pomt-02526	"Six of Georgia’s counties have no lawyers at all."	true	/georgia/statements/2014/feb/10/hugh-thompson/access-legal-help-issue-justice-says/	In his first State of the Judiciary address, Chief Justice Hugh P. Thompson declared that all Georgians need access to justice, regardless of their economic backgrounds. And in many cases, he said, that means they need the services of a lawyer. Yet in Georgia, Thompson said, that's not as easy as it might seem. He cited statistics showing: 70 percent of Georgia's lawyers work in five metro Atlanta counties. 62 of Georgia's 159 counties have 10 or fewer lawyers. six counties are lawyerless. Too few lawyers? What about the so-called "lawyer glut?" In the interest of truth (and justice), we decided to do some checking. Jane Hansen, spokeswoman for the Georgia Supreme Court, said the chief justice's comments were based, in part, on a report by the State Bar of Georgia titled "Lawyer Distribution in Georgia." The report showed the state with 28,883 active lawyers in 2011, including 20,027 or 69.3 percent, working in Clayton, Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties in metro Atlanta. The State Bar research revealed that there are no lawyers in six rural counties - Baker, Chattahoochee, Clay, Echols, Glasscock and Webster. In three of those counties, Baker, Clay and Echols, at least 30 percent of residents live in poverty, according to U.S. Census data. Follow-up research in August 2013 showed the number of lawyers in the state had grown to 29,973. But none of them had established a practice in those six lawyerless counties, said Michael L. Monahan, an attorney and pro bono director for the State Bar. The findings came directly from the State Bar’s membership data, Monahan said. In Georgia, membership in the State Bar is mandatory for all lawyers. In his address to a joint session of the state Senate and House of Representatives, Thompson recalled the promise of "liberty and justice for all" in the Pledge of Allegiance. "I don’t believe we ever meant ‘liberty and justice only for those who can afford it,’ " he said. "... As Georgia continues to grow in population and diversity, access to justice is a challenge requiring the commitment and hard work of us all." Thompson told lawmakers that many attorneys and two groups -- the Atlanta Volunteer Lawyers Foundation and the State Bar of Georgia -- have stepped up to offer their services at no cost to the poor. "But these voluntary efforts do not fill the gap," he said. Thompson cited a report from the Supreme Court’s Committee on Civil Justice in 2008 that showed only 9 percent of low-income Georgians with a legal need were able to get help from a lawyer. He also pointed out that two nonprofit law firms, the Georgia Legal Services Program and the Atlanta Legal Aid Society, provide civil legal services to the poor. But both firms have been hard hit financially since the start of the recession in 2007, Thompson said. Phyllis Holmen, the executive director of Georgia Legal Services, said her budget is back up slightly this year but had been cut $2 million since 2008. That meant that the agency had to freeze positions and lay off staff, including 23 of the 75 lawyers who work in 154 counties, Holmen said. Judges, Thompson said, have been reporting that more people are coming into court trying to represent themselves. That creates fairness issues, particularly in family law cases where the opposing party has an attorney, Holmen said. Monahan said the State Bar is looking to address a difficult problem. "The fix is not going to be easy," he said. "The market decides where people work." Thompson said other states are also experiencing a void of lawyers outside their major cities. In South Dakota, where 65 percent of attorneys practice in five cities, the chief justice has warned that the large populated areas of his state are becoming "islands of justice in a rural sea of justice denied," Thompson said. "Georgia’s lack of legal services in rural areas is every bit as severe as South Dakota’s, if not more so," he told lawmakers. "We must take steps to correct the imbalance." So where does this leave us? Thompson said, "Six of Georgia’s counties have no lawyers at all." Credible data from the State Bar of Georgia and other information, including anecdotal evidence from local judges, support his statement. We rate it True.

pomt-13110	"FBI confirms evidence of huge underground Clinton sex network."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/04/conservative-daily-post/evidence-ridiculously-thin-sensational-claim-huge-/	The presidential race has tightened again, this time after the FBI revealed that Hillary Clinton emails might be found on the laptop of Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Now some conservative websites are claiming — without offering any evidence — that the probe has uncovered evidence of a pedophile sex ring run under the guise of the Clinton Foundation. "Breaking: FBI confirms evidence of huge underground Clinton sex network," the Conservative Daily Post said on Nov. 1. "A source from the FBI has indicated ... that a massive child trafficking and pedophile sex ring operates in Washington, D.C.," the website reports, saying "there are at least six members of Congress and several leaders from federal agencies that partake in the pedophile ring, which they say was run directly with the Clinton Foundation as a front." No sources are named. No documents are cited. The claim about a child trafficking and a pedophile sex ring links to a New York Post story that makes no reference to either child trafficking or a sex ring. The claim about the Clinton Foundation and members of Congress links to an internet message board where anonymous people have posted under the topic, "Breaking: Its (sic) worse than classified emails. Political Pedophile Sex Ring exposed." "Hillary, Bill, all of them knew/know and were active participants," says the poster, who has the nickname "WartHog76." "DC and the FBI, DOJ fear a complete loss of public support for the federal government. ... Both parties, all levels of government. Its (sic) about to come apart." Subsequent posts by other people range from speculation that the story is part of a Clinton strategy ("Throw out some wild claims, have them proven false, and their real crimes will be dismissed as false") to a link to another website claiming that Bill Clinton and Donald Trump are connected to a place called Sex Slave Island. The latter pertain to the real-life story of financier Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire sentenced to 18 months in jail and ordered to register as a pedophile in 2008 after pleading guilty to a Florida felony charge of soliciting a minor. He had been accused of hiring underage girls for massages and sex at Epstein’s Palm Beach mansion. Clinton has repeatedly flown on his plane. Trump's phone numbers were found in Epstein's address book. The Conservative Daily Post article doesn't mention Trump's connections to Epstein. We contacted the FBI. Spokesman Andrew Ames said in an email, "We have provided no comment, nor confirmed any investigation, beyond the existence of a letter from the Director to select members of Congress, which was then provided to the media by members of Congress." Another commentator on the message board says, "NYPD has verified it. It's not a false claim." An NYPD spokesman said he was unaware of anyone make such a statement. Our ruling The Conservative Daily Post says, "FBI confirms evidence of huge underground Clinton sex network." We could find no evidence that such a network exists; there is definitely no evidence that the FBI has confirmed it. The blog post seems to be relying on an anonymous claim put up on an internet message board. Here at PolitiFact, we believe it's up to the entity making a claim to support it with real evidence, especially when a claim is as extraordinary as this one. For now, the Post story fails to rise above rumor or hoax. Without anything real to go on, the website is blowing smoke. And in this case, where there's smoke, there's Pants on Fire!

pomt-14758	"I have always opposed driver's licenses for illegal aliens."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/dec/11/david-simpson/david-simpson-mostly-right-about-his-staunch-oppos/	Republican candidates for an East Texas state Senate seat disagree over whether one of them has endorsed, and voted for, permitting driver’s licenses for Texas residents lacking legal permission to live in the country. State Rep. David Simpson of Longview emailed reporters a Nov. 30, 2015, statement saying Rep. Bryan Hughes of Mineola had slanderously charged Simpson with supporting licenses for illegal immigrants without delivering the factual goods. Simpson further declared: "I have always opposed driver’s licenses for illegal aliens." We wondered. Some perspective: The Texas Department of Public Safety began requiring license applicants to produce government-issued documents affirming their legal residency status in 2008, and lawmakers voted to require as much in a 2011 special session. Before 2008, according to a July 2011 Texas Tribune news story, no proof of legal residency was required to obtain a Texas license or state identification card. The spat between Hughes and Simpson developed, we suspect, because Republicans who show weakness on illegal immigration can run into trouble, especially in a party primary. The two are both angling to succeed Kevin Eltife, R-Tyler, representing the Senate’s District 1. We can’t gauge how someone has always felt about an issue. So we limited our scope to signs of Simpson publicly opposing licenses for such immigrants--finding that while there’s room for contrary speculation, a little of it caused by his own ambiguous statement, Simpson was among the vast bulk of House members who voted for the 2011 Legislature’s mandate to the DPS, arguably a sign he wasn’t intent on ensuring that all residents access licenses. News stories Let’s start with what Simpson has said in public settings. Hughes’ campaign pointed out a July 21, 2014, Tyler Morning Telegraph news story quoting Simpson after he returned from a weeklong tour of the Rio Grande Valley. "We do have a problem with drugs and warlords taking advantage of the situation," Simpson said. "We have to require a fulfillment of promises to appear before immigration courts to enter schools. We need to determine the status of these immigrants and not put them in this limbo. They can get an education but not get a driver’s license. That’s not right." What wasn’t right in Simpson’s view wasn’t entirely clarified. The story further quoted him saying: "We do need to secure the border against crime and terror, in order to defend life, liberty and property. I welcome people to come. We need workers. We do need to limit our health care to emergencies and critical care to immigrants as well as citizens. What’s going on in emergency rooms is not right. We need to stop the freebies, and open the legal pipeline while continuing to secure the border." To our inquiry about Simpson’s consistency, Luke Macias, a consultant to Simpson’s campaign, guided us to Simpson’s 2014 98-slide presentation based on the legislator’s border trip, which included photos of his travels and thoughts about border and immigration policy. Macias urged us to note the slide indicating Simpson thinks Texas should "overturn the mandate to educate aliens who have entered the country illegally or who are still residents of Mexico." A 1982 U.S. Supreme Court decision, in Plyler v. Doe, required Texas not to deny public education to "undocumented school-age children." Another Simpson slide, titled "Dysfunctional Policies," including this license line: "We provide K-12 education, but students cannot receive a driver’s license:" SOURCE: Presentation, "A Sobering and Beautiful Week on the Rio Grande," David Simpson, June 30-July 6, 2014 (web link received by email from Luke Macias, general consultant, David Simpson Texas Senate campaign, Dec. 1, 2015) What gives? By phone, Simpson told us he was trying to stress his continuing belief in not giving "handouts and privileges" to immigrants living here without permission; those include driver’s licenses, he said. By email, Simpson noted accurately that while his presentation called for some changes--such as ending the public schooling of children in the country illegally--it "did not advocate for giving driver’s licenses to illegals." Our searches via the Nexis news database and through news stories published by the Longview News-Journal yielded no examples of Simpson previously offering an opinion on driver’s licenses for immigrants. Simpson’s legislative record Next, we took up Simpson’s legislative record. In summer 2011, lawmakers moved to require the DPS to seek proof of legal residency from applicants for driver’s licenses by placing an amendment on a fiscal matters measure. At the time, the move was pitched as bringing Texas into compliance with the federal REAL ID Act, which says applicants for a driver's license must prove legal residency if they want to use the identification to get through airport security. See the agency's explanation here. And on June 9, 2011, nearly all House members (including Simpson) approved the amendment to Senate Bill 1. House video reveals no debate of the matter after Rep. Charles Geren, R-Fort Worth, told colleagues the amendment "addresses an issue of people getting Texas driver’s licenses that don’t live in Texas and it also allows the department to issue a license only for the length of time that a person is entitled to be here." According to the House Journal, eight members, Simpson not among them, asked to be recorded voting against the amendment. Records show too that Simpson voted against the overall fiscal matters proposal several times; the votes occurred on June 9, June 10 and June 28, 2011. By email, Simpsons told us he opposed the measure "due to its accounting gimmicks—namely, the deferment of Foundation School Program payments and the speed-up of tax payments—and its misplaced priorities, not because of the license provision, which I supported." He provided a copy of a May 2012 letter to constituents stating that he "voted for the amendment to add documentation requirements for driver's licenses" but against SB 1 because it extended inequitable school funding, sped tax collections and used "smoke and mirrors" to balance the state budget. So, Simpson backed the mandate that DPS check on each applicant’s legal residency. Two years later, though, Simpson cast a vote at least leaving room for speculation about his consistency on this front. That year, he voted against successful House efforts effectively killing proposals that related to more residents possibly getting driving permits. We know of no independent way of telling if those votes signaled a position on driver’s licenses. But on May 20, 2013, Simpson voted in favor of one of the failed amendments, the Texas House Journal shows. The amendment to Senate Bill 1729 by Rep. Byron Cook, R-Corsicana, said that under the legislation, which otherwise authorized a pilot project enabling a few counties to update or renew driver’s licenses, a license should include "any Texas resident driver’s permit authorized by law." And what did that mean? In debate, opponents said Cook’s language related to unauthorized residents getting a driver’s permit. Similarly, Simpson and Hughes’ campaign each nudged, conservative advocacy groups characterized the amendment as opening driver’s licenses to ineligible individuals. In a scorecard of the 2013 Legislature, for instance, the Young Conservatives of Texas said Cook’s amendment "would have allowed for illegal immigrants to receive driver’s licenses." We didn’t reach that conclusion--and by email, Simpson told us Cook’s amendment "in no way authorized illegal aliens to receive driver’s licenses." Asked why he voted for it, Simpson said: "I voted yes to the amendment because it would only include licenses or permits already" authorized by law. In debate, Cook didn’t dispute that his proposal might legalize more drivers; he also stressed that another change in law would be needed for the envisioned permits to become a reality. Cook’s proposal drew 72 votes, with 67 members voting no, but it died because Cook offered the proposal during final consideration of SB 1729; at that stage, 100 House votes were needed to amend legislation. A few days earlier, on May 17, 2013, Cook rolled out a longer amendment to SB 1729. He described the proposal--which was shortly derailed on a parliamentary point of order without members (including Simpson) voting on it--as identical to a committee-approved version of House Bill 3206 by Rep. Roberto Alonzo, D-Dallas. Alonzo’s amended plan called for state-issued driving permits for residents who lack proof of legal residency, also requiring recipients to obtain auto insurance. Under the proposal, every applicant would have to submit to fingerprinting and clear a criminal background check before qualifying for a permit. The same month, Hughes’ campaign noted, Simpson was on the losing end of an 87-60 House vote setting aside Alonzo’s amendment to a House measure that authorized the state to let public schools and driving schools give the driving test required to get a license. Before that May 21, 2013, action, Alonzo told House colleagues that under his amendment, schools could give driving tests to individuals who obtained resident driving permits, provided such permits were legalized. "Texas has a problem," Alonzo said, with people driving without auto insurance or a driver’s permit. By phone, Alonzo told us he favors giving undocumented individuals an opportunity to legally drive in Texas and his 2013 proposal’s described permits could have nudged the state toward fulfilling the goal though, he said, it didn’t provide for full-fledged licenses. Finally, we spotted no evidence of Simpson trying to legislate about driver’s licenses. In the 2011 session, Simpson authored or co-authored about 50 measures, none touching on giving or denying licenses. In the 2013 and 2015 sessions, Simpson authored or co-authored nearly 150 measures, none of them affecting driver’s licenses. Our ruling Simpson said he’s always been opposed to illegal immigrants having driver’s licenses In 2011, Simpson joined House members in voting for the change in law requiring license applicants to document their legal residency, which we take as a strong indication of his position. But there’s a hint of uncertainty in Simpson’s 2013 vote on a proposal offered in favor of unauthorized residents someday getting resident driver permits as sought by Alonzo and others, which importantly didn’t and don’t exist, and his ambiguous 2014 remark about driver’s licenses.

pomt-02753	"Every major city which has a center of poverty is run by Democrats. Every major city."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/15/newt-gingrich/new-gingrich-says-poverty-problems-are-tied-democr/	A New York Times investigation detailing the plight of more than 22,000 homeless children in New York City prompted a fierce discussion about poverty in the United States on ABC’s This Week -- and specifically who’s to blame. Robert Reich, a Democrat and former Labor Department secretary, said Republicans shoulder responsibility for blocking legislation supported by Democrats and President Barack Obama. "Baloney," responded former House Speaker Newt Gingrich. "Every major city which has a center of poverty is run by Democrats," Gingrich said. "Every major city." We can’t easily assess whether Democrats or Republicans are to blame for poverty in U.S. cities, but we can analyze the basic statistics to see if Gingrich's point was correct. (Gingrich did not respond to us.) To measure the accuracy of Gingrich’s comment, we isolated the largest 50 U.S. cities using 2012 U.S. Census Bureau data. We then calculated the percentage of people in each city who are living below the federal poverty line, thanks to this Governing magazine report that relied on Census Bureau data. From there, we created a list of the 20 biggest U.S. cities with the largest percentage of people living below the federal poverty level (about $11,500 for one person). And finally, we researched the political party of the mayor in each city. Comparing poverty rates and political affiliation in large U.S. cities City % of people below poverty level Mayor Political party Detroit, MI 42.3 David Bing Democrat Cleveland, OH 36.1 Frank Jackson Democrat Miami, FL 31.7 Tomás Regalado Republican Fresno, CA 31.5 Ashley Swearengin Republican Milwaukee, WI 29.9 Tom Barrett Democrat Memphis, TN 28.3 A C Wharton Democrat Philadelphia, PA 26.9 Michael Nutter Democrat Tucson, AZ 26.7 Jonathan Rothschild Democrat Atlanta, GA 25.8 Kasim Reed Democrat Baltimore, MD 24.8 Stephanie Rawlings-Blake Democrat Phoenix, AZ 24.1 Greg Stanton Democrat Chicago, IL 23.9 Rahm Emanuel Democrat Dallas, TX 23.9 Mike Rawlings Democrat Houston, TX 23.5 Annise Parker Democrat Sacramento, CA 23.4 Kevin Johnson Democrat Los Angeles, CA 23.3 Eric Garcetti Democrat Long Beach, CA 22.9 Bob Foster Democrat El Paso, TX 22.8 Oscar Leeser Democrat Minneapolis, MN 22.7 R.T. Rybak Democrat Indianapolis, IN 22.2 Gregory Ballard Republican As you can see, out of the top 5 poorest major cities, two are led by Republicans -- Miami and Fresno, Calif. When we expand that to the top 20, we find three Republican mayors. For the record, New York -- which prompted the discussion -- ranked 25th out of the top 50 cities. Current New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has served as both a Republican and an independent. University of Michigan population studies professor Sheldon Danziger suggested analyzing state poverty levels and matching those with governors’ political ties would be more accurate than honing in on cities. Like we said at the outset, we’re staying away from drawing conclusions about poverty in U.S. cities and the political affiliation of their elected leader. We’re simply analyzing the statistics behind Gingrich’s comment. Our ruling Gingrich emphasized that every major, poor U.S. city is run by Democrats. We found two cities in the top 5 poorest, and three in the top 20, that have Republicans at the helm. Yes, most cities on the list are led by Democrats, but Gingrich said "every." As such, we rate his statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4cfba731-6fa6-4ffe-8c24-c2fc2ae43b57	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2013-12-15T16:33:30	2013-12-15	['None']
pomt-07450	General Electric "hasn't really created any jobs in this country, doesn't pay any taxes, and they're making historic profits."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/apr/20/marcy-kaptur/rep-marcy-kaptur-says-ge-pays-no-taxes-and-creates/	Certain companies make natural targets for people who believe that multinational conglomerates game the United States tax system while the proverbial little guy can’t catch a break That’s why Rep. Marcy Kaptur brought up the names of certain companies while explaining her demand for fairness as Congress debated spending cuts. "I’m willing to support a package that is balanced," Kaptur, a Toledo Democrat, said during an April 6 interview on "On Point," a public radio show, when host Tom Ashbrook, asked what level of federal spending cuts and policy compromises she’d accept. Pointing to what she thinks is an imbalance, she cited the case of General Electric, "which hasn't really created any jobs in this country, doesn't pay any taxes and they're making historic profits." Her comments stood out because General Electric’s federal income taxes have been a matter of dispute. Did the Connecticut-based company, with $14.2 billion in earnings, avoid paying any U.S. corporate income taxes for 2010? A New York Times examination March 24 said so, noting in detail the tax-avoidance lengths -- all legal -- to which the company goes. Kaptur’s communications director, Steve Fought, says that Kaptur was referring to that article when making her comment. Yet that article has come under attack, and not just from GE. Another investigation, by the nonprofit journalism organization ProPublica and co-published with Fortune magazine, says the Times went too far. Due to various deductions, credits and an ace tax accounting team, GE got a $3.2 billion "tax benefit," both investigations found. But "tax benefit" is a financial term that is not the same as a tax refund or negative tax balance. So does GE "not pay any taxes," as Kaptur said? GE pays other kinds of taxes. But we believe that those following this issue -- especially public radio listeners -- knew that Kaptur meant income taxes. She was using a kind of shorthand that’s well known in public policy circles when discussing corporations’ avoidance and the way some shelter profits overseas. What is not disputed is that heavy losses from its financial unit, GE Capital, played a big role in helping GE avoid all U.S. income taxes for calendar year 2009. Forbes reported on this this last year and GE told us in an e-mail that "the total company lost money on its U.S. operations" in 2009. But Forbes suggests the Times was wrong about GE’s taxes for 2010. The Columbia Journalism Review sides with the Times, however. And Henry Blodget, a financial blogger and analyst who runs Business Insider, concludes that "GE is still trying to find a way, any way, to talk its way out of this." Our own discussions by phone and e-mail with GE spokeswoman Anne Eisele may illustrate why this is so hard to pin down. Eisele said in an e-mail: "We will file our 2010 tax returns by September. We expect to have a small, positive U.S. federal income tax liability." The figures reported elsewhere are based on pre-payments and projections. But that’s not quite the same as what GE said in a recent web statement: "GE paid significant U.S. income tax in 2010 and in total from 2006-2010." And AFP, an international wire service, reported that when it inquired about the dispute, Eisele replied in an e-mail saying, "GE did not pay U.S. federal taxes last year because we did not owe any." Confused? Add to that confusion something Eisele told us: "In 2010, GE paid significant federal income taxes for prior years." Presumably, that would mean GE paid taxes during 2010, but not for the 2010 tax year -- and presumably not for 2009 because GE reported that it lost money on U.S. operations that year. GE is not legally obligated to say what it actually paid or didn’t. You could put GE’s statements together like a jigsaw puzzle and the pieces seem to fit, but the statements are nuanced, qualified and at times legalistic. Given all this, we are going to hold this part of Kaptur’s claim in reserve. We’ll come back to it if the picture gets clearer. But what about Kaptur’s claim that GE "hasn’t really created any jobs in this country?" We turned to what we thought would be a reliable measure: GE’s annual 10-K filing, a self-reported, audited examination of its performance that it turns in to the Securities and Exchange Commission. We also looked at some of its annual reports to investors. In 2010, GE had 133,000 employees in the United States. In 2004, it had 165,000. The declines occurred every year, totaling 32,000 jobs lost in six years. If you went back even further you’d see more domestic job shedding. Meantime, the company’s foreign employment has shot upward. In 1996, GE had 84,000 workers in foreign countries. The number reached 172,000 by 2007 before dipping to 154,000 in 2010. GE itself has said it: There were growth opportunities abroad. Thousands of these job losses were the result of layoffs. Eisele attributed about 4,000 of them to the financial crisis and its effect on GE Capital. But she also said that since the beginning of 2009, "GE has announced plans to create nearly 7,000 new U.S. manufacturing jobs through 2013." She provided us with a list of those announcements, which listed 6,465 new jobs with GE plus others in support of a GE-related smart energy project. Furthermore, "GE's three largest industrial businesses (Energy, Aviation, and Healthcare) grew U.S. jobs 31% over the decade," Eisele said. But, even with these upcoming gains, GE will not employ as many people in the United States as it did in 2008. The expansion would create a blip, not a total comeback. Yet there is more to consider, Eisele said. About 33,000 jobs since 2004 are no longer on GE’s books because their divisions were sold or spun off, she said. "Those jobs weren't cut; they moved to other companies," she said. Add those 33,000 people back into the equation and the number of workers rises to 166,000. This math works in GE’s favor, because in 2001, GE reported 158,000 workers in the United States, and 165,000 in 2002. It gives credence to a GE assertion -- that if you factored in the dispositions, "GE's U.S. employment has increased from 2001 to 2010." But wait: It you decided to compare 2000 with 2010 -- going back just a year further -- a funny thing happens: GE winds up showing a loss again, even if you add those dispositions back in. We wanted a more precise accounting of job spin-offs by year so we could do a more exacting comparison, but Eisele said she did not have "that level of granularity" available. So how do we gauge Kaptur’s claim that General Electric "hasn’t really created any jobs in this country?" Using GE’s own filings to shareholders, Kaptur is correct. Backing out some of those losses because employees simply moved from GE’s books to successor companies’, the answer is: GE has mostly held steady since 2001 -- but not since 2000 or 1999. Getting precision beyond GE’s SEC filings requires, well, granularity. Kaptur made one more claim about GE -- that "they’re making historic profits." That’s false. GE reported $14.2 billion in continuing operations before taxes in 2010. But it was significantly higher in 2008, at $19.8 billion, and it was $27.52 billion in 2007. So, on the first part of Kaptur’s claim, the jury is still out. On the second part, GE’s self-reported numbers back her up. GE provided rough numbers that could point to a different conclusion, but it depends on the years selected. Short of much better detail -- if the company wants to go granular, we are here awaiting -- we go with the precise numbers the company reported to the SEC. But Kaptur is wrong on the third part of her claim. While $14.2 billion is a lot of money, it set no GE record.

pomt-08873	"This is the first time since the Depression that unemployment has stayed above 9 percent for two consecutive years."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/03/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-unemployment-has-exceeded-9-perc/	On the Aug. 1, 2010, edition of Fox News Sunday, House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, tried to crystallize how bad the current job picture is. "This is the first time since the depression that unemployment has stayed above 9 percent for two consecutive years," Boehner told host Chris Wallace. We decided to check whether Boehner was right. We looked at the numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal agency responsible for calculating the national unemployment rate. It showed that unemployment has been 9 percent or higher for 14 months running, from May 2009 to June 2010. That's well short of the two years Boehner suggested. And before the downturn, it never got close to being as bad as Boehner claims. BLS' searchable figures go back to 1948, so we looked through the full data to find historical comparisons. Since 1948, there have only been two periods prior to the current stretch when unemployment exceeded 9 percent. There was a one-month blip in May 1975, and then a 19-month period between March 1982 and September 1983 when unemployment never dipped below 9 percent. Pre-1948 data is not as comprehensive, but a BLS study shows that things were far, far worse during the Great Depression. The estimated annual unemployment rates stayed above 9 percent for more than a decade -- from 1931 to 1941. Between 1932 and 1935, the unemployment rate exceeded 20 percent in each year. We considered the possibility that Boehner might have simply misspoken, intending to say that unemployment had exceeded 8 percent for two consecutive years. But that isn't correct either. If you go back a full two years, the unemployment rate in July 2008 was 5.8 percent. From today's vantage point, that seems like a whole lifetime ago. So any way you look at it, Boehner's statistic was wrong. We rate his statement False.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2010-08-03T12:28:01	2010-08-01	['None']

pomt-14839	"Forty-five states allow open carry of firearms."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/nov/18/marion-hammer/there-are-45-states-allow-open-carry-handguns-form/	The former president of the National Rifle Association is defending bills in the Florida Legislature proposing the open carry of handguns, saying the vast majority of states already allow the practice. Marion Hammer, currently executive director of United Sportsmen of Florida, responded to criticism of SB 300 and its companion in the House, HB 163. In a column posted on the NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action website on Nov. 1, 2015, Hammer pointed out how many states allow open carry. "Forty-five (45) states allow open carry of firearms," she wrote. "Varying restrictions on open carry in some states does not alter the fact that 45 states allow open carry." Hammer was refuting Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri, who is the Florida Sheriffs Association Legislative Committee chairman. Gualtieri, whose group opposes the bills, previously told the Palm Beach Post it’s not really accurate to say those 45 states allow open carry because there are various rules and restrictions on the practice. PolitiFact Florida decided to get to the bottom of just how many states do let you carry guns openly in public. Laws across states The bills filed in the state Legislature would allow anyone with a valid concealed weapons permit to also carry their handgun openly, a practice currently prohibited by law. Obtaining a license for concealed carry already includes requirements for registration, fingerprinting and firearm training. Florida has about 1.4 million concealed weapon permit holders. Both bills are pending approval by committees before the 2016 legislative session. Hammer told PolitiFact Florida that her figure came from the NRA’s own research of state laws. According to that analysis, there are four other states that prohibit handgun open carry in public places like Florida — California, Illinois, New York and South Carolina. The District of Columbia does not allow it, either. Hammer is equating the lack of an outright ban in other states with the other 45 states allowing the practice, but it isn’t quite that cut and dried. There are different rules and restrictions in different places, and some so-called open carry states can be very specific about what’s required. The Florida bills address the open carry of handguns, so that's the context of Hammer's column. There are other states that allow the open carry of handguns while restricting long guns, such as rifles and shotguns. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence agrees with the NRA on the same five states that prohibit open carry. But the center points out that Massachusetts, Minnesota and New Jersey prohibit the open carry of long guns, just as Florida, California, Illinois and D.C. do. But New York and South Carolina allow open carry for long guns, while preventing it for handguns. So Hammer’s statement that 45 states allow the open carry of firearms, period, is imprecise. Further, 15 states require a permit or license to open carry, while eight more have other restrictions on how, when or where you are allowed to do so. Some municipalities restrict open carry in ways their state doesn’t. In Pennsylvania, open carry is generally allowed without a license, but Philadelphia does require a license. There are even more caveats about specific states and where they land on the open carry spectrum. For example, gun rights group OpenCarry.org doesn’t include Texas on its list of open carry states, because its recently passed law doesn’t take effect until Jan. 1, 2016. Like Florida’s proposed change, the state’s concealed carry license will become an open carry license for handguns as well. There are also states that could be categorized differently depending on how you interpret the local laws. The NRA’s Institute for Legislative Action noted Arkansas is hard to categorize. The state decriminalized the open or concealed carry of a loaded handgun in 2013, but the state’s ban was not repealed. Attorney General Leslie Rutledge said in a nonbinding opinion that the law was intended to protect people traveling through or across the state, even though open carry was still technically against the law. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence notes you generally can’t carry openly or concealed in Arkansas with the gun "readily available for use with a purpose to employ (it) as a weapon against a person." All the groups we consulted agreed California is not an open-carry state because it banned open carry of loaded handguns starting in 2012, but there’s still more to the story. If you live in a California county with less than 200,000 people, you can ask the local sheriff or police chief to give you an open-carry license at his or her discretion. Of course, the license is only good for that county, but there’s wiggle room in saying California prohibits open carry. Our ruling Hammer said, "Forty-five states allow open carry of firearms." Groups both for and against stricter gun laws told us there are five states that have laws banning open carry for handguns: California, Florida, Illinois, New York and South Carolina. It’s worth remembering, however, that the laws in some open-carry states are not as permissive as Hammer makes it seem. Several states have restrictions on the open carry of certain types of firearms, and in some places the rules are stricter than others. We rate Hammer’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-05506	The "Buffett rule" "raises virtually no money, maybe a day and a half of our borrowing per year."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/apr/15/barry-hinckley/republican-senate-candidate-barry-hinckley-says-bu/	When Mitt Romney was in Rhode Island last week as part of his campaign for the Republican presidential nomination, GOP Senate candidate Benjamin "Barry" Hinckley III asked him a question about the Obama administration’s effort to raise taxes on the wealthy. Hinckley -- who is challenging Democratic U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, the lead sponsor of the so-called "Buffet Rule" legislation -- asked how Romney would respond to the tax plan. As part of his introduction to the question, Hinckley dismissed the bill as part of the "politics of envy" and described it as "a plan that is so obviously political because it raises virtually no money, maybe a day and a half of our borrowing per year." The bill, which is officially known as the Paying a Fair Share Act, would increase the income tax rate on those who earn more than $1 million annually to 30 percent. It was inspired by billionaire investor Warren Buffett, who has said it is unfair that he is able to use tax loopholes to pay a lower effective rate than his secretary. The Senate is set to vote on the bill Monday. Other opponents of the legislation have questioned how much money it would actually raise and whether it would make a dent in the national debt. But does the amount really correspond to just "a day and a half" of what the United States borrows annually? Hinckley’s statement relies on two numbers -- how much the nation borrows on a daily basis and how much the Buffet rule would raise per year. While we waited to hear back from Hinckley’s campaign, we started researching the issue, starting with what the federal government borrows to cover the national debt, a subject we have explored before. PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact Georgia also have all written pieces on the national debt and what it works out to per day. We’ll use the same rationale as those items from 2011 but update the numbers. The national debt is the total amount of money owed by the federal government to creditors who have loaned the government money. That debt has grown by an average of $4.2 billion per day since January 2009. The rate has slowed down more recently. Since January 2012, the average daily increase has been about $3.9 billion. The total debt stood at $15.6 trillion as of April 11, according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. As Politifact Florida made clear, the government does not borrow money every day to stay afloat. Rather, it does so by periodically auctioning bonds. But the logic of calculating the borrowing per day is reasonable. For our purposes, we’ll use a rate of borrowing of $3.9 billion per day. The second part of Hinckley’s statement -- how much the Buffett rule would raise -- is based on a projection from Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation, according to Whitehouse spokesman Seth Larson. The committee estimated that increasing the tax rate paid by the wealthiest Americans would raise $47 billion over 10 years, or $4.7 billion a year. But that estimate is based on a comparison to the "current law baseline," which assumes the full expiration of the Bush tax cuts. If the Bush tax cuts are extended -- a distinct possibility with a Republican-controlled House -- then the Buffet rule would raise $160 billion over 10 years, or $16 billion a year. Both are valid estimates. "They’re two separate projections based on two different scenarios," said Larson. A spokesman for Hinckley said that the candidate used the $4.7 billion figure and a range of estimates for borrowing that, at the high end, is nearly identical to our number. So if we divide $4.7 billion by $3.9 billion, we get 1.2, or the equivalent of 1 day and about 5 hours. That’s actually less than a day and a half. If we use the $16 billion figure, we calculated the Buffet rule would raise the equivalent of about four days of the nation’s borrowing. Our ruling Senate candidate Barry Hinckley says the Buffett rule would annually raise only "a day and a half" of what the federal government borrows every year. Our calculations yield a number closer to a day and a quarter, which would actually bolster Hinckley’s point that the tax plan raises "virtually no money." In relative terms, he may have a point, but $4.7 billion is not a small amount of money. (Rhode Island’s total budget is $7.7 billion.) Moreover, by another estimate, increasing taxes on the wealthy could raise $16 billion a year, or the equivalent of four days of the nation’s borrowing. Because of that issue and others related to calculating the national debt per day, Hinckley’s is not a perfect comparison. Because the statement needs clarification, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-03436	Says abortion increases the risk of breast cancer.	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2013/jun/24/ron-hood/state-rep-ron-hood-links-abortion-and-breast-cance/	A group of Ohio House Republicans has introduced legislation aimed at reducing abortions through an extensive list of restrictions and requirements. Rep. Ron Hood, R-Ashville, the sponsor of the legislation, House Bill 200, said he drafted it based on talks with the National Pro-Life Alliance. He said it was intended to make women more aware of what they are doing to "make an informed choice." Among its provisions, the bill would require abortion providers to tell patients about "the increased risk of breast cancer" from abortion. PolitiFact Ohio wanted to know more about that warning. We called to ask Hood for the source. His legislative aide referred us to the website of the Coalition on Abortion/Breast Cancer, an advocacy group that asserts there has been a "cover-up" of a link between abortion and breast cancer. A review of the website shows that the group's case for a link is supported largely by the work of Dr. Joel Brind, a member of the group's advisory board, who is a professor of biochemistry at Baruch College in New York City and is recognized as the leading proponent of an abortion-breast cancer link; and Dr. Angela Lanfranchi, a breast cancer surgeon in New Jersey who, with Brind, co-founded the Breast Cancer Prevention Institute to help publicize what is sometimes called the ABC (for abortion-breast cancer) link. A review of the history shows their work is a significant part of what has been called "abortion politics." Research on a possible connection had been going on for decades when Brind published an analysis in the 1990s that suggested a link between induced abortion (the deliberate ending of a pregnancy) and an increased risk of breast cancer. But the analysis was based on studies that relied on survey interviews of women, which were widely questioned because of factors including "response bias" -- the inaccurate self-reporting of medical history information by participants. Subsequent studies using larger groups and data not subject to bias found no link, according to sources including the National Cancer Institute. In 2003, largely because of political questions raised over the "ABC link," the NCI convened a three-day conference of experts on abortion and cancer. Based on a review of population-based, clinical and animal studies, they concluded that having an abortion or miscarriage does not increase a woman’s subsequent risk of developing breast cancer. Hood also pointed specifically to a 2009 paper by Lanfranchi about the mechanisms of cancer. It asserted that a prematurely ended pregnancy leaves a woman with more cancer-susceptible breast tissue than when the pregnancy began. Also in 2009, however, the Committee on Gynecologic Practice of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists concluded that "more rigorous recent studies demonstrate no causal relationship between induced abortion and a subsequent increase in breast cancer risk." PolitiFact does not do medical or scientific analysis. We rely, as we do in other areas, on the most reliable and independent sources available. The World Health Organization says that abortion does not increase the risk of breast cancer. Britain’s Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists says that abortion does not increase the risk of breast cancer. The American Cancer Society says: "scientific research studies have not found a cause-and-effect relationship between abortion and breast cancer." The Susan. G. Komen Foundation says there is no link. The National Cancer Institute gives its highest strength-of-evidence ratings to the statements that: Induced abortion is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk. Recognized spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) is not associated with an increase in breast cancer risk. Women who have had an induced abortion have the same risk of breast cancer as other women. Women who have had a spontaneous abortion (miscarriage) have the same risk of breast cancer as other women. Cancers other than breast cancer also appear to be unrelated to a history of induced or spontaneous abortion. The credible research overwhelmingly contradicts the statement in Hood’s legislation. It’s a ridiculous claim, and even more ridiculous to force doctors to spread this misinformation to patients. Pants on Fire!	None	Ron Hood	None	None	None	2013-06-24T06:00:00	2013-06-12	['None']
pomt-14797	"The Family Research Council, according to some government agencies, is a terrorist group."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/01/ben-carson/ben-carson-incorrect-government-agency-considers-f/	Over the long Thanksgiving weekend, the top news story was the incident in which a gunman killed three people and shot nine others at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colo. During a Nov. 29 interview, CNN host Brianna Keilar asked Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson about the incident. "Planned Parenthood is calling this now an act of domestic terrorism," Keilar said. "Do you agree with that assessment?" Responding by satellite link from Jordan, where he had gone to visit Syrian refugee camps, Carson said, "It certainly is an act of extreme hatred and violence. You know, the Family Research Council, according to some government agencies, is a terrorist group. You know, so let's get away from the rhetoric and talk about the real problem." A reader asked us to check whether it’s true that government agencies had labeled the Family Research Council a terrorist group. So we took a closer look. The council would seem like an odd group to be labeled "terrorist." A prominent think tank for social conservatives, the council hardly lives in the shadows. Its experts appear regularly on television, it has a prominent headquarters building in downtown Washington, and its legislative affiliate sponsors a high-profile annual political conference called the Value Voters Summit that attracts a variety of top politicians, including such Republican presidential contenders as … Ben Carson. We didn’t find that any government agencies have labeled the council as a terrorist group. But the council has sparked condemnation from a high-profile civil rights group, and it seems possible that might be what Carson was thinking of. (Neither Carson’s staff nor the Family Research Council responded to inquiries for this story.) The Southern Poverty Law Center -- a nonprofit based in Montgomery, Ala., that monitors "domestic hate groups and other extremists, including the Ku Klux Klan, the neo-Nazi movement, neo-Confederates, racist skinheads, black separatists, anti-government militias, Christian Identity adherents and others" -- has labeled the Family Research Council an "extremist group." Specifically, the Southern Poverty Law Center writes on its website that the Family Research Council’s "specialty is defaming gays and lesbians. The FRC often makes false claims about the LGBT community based on discredited research and junk science. The intention is to denigrate LGBT people" in various public-policy battles. The center separately lists several of the Family Research Council’s leaders, including president Tony Perkins and retired Lt. Gen William G. (Jerry) Boykin, the group’s executive vice president, in its category for individual "extremists." Such designations have flummoxed some observers, including some who generally lean liberal, such as Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank, who wrote, "I disagree with the Family Research Council's views on gays and lesbians. But it's absurd to put the group, as the law center does, in the same category as Aryan Nations, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Stormfront and the Westboro Baptist Church." The Southern Poverty Law Center’s designation appears to have contributed to a violent incident when 28-year-old Floyd Corkins shot and wounded a security guard at the Family Research Council’s headquarters in August 2012. The gunman told law enforcement that he was opposed to the council’s socially conservative policies and had targeted the group after using the Southern Poverty Law Center’s website. Corkins later pleaded guilty to transporting a firearm over state lines, assault with intent to kill, and committing an act of terrorism while armed. We won’t take a position on the Southern Poverty Law Center’s designation, but we should note that while calling the Family Research Council an "extremist" group is a serious charge, it’s not the same thing as saying the council is a "terrorist" group. The former generally refers to someone who holds extreme views. The latter generally involves something more -- the threat or use of violence to advance such extreme views. For the record, the Southern Poverty Law Center does not consider the Family Research Council a "terrorist" group, said Heidi Beirich, a spokeswoman for the group. "We have no such list," she said. That said, there has been some blurring of the lines, at least linguistically. " 'Terrorism' and 'violent extremism' are often used interchangeably -- the Obama administration's policy on countering 'violent extremism' was explicitly intended to replace the term ‘terrorism,' " said Charles Kurzman, a professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill who has studied terrorism. More definitively for the purpose of gauging Carson’s statement, the Southern Poverty Law Center is not a government agency. So are there any federal agency lists that label the Family Research Council a terrorist group? The only official, public list of terrorist groups is maintained by the State Department, and the Family Research Council isn’t on it. That list is designed to catalogue foreign terrorist organizations. Indeed, there is no equivalent list for domestic terrorist groups, though the FBI has cited some broad categories that it considers potential sources of domestic terrorism, including eco-terrorists and animal rights extremists, sovereign citizens movements, anarchist extremism, militia extremism and white supremacy extremism. The Family Research Council is not mentioned by name in any of these categories. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security produced a report in April 2009 titled "Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment." When the report was leaked to the public, the newly installed Obama administration took significant heat from some conservatives who said the report unfairly labeled right-of-center groups as potential sources of violence. However, neither this report -- nor another Department of Homeland Security study focusing on a broader range of potential ideologically driven threats -- lists the Family Research Council, or, for that matter, any other specific conservative groups. "I do not know of any source that lists the Family Research Council as a ‘terrorist group,’ " said Pete Simi, an associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, where he serves as director of radicalization and violent groups research. Our ruling Carson said, "the Family Research Council, according to some government agencies, is a terrorist group." The Family Research Council has been labeled an "extremist" group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, but that’s not the same as a "terrorist" group and, more importantly, the center is a private, non-profit group, not a government agency. We could find no government agency that singled out the Family Research Council as a terrorist group, and experts told us they were unaware of any government lists that did. We rate Carson’s statement False.	None	Ben Carson	None	None	None	2015-12-01T12:08:16	2015-11-29	['None']
pomt-08393	Says Rick Perry recently said he "wanted another (Texas) business tax."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/oct/23/kathie-glass/kathie-glass-says-rick-perry-told-houston-newspape/	Libertarian gubernatorial nominee Kathie Glass vowed to cut the state budget in half during an Oct. 19 debate in Austin also featuring Democratic candidate Bill White and Green Party hopeful Deb Shafto. There was more to her vision of revenue and taxes. "We need to end property taxes and end (business) franchise taxes," Glass said. Then came a revelation: "In the Sunday Houston Chronicle, Gov. (Rick) Perry said that he wanted another business tax." Missed that Perry bombshell? Us too. Far as we can tell, Perry has lately ruled out tax hikes. In an Oct. 15 interview with the Texas Tribune, the governor reaffirmed his intent not to raise taxes to balance the next state budget, adding that he's got a track record of no tax increases--a claim that we're not checking in this article. So what about Perry calling for another business tax? Glass's campaign pointed us to a news article on page A-10 of the Oct. 17 Houston Chronicle titled "Where They Stand," subtitled "the candidates for governor, on the issues." The article briefs where Perry and White stand on such topics as higher and public education, border security, state spending and economic development. And in the economic development portion, it says Perry claims his policies resulted in jobs being added to Texas and brags that Texas has been hailed as the nation's leading state for business. The next sentence--highlighted by Glass's camp--says Perry cut "property taxes by $15.5 billion statewide, paid for in part by the adoption of a new business tax." Huh. We read that sentence as referring to 2006 legislation encouraged by Perry that resulted in the state picking up a bigger share of public school funding by using state revenues--including money from a major revision of the state's business franchise tax--to cover reductions in local school property tax rates. We called Glass to to share our read of the Chronicle story. Glass said: "I just read it differently and I am not willing to give Perry any slack. He should have been there" at the debate. She was referring to Perry's refusal to join any debate with White unless White released additional tax returns.

pomt-13653	The Iran nuclear deal is "putting billions of dollars back into a country that’s the world’s largest supporter of terrorism. We are actually giving them the money to fund the terrorists that are killing us and our allies."	half-true	/new-york/statements/2016/aug/05/rudy-giuliani/no-one-writing-iran-check-under-nuclear-deal/	Speaking at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani took aim at the U.S. nuclear weapons deal with Iran last year. "To defeat Islamic extremist terrorists, we must put them on defense. If they are at war against us, which they have declared, we must commit ourselves to unconditional victory against them," Giuliani said. "This includes undoing one of the worst deals America ever made - Obama’s nuclear agreement with Iran that will eventually let them become a nuclear power and it’s putting billions of dollars back into a country that’s the world’s largest supporter of terrorism. We are actually giving them the money to fund the terrorists that are killing us and our allies. We are giving them the money. Are we crazy? Donald Trump will make sure any agreement with Iran meets the original goals of the U.N. and our allies - a non-nuclear Iran." Republicans in Congress have opposed the nuclear deal. They tried to block it through a vote in the Senate, but the effort failed by two votes. Since then it’s been a talking point on the campaign trail both in national and statewide races. Is Giuliani right about the details of the Iran nuclear deal? ‘Billions of dollars’ to Iran A similar claim has been made before about the money Iran will receive under the deal. In March, Donald Trump said in Florida that Iran would be given $150 billion ‘for nothing’ as part of the deal. As PolitiFact has reported previously, the money already belongs to Iran and the final amount is expected to be closer to $50 billion. Giuliani did not specify an amount that Iran will receive. PolitiFact previously rated Donald Trump’s claim as False. Money to Iran The countries involved are not collectively writing a check to Iran. According to Richard Nephew from Columbia University, the money is revenue from oil and gas sales that foreign banks are forced to hold. With the sanctions lifted, Iran was expected to end up with about $50 billion after financial obligations and other matters, according to experts we spoke to and testimony from Treasury Secretary Jack Lew. Iran would not receive the money without U.S. permission. If the U.S. had not cut a deal with Iran, the funds would still be frozen under the sanctions. So while no taxpayer money goes to Iran, the U.S. allowed Iran to receive billions of dollars. It’s unclear how much money has been released to Iran. The sanctions were lifted when the deal was implemented earlier this year, but only the Iranian Central Bank knows exactly how much is available to the country. Sponsor of terrorism More than 30 years ago the U.S. State Department designated Iran as a state sponsor of terrorism. The country remains on that list. Each year the State Department releases reports on international terrorism for Congress and the public. This year’s report was released in June. In a briefing with reporters to discuss the report, the department’s acting Coordinator for Counterterrorism Justin Siberell called Iran the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. Iran sponsors Hezbollah in Lebanon, terrorist groups in Gaza, and groups in Iraq and the Middle East. Experts we spoke to are mixed on whether the deal means Iran has increased terror funding. Matthew Kroenig from Georgetown University suggests that could happen. No experts had evidence that Iran's funding of terror groups had grown. Our ruling At the Republican National Convention, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani said the United States is giving Iran billions of dollars under the Iran nuclear deal and that the money is being used to fund terrorists. He also called Iran the world’s largest supporter of terrorism. Giuliani is right that Iran ranks as the world’s leading state sponsor of terrorism. The billions of dollars released to Iran was already Iran’s money, but could only be released with U.S. consent. On the last part of Giuiani's claim, experts have said it’s difficult to know whether Iran has used any of the money to sponsor terrorist groups. We rate this claim as Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d81d1a7d-7aa5-47d8-b7e3-1859f23fc5b8	None	Rudy Giuliani	None	None	None	2016-08-05T15:05:12	2016-07-18	['Iran']
pomt-05874	"This year President Obama canceled the 21st annual National Day of Prayer ceremony at the White House under the ruse of ‘not wanting to offend anyone.' BUT … on September 25, 2009 from 4 AM until 7 PM, a National Day of Prayer FOR THE MUSLIM RELIGION was HELD on Capitol Hill, Beside the White House."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/09/chain-email/claim-obama-canceled-national-day-prayer-has-been-/	The people behind a chain email circulating in New Jersey about President Barack Obama and the National Day of Prayer might want to think about the sin of omission. That’s omission, as in omitting facts. The email, received Jan. 30 by PolitiFact New Jersey, claimed in 2010 that Obama canceled a National Day of Prayer ceremony at the White House in 2009, but later that year a National Day of Prayer for Muslims was permitted on Capitol Hill, beside the White House. The email reads, in part: "This year President Obama canceled the 21st annual National Day of Prayer ceremony at the White House under the ruse of ‘not wanting to offend anyone,’" the email reads. "BUT … on September 25, 2009 from 4 AM until 7 PM, a National Day of Prayer FOR THE MUSLIM RELIGION was HELD on Capitol Hill, Beside the White House." Most of the claims in the email don’t have a prayer of being accurate, PolitiFact New Jersey found. There are several statements to address. Let’s start with the origins of the National Day of Prayer, which is an annual observance for people of all faiths. President Harry Truman established the day as a national event in 1952. In 1988, President Ronald Reagan signed a resolution designating the first Thursday in May as the National Day of Prayer. Every president since – including Obama – has issued a proclamation to recognize the day. Obama, however, has not held the National Day of Prayer ceremony at the White House that President George W. Bush had for eight years. Presidents George H.W. Bush held one, in 1989, and Reagan also held one, in 1982. President Bill Clinton had none. So, there have not been 21 annual National Day of Prayer ceremonies, as the email claims. In fact-checking this email, we found at least 30 published reports in a basic Google search debunking various claims in it. While those reports confirm that Obama decided against the public White House ceremony, none state exactly why. In a May 7, 2009 CNN video, a representative with the Christian Broadcast Network speculated the cancelation might stem from publicity about controversial comments once made by the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, Obama’s longtime pastor in Chicago. Other articles imply that a statement in Obama’s inaugural speech about inclusivity of all religions and nonreligions in the United States might have been a factor. At the time, White House press secretary Robert Gibbs said of Obama’s plans on the National Day of Prayer, "Privately, he’ll pray as he does every day." The same is expected this year. "As he has done each of the last three years, President Obama will continue to recognize the National Day of Prayer," White House spokesman Brandon Lepow said in an email. Next, let’s review the claim about "a National Day of Prayer FOR THE MUSLIM RELIGION" being held "on Capitol Hill, Beside the White House." The Jummah Prayer on Capitol Hill event was a one-time only activity coordinated by the Dar-ul-Islam mosque in Elizabeth to "clear up myths about Muslims," said Imam Ali Jaaber, who attended the Sept. 25, 2009 event. It was never billed as a National Day Of Prayer. Hassen Abdellah, board president at Dar-ul-Islam, organized the event in response to positive remarks by Obama in his inaugural speech and during another speech five months later in Egypt about welcoming and acknowledging the presence of Muslims in the United States, Jaaber said. Also, Capitol Hill is approximately one mile from the White House – not beside it. And, Muslim is not a religion. A person who follows the religion Islam is a Muslim. Our ruling A chain email circulating in New Jersey that Obama canceled the 21st annual National Day of Prayer ceremony in 2009 but a National Day of Prayer for Muslims was held later that year on Capitol Hill is full of inaccuracies. While it’s true that Obama did not hold a public ceremony at the White House that President George W. Bush did, it’s untrue that the ceremony would have been the 21st annual event. But wait – there’s more: the email’s author incorrectly located Capitol Hill as "beside" the White House and identified Muslim as a religion. Despite the numerous errors in the email, it does contain an element of truth -- and that fits the Truth-O-Meter’s definition for Mostly False. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-06863	"The (State Board of Administration) transparency issue got a great airing the last legislative session."	false	/florida/statements/2011/aug/02/ash-williams/florida-state-investment-chief-says-transparency-w/	Facing questions about the handling of the state's $130 billion investment portfolio, the executive director and chief investment officer of the State Board of Administration tried to reassure Florida Gov. Rick Scott that everything is fine. SBA executive director Ash Williams defended SBA procedures and policies to Scott and members of the Florida Cabinet on Aug. 2, 2011. The comments came following a St. Petersburg Times analysis, which found that state investments would have yielded a better return sitting in an automated index fund than they did under high-priced investment consultants. The SBA currently invests about $130 billion for more than 1 million current and future government retirees and hundreds of state and local government agencies. Part of the concern for Scott, were questions about whether the SBA is handling its transactions in secret. "What about the question about transparency?" Scott asked Williams. "Are there things that we ought to be doing that we're not doing yet?" "Well, I think the transparency issue got a great airing the last legislative session. We have for the most part full transparency," Williams said. "All of our publicly traded activity is very readily observable or obviously subject to the public records law. We have one very narrow slice of our activity that has a very limited exception from Florida's public records law and that relates to alternative investments and subjects them to a certain type of review prior to being released." What stuck out to us at PolitiFact Florida was Williams' suggestion that the question of transparency at the SBA "got a great airing the last legislative session." (After all, we witnessed the entire legislative session firsthand.) Was that what really happened? The 2011 annual legislative session came and went with lengthy debate on a number of issues. We remember hours of debate about a bill -- which ultimately failed -- that would have eliminated the automatic payroll deduction of union dues for public employees. We remember feisty arguments and a fair amount of public testimony about a bill that passed (and is now being challenged in court) altering Florida voter laws. Early in the session, debate zeroed in on an education bill that would eliminate a form of tenure for public school teachers. Late in the session, in the Senate, debate roiled over an immigration bill. We can list others -- bills about abortion, the state budget and amending the state's growth management laws all consumed hours of time in the 60-day spring session. But again, back to Williams' statement -- transparency at the SBA. We searched and found one bill on the topic -- HB 7225 (the identical Senate bill was SB 2174). The bill was filed in order to extend a public records exemption for the SBA that was set to expire. Specifically, it renews a 2006 law giving the SBA an exemption from public records requirements for "proprietary confidential business information." The bill passed the Senate 33-3 (one senator originally voted yes, but changed -- more on that later) and the House 114-1. It was signed into law by Scott on May 31. Williams explained the 2006 law and the extension this way to Scott and Cabinet members as part of his Aug. 12 comments: "That law has been in effect and affects less than 10 percent of the SBA's portfolio, so the other 90-plus percent doesn’t have any of that protection," he said. "That law was under sunset review last legislative session. It was heard extensively in committees and in the House and Senate, and the overwhelming vote of the Legislature was that it was in the public interest, so much so that it was reinstated and the future recurring sunset review of it was removed because it's been in place for so many years that the judgment of the Legislature in public hearings and after extensive staff review was that it actually served the public interest well." The Florida Senate and House websites archive video of committee meetings, as well as regular floor sessions. So by retracing the path of the bill, we were able to watch the entire debate over HB 7225 and SB 2174. Lucky for us, there wasn't a lot. The measure was first heard in the Senate Governmental Oversight and Accountability on April 5. It was explained by a Senate staffer (the de facto sponsor, Sen. Jeremy Ring, D-Margate, was not at the meeting.) After its introduction, Sen. Mike Fasano, R-New Port Richey, asked several questions about the records exemption and whether it was necessary. Eventually, Williams responded to Fasano's questions directly in a back-and-forth that lasted a little less than 20 minutes. At one point, Fasano showed SBA documents that had been heavily redacted. "It's all blank, Mr. Chairman. There's nothing. It just goes on and on," he said. Williams, in response, noted that the document Fasano was referring to -- an Invitation to Negotiate for legal services -- was heralded as being a model of transparency by a national group. That didn't win over Fasano, who continued to voice strong objections. Another senator, Jack Latvala, R-Clearwater, also voiced concern. The proposal, which didn't get a vote that day, returned before the same committee April 14, when senators heard and discussed the bill for 10 minutes. No one from the public spoke; neither did Williams. Fasano reiterated his concerns, as did Latvala. Democratic Sen. Bill Montford of Tallahassee said he had no problem with the exemption, and Ring defended the proposal -- saying companies now doing business with the state would walk away if the public records exemption were allowed to expire. It passed the committee 11-2. On the same day, April 14, a House committee heard its version of the same bill. Discussion lasted three minutes and 15 seconds. Republican Paige Kreegel of Punta Gorda asked sponsor Rep. Jimmy Patronis, R-Panama City, if there had been concerns over some of the SBA's investments. Patronis didn't directly answer the question, saying the two members could talk later, and that the bill had another committee stop. The bill passed unanimously 17-0. But it never went to another committee. Instead, it appeared on the House floor April 28, where it was read the required second and third times and passed by the full chamber 114-1 in a total of 57 seconds. The Senate then took up the House version of the legislation the next day (though the versions were identical). The Senate read the bill a second and third time as required, and without any discussion or debate -- voted 34-2 in favor. Fasano, originally a yes vote, changed his vote to no, making the final outcome 33-3. Total time on the Senate floor: One minute, 30 seconds. Overall, the SBA public records exemption was a topic for less than 36 minutes in a public meeting, according to our review of videos from committee hearings and from the floors of the House and Senate. Of that, about 25 minutes of the discussion came from one senator, Fasano, during a back-and-forth with Williams and a subsequent committee speech. And excluding the sponsors -- Ring and Patronis -- only five members of the 160-member Legislature ever discussed the exemption in a public forum: Fasano, Latvala, Montford, Kreegel and Rep. Rick Kriseman, D-St. Petersburg, who asked during a hearing what the First Amendment Foundation thought about the bill. That brings us back to what Williams said, that "the transparency issue got a great airing the last legislative session." At PolitiFact we're sometimes reluctant to analyze statements that are open to interpretation (what's the definition of "great" in this case), but we feel confident that someone seeing Williams' statement would come away with an impression that is very different from the legislative record. In fact, the public records SBA bill that moved through the House and Senate passed with just slightly more debate than is absolutely necessary to comply with state rules that a bill be read three times before it is passed. We're not saying it's Williams' fault that the Legislature decided not to speak out on this bill. But we do hold him accountable for his words. We rate his statement False.

pomt-06980	"There's no scientific conclusion that (being gay) is genetic."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/13/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-says-theres-no-scientific-conclusion-/	During a July 10, 2011, appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press, host David Gregory asked Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty about the origins of homosexuality. Here’s their exchange: Gregory: "Let me ask you about social policy. You've notably said that you're a big fan of Lady Gaga, and even the song Born This Way. There's a lot of debate about a gay marriage pledge in Iowa. And related to that, I wonder, do you agree with some of those who are behind that, that being gay is a choice?" Pawlenty: "Well, I have two teenage daughters who listen to Lady Gaga, so I'm subjected to it. And it has some good qualities to it. But as to, as to gay marriage, I'm in support of traditional marriage as between a man and a woman. I have not supported the issues of allowing gay couples to have the same benefits ... as traditional couples. And so this is an issue in Iowa and across the whole country. But I've stood in favor of traditional marriage and traditional relationships in that regard. Gregory: "Is being gay a choice?" Pawlenty: "Well, the science in that regard is in dispute. I mean, the scientists work on that and try to figure out if it's behavioral..." Gregory: "Right." Pawlenty: "...or if it's partly genetic." Gregory:"What do you think?" Pawlenty: "Well, I defer to the scientists in that regard." Gregory: "So you, you think it's not a choice." Pawlenty: "Well, there is no...." Gregory: "That you are, as Lady Gaga says, you're born that way." Pawlenty: "There's no scientific conclusion that it's genetic. We don't know that. So we don't know to what extent, you know, it's behavioral, and that's something that's been debated by scientists for a long time. But as I understand the science, there's no current conclusion that it's genetic." We decided to rate two of Pawlenty’s statements separately. In another item, we’ll look at whether scientists are "in dispute" about whether being gay is a choice. In this item, we’ll look at Pawlenty’s claim that "there's no scientific conclusion that it's genetic." Pawlenty’s word choice -- "genetic" -- is pivotal for rating the accuracy of his claim. The way he phrased it, he’s pretty close to accurate. But if he’d said instead that "there's no scientific conclusion that (being gay) is biological," he would have been incorrect. Since the significance of this distinction may not be obvious at first glance, we’ll explain it in detail here. If a trait is "genetic," it means that it comes from the genes encoded in your DNA. Furthermore, arguing that something is genetic suggests that there’s a single, or at least a well-defined, genetic source -- what has sometimes been called a "gay gene." By contrast, if a trait is "biological" in origin, it means that it can stem from any number of factors, such as hormone levels or how a fetus develops in the uterus. It would not, however, originate primarily from environmental factors such as childhood experiences -- what one might call the "nurture" part of the nature/nurture divide. The typical way of figuring out whether something is caused by genes is through twin studies. Since identical twins share 100 percent of their DNA, any observed differences in traits would be presumed to be influenced by environment rather than genetics. So if being gay was truly, and exclusively, a genetic trait, every set of identical twins should either be both straight, or both gay. In fact, that’s not the case. Even the studies with the strongest linkage show about a 50 percent correlation in sexual orientation between identical twins. Other studies have shown lower rates. Based on these findings, scientists agree that being gay is not caused exclusively by genes. However, being gay does appear to have a genetic component -- just a weaker one. The same study that showed roughly a 50 percent correlation in sexual orientation between identical twins also showed weaker correlations for fraternal twins, who share only 50 percent of their genes on average. That’s pretty much what you’d expect to see if genetics played a role, but not a dominant one. "Pawlenty is surely right that a genetic explanation has not been proven, and indeed genetics is likely a modest influence on sexual orientation," said Michael Bailey, a Northwestern University psychologist who undertook the twin study that showed a 50 percent correlation, as well as another that showed lower correlations. But if being gay is not primarily determined by genes, it doesn’t mean that its origin isn’t biological. Bailey and others find some of the most convincing evidence of the inherent nature of sexual orientation in long-term studies of the rare cases in which hormonally normal boys are reared as girls due to either accidents or certain medical conditions that have left them less obviously male. He said there have been six published cases of hormonally normal males reassigned early as females, and invariably, their sexual orientation was toward females. That’s consistent with their prenatal gender, not with their rearing as girls. The point of these studies is that sexual orientation -- one’s attractions and impulses -- runs very deep and is resistant to social and environmental factors. "If you can't make a male attracted to other males by cutting off his penis, castrating him, and rearing him as a girl, how likely is any social explanation of male homosexuality?" Bailey asks. Scientists freely acknowledge that the precise pathways for imparting sexual orientation are not yet understood. "Although much research has examined the possible genetic, hormonal, developmental, social and cultural influences on sexual orientation, no findings have emerged that permit scientists to conclude that sexual orientation – heterosexuality, homosexuality or bisexuality -- is determined by any particular factor or factors," the American Psychological Association has put it. However, just because scientists don’t know the specific mechanisms that cause sexual orientation doesn’t mean that they aren’t confident that they are biological in nature. "We do not really know in any definitive way the mix between biological and other explanations, but the evidence for biological contributions is as good or better than for any other factor," said Clinton W. Anderson, the associate executive director of the American Psychological Association and the director of its lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender concerns office. "Some have suggested that it’s how you were reared or a failure in bonding to the same-sex parent. But the research to support that is abysmal." Jack Drescher, a distinguished fellow of the American Psychiatric Association, added that "you’d be hard-pressed to find a reputable scientist who would exclude some aspect of biology" from the causes of homosexuality. Drescher is a member of the working group on sexual and gender-identity disorders for the forthcoming fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM 5-- the authoritative reference work in the field. At this point, we need to note an important caveat: What we’ve been discussing here applies primarily to gay men. There is actually no solid scientific consensus about the causes of female homosexuality, because the research has been much less extensive. We struggled with the question of how we should factor in what one might call the lesbian exception. Neither Pawlenty nor Gregory specifically referred to either gay men or gay women in their comments. Ultimately, we concluded that the science of what causes women to be gay was too unformed to draw any solid conclusions, so we set it aside as a factor in our ratings. So where does this leave us? Pawlenty said "there's no scientific conclusion that (being gay) is genetic." On that specific question, we found broad agreement that Pawlenty was correct. Scientists told us that genetics may play a role in determining sexual orientation, but the current evidence suggests that it’s not the dominant factor and may ultimately be shown to play just a modest role. But a modest role is still different from no role. And we also think that viewers of the interview might be led to believe that because homosexuality is not primarily caused by genes, there’s no biological cause. In reality, most scientists do believe that sexual orientation is caused by biology, rather than by choice. On balance, we rate Pawlenty’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-11587	"There were slaves in 1845 who helped construct and build the Old Capitol."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/feb/01/kionne-mcghee/did-slaves-help-build-old-capitol-building-tallaha/	Rep. Kionne McGhee, D-Miami, offered an emotional speech about the role slavery played in Florida’s history as the Florida House prepared to vote on a slavery memorial at the Capitol. McGhee, the bill’s sponsor, referred to a mural in the House chamber that depicts a slave woman holding a bushel of cotton near Andrew Jackson, the state’s military governor who would later become president. "Because her lips were sealed, I will attempt to do justice," McGhee said. "You see, if she were able to talk on this day, she would tell us that in 1824, the slaves from Gadsden (County) came here, on this capitol complex some 200 yards away to clear the field." "She would also tell us that just behind us, there were slaves in 1845 who helped construct and build the Old Capitol, as we call it, that’s what she would tell us," McGhee said. The Florida House voted unanimously for HB 67, the companion of which has not yet been considered by the full Senate. If approved, the slave memorial would join other Capitol Complex monuments honoring fallen police officers, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and Civil War soldiers from Leon County, among other structures. We wanted to take a look at McGhee’s claim that enslaved people helped build the "Old Capitol." (We have previously found slaves helped build the White House in Washington.) We found very little documentation about enslaved people building the Old Capitol, but history experts said it was very likely they helped build it, given the large role slaves played in Florida at the time. McGhee’s team said the claim can be found in The Old Capitol: The Florida Center of Political History and Governance, an informational pamphlet compiled by Museum of Florida History staff to accompany the opening of a new exhibit. The booklet said that the Old Capitol was "built in part" by enslaved people, but does not say anything else about its construction. The history of Florida’s Capitol Florida commissioners picked Tallahassee as the capital in 1824, between two existing governmental centers — Pensacola and St. Augustine. The building that came to be known as the "Old Capitol" was completed in 1845, just before Florida was admitted as the 27th state. The Florida Capitol Complex we know today includes the Old Capitol, plus House and Senate office buildings, and the 22-story building sometimes called the "New Capitol." We asked the Florida Historic Capitol Museum, the Museum of Florida History and the Florida Department of State for additional information about the pamphlet McGhee cited, but came up empty-handed. The Florida Historic Capitol Museum has a webpage dedicated to the Old Capitol, but it does not mention anything about slave labor. (Rachel Porter, the director of research and programming at the museum, collected the information for McGhee’s claim.) Every expert we spoke to said that slave labor was integral to every aspect of Florida in the 19th century. However, specific records about slaves’ contributions often went unrecorded, as slave owners rarely disclosed the extent of their labor. "The fact that there is only a cursory mention of enslaved Africans building the Capitol is not unusual," said Larry Rivers, a distinguished history professor at Florida A&M University. "Enslaved Africans were regarded, like in other antebellum southern states, as objects to be simply worked until they died." According to Census information from 1840, Richard A. Shine, the supervising architect and primary contractor for building the Old Capitol, was listed as a slave owner. Andrew Frank, associate history professor at Florida State University, said Shine was known to have used slaves on other projects in Tallahassee or to have hired out some of them as manual or skilled laborers. Frank added that Shine’s son, Richard Shire Jr., later described himself as an "auctioneer" or slave trader. "They, like most residents in what was known as Middle Florida, were deeply invested (financially and socially) in slavery," he said. Edward E. Baptist, a history professor at Cornell University who has written a book about slavery in Florida, said almost every building in pre-1865 Tallahassee was built at least in part with slave labor. "It would in fact be shocking if the Old Capitol was not built with enslaved labor," Baptist said. "Artisans like white carpenters and masons owned slave laborers and craftsmen." Our ruling McGhee said enslaved people "helped construct and build the Old Capitol." African-American slaves were part of almost every facet of Florida life in the 19th century. Historians said they did all possible work in Florida, which would have included the building McGhee referenced.

pomt-03978	Says "overwhelming majorities of Americans" support gun legislation "like background checks."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/feb/13/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-says-overwhelming-majority-/	President Barack Obama used his 2013 State of the Union address to urge Congress to vote on legislation to reduce gun violence. Victims of recent attacks deserve it, he said, and voters support some "common-sense reform." "Overwhelming majorities of Americans – Americans who believe in the 2nd Amendment – have come together around common-sense reform – like background checks that will make it harder for criminals to get their hands on a gun," he told lawmakers. Do "overwhelming majorities of Americans" support gun legislation such as background checks? The evidence Viewers who watched an enhanced version of Obama’s speech online at WhiteHouse.gov saw a graphic that said "92 percent of Americans support background checks for gun buyers." It cited an independent poll from Quinnipiac University, which we quickly found on the university’s site. The results from the phone poll of 1,772 registered voters in late January and early February 2013 were straightforward: • It found 92 percent support for background checks for all gun buyers, which the Quinnipiac pollsters described as "overwhelming." • It found 91 percent support for universal background checks among voters in a household with a gun. Other polls we’ve cited in recent fact-checks also found high percentages of support for universal background checks, even among gun owners. A Pew Research Center poll from Jan. 9-13, 2013, of 1,502 adults found 85 percent of Americans (and 85 percent of gun owners) favor making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks. A CBS/New York Times poll conducted Jan. 11-15 among 1,110 adults showed that 92 percent of Americans (and 85 percent of respondents living in a household with an NRA member) support universal background checks. Obama did cherry-pick the gun-control proposal on which consensus is strongest -- background checks. Other proposals he might also call "common-sense," such as bans on assault weapons and high capacity magazines, held 56 percent support in the Quinnipiac poll. And they were narrowly opposed by voters in households with a gun, with 52 percent against such measures. Our ruling Obama said "overwhelming majorities of Americans" support gun legislation "like background checks." The poll cited by the administration, as well as other independent polls in 2013, do show support for universal background checks above 80 percent among voters, even those who own guns. But people would get the impression from Obama's statement that there is similar support for other White House gun proposals, when the reality is weaker majority support among voters and slim opposition among gun owners. That’s a point worth clarifying. We rate the president’s claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-02-13T00:21:37	2013-02-12	['United_States']

pomt-01822	There are "approximately 20,000 annual gun purchases in Rhode Island."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jul/20/brett-smiley/providence-mayoral-candidate-brett-smiley-says-the/	As the gun debate continues to roil the nation and Rhode Island, Providence mayoral candidate Brett Smiley wants to take guns out of the hands of criminals. But how? Smiley, one of five Democrats vying for the seat, proposes a supplemental 10-percent statewide sales tax "on the approximately 20,000 annual gun purchases in Rhode Island and on ammunition purchases." That in turn, would produce revenue to support community anti-violence efforts and other initiatives to part criminals from their guns. Smiley unveiled his "Safest City Plan" at a December press conference. A seven-page campaign brochure he mailed to voters in the last week of June includes a version of that plan that reiterates his gun tax proposal. [A bill sponsored on Smiley’s behalf to impose the 10-percent statewide surplus gun tax failed to make it out of committee in the last General Assembly session]. So are there 20,000 guns sold a year in Rhode Island? First, let’s look at the laws for buying a gun in the state: Statutes 11-47-35 and 11-47-35.2. Anyone wanting to do so must first fill out a state purchase application form with a Federal Firearms Licensee - i.e., a licensed gun shop. The application is run through the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) data base. The licensed firearms dealer sends a copy of the application to local or state police, and the attorney general’s department. They must later destroy the copies if no disqualifying information is found. If approved, you must wait seven days before you buy your firearm - or firearms (more than one gun can be purchased per application.) Smiley bases his claim on NICS Firearm Background Checks data. Here are the NICS statistics from 2010-2014: 2010: 14,835 2011: 17,271 2012: 24,050 2013: 26,666 2014: 10,140 as of June 30 "Looking just at the data for NICS Firearm Background Checks, you see that the Rhode Island figure has been steadily increasing in recent years, with 24,050 in 2012 and 26,666 in 2013," campaign manager Josh Block wrote in an email. "It's also worth noting that these figures are for the number of people receiving background checks, and multiple guns purchased at the same time would still yield only one background check. Given these figures, it's clear that saying "approximately 20,000 annual gun purchases in Rhode Island" is an accurate, and frankly even a relatively conservative, estimate," Block wrote. He said that number refers specifically to the number of guns sold. Federal law prohibits the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives from creating a federal registry of gun transactions. The FBI must destroy all approved gun purchase records within 24 hours. "ATF does not gather or collect information pertaining to the number of guns sold," says Debora A. Seifert, public information officer for the ATF Boston field division. The FBI notes that the NICS Firearm Background Checks "do not represent the number of firearms sold. Based on varying state laws and purchase scenarios, a one-to-one correlation cannot be made between a firearm background check and a firearm sale." OK. But do those NICS statistics represent an approximate measure, as Smiley claims? Short of tallying every licensed firearms dealer’s register in the state, no one can say precisely how many guns are sold every year in Rhode Island. We turned to the Rhode Island State Police and attorney general’s office for some answers. We also called more than half a dozen local gun shop owners. In different ways, they suggested that, if anything Smiley’s estimated number is on the low side. Amy Kempe, spokeswoman for Atty. Gen. Peter F. Kilmartin, gave us a breakdown for the years 2010 through 2013, of the number of applications approved and denied. The data reflect a consistent ratio between approvals and denials: on average, fewer than 1 percent are denied. State police Major James M. Manni interprets the NICS data the same way as Smiley. "Based on the number of NICS checks done - that’s factual that there are approximately 20,000 firearms sold in Rhode Island or even more" every year, said Manni, state police commander of inspectional services. Take the 2013 figure of 26,666 firearms background checks for example, Manni says. "Does that mean there were 26,000 guns sold? There could be more. You can buy multiple firearms" on one application, however he notes that "the vast majority are single sales." Manni also noted that the numbers of applicants who are either denied a purchase -- or who ultimately decide not to buy a firearm -- are very small. He said that In 2014, "in a six-month period, there were 10,140 NICS firearms background checks. So 2014 is on track for about 20,000" of those checks. Gun shop owners we spoke with also confirmed that very few applicants change their minds about buying a gun during the 7-day waiting period. And they confirmed that it’s impossible to determine precisely how many guns are purchased in the state each year. John Francis, owner of Competition Shooting Supplies, in Pawtucket, said " Unless you went to each dealer, and had each dealer count through our records … there’s no way to know." Our ruling Brett Smiley says there are "approximately 20,000 annual gun purchases in Rhode Island." There is no official registry of yearly gun sales in Rhode Island; state law prohibits it. But state and federal law enforcement officials cite the same statistics that Smiley does to back up his claim. Gun shop owners, and state police tell us that the majority of applications represent single sales. Because Smiley was careful to approximate the number, we rate his claim as True.

pomt-08706	Ohio today has the "fewest number of state employees since the Reagan administration."	true	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/06/yvette-mcgee-brown/strickland-running-mate-yvette-mcgee-brown-says-oh/	For much of this gubernatorial campaign, Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland has been defending his record against charges from Republican challenger John Kasich that he has done too little to stem job losses in Ohio and responding to accusations that he still oversees a bloated state government. Strickland’s running mate, Yvettee McGee Brown, in her own campaign speeches has echoed the governor’s. Recently she tackled a charge by Republicans that Ohio still has too many employees on the state payroll by evoking the name of one of the GOP’s favorite sons. Ohio today has the "fewest number of state employees since the Reagan administration," McGee Brown said in an Aug. 4 speech at a candidates forum in Columbus. Clearly, recent well-chronicled state layoffs and hiring freezes almost assure Ohio has fewer state employees than when Strickland took office in 2007. But could it be fewer than in the 1980s when Reagan was president, as Brown contends? The Strickland campaign is looking to reverse long-held Republican opinion that Democrats favor higher taxes and bigger government. The higher taxes issue will loom for whomever is Ohio’s next governor, given that the state faces up to an $8 billion budget deficit in the next operating budget with seemingly few options other than raising personal income taxes. But the big government question is something Strickland has dealt with since 2009 when the last biennial budget was set and the administration laid off state workers, froze hiring in some areas and otherwise shrunk government by attrition. Now McGee Brown has gone a step further by stating that under Strickland, Ohio now has the fewest state employees since Reagan, who was president from 1981 through 1988. Strickland’s campaign communications team offered uneven explanations for where McGee Brown got her information. It first stated it came from a state data chart that officials could not find until, PolitiFact began inquiring three weeks after McGee Brown’s speech. It then said the information was in an October 2009 news release from the Strickland administration that the campaign never produced. But the Ohio Department of Administrative Services bailed them out. It discovered annual employee data in a trends report that contained information dating back to 1983 and updated to include recent years. The report shows that as of December 2009, Ohio had 58,622 employees, the lowest number since 1983 when the state had 60,292 workers. That 28-year stretch includes a period from 1991 through 2006 when Ohio’s governors were Republicans and the state had more than 65,000 employees. We rate McGee Brown’s statement as True.

pomt-10994	"The United States was paying for anywhere from 70 to 90 percent of (NATO), depending on the way you calculate."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/12/donald-trump/donald-trump-misleads-us-defense-spending-nato-bud/	Since his earliest days in office, President Donald Trump has made no bones about his feelings on how much the United States spends on NATO, often scolding allies for not carrying their weight. This week he was in Brussels for a summit with those very nations he’s unhappy with. One talking point came up again and again. As he left the White House for Europe, Trump tweeted that the United States is paying for 90 percent of NATO with other member countries falling far behind. In a short speech before he boarded his plane, he repeated his frustration but dialed back the size of the U.S. share, saying "we spend at least 70 percent for NATO." And in a July 12, 2018, press conference before he left Brussels, Trump decided to use both numbers to describe a lopsided U.S. contribution: "I believe in NATO. I think NATO's a very important, probably the greatest ever done. But the United States was paying for anywhere from 70 to 90 percent of it, depending on the way you calculate. That's not fair to the United States." Regardless of the figure used, it is not accurate to say that the United States is paying for either 70 or 90 percent of NATO’s military defense. U.S. outspends other countries on defense We first consulted NATO’s latest budget report for 2017. (A report with projected 2018 defense spending was released after Trump’s initial comment, but this doesn’t change the facts surrounding the claim.) The 2017 numbers show defense spending data of all member countries from 2010 to 2016 and 2017 estimates. By NATO’s count, total defense spending of all NATO members stood at about $957 billion in 2017. The United States’ share was about $686 billion. Do the math, and the percentage of U.S. spending is about 72 percent. (We don’t know the source for the 90 percent number.) Here are the top four spending countries on NATO’s list: Country Spending in billions (2017) Percent of total defense spending by NATO members United States $686 71.7% United Kingdom $55 5.8% France $46 4.8% Germany $45 4.8% U.S. spending isn’t all for NATO But what do these numbers mean? The spending doesn’t represent money spent on behalf of NATO, nor for NATO. They’re the total defense budgets of NATO members. For 2017, the defense spending of all NATO members totaled about $957 billion. The United States spent $686 billion on all of its defense spending across the globe for that year. Gordon Adams, professor emeritus at American University’s School of International Service, said the president’s wording is "bizarre" given that the burden for defense is quite different for the United States and European nations. "U.S. defense missions are global, not just European," he said, "while the allies spend solely for European defense." American defense spending supports aircraft carriers in the Pacific, as well as troops in Europe. On top of that, Adams said that U.S. equipment and personnel in Europe, such as an F-35 stealth fighter, can be deployed for missions in the Middle East. There is no clear way to tease out the fraction of American defense spending that primarily guards Europe. How countries do fund NATO NATO does have things it calls its own. There is a civilian staff and headquarters, and military equipment such as surveillance aircraft. There are bases, command headquarters and a program to beef up military capabilities in certain countries above and beyond what they would need for their own defense. Each of the 29 members contribute to those costs through an agreed cost-sharing formula based on the country’s gross domestic product. As the member with the largest GDP, the U.S. contributed 22 percent of NATO’s common funding. Not far behind is Germany with about 15 percent, then France and the United Kingdom with about 10 percent. With common costs of about $2.5 billion in 2017, the U.S. share of about $550 million doesn’t change the picture, since Europe’s share was a much larger $1.8 billion. That gap only weakens Trump’s argument. Our ruling Trump said "the United States was paying for anywhere from 70 to 90 percent of (NATO)." It is not accurate to say the United States pays for the majority of NATO's costs. The United States pays for 22 percent of NATO's common fund. Beyond that relatively small amount, the cost of NATO is undefined. The organization does total the defense budgets of its members, and based on that, U.S. defense spending equals about 70 percent. But the United States spends as much as it does because it is a global military power, which by and large, the European members are not. It is an apples and oranges comparison. Trump pushed a flawed comparison even further by saying the U.S. paid for as much as 90 percent of NATO. That goes beyond the exaggeration of this statistic that we've seen before. Trump’s statement contains just an element of truth, ignoring critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-02910	"If your plan is the result of collective bargaining, no subsequent changes by anybody -- insurance companies, Obamacare -- can force your grandfathered policy to change."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/04/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaughs-errant-attack-unions-grandfathered-/	President Barack Obama made sure his union pals got special treatment in the health care law, says conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh. How? Their health insurance plans are locked in, completely immune to new rules set forth by the Affordable Care Act, he said, noting that everyday Americans being hit with cancellation notices from their insurers don’t get the same courtesy. "If your plan is the result of collective bargaining, no subsequent changes by anybody -- insurance companies, Obamacare -- can force your grandfathered policy to change," Limbaugh said about the union carve-out on his show Oct. 30. "So, in other words, union insurers can amend their coverage. Your insurance company can't," Limbaugh continued. "Well, your insurance company can, but you lose your grandfathered status when they do. Unions don't because they're covered under an amendment made pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement." Limbaugh’s commentary leans on a Human Events column by Betsy McCaughey, the former New York lieutenant governor who once claimed that "Obamacare will question your sex life." We contacted several experts of the health care law, as well as unions, and they agreed: The law does contain a special rule for some union-negotiated health plans, but it’s not a permanent guarantee of grandfather status. It was a temporary rule aimed to create a smooth transition to the new law without breaking collectively bargained contracts across the country. You may be wondering about all this "grandfather" talk in the news lately, and why people are so dad-gum angry about it. We’ll back up a little bit. We discussed grandfathered plans, the fight du jour in the ongoing health care wars, at length in this fact-check. Basically, a health plan purchased by an individual or through an employer may be "grandfathered" if it existed before the Affordable Care Act became law March 23, 2010, and has not significantly changed since. The insurers offering these old plans have to follow some parts of the new law, such as covering adult children up to age 26, but they can largely keep these plans as they are without making many of the bigger changes required of new plans, such as fully covering preventive care. That said, the plan can lose its grandfathered status if the insurer makes a tweak that is considered too drastic by the federal government. For example, a plan can lose its grandfathered status if copayments go up by at least $5 plus medical inflation or if an employer decreases its contribution rate by more than five percentage points for a group plan. There’s a lot of fine print, and you can read it all courtesy of the breezy Federal Register. A plan that loses its grandfathered status is headed for certain death. There’s your need-to-know background info. So where do unions come in already? Here’s where: The same section of the Affordable Care Act that talks about grandfathered policies also talks about plans agreed to through collective bargaining (section 1251 (d) on page 56). The lawmakers who wrote this provision were not thinking of those of us without law degrees when they wrote it, so here’s the PunditFact translation: Workers whose health benefits are provided through an insurance company and were included in a collective bargaining agreement ratified before March 23, 2010, can keep their plan no matter the changes -- but not for long. The plan is only automatically grandfathered until the termination date of the agreement. So they do receive different treatment, but only until the agreement expires. After that, the plan must meet the same requirements of all other grandfathered plans. And importantly, none of this applies to collectively bargained plans for self-insured employers, which comprise more than half of union plans. Union-negotiated self-insured plans operate like all other companies. "This isn’t some huge gift which is being handed to the union," said Timothy Jost, Washington and Lee University law professor. "It’s simply recognizing that if you have coverage under a collective bargaining agreement, as long as that collective bargaining agreement remains in place, that coverage is okay." Gail Wilensky, former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, sounded a similar chord, saying "to me, that’s not unreasonable" because the alternative is prying open existing agreements to satisfy the health care law. A union plan could keep its grandfathered status after the expiration date of the agreement as long as "no changes were made since March 23, 2010, that would have otherwise caused the plan to lose its grandfathered status," according to the University of California Berkeley Labor Center. In other words, union plans could lose their grandfathered status once the agreement expires if they reduce benefits in ways that are at odds with the health care law, just like all other grandfathered plans, said Randy G. DeFrehn, National Coordinating Committee for Multiemployer Plans executive director. "The statement that collectively bargained plans cannot lose their grandfather status is not correct," he said. Experts told us most union agreements last between three to five years, which means most of those plans are already being treated like other grandfathered plans because the agreements that were in place before the health care law passed have expired. "It’s a really narrow exception," said Paul Secunda, a labor law professor at Marquette University School of Law. "This is kind of coming to an end anyway." The law says these plans can be adjusted to comply with the Affordable Care Act without breaking the union agreement. Our ruling Limbaugh takes a point about real language inserted in the health care law for some union-negotiated health care plans and twists the truth. These plans are only grandfathered for as long as the collective bargaining agreement lasts. After the agreement expires, and some already have, those plans are held to the same standards as all other grandfathered plans. Limbaugh's suggestion that "no subsequent changes by anybody" can change the union plans goes too far. On top of that, union-negotiated self-insured plans (which make up more than half of all union plans) are treated no differently than regular employer plans. We rate Limbaugh's claim Mostly False.

pomt-13732	Says Hillary Clinton helped "get done" the Children's Health Insurance Program.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/jul/26/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-hillary-clinton-helped-get-done-/	Former President Bill Clinton said that after health care reform failed in the 1990s because they couldn’t break a Senate filibuster, Hillary Clinton sought to tackle health care reform piece by piece, including expanding health insurance for children. "In 1997, Congress passed the Children's Health Insurance Program, still an important part of President Obama's Affordable Care Act. It insures more than 8 million kids," Clinton said in his speech at the second night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. "There are a lot of other things in that bill she got done, piece by piece, pushing that rock up the hill." We will fact-check Hillary Clinton’s role in expanding health care for children. Children’s Health Insurance Program We have previously rated a few claims related to her role in the Children’s Health Insurance Program, known as CHIP. Some claims have been more careful in their wording about her role than others. We could not reach a Bill Clinton spokesman, but we previously interviewed a Hillary Clinton spokesman on the same topic. The CHIP program provides health care coverage to more than 8 million children, according to Medicaid. Created in 1997, when it was known as the State Children's Health Insurance Program, it promotes health coverage for low-income children by providing federal funding to states. The late-Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass. received much of the credit for CHIP, because he shepherded the legislation through a Republican-controlled Congress. Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch was the lead Republican cosponsor. In 2007, Kennedy told the Associated Press that Hillary Clinton played a critical role. "The children's health program wouldn't be in existence today if we didn't have Hillary pushing for it from the other end of Pennsylvania Avenue," Kennedy said. Nick Littlefield, a senior health adviser to Kennedy at the time, agreed. "She wasn't a legislator, she didn't write the law, and she wasn't the president, so she didn't make the decisions," Littlefield told the Associated Press. "But we relied on her, worked with her and she was pivotal in encouraging the White House to do it." Shortly after the legislation passed, the New York Times reported, "Participants in the campaign for the health bill both on and off Capitol Hill said the first lady had played a crucial behind-the-scenes role in lining up White House support." The Washington Post The Fact Checker examined her claim in an ad that she worked with Democrats and Republicans to get the law passed and concluded that was questionable. While she worked behind the scenes on the legislation, the Fact Checker wrote that there was no evidence she worked with members of both parties and instead worked with White House staff and Kennedy’s office -- not Hatch. "The White House wasn't for it. We really roughed them up" in trying to get it approved over the Clinton administration's objections, Hatch told the Boston Globe in 2008. "She may have done some advocacy (privately) over at the White House, but I'm not aware of it. Hatch added "I do like her," referring to Hillary Clinton. "We all care about children. But does she deserve credit for SCHIP? No -- Teddy does, but she doesn't." Our ruling Bill Clinton said Hillary Clinton sought to expand health care piecemeal including the "Children's Health Insurance Program." Clinton did work behind the scenes to create the program to offer healthcare to children. He avoided specifying how much credit she should get for that and whether she worked with both parties to make that happen.

pomt-07969	The governor has made a "commitment to billions of dollars in debt and new spending without any explanation of how he plans to pay that money back."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2011/jan/21/brian-moran/democrat-brian-moran-says-gov-bob-mcdonnell-has-no/	For the better part of a decade, the General Assembly has been stalled in debate over how to fund Virginia’s growing transportation needs. The Senate has largely argued the state needs to dedicate new long-term revenues, such as a gas tax increase, to building roads. The Republican majority in the House has stood steadfast against tax hikes, insisting that the state scrape up transportation money by borrowing, earmarking budget surpluses during good years, increasing traffic fines and fees and a blend of other ideas. The fight may return as the main event in this winter’s General Assembly session. Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, has proposed accelerating a borrowing plan approved in 2007, saying he wanted to issue $600 million in bonds annually over three years instead of $300 million annually over six years. And it didn’t take long for Brian Moran, chairman of the state Democratic Party, to attack. Moran, in a statement released after the governor’s State of the Commonwealth address on Jan. 12, argued McDonnell has made a "commitment to billions of dollars in debt and new spending without any explanation of how he plans to pay that money back." No explanation? We decided to check that out, particularly because PolitiFact Virginia discussed a payback plan in a Dec. 30 article. After a quick search, we found our answer. The Virginia Transportation Act of 2000 created the Priority Transportation Fund to help the state borrow money for roads, rail and public transportation. The bill directed that one-third of the state’s revenue from insurance premium taxes go into the fund. That portion is roughly equal to the fraction of auto insurance premiums compared to total insurance premiums each year. A 2007 transportation bill again placed one-third of the insurance premium tax revenue in the fund. Moran, who represented Alexandria in the House from 1996 to 2008, voted for both of the bills. McDonnell noted that fact when he introduced his stepped-up borrowing plan on Dec. 8. Moran e-mailed his statement saying McDonnell has offered no pay-back plan on Jan. 12 at 9 p.m. That was more than an hour after McDonnell completed his address to the legislators, saying the Virginia Department of Transportation "already has the money necessary for debt service from the insurance premium tax you approved in 2007." When we called Moran, he acknowledged the governor would be accelerating the debt issuance "as long as the premium revenue is sufficient to pay." Ric Brown, the state’s secretary of finance, told us that one-third of the insurance tax premium will net about $131 million for the 2011 budget year, up from $128 million in 2010. That should more than cover the accelerated borrowing, he said. When the state last borrowed for roads, in the spring of 2010, Brown said the bonds carried a 3.2 percent interest rate over 25 years. For every $100 million borrowed, he said, the state pays $3.2 million per year to cover interest and about $1.8 million in principal payments. So each year the state is paying about 5 percent of the bond’s total cost. Brown said interest rates for Virginia’s debt are similar to the ones seen last year and have hovered between 3 percent and 3.5 percent for the past several months. Let’s say Virginia issues $1.8 billion in 25-year bonds at the high end of that range, paying a 3.5 percent annual interest rate. When the interest and principal payments are combined, the state would be paying roughly 5.5 percent of the total bond value in annual payments. Our calculator shows the debt would cost Virginia $99 million a year. That’s well below the $131 million in revenue received from the insurance taxes. And during the first two years the state would pay less, of course, because the entire $1.8 billion in debt would not have been issued. Let’s review. Moran said the governor made "a commitment to billions of dollars in debt and new spending without any explanation of how he plans to pay the money back." With little effort, we found the explanation in five places easily available to Moran before he made his statement: the two bills voted for as a legislator; the governor’s written talking points when the new borrowing plan was announced; the governor’s State of the Commonwealth address; and at least one newspaper story. When we called Moran, he didn’t try to defend his claim. It’s absurd for Moran to say he was in the dark. We rate his claim: Pants on Fire.

pomt-05718	Says opponent Beto O’Rourke "wants to legalize drugs."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/mar/07/silvestre-reyes/silvestre-reyes-says-challenger-favors-legalizing-/	A video posted by U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes of El Paso opens by showing a silent, grim-faced child. His image is followed by other kids individually saying "no." The words flash on screen: "Beto O'Rourke," challenging Reyes in the 2012 Democratic primary, "wants to legalize drugs." "Legalizing drugs is not the answer," a narrator says. "Even our children understand." Does O’Rourke, a businessman and former member of the El Paso City Council, want to legalize drugs? Marijuana, certainly, we learned. But a news article in the Feb. 28, 2012, El Paso Times quotes O’Rourke saying he has not advocated the wholesale legalization of drugs. The article quotes Reyes defending his ad by pointing to a book and a 2011 San Antonio Express-News op-ed column that O’Rourke co-wrote with Susie Byrd, a member of the El Paso City Council. Their Dec. 4, 2011, column says the prohibition of marijuana has resulted in a lucrative but violent marijuana economy entwining Mexico and the United States. "Mexican drug cartels smuggle many things into the U.S., but marijuana is the most profitable portion of the cartel's portfolio," the column says. "Marijuana has the larger customer base with the most stable demand and steady prices. And, the Mexican cartels own the value of the marijuana from farm to market." El Paso, the column continues, "bears daily witness to the violence that the marijuana economy inflicts on Juarez, our neighbor on the U.S./Mexico border. Since 2008, more than 9,000 people have been murdered in Juarez. The violence stems at least in part from a declared war between the two largest cartels for control of the El Paso/Juarez trade corridor." Meanwhile, they write, Americans, including high-school students, continue to use marijuana. "At some point, we must challenge our elected leaders to enact laws that reflect reality," the column says. "We must come to a reckoning, much the same way we did 80 years ago, and repeal a prohibition that does more harm than good. If Washington won't do anything different, if Mexico City won't do anything different, then it is up to us — the citizens of the border who understand the futility and tragedy of this current policy first hand — to lead the way." In December 1933, the federal prohibition of the manufacture, sale and transportation of alcoholic liquors, which had been in place since early 1919, was repealed on ratification of the 21st Amendment to the Constitution. Alcohol consumption had persisted in the intervening years while federal efforts to enforce prohibition cost 150 lives and billions of dollars, according to a December 5, 1933, New York Times report. We did not track down O’Rourke’s just-published book, "Dealing Death and Drugs, the Big Business of Dope in the U.S. and Mexico." But we noticed the subtitle underneath the title on a portion of a Kindle version of the book: "An Argument to End the Prohibition of Marijuana." A Nov. 21, 2011, El Paso Times news article about the book quotes O’Rourke opining on possible benefits from legalizing marijuana: "We can do a much better job of keeping marijuana out of the hands of kids and keeping marijuana proceeds out of the hands of cartels that use those proceeds to murder, kill and terrorize with impunity, corrupt public officials, recruit people and arm themselves." Reyes also has offered as backup for his claim a resolution supported by O’Rourke when he was on the El Paso City Council. According to a news account on newspapertree.com, an online El Paso newspaper, the council in January 2009 unanimously endorsed the resolution, which included language added at O’Rourke’s suggestion urging the federal government to come to the aid of bordering Juarez by "supporting an honest open national debate on ending the prohibition on narcotics." The story says Mayor John Cook later vetoed the resolution, saying that as amended, it would not be taken seriously in Washington. O’Rourke, talking to reporters about the resolution before the veto, said: "I’m not advocating legalization, but I’m saying that we should at the very least have a conversation about ending prohibition. And that it is looking like one of the more attractive solutions out there right now to an otherwise intractable problem that’s getting worse by the day." He added that the nation needs to rethink its drug war, which is "not working." After declaring his House candidacy, O’Rourke defended the resolution in what appears to be a classroom speech, according to an undated video of his remarks brought to our attention by Reyes’ campaign. In the recording, O’Rourke recaps his rationale for advocating the resolution and says that he said at the time that "given what’s going on in Juarez, given what’s at stake, I think that we owe ourselves an honest and open conversation about our drug laws and potentially, potentially, ending the prohibition on these drugs -- namely and most importantly marijuana." Reyes’ campaign also pointed out a "declaration" presented by O’Rourke and others at the U.S.-Mexico border on May 17, 2010, bemoaning conditions in Juarez and urging "repeal of the ineffective U.S. marijuana drug laws in favor of regulating, controlling and taxing the production, distribution, sale and consumption of marijuana by adults." In a telephone interview, O’Rourke told us that he favors ending the legal prohibition on marijuana but has not been telling voters he will push such a change. He said that is "not a priority of this community; it doesn’t reflect the desires of people I seek to represent as my constituents." Asked why he doesn’t describe himself as favoring legalization of marijuana, O’Rourke replied: "That word (legalize) is so charged and weighted from years of popular culture references." Our ruling O’Rourke favors ending laws against marijuana and has urged a national conversation about legalizing other illegal drugs. But Reyes’ claim leaves the misimpression that O’Rourke favors legalizing all illegal drugs. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-02823	The Affordable Care Act alters the "sensible doctor-patient-relationship-centered health care program ... we see today."	false	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/24/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-says-fewer-people-will-be-covered-sens/	Any time former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin weighs in on the health care debate, our ears perk up as fact-checkers. The 2008 vice presidential candidate brought us "death panels" (our 2009 Lie of the Year) and helped circulate the inaccurate statement that the Affordable Care Act is government-run health care. On Fox News Sunday, Palin continued her criticism of the law and expressed skepticism that "30 million more people will receive health care coverage under Obamacare." Palin then made a bold statement regarding the health care law and the doctor-patient relationship. "There will be fewer people being covered under a sensible doctor-patient-relationship-centered health care program under Obamacare than what we see today," she said. "I guarantee you that." That sounds like other statements PolitiFact has checked in the past. We decided to investigate. Government, health care and you We reached out to Palin’s camp in hopes she could clarify her statement, particularly what she meant by a "sensible doctor-patient-relationship-centered health care," but she didn’t get back to us. It sounds like previous claims made by the law's opponents, namely that Obamacare puts the government between Americans and their doctors. In the past, PolitiFact said that assertion was False. The health care law overwhelmingly relies on the private sector to provide coverage to the millions of Americans currently without health care by offering subsidies to help people obtain private insurance. There is an expansion of Medicaid, but reliance on that joint federal-state program has shrunk as several Republican governors have chosen not to increase their Medicaid rolls. Obamacare primarily sets guidelines for minimum coverage of care and created marketplaces for plans to be bought and sold to the uninsured. As PolitiFact noted when former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said last year that "Obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor," if that were the case, we would expect doctors to be up in arms. Instead, the American Medical Association, the largest doctor advocacy group in the country, has been supportive of the law. There are other instances when the federal government seeks to improve overall quality of care through bureaucratic means. In 2020, for example, a 15-member panel called called the Independent Payment Advisory Board can recommend changes in reimbursement rates and other cost-saving measures for Medicare. Some have said this will lead to rationing, but we have repeatedly found those concerns exaggerated. Recent reports Now, there are recent reports that insurance companies are shrinking their networks, including excluding certain hospitals from coverage. This is particularly the case for insurance plans sold on the new state and federal marketplaces created by Obamacare. In certain instances, as noted by the Washington Post, it has meant some families forced to change doctors or purchase more expansive, and expensive, plans outside the government-run insurance marketplaces. The limitations are happening in attempts to keep costs down. One insurance company, Anthem, told the Post "the network still covers 74 percent of all primary-care providers and 78 percent of specialists," and the smaller networks would drive down the cost of their plans. Some of this maneuvering was going on for years, and a trend already taking place in the industry may have just been accelerated by the law. In the spring of 2011, the Los Angeles Times reported that insurance companies in California offered a narrower list of providers to thousands of customers. So there is some volatility in the market, and that will continue to be the case as doctors, patients, insurance companies and regulators adjust to changes in the law and the massive amount of new customers now buying insurance. Our ruling Palin said the health care law changes "a sensible doctor-patient-relationship-centered health care program." It's valid to be worried about people potentially seeing changes in their coverage, including some people who will be forced to switch doctors. But that’s a far cry from Palin’s actual words, which suggest some sort of government intervention in the doctor-patient relationship. That's not the case. We rate Palin’s statement False.

pomt-15314	"Obama keeps talking about getting rid of all nuclear weapons. He’s already significantly reduced our capabilities there."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/17/dick-cheney/cheney-obama-wants-get-rid-all-nuclear-weapons-has/	Fox News host Sean Hannity found a partner in outrage over the Iran nuclear deal in former Vice President Dick Cheney. On July 14, the pair blasted the White House’s agreement (full text) as a betrayal of Israel, saying the agreement had loose restrictions on Iran that will endanger the world. At one point, Hannity asked Cheney if he thought the deal would incentivize other countries, such as Saudi Arabia, to move forward with their own nuclear programs. Cheney said he would be surprised if they didn’t because they will feel "they have no choice." The United States under President Barack Obama is no longer an ally they can trust, he said. "For one thing, we haven’t kept our word to them in the past," Cheney said. "Secondly, we’re dramatically reducing our own capabilities. Obama keeps talking about getting rid of all nuclear weapons. He’s already significantly reduced our capabilities there. This last week, he announced a 40,000-man reduction in the United States Army. He’s not a man of his word." When we looked into Cheney’s characterization of the U.S. nuclear program under Obama, experts called it "ridiculous" and said that Cheney neglected important caveats Obama gave in talking about his dream for a world free of nuclear weapons. (PunditFact tried to reach Cheney through his speaker’s bureau, but he did not respond to our inquiry.) Here’s what’s missing from Cheney’s claim that Obama "keeps talking about getting rid of all nuclear weapons" and is "significantly" reducing the country’s nuclear capabilities. ‘A world without nuclear weapons’ Obama entered the White House in 2009 having made a slew of campaign promises about reducing the nuclear arsenal of the United States and the world. (Several of these promises have been monitored by PolitiFact.) The Norwegian Nobel Committee highlighted his "vision of and work for a world without nuclear weapons" in awarding Obama the 2009 Peace Prize. The award followed Obama’s major speech on how he would address nuclear weapons in Prague on April 5, 2009. The new president said the United States had a moral responsibility to act on reducing the threat of nuclear weapons in the 21st century as the only country to have used nuclear weapons. Obama said: "So today, I state clearly and with conviction America's commitment to seek the peace and security of a world without nuclear weapons." Bingo for Cheney? Not necessarily. There was more. "I'm not naive. This goal will not be reached quickly –- perhaps not in my lifetime. It will take patience and persistence. But now we, too, must ignore the voices who tell us that the world cannot change. We have to insist, ‘Yes, we can.’ Now, let me describe to you the trajectory we need to be on. First, the United States will take concrete steps towards a world without nuclear weapons. To put an end to Cold War thinking, we will reduce the role of nuclear weapons in our national security strategy, and urge others to do the same. Make no mistake: As long as these weapons exist, the United States will maintain a safe, secure and effective arsenal to deter any adversary, and guarantee that defense to our allies –- including the Czech Republic. But we will begin the work of reducing our arsenal." Obama reinforced his dream in a 2012 speech in Seoul and a 2013 address in Berlin. In the latter speech, he told the crowd: "Peace with justice means pursuing the security of a world without nuclear weapons — no matter how distant that dream may be. And so, as President, I’ve strengthened our efforts to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, and reduced the number and role of America’s nuclear weapons. Because of the New START Treaty, we’re on track to cut American and Russian deployed nuclear warheads to their lowest levels since the 1950s." So Obama had a dream, but it’s one that he couched with a significant caveat. Cheney has a point that a world without nukes is Obama’s end-goal, a position that some conservatives say isn’t realistic because the weapons cannot be uninvented. On the other hand, the United States will not be first to eliminate its arsenal, Obama pledged. Experts told PunditFact this is not a new vision among U.S. presidents. "The goal of working for the elimination of nuclear weapons has been U.S. policy since the Kennedy administration," said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists. "Obama didn’t invent it." At the 2009 United Nations Security Council Summit about nuclear disarmament, Obama quoted Ronald Reagan, who said, "We must never stop at all until we see the day when nuclear arms have been banished from the face of the Earth." While Obama did not reiterate this vision in a White House address or press conference about the Iranian nuclear deal, he did bring it up again on page 11 of his national security strategy paper released February 2015. ‘Significantly reduced’ nuclear capability? Cheney’s second point — that the country’s nuclear weapons arsenal has been "significantly reduced" under Obama — drew more scorn from the experts. "It is clearly incorrect to say that President Obama has reduced the U.S. nuclear weapons capability," said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, which supports reducing American and Russian nuclear stockpiles. "We’d like for him to be doing more, and we’re disappointed that he’s not." In fact, the United States will spend hundreds of billions in the next 10 years to modernize its aging strategic nuclear force, which consists of submarines that launch ballistic missiles, land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, and long-range bombers. Nuclear warheads will also be refurbished, and new and improved facilities around the country will be constructed. In all, the United States will spend about $35 billion a year on these improvements, or $350 billion through 2025, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The current nuclear force is comprised of about 1,550 long-range warheads. As the upgrades began, many supporters of disarmament grew confused about Obama’s shift in nuclear priorities. The New York Times quoted Sam Nunn, a former senator who influenced Obama’s view on nuclear nonproliferation, in September 2014 as saying Obama’s "vision was a significant change in direction. But the process has preserved the status quo." According to Kristensen’s 2014 analysis, Obama has cut the number of nuclear weapons by a smaller percentage than any American president since the end of the Cold War. Obama’s 10 percent reduction over six years trails even George W. Bush’s 50 percent, according to Kristensen. Under the New START Treaty with Russia -- an arms control agreement that was approved in bipartisan fashion by the then-Democratic-led Congress in December 2010 -- the Obama administration has reduced the number of deployed warheads and launchers slightly. Under the treaty, neither country is allowed to possess more than 1,550 nuclear warheads and 700 intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles and deployed heavy bombers equipped for nuclear armaments. "Those are modest reductions that in no way are ‘dramatically reducing our own capabilities,’ " Kristensen said, adding that the policies Obama is pursuing on nuclear weapons have been approved by the United States Strategic Command and the Pentagon. Our ruling Cheney said, "Obama keeps talking about getting rid of all nuclear weapons. He’s already significantly reduced our capabilities there." Since campaigning for office, Obama has frequently mentioned that, in an ideal world, there would be no nuclear weapons. However, Cheney ignores that Obama has consistently acknowledged that this dream may not be achievable in his lifetime, and that the United States won’t give up its nuclear weapon arsenal as long as its enemies possess them. Experts also said Cheney overstates the arms reductions occurring during Obama’s presidency. Reductions are happening under a 2010 treaty with Russia, but the United States is also spending billions on modernizing its arsenal, and it is taking fewer weapons out of service than under any previous president in the post-Cold War age. Cheney’s statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-01383	"Weeks after accepting a quarter-million-dollar campaign contribution" from a hospital board chairman, Greg Abbott went to court against victims of a drug-taking neurosurgeon.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/oct/15/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-says-greg-abbott-fielded-250000-donati/	CORRECTION, 5:22 p.m., Oct. 15, 2014: This story has been amended to remove the incorrect original declaration that the $250,000 donation was given before the suits were filed. According to copies of the filings provided by Zac Petkanas, a spokesman for Davis, one of several suits singled out by Davis as the basis of her ad was filed in January 2014, before the donation the next month. This change led us to change our rating of the statement from Half True. (See the original fact check here.) In a TV ad, Wendy Davis said Greg Abbott took a hefty campaign donation before siding with a hospital against patients injured and killed by a drug-taking surgeon. Davis, the Fort Worth state senator and Democratic gubernatorial nominee, consistently depicts Abbott, the state attorney general and Republican choice for governor, as an unethical insider beholden to powerful interests. The narrator of the ad, titled "Operation," says: "He was a Texas surgeon, performing operations while reportedly using cocaine. Two people died, others were paralyzed. Doctors spoke out," the narrator says, "but the hospital did nothing to stop him. Families and victims sued the hospital. "Then, weeks after accepting a quarter-million-dollar campaign contribution from the hospital's chairman, Greg Abbott got involved, using his office to go to court -- against the victims." Abbott solicited and accepted the donation, we confirmed, and the state intervened in lawsuits pitting patients against the hospital, though he got involved to defend a state law. Senator’s backup By email, Davis spokesman Zac Petkanas said Davis based her claim in part on a July 30, 2014, news story in the Dallas Morning News stating that not long after the chairman of the board of the Baylor Health Care System, which owns the Baylor Regional Medical Center at Plano, donated $250,000 to Abbott’s campaign, Abbott weighed in on federal lawsuits against the hospital where a neurosurgeon allegedly had done damage to patients. News report and interview of donor We confirmed from Abbott’s campaign finance filings with the state and an interview with the board chairman and donor, Temple businessman Drayton McLane, that McLane donated $250,000 to Abbott’s campaign in January 2014. That donation, the News story said, came after McLane gave the campaign $100,000 in 2013. Before the six-figure contributions, the story said, McLane’s biggest donation to Abbott had been $25,000. Abbott’s campaign recorded the $250,000 donation as arriving Jan. 23, 2014 -- the very date one of the relevant federal lawsuits were filed against the hospital. Then again, we realized with a nudge from Petkanas after this article initially appeared, one of the several lawsuits was filed Dec. 27, 2013, weeks prior to McLane's contribution. His $250,000 check, a photo of which McLane’s office emailed to us, was dated Jan. 21, 2014. The News story said Abbott and McLane had each told the paper the two had not discussed the lawsuits. McLane also said he didn’t know about the case before contributing the $250,000, the paper said, and he stressed he had no personal financial interest in the nonprofit hospital system; the chairman’s post is unpaid. By phone, McLane told us he’s known Abbott since before Abbott, originally a Houston lawyer, won election as a Harris County state district judge in 1992 and gave the $250,000 after Abbott asked him for a large contribution. McLane said he hadn’t spoken with the Republican nominee since. Asked what he expected for the eye-catching contribution, McLane said: "I’m not expecting to get anything back. I believe in strong good government. Unfortunately, on both sides, there are heavy contributions." On top of not knowing about the lawsuits described by Davis before making his donation, McLane said, he hadn’t long been chairman of Baylor Scott & White Health, which owns the Plano facility, having become chairman when healthcare systems merged in October 2013; McLane previously chaired Scott & White Healthcare. Abbott in court As noted in the News, the federal suits against the Baylor system and Plano hospital challenge the constitutionality of a state law requiring the plaintiffs to prove Baylor acted with actual intent to harm patients -- which the suing plaintiffs/families call an impossibly stiff burden. Petkanas of Davis’ campaign provided copies of several lawsuits filed on behalf of patients and families, each one alleging a neurosurgeon, Christopher Duntsch, was permitted by the Plano hospital to perform surgeries under the influence of illegal drugs and alcohol, causing harm. Those suits also challenge action by state lawmakers in 2003, while overhauling laws regulating lawsuits seeking damages, to delete a definition of "malice" in the law, hence "eliminating a common-law right arbitrarily in light of the purposes of the statute leaving only an impossible condition before liability will attach," the lawsuits say. A spokeswoman for the attorney general’s office, Lauren Bean, emailed us the state’s nearly identical March 24, 2014, filings in three plaintiff challenges to the law. In the filings, the state said it has a statutory right to intervene in a case when the constitutionality of a state law is at issue. On March 31, 2014, a week after the state filed its request, U.S. District Judge Jorge A. Solis granted the request to intervene "for the purpose of defending the constitutionality of Texas law," Solis wrote. His order said no parties to the litigation objected. It’s undisputed an attorney general may seek to get involved in a federal suit to defend a state law, but some lawyers told us it’s up to the official to do so -- or not. Attorney Kay Van Wey, who represents some plaintiffs in the suits against the hospital, said by email Abbott’s move was unusual and unreasonable, though she didn’t object, she said, because there is no legal way to do so; we didn’t divine what she meant by that. Van Wey further said Abbott "is defending a law that essentially gives immunity to hospitals for credentialing dangerous physicians. The law, as it now stands, denies access to the courts for good, taxpaying Texas citizens, who through no fault of their own, were butchered by a highly dangerous surgeon. "Even if we prove the hospitals were grossly negligent in hiring and retaining a dangerous surgeon," Van Wey said, "...it isn't enough under the current state of the law. In Texas, we have to prove ‘malice,’ meaning we have to prove the hospital had a subjective intent to harm the patient. That is considered to be an impossible standard. It is clearly an erroneous and completely unfair law. He didn't have to intervene in our lawsuits. He chose to." The News story quoted Bean saying McLane’s contributions played no role in his decision to intervene in the suits. Besides, Bean said, the "state is not defending the hospital or the doctor in this case — or their alleged conduct. If the hospital or doctor have violated the law, then they will be held accountable, and nothing in the state’s court filings opposes the plaintiffs," patients and families, "on that front," she said. Bean gave us the agency’s full response sent to the News. In it, Bean said the state "will not be putting on any defense of any action by the hospital or any doctor. The state will not put on any evidence or make any argument whether the hospital’s actions or the doctor’s actions violate the law. The state does not condone, support or defend the actions of the hospital or doctor. The only thing the state will argue is that the law is not unconstitutional." Outside lawyers An Austin lawyer who helped write the 2003 change told us he believes the attorney general was bound to defend the revised law as Abbott is doing. Michael Hull emailed: "The AG intervention is consistent with federal and state law. The AG is defending the constitutionality of a statute. His office has not taken a position on the facts alleged in the petition nor has the AG chosen to defend the hospital or the doctor." Hull later said such constitutional challenges are rare, "but when challenges do occur, it is common for the AG to defend the constitutionality of the statute." Hull and Michael Guajardo, the Dallas president of the Texas Trial Lawyers Association, each pointed out any litigant is required to notify the state of a federal challenge to a state law’s constitutionality We asked if that formal notice touched off Abbott’s intervention. Not so, Bean said, adding the attorney general’s office has no record of receiving the notice, which court filings say was sent by certified mail. Instead, Bean said, Jonathan Mitchell, the state solicitor general, learned of the suits from a March 10, 2014, news story in the Texas Lawyer magazine. Petkanas, told we hadn’t uncovered proof the McLane donation prompted Abbott to enter the lawsuits, said by email the ad didn’t assert a cause and effect -- only that McLane gave his campaign donation before Abbott intervened. Our ruling Davis said that weeks "after accepting a quarter-million-dollar campaign contribution" from a hospital board chairman, Greg Abbott went to court against victims of a drug-taking neurosurgeon. Davis’ statement needs clarification – that Abbott’s intervention was limited to defending the constitutionality of Texas’ tort-reform laws. That makes this statement Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-02129	Says U.S. Senate candidate David Perdue flip-flopped on releasing his tax returns.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/may/09/karen-handel/handel-attacks-perdue-tax-returns/	In politics, being the rich guy can have its advantages and disadvantages. Case in point, Republican U.S. Senate candidate David Perdue, a former CEO of several large corporations who has risen to the top of the polls. He’s portrayed himself as a by-the-bootstraps candidate offended by the ways of Washington, endearing himself to conservatives. Perdue has also spent a lot of his own money on television ads ridiculing his opponents. One of those opponents, former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel, recently challenged her fellow candidates to release their income taxes. A Perdue spokesman called it "voyeurism," and Handel criticized his decision. "David Perdue Flip-Flops Again, Refuses to Release Tax Returns," the Handel campaign said in an April 22 press release. Did Perdue flip-flop? PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d conduct our own audit. When Perdue entered the race in July 2013, Channel 2 Action News political reporter Lori Geary asked him how open he would be about releasing his financial information. "Everything," Perdue said in the interview. "I have no problem in that. … I’m going to be totally transparent." Perdue did not specify whether that included releasing his tax returns. The television report did not say whether he was asked about releasing his tax returns. Four months later, in November, Perdue filled out a financial disclosure report with the U.S. Senate, as required by law. The disclosure forms, though, do not require a candidate to add up his or her entire wealth. The report shows Perdue was a board member of five corporations, collecting nearly $900,000. He held stocks and bonds in about 150 companies. His assets in more than 40 of those companies and entities ranged between $100,000 and $1 million. That doesn’t include the 18 individual retirement accounts Perdue listed in the report and other assets that he and his wife own. A separate report Perdue filed in February shows he owns 2 acres on the wealthy sand of St. Simons Island. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported Perdue’s net worth, after examining his disclosure, at between $11.9 million and $48 million. In recent years, political candidates -- particularly wealthy politicians -- have been pressured to unveil their income taxes in addition to the reports they’re required to fill out. For example, Mitt Romney, the GOP’s 2012 presidential nominee and a former corporate CEO, responded to those demands by releasing his 2011 return and a summary of returns from the prior 20 years. Critics complained the summary didn’t offer enough details about his finances. President Barack Obama’s tax returns are available online dating to 2000. On April 14, the AJC reported Handel was releasing her taxes and encouraged her Republican opponents to do the same in an "effort to promote government transparency." The challenge was seen as directed at Perdue. Two candidates, U.S. Reps. Phil Gingrey and Jack Kingston, agreed to do so. Perdue did not. One week later, on April 21, Handel hammered Perdue, citing the Channel 2 interview. "David fails to realize that this is an election, not an auction, and that he has an obligation to the voters of Georgia to be transparent and forthcoming about the millions of dollars he is spending to try to buy this election," Handel campaign manager Corry Bliss said. "One can only assume that David has a lot to hide since he has changed his mind on releasing his taxes." Perdue campaign spokesman Derrick Dickey countered: "In the time since his first interview as a candidate last year, David has produced detailed personal financial information for the public. After going through that process, at this point it seems that anything more only satisfies some folks’ voyeurism." Perdue’s cousin, former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue, once used a similar line when pressured to release his tax returns. Sonny Perdue said he preferred to release his tax records during campaign season, not while governing. "I think that's an absolutely appropriate thing to do rather than a sort of voyeuristic sort of thing, " Sonny Perdue told the AJC. Brian Galle, a former prosecutor in the U.S. Department of Justice’s tax division, said Senate disclosure reports have information that isn’t included in tax returns and vice versa. The disclosure reports contain information about the assets held by a candidate. Galle said tax returns include potentially embarrassing information, such as whether the candidate has lost money through bad financial dealings and how much money -- or little money -- he or she gave away through the charitable contributions category. Galle, an assistant professor at Boston College Law School, said he believes candidates should release their tax returns to the public. "It ought to be routine," he said. On May 1, the Perdue campaign invited two AJC reporters to look at 10 years of the candidate’s tax returns as part of an article on his business record. It showed Perdue earned $55 million and paid $21 million in taxes, or 38 percent, over that period. Over the 10 years of tax returns reviewed by the AJC, Perdue donated about $1 million to charities, or just under 2 percent of his income. The Associated Press also reported it has looked at Perdue’s returns, along with Gingrey’s and Handel’s. Kingston and Michelle Nunn, who’s leading the polls among Democrats vying for the Senate, have said they would release their returns, but neither has done so. Another GOP candidate, U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, declined, directing reporters to his disclosure reports. Handel campaign spokesman Dan McLagan, noting the Perdue campaign’s initial comments about voyeurism and its subsequent decision to show the candidate’s tax returns, said Perdue had "flip-flopped-flipped." "It’s a high level of difficulty, and I think (Perdue) missed the dismount," McLagan said. To sum up, Perdue agreed to release his financial information when he announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate in July 2013. A few months later, Perdue filled out a federal financial disclosure report. In April, Handel criticized Perdue for not releasing his tax returns a week after she challenged her Republican opponents to do so. Perdue has since shown his returns to the AJC and AP. Perdue did show his returns, but only a few weeks after Handel’s challenge. And a pledge of total transparency means your taxes are open to inspection to the public, not just a few reporters.

pomt-00565	"In Muslim countries, under the Sharia, there is a death penalty for blaspheming Mohammad."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/11/pamela-geller/anti-muslim-activist-pam-geller-says/	In a recent interview on CNN, Chris Cuomo invited Pamela Geller to speak on his show about the recent threats against her life after Geller hosted a cartoon drawing contest depicting the prophet Muhammad. Geller said she decided to hold the contest as a response to the terrorist attack on Charlie Hebdo in France. "They’re just cartoons," Geller said about the contest. "We’re holding this exhibit and cartoon contest to show how insane the world has become — with people in the free world tiptoeing in terror around supremacist thugs who actually commit murder over cartoons. If we can’t stand up for the freedom of speech, we will lose it." The topic of free speech was revisited during Geller’s segment with Cuomo, during which Geller pointed out that free speech is often curtailed in Muslim countries: "In Muslim countries, under the Sharia, there is a death penalty for blaspheming Mohammad." Is that true? Well, yes and no. First, a bit of background on what Sharia law actually entails. The Sharia is tied in to Islamic law as derived from both the Quran and Mohammad’s teachings. Essentially, it translates to the "right path" or "the way." However, as Professor Khaleel Mohammed at San Diego State University pointed out, "that way is not always defined (and can) be considered similar to Jesus saying ‘I am the way, the truth and the life...’ In Islam, the Sharia is this abstract." Stemming from the Sharia are multiple interpretations of this "way," and they are embodied in the fiqh. Geller said that "in Muslim countries, under the Sharia, there is a death penalty for blaspheming Mohammad." In an email interview with PunditFact, Geller elaborated on her statement: "The death penalty can result from blasphemy charges in majority-Muslim countries including Afghanistan, Egypt, Iran, Pakistan (where the death penalty is often enforced against ‘blasphemers’ by lynch mobs), Saudi Arabia, Sudan and Yemen. Kuwait and the UAE recognize Sharia rules for blasphemers, and that can lead to death (too)." To assess Geller’s claim, we turned to the "Compendium of Blasphemy Laws" compiled by the Human Rights First organization, the Library of Congress’ "Laws Criminalizing Apostasy," as well as other sources. We compiled a chart to see how different countries handle blasphemy. Out of 50 countries listed with a Muslim majority, we only found five with definitive state laws stating that in cases of blasphemy against Islam, Allah, or Mohammad, the punishment was death - Afghanistan, Iran, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia, and Brunei. (Brunei’s death penalty against blasphemy will not go into effect until this October.) In addition, another six countries have laws in which death is the punishment for apostasy, or the denouncement of one’s religion. (Since blasphemy may fall under the category of apostasy in some instances, these laws are also included.) These countries are Morocco, Mauritania, Yemen, the Maldives, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar. That’s 11 out of 50 countries. And even in these instances, laws are not absolute. Take Qatar. Under its penal code, apostasy is to be judged according to the Sharia, which states that the punishment is death. Blasphemy could also fall under this category. Yet, "Qatar has not imposed any penalty for this offense since its independence in 1971," according to the Library of Congress’ "Laws Criminalizing Apostasy." Other countries are even more clear. In Tajikistan, with a Muslim population of 96.7 percent, the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion and speech. While not many countries on the list go so far as to guarantee these rights, the majority do not have capital punishment officially listed for either blasphemy or apostasy. In many instances, when individuals are killed for either of those crimes, it is through extrajudicial means. Private citizens, and not the state, kill people they believe committed blasphemy or apostasy. "Remember, (when we hear) about ‘Islamic law,’ it often has little to do with actual Islamic law... in fact (these ‘laws’) are on-the-spot creations of warlords," Mohammed said. The majority of countries who have laws detailing punishment against blasphemy or apostasy have either imprisonment or a fine, and not death, as the worst outcome. Our ruling Geller said that "in Muslim countries, under the Sharia, there is a death penalty for blaspheming Mohammad." At best, that is an overgeneralization. Yes, there are countries who prescribe the death penalty, and they often do cite the Sharia as the cause for it. But out of 50 countries with Muslim majorities, there are only 11 where this is in some way sanctioned by state law. In addition, not all countries with the death penalty use it. The death penalty is not applied universally, and can be mitigated in cases when the accused repents. Geller’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context. We rate her statement is Half True.

pomt-05584	Says "today unemployment has been running near 12 percent or more for the last four years" and the Legislature hasn’t done much to lower it.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/apr/02/tim-knopp/how-much-oregon-legislature-blame-deschutes-county/	Former House Majority Leader Tim Knopp, R-Bend, surprised hobby political watchers on filing day when he announced he’d take on fellow Republican and state Sen. Chris Telfer, R-Bend, for the Central Oregon district. Knopp left the Oregon House in 2005, after serving three terms. He said that when he left the Legislature, the state, and Central Oregon, were in much better shape. For example, unemployment in the area was 6 percent. "Today unemployment has been running near 12 percent or more for the last four years and the Legislature has stalled on critical job legislation, additional PERS reforms, school choice expansion, and efforts to protect small businesses, seniors and veterans," Knopp writes on his campaign website. On one level, this is a statement of fact. When Knopp left the House, unemployment was much lower. On another level, he’s criticizing his opponent, Telfer, for failing to do anything about unemployment. Is that fair? How much of the high unemployment can be blamed on the Legislature? On the flip side, can he take credit for lower unemployment? In a phone interview, Knopp confirmed he is calling out the Legislature and, specifically, Telfer, for failing to focus on jobs. Knopp criticized Telfer for running for state treasurer after winning her state Senate seat in 2008; there wasn’t much jobs action in 2011, he said, and just a little more in 2012. "There are 27 counties that are doing better than Deschutes County right now," Knopp said. "We need to do better and the focus needs to be on jobs, and that’s a good portion of why I’m running." Senate District 27 is wholly within Deschutes County. Central Oregon includes Deschutes, Jefferson and Crook counties. You can see by the unemployment numbers that Bend/Deschutes suffered during the recession. 2005 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Bend area 6.1 4.5 6.2 12.7 14.3 13.9 11.6 Oregon 6.5 5.1 5.2 9.9 11 9.9 8.8 Knopp is correct that when he left office in January 2005, unemployment for both Bend and Deschutes County were at 6 percent. Jobless figures started creeping up in 2008. The recession officially started in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. Oregon tends to lag the nation in downturn and recovery. Knopp is largely correct in saying that in Deschutes County, unemployment hovered at 12 percent or more for the last four years. (We will give him the 11.6 percent in January 2012, although we should note that it’s dropped to 11.3 percent in February 2012.) But again, just how much sway do state legislators have in the face of a global recession? We turned to the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis, where they have a good description of the region’s economic history. Basically, Central Oregon has enjoyed large growth. Employment grew 4.8 percent per year, on average, from 1983 through 2007. By contrast, Oregon grew 2.4 percent per year. The region benefited from more people moving in and a boom in housing. Then the bubble burst, spectacularly. Tom Potiowsky, who did two tours as Oregon state economist, says Deschutes County was caught up in the national housing frenzy. Home prices soared. Anyone could get a loan, with hardly any credit. He doesn’t know how legislators could have foreseen that and stopped the building boom -- or, in the aftermath, shed the oversupply of homes. "Deschutes County was probably one of the hardest hit counties in the housing problem," he said. Richard Read, a reporter at The Oregonian, wrote in May 2009 of Bend’s rise and fall: "Fair or not, Bend -- the nation's sixth-fastest-growing metro area early this decade -- soared the highest and crashed the hardest of any community in Oregon. The city's volcanic housing market of just a few years ago has collapsed into a sea of foreclosures, bankruptcies and plant closures." Here’s the evidence. Residential construction permits went from 922 in 2005 to 220 in 2008, and to 97 in 2010, according to Deschutes County. Carolyn Eagan, regional economist with the employment department, says that the jobless rate peaked in 2009, "but we still have a lot of people who were unemployed in fields that were related to housing that continue to look for work." We’re not sure what the Legislature could have done. Certainly some lawmakers, including Knopp, will argue that they could have done something to buck up the area. Knopp was in office during the 2001 recession. Unemployment crept up to 8.2 percent in Bend, but Oregon’s economic analysts say that recession didn’t affect the area that much. "Both the 1990 and 2001 recessions had little net impact on local employment, partially due to continued strong population growth and also the industrial structure … However the collapse of the housing bubble brought extreme levels of job loss to the region." In 2010, PolitiFact Oregon analyzed a similar claim by then-GOP gubernatorial candidate Chris Dudley, who said that unemployment rose 65 percent under the watch of former Gov. John Kitzhaber. We found that while Kitzhaber didn’t help the situation -- businesses could have used help navigating land-use regulations -- there wasn’t much a governor could do about the 2001 recession. (We gave it a Half True.) We think the same way here. Knopp appears to be as responsible for a 6 percent unemployment figure as Telfer is for a 12 percent unemployment rate, and that’s not very much. His figures are correct, making the statement partially accurate, but there’s important information missing: The context of a global recession. We rate the statement Half True.

obry-00038	Incumbent Republican Senator Rob Portman is continuing to apply pressure to former Democratic Governor Ted Strickland in the Ohio Senate race. In a recent Facebook post on his campaign’s page, Portman made numerous claims pertaining to the effectiveness of Strickland’s political history. “After 12 years in Congress, Ted Strickland was ranked as one of the most absent and ineffective members of Congress and never authored a single bill that became law. Under Governor Ted Strickland, Ohio lost over 350,000 jobs and ranked 48th in job creation,” said Portman. Strickland served as the representative for Ohio’s 6th Congressional District from 1993-94 and 1997-2006. According to GovTrack — a nonpartisan, open data website that tracks the work of the U.S. Congress — from January 1993 to December 2006, Strickland missed 364 out of 6,954 roll-call votes. Strickland missed 5.2 percent of the votes held during his congressional career, noticeably worse than the 2.9 percent lifetime average among all the representatives serving during December 2006. 	verified	https://observatory.journalism.wisc.edu/2016/11/29/portman-claims-strickland-ineffective-in-congress-as-governor/	None	None	None	Max Beyer and Riley Vetterkind	None	Portman claims Strickland ineffective in Congress, as governor	November 29, 2016	None	['Ted_Strickland', 'United_States_Congress', 'Ohio', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Congressional_district']

pomt-12646	"More than half of Planned Parenthood facilities are in rural or medically underserved areas."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/24/carolyn-maloney/ny-rep-maloney-most-planned-parenthood-clinics-are/	During debate on the Republican health care bill, U.S. Rep. Carolyn Maloney, D-N.Y., spoke passionately about the impact it will have on women’s health and especially on Planned Parenthood. "We all know by now that the recent CBO analysis has bad news for millions of Americans, but it has some especially bad news for women," Maloney said on the House floor on March 16, 2017, the same day that the House Budget Committee approved the bill. "The GOP plan makes Planned Parenthood ineligible for any reimbursement from Medicaid or Medicare for one entire year," Maloney said. "More than half of Planned Parenthood facilities are in rural or medically underserved areas." Maloney was right that the bill restricts funds for Planned Parenthood. The American Health Care Act has a provision that won’t allow states to use direct spending of federal funds on prohibited entities. Planned Parenthood is a prohibited entity under the bill because it is a provider that is "primarily engaged in family planning services, reproductive health and related medical care" or "provides for abortion" in any situation besides saving the life of the mother, incest or rape. We were intrigued, however, by the claim that half of Planned Parenthood facilities are in rural or underserved areas. It’s a tricky thing to measure, but the evidence suggests the claim is sound. Our research Maloney’s spokeswoman Jennifer Bell pointed us to data from Planned Parenthood’s website. Statistics there show that 54% of Planned Parenthood facilities are located in health professional shortage areas, rural or medically underserved areas. This percentage was calculated by the Health Resources & Services Administration Shortage Area Database system. The HRSA is an agency of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The HRSA's programs help provide health care to people who are geographically isolated, or economically or medically vulnerable. The agency identifies areas where health care is difficult to come by. Planned Parenthood matched up their locations to the HRSA data. Mark Holmes, an associate professor in health policy and management at the University of North Carolina, told us the government system of identifying underserved areas is reliable. "The HRSA database for shortage areas is pretty accurate. In terms of additional context, there are multiple types of shortage areas," he explained. Holmes said some shortage areas are designated as a "population" shortage area. "This area is okay in general, but for certain kinds of populations, they may have a tough time getting the care they need," he said. He used an example of "low-income" populations. "Medicaid beneficiaries may live in an area with lots of providers, none of whom take Medicaid, so then although it looks like the area is well-served, there is actually a considerable shortage," Holmes said. "In Planned Parenthood’s case, I don’t think that is a problem because so many of Planned Parenthood’s clients are lower income, according to their data." We ran this by two other health care experts, and they said that the claim was accurate. Our ruling Maloney said, "More than half of Planned Parenthood facilities are in rural or medically underserved areas." That claim is supported by data from Planned Parenthood and the federal health care database. Experts familiar with the data told us that there is enough evidence to show Maloney was on target with her claim. We rate this claim True.

pomt-15329	"Limberbutt McCubbins (a five-year-old cat) is a candidate" in the 2016 presidential election.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/14/limberbutt-mccubbins/can-a-cat-run-for-president/	Editor’s note, July 15, 2015, 10:50 a.m.: After we published this report, we received additional details from the Federal Election Commission that may prove a devastating blow to Limberbutt’s fledging candidacy. According to the FEC, Limberbutt must raise or spend $5,000 to be considered an official candidate by the commission. We’ve added that new information to this fact-check. Limberbutt McCubbins is running for president, and the five-year-old feline isn’t pussyfooting around. Besides launching a campaign website and accompanying social media accounts, Limberbutt has caught some media attention (though some seem unaware of his animal nature), nabbed an endorsement, and even inspired a line of campaign swag. "Limberbutt McCubbins is a candidate we can all get behind! Meow is the time!" the kitty’s website announces. After thousands of fact-checks devoted to policy issues and the major presidential candidates, we thought it would be fun to look into how far this candidacy has gone and how far it can go. Registering with the FEC At the time of this report, Limberbutt and 477 others have submitted a statement of candidacy to the Federal Election Commission. So far, the cat has followed all the rules of the election process. Virtually anyone can file the paperwork but only those who have spent or received $5,000 on their campaigns are considered official candidates, an FEC spokesperson told us. These regulations, however, say that they apply to "individuals," not animals. High schooler Isaac Weiss, a friend of Limberbutt’s owner Emilee McCubbins, filed the cat’s statement of candidacy on May 6, 2015. Limberbutt’s a Democrat, and Weiss registered his campaign organization, "The Committee for the Installation of Limberbutt," on the same day. "It only took us about 20 minutes to fill out the forms, which surprised us," Weiss told the Miami Herald. "And it surprised us even more that nobody from the FEC got back to us about Limberbutt being a cat after reporters started doing stories." The FEC is not responsible for checking out a would-be candidate’s qualifications, according to the spokesperson. (We’ll get to this later.) Limberbutt has yet to file the mandatory quarterly report disclosing his receipts and disbursements (neither has Donald Trump). But the form isn’t due until July 15, so "there’s still time," Weiss told PolitiFact. Constitutional requirements Even if Limberbutt complies with election regulations, the question of his eligibility looms. For one, he’s only 5 years old, 30 years too young to run for president. Weiss, for his part, is confident Limberbutt faces no legal hurdles in his bid, claiming that Limberbutt is 36 in cat years. "The Constitution doesn't say it has to be human years," he told the Herald. Unfortunately for Weiss, we found no reliable scientific method for converting cat years into human years nor legal framework allowing the practice. Article II of the Constitution states that "no person" under age 35 who’s not a natural-born citizen can be president. (We’ve looked into the eligibility of Ted Cruz, who was born in Canada.) Does that mean cats are exempt from the age requirement? Probably not, said Michael Gilbert, a professor of election law at the University of Virginia. "In jest, the expression of one thing (persons must meet certain requirements to be president) implies the exclusion of all others (nonpersons don’t have to meet any requirements to be president) — an underage Pakistani cat could win in 2016," Gilbert said. In seriousness, Gilbert is "quite sure that any court that considers the matter will interpret the Constitution to require federal officeholders to be human beings." Constitutional law scholar Sarah Duggin of Catholic University pointed out several other issues with Limberbutt’s candidacy in the text: The 14th Amendment restricts citizenship to human beings; the 25th Amendment stipulates he must be able to discharge his powers and duties to a vice president; and, if Limberbutt is elected, the 20th Amendment gives Congress the burden of handling a situation where "the president-elect shall have failed to qualify." "I suspect that there might also be a strong case for arguing that cats are aliens, and it's very hard to argue that cats are subject to anyone's jurisdiction -- just kidding," she added. In sum, Limberbutt fails to meet the constitutional requirements. Ballot access Historically, at least 33 unqualified candidates have made it onto ballots, experts told us. The requirements for getting your name listed vary from state to state and from the party primaries to the general election. "It’ll be harder to get on the primary ballot than on the general," said Richard Winger, publisher and editor of Ballot Access News. That’s because primary ballots often require would-be candidates to sign a written declaration that they meet the constitutional requirements and/or they are a registered member of the party. General election ballots are often more lax -- some require a few thousand signatures, and others a filing fee. The most crowded presidential ballot (16 candidates) was Colorado’s in 2012, said Winger. He noted that in 1972, the Socialist Workers Party’s underage slate appeared on 20 state ballots. More than 3,000 voters in six states cast ballots for the party’s 2004 presidential candidate, who was a citizen of Nicaragua. If Limberbutt re-declared as a third-party candidate in the general election, he would need 5,000 signatures to appear on the ballot in his homestate of Kentucky. Weiss, the cat’s campaign manager, told us he needs to meet with other members of the organizing committee when the school year starts to determine if they’ll pursue that option. Even if he gets the support, Winger doubts if the Bluegrass State will permit voters to choose Limberbutt in November 2016, and "no court would make them do it." Political animals Limberbutt’s not the first non-human candidate to run for office. In a few local and international elections, some animals have even won. Limberbutt’s most famous predecessor was a boar hog named Pigasus the Immortal, the Youth International Party’s 1968 presidential candidate. Its slogan: "They nominate a president, and he eats the people. We nominate a president, and the people eat him." "Pigasus was definitely satire and fun, and incredible street theater, but there was also a political message of course," said Katherine Sibley, who studies social movements at St. Joseph’s University. "They wanted to show the police, those at the convention, protesters in Chicago and Americans at large, that things had gotten pretty insane and violent in America." No efforts were made to get Pigasus on a ballot that year, as he and supporters were arrested at the Democratic Convention in Chicago. The charges were dropped, and the pig dropped off the radar. Rumors that he had become a meal for the Chicago police have never been confirmed, said Sibley. Limberbutt’s candidacy, meanwhile, was inspired by a more passive form of youth revolt. Weiss and his friends registered the cat after being bored by "what seemed to them like about the umptheenth (presidential) announcement," reports the Herald. Can Limberbutt claw his way to the White House politically? On one hand, he’s effectively polling at the same rate as Democratic rival Lincoln Chafee, and there’s some speculation Bernie Sanders could pick him as a running mate. On the other, we still haven’t heard anything about his economic pawlicy. Our ruling McCubbins, a five-year-old cat, said, "Limberbutt McCubbins is a candidate" in the 2016 presidential election. Yes, this is the first time we're fact-checking a claim made by a cat. (Though we have fact-checked a terrier who supported Mitt Romney in 2008.) Limberbutt’s campaign manager has filed official paperwork, but the FEC doesn’t deem him formally a candidate, because he hasn’t spent or received $5,000. (This is also the case for some human candidates.) Experts told us it’s very unlikely that he’ll appear on any ballots as a candidate, and it’s even more unlikely that his candidacy will stand in a court of law. We rate Limberbutt’s claim Half True.

pomt-07089	Says critics who say he cut Medicaid are wrong; his budget added $1.2 billion to the program	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jun/24/scott-walker/governor-scott-walker-says-critics-are-wrong-he-cu/	Gov. Scott Walker got a friendly reception during a June 21 turn on CNBC’s "Squawk Box," but he was asked to respond to the notion that his budget was balanced on the backs of the poor and schoolchildren. In an exchange with Walker, the show’s co-anchor Becky Quick noted that critics say Walker cut Medicaid-funded health programs by $500 million and public education by $800 million. The Republican governor disagreed, calling the critiques "Madison math" -- his shorthand for common-sense-defying arithmetic. "This budget actually adds $1.2 billion more for Medicaid, to make sure the neediest, the poorest of the poor, seniors, needy families and children are the ones taken care of," Walker responded. He also said his education cuts were offset by employee benefit savings his budget allowed. But even as he spoke, the budget was on Walker’s desk after legislators gave approval to a 2011-’13 Medicaid plan that Walker’s own budget documents had pledged would "reduce expenditures by over $500 million in the next biennium." That sounds like an open and shut case. But, as you might expect, there is more to this story. It’s as much a case of "Medicaid math" as "Madison math." To understand both, you need to remember that Medicaid costs are driven by many factors, from how many people are eligible for the program to the cost of treatment and what recipients are asked to contribute in co-pays. So, when spending adjustments are made, it does not necessarily change the benefits to the individuals. In this case, projections called for a need to spend at least $1.8 billion more in the two-year budget to keep the program running as it currently does. The Medicaid funding gap amplified the size of the overall state deficit Walker said he was facing, but ultimately he did not put all of the money into his plan. The budget Walker introduced did increase baseline spending for Medicaid by $1.2 billion. But it also made cuts -- though little is yet known about their impact on the state-federal program that cares for low-income families with children under 19, the elderly, disabled and others. Charles Morgan, the top expert on health services at the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, explains it this way: "They first fully funded it but then reduced it. It depends on what you are comparing it to, the gross funding or the base. Total funding is up, but there is a funding reduction." Many Medicaid-funded health services are an entitlement, and enrollment soared as the economy cratered. Therefore, the normal "cost to continue" the program would have required an increase of $1.8 billion to $2 billion compared to the $1.2 billion that Walker and legislators added, according to Fiscal Bureau figures, outside analysts and our own calculations. Part of the challenge was that federal stimulus funds for Medicaid have dried up. In the end, Walker, trying to plug that shortfall, won approval from the Legislature for his Health Services Department to find $466 million in budget savings over two years through as-yet-unidentified changes. Many of the changes likely will need approval by federal authorities. Some other states have made or proposed dramatic across-the-board cuts, limited enrollment or dropped certain medical procedures. But it’s not clear yet whether Wisconsin’s actions will go that far, or rely on more cost-sharing by clients, tighter enrollment rules, less money for hospitals, doctors and other health care providers, or other moves. The details will determine which group views the moves as "cuts." The impact of one Wisconsin cost-saving move is clear, however: The budget approved by legislators caps enrollment in Family Care, the long-term care program that gives seniors options rather than nursing-home living. That could save $265 million by blocking new enrollments. Dennis Smith, Walker’s Health Services chief, put it this way after Walker’s budget came out: "Despite a historic 23% increase to the Department's budget, Wisconsin's Medicaid program still faces a serious fiscal challenge over the next two years as we identify over $500 million in cost savings. To meet our goals, and balance the Medicaid budget, we have to find ways to be more efficient and cut costs." In future years, those savings would continue to grow, totaling $1.2 billion in all funds by fiscal year 2016-’17, according to the governor’s original budget plan, which was adjusted only modestly by legislators. How have similar moves been portrayed in the past? Two years ago, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, Walker’s predecessor, made a very similar move -- increasing the Medicaid budget but trimming $600 million from the "cost to continue" price tag. His top budget administrator bluntly called it "cuts of over $600 million to Medicaid." Media accounts called it "cost cutting," as did some major actors in the budget drama, such as the Wisconsin Medical Society. We give a lot of weight to the independent Fiscal Bureau and history. But there are well-informed partisan voices on this topic -- and previous PolitiFact rulings on a somewhat similar claim to consider as well. As we have already seen, "cost cutting" did not equal a real-dollar decrease in Walker’s Medicaid budget proposal. (The 2011-’13 budget, as adjusted by lawmakers, was sent to the governor’s desk on June 16, 2011.) George Lightbourn, a former top administration official under two Republican governors, said the bottom line was the program would receive a big funding increase, a remarkable reality in a budget that made actual deep cuts in other areas. It could only be a "cut" if the state had been in a position to take a business-as-usual approach to the budget -- and it wasn’t, said Lightbourn, president of the conservative Wisconsin Policy Research Institute. Jon Peacock, a Medicaid expert at a liberal advocacy group, the Wisconsin Budget Project, agreed with the Fiscal Bureau -- he said the two statements could accurately co-exist. Peacock said it was appropriate for Walker to use realistic projections of the Medicaid "cost to continue" in his budget -- and appropriate for his budget to be judged on not fully funding that. "As an analogy, imagine that Social Security spending was going to increase by 5 percent because the number of people eligible was increasing 2 percent and the average benefit per person was increasing 3 percent (tied to the cost of living)," Peacock wrote. "If the President or Congress decided to provide a total spending increase of 1 percent, by cutting the benefits by 1 percent, rather than increasing them 3 percent -- lawmakers could correctly argue that they were increasing spending, and seniors could correctly argue that the program was being cut." Finally, we turned to PolitiFact National and PolitiFact state sites, which have dealt with a claims regarding a similar program, Medicare, which like Medicaid is an entitlement program. PolitiFact consistently has rated as Barely True Republican claims that federal health care reforms supported by President Barack Obama and Democrats "cut" Medicare. Here was PolitiFact’s rationale: "It's important to note that the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget. Rather, the bill attempts to slow the program's future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in future spending over the next 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase..." It’s not a totally clean comparison to the Wisconsin situation: Walker’s cut is in two years, not 10, and it’s not clear yet here whether benefits will be cut to get the savings. But it’s in the ballpark. Let’s get to the bottom line. In the wake of his controversial budget proposals, Walker co-hosted a CNBC program and disagreed with a critique that he made cuts to the state’s Medicaid program. Walker ridiculed the idea as "Madison math." Experts are not united on this one, but Wisconsin’s nonpartisan official budget scorekeeper thinks both the cuts and the increase are accurate claims. Media accounts have portrayed past moves as cuts, as well. What’s more, when Walker introduced his budget, he also described the changes as cuts. So, Walker made a generally accurate statement about the increase, but by dismissing the talk of cuts he left out a lot of context and important details on his budget move. That’s a Half True.

pomt-02891	Wendy Davis is "fighting to bring ... Bloomberg-style gun control to Texas."	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/nov/08/greg-abbott/davis-not-pushing-gun-control-bloomberg-has-favore/	Austin political consultant Steven Rivas drew our attention to a claim on a donation web page for Greg Abbott’s gubernatorial campaign saying state Sen. Wendy Davis is "fighting to bring California values to Texas" including "Bloomberg-style gun control." Setting aside how much California agrees with New York’s gun-control advocate mayor Michael Bloomberg, we thought Texans would want to know Davis’ views, as her bid to become governor is the first statewide campaign for the Fort Worth Democrat. Davis hasn’t, so far, focused on gun control in her campaign. Abbott, a Republican who’s served as Texas’ attorney general since 2002, says on his campaign site that he’ll fight federal limits on gun rights. Abbott campaign spokesmen Matt Hirsch and Avdiel Huerta told us by email that Davis, a former Fort Worth City Council member elected to the Senate in 2008, had "voted twice against campus carry," "voted to prohibit gun shows in Fort Worth," supported background checks for gun buyers and had opposed a measure to remove cities’ abilities to restrict guns in municipal buildings; they also provided citations and backup materials. Asked for specifics on "Bloomberg-style," Huerta sent a March 26, 2013, PolitiFact fact-check that said, "Bloomberg is pushing for universal background checks on all firearm purchases." In addition, Bloomberg, a powerful advocate for gun control both locally and nationally, has long urged and in some cases helped enact measures including strengthening punishments for those who illegally possess guns, registering gun offenders and banning military-style weapons. He also focuses on "straw" purchases -- those made by people who intend to re-sell the weapons to illegal buyers -- and has been criticized for his city administration’s sting operations in other states to uncover such transactions. Bloomberg co-founded and co-chairs Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a group that launched a $12 million, 13-state ad campaign March 23, 2013, promoting expanded background checks. Group spokeswoman Erika Soto Lamb told us by email that "Bloomberg-style" could fairly be defined as "common-sense gun reforms that will save American lives by keeping guns out of dangerous hands." Universal background checks -- requiring private sellers everywhere (not just at gun shows) to run background checks -- are a prime example and the group’s priority, she said. Davis on gun shows Hirsch of Abbott’s campaign emailed us citations from news stories saying that as a member of the Fort Worth City Council in 2000, Davis supported making sure all buyers faced background checks at gun shows in city-owned facilities and that she recently told the Texas Tribune she still held that view. A Sept. 11, 2013, Tribune news story Hirsch emailed to us said Davis was a gun owner and quoted her as saying of the gun show restrictions, "I haven’t pursued it as a senator because I know it’s like spitting in the wind" and "But I still believe it’s the right thing. And if I were governor and a bill came to my desk that provided for background checks at gun shows, I would sign that." Hirsch also cited a Sept. 18, 2013, commentary by Georgia writer Brandon Howell, posted on the conservative Daily Caller website, that went further, saying Davis also "sought banning gun shows on city-owned property." A Fort Worth ordinance Davis proposed in 2000 could have barred some gun shows from city property, but was tabled along with a related proposal, according to news stories starting in 2000 about a months-long city government debate on gun control that year. An Aug. 9, 2000, news story in the Dallas Morning News said her ordinance would have placed restrictions on shows "including provisions that would allow only licensed dealers to sell firearms on city premises." According to the story, Davis said that another option was requiring background checks on gun buyers at the shows. A July 19, 2000, News story said Davis also supported the other tabled proposal, a resolution by which the council would have asked the federal government to require background checks of gun show buyers. Bloomberg supports background checks on gun show buyers, evidenced notably when he sent New York investigators to gun shows in states as far away as Nevada in 2006, 2009 and 2011 to find evidence that private dealers would sell to buyers who wouldn’t pass background checks. In a July 25, 2012, fact-check, PolitiFact gave a Half True rating to his claim that "you can sell guns without a background check at a gun show, forty percent of guns are sold that way, same thing on the Internet." Davis on campus carry Legal gun owners’ ability to take their weapons onto college campuses doesn’t appear to be an issue Bloomberg emphasizes, based on our check of the Nexis news archive. Mayors Against Illegal Guns has supported college leaders calling for tighter gun restrictions on campuses nationwide, but doesn’t name the issue among its principles or in the primary categories on its scorecard for lawmakers. New York state bans weapons on campuses. Hirsch, turning to Davis’ tenure as a state senator, cited her 2009 vote against a proposal to allow Texas concealed-handgun license holders to carry handguns on college campuses. That proposal passed the Senate by 20-11 and cleared a House committee, but it died toward the end of the legislative session short of reaching the full House. Hirsch also specified Davis’ 2011 vote on legislation intended to let such license holders carry guns inside campus buildings. Senators including Davis voted 19-11 not to bring the proposal up for floor consideration, and it then died (a similar measure failed to pass in the 2013 session). To our inquiry, Davis campaign spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña told us by email that Davis voted for three pro-gun measures, supported two others and was quoted in a Jan. 13, 2013, Fort Worth Star-Telegram news story as saying, "Americans have the right under the Second Amendment to own firearms, and that is not going to change." Acuña said Davis wants to protect Second Amendment rights on firearms "for honest citizens by assuring that they are kept out of the hands of criminals." One of the Senate votes Acuña cited was related to campus carry issues. In the 2013 session, Davis was among the "yea" votes when the Senate approved, 27-4, a proposal to allow college students with concealed-handgun licenses to store handguns in locked vehicles on campus. The measure became law and took effect Sept. 1, 2013. The Daily Caller item Hirsch provided to us described that as "an easy vote" for Davis because the proposal passed by such a wide margin. Davis told the bill’s author, according to an April 30, 2013, Star-Telegram news story, that "she planned to support his bill but said she wanted his assurance that ‘you will not allow that opening, that broad opening to become a part of what you’re passing out of here today.’ … ‘You understand that there are many of us in the Senate chamber who are concerned about the broader impacts of carrying on campus.’ " The story said Davis later issued a statement saying that "it is important that the local control of colleges and universities over their campuses be preserved with regard to carrying guns on campus." Davis on concealed-carry measures and cities’ abilities to restrict guns Bloomberg and his group have long opposed letting states recognize out-of-state concealed-carry permits. New York City, where Bloomberg is nearing the end of his 12-year stretch as mayor, issues concealed-carry permits in limited circumstances. And Bloomberg favors expanding at least some concealed-carry restrictions; after the Feb. 26, 2012, death of Trayvon Martin in Florida, Bloomberg said in an April 11, 2012, speech at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., that George Zimmerman, who shot Martin, should never have been allowed to carry a concealed weapon because of his legal history. Huerta sent us part of a May 24, 2001, Star-Telegram news story in which council members including Davis "criticized a bill passed by the state Senate that would ... give the Legislature the sole right to regulate whether" concealed-handgun license holders "can take their weapons to such locations as city halls, libraries or parks." The story quoted Davis as saying, "I think it's a terrible idea" and "Once again, it's an example of the state getting involved in an issue that should be within the city's jurisdiction." Acuña cited Davis’ 2013 votes on three measures simplifying the process to get a concealed-carry license. Davis voted for a proposal to prohibit state officials from requiring applicants’ Social Security numbers that became law and takes effect Jan. 1, 2014, and for two measures that became law effective Sept. 1, 2013, cutting the number of instruction hours needed and eliminating the need to take a proficiency test. The Senate approved the measures by votes of, respectively, 25-6, 29-1 and 27-4. Acuña also noted that Davis voted for a measure allowing the state’s attorney general to get an injunction against a city or county that breaks state law by restricting ownership, transport, licensing or other actions regarding firearms, ammunition and supplies. The Senate approved it 24-6; it became law and took effect June 14, 2013. It’s not a new restriction on cities, but rather a specific way to enable the enforcement of existing state law that bars such local restrictions. So is Wendy like Mike? The mayoral group’s spokeswoman named universal background checks as "Bloomberg-like." So does the NRA, it turns out. Spokesman Andrew Arulanandam of the NRA’s lobbying arm told us by phone, "AG Abbott is correct in his assessment," based on Bloomberg’s federal-level push for expanding background checks and Davis’ remarks to the Texas Tribune favoring "background checks at gun shows." At the Texas State Rifle Association, which is affiliated with the NRA, spokeswoman Alice Tripp told us by phone that she agreed with Abbott based on Davis’ 2000 push for background checks at gun shows. "Bloomberg seems to attack firearm ownership in that kind of parental way," she said. Shannon Watts, founder of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America, told us by email her group hopes Davis "will come out in support of common-sense gun reform, including background checks," and said that to her group, "Bloomberg-style gun control" is not a pejorative term. The groups did not have scorecards or endorsements for specific candidates this far ahead of Texas’ Nov. 4, 2014, general election. Our ruling Abbott said Davis is "fighting to bring" "Bloomberg-style gun control to Texas." Like Bloomberg, Davis supports background checks for all buyers at gun shows. She has opposed campus-carry measures, but voted to allow concealed weapons locked in vehicles while warning the author not to take it any farther. She has opposed letting the state tell cities or colleges they can’t regulate guns on their property, but voted to let the state pursue injunctions against cities that overstep limitations currently in state law. She joined most of the Senate in voting for three laws simplifying concealed-handgun permit applications. Davis has taken some actions Bloomberg might approve, and others he might not. However, she doesn’t appear, so far, to be "fighting" for tighter gun control if elected governor. We rate Abbott’s partly accurate statement as Half True.

pomt-03062	The crime rate in some Atlanta neighborhoods has dropped by 35 to 51 percent.	false	/georgia/statements/2013/oct/02/city-atlanta/atlanta-erred-claim-drop-crime/	Atlanta officials had some explaining to do last month when an audit concluded the city mismanaged federal grants designed to combat crime in poor neighborhoods plagued by illegal drug activity. The city disagreed with some of the findings and noted that crime was down significantly in the neighborhoods the program was designed to help. Mayor Kasim Reed’s Office of Communications put out a press release, noting the program had enjoyed some success. "From 2009 to 2013, in the Pittsburgh and Mechanicsville neighborhoods, crime is down 42 and 35 points, respectively. In English Avenue and Vine City, major crimes are down 51 percent and 50 percent, respectively, between 2007-2011," the city said in a press release. PolitiFact Georgia was curious about the numbers. Did crime really drop by these percentages in those neighborhoods, as the city claimed? From 2007 to 2010, the city of Atlanta received slightly more than $1.1 million in U.S. Justice Department grants for its now-defunct Weed and Seed program. The Justice Department questioned the city’s spending of nearly $400,000 in grant money. "Weed" is used to represent the campaign to weed out criminals and drug dealers while "seed" represents the effort to plant seeds of revitalization. "Four elements make up the two-pronged Weed and Seed strategy," the Justice Department said in its report. "Law enforcement; community policing; prevention, intervention, and treatment; and neighborhood restoration." The four neighborhoods that received help from the Weed and Seed program are located on the city’s south side. Pittsburgh and Mechanicsville are located near Turner Field. English Avenue and Vine City are located near the Atlanta University Center and the Georgia Dome. All four neighborhoods have had trouble with crime, drug dealers and mortgage foreclosures. Carlos Campos, a spokesman for the city, agreed to assist PolitiFact Georgia when we questioned the crime numbers and asked for more details. Campos called us back a couple of days after our initial inquiry. He said the city’s numbers in the press release were incorrect. They were way off base for Mechanicsville. Campos sent PolitiFact Georgia a statement with the corrected statistics: Neighborhood Claim Actual Change Mechanicsville down 35% up 35% Pittsburgh down 42% down 37% Vine City down 50% down 44% English Avenue down 51% down 45% Campos said the numbers in the original press release were not vetted with the Atlanta Police Department’s Tactical Crime Analysis unit beforehand. Campos took the blame for the incorrect numbers. "It is worthy to note that major crimes are down for 2011 compared to 2007, collectively, in those four neighborhoods served by Weed & Seed by 21 percent, according to APD’s numbers," the city said in a statement. The city posted the statement and the corrected crime statistics in a news release on its website. Again, the city of Atlanta claimed crime was down between 35 and 51 percent in four neighborhoods that received help from its Weed and Seed program. The decrease in crime was not as great as the city claimed in three of the four neighborhoods. In Mechanicsville, the city said crime had declined 35 percent, but it was actually up 35 percent. Campos conceded the crime stats initially presented to the public and news organizations were incorrect. The crime decrease cited by the city in its original statement was not as dramatic as officials said. The city did issue a follow-up press release with the correct numbers. But that came after the initial, incorrect information was broadcast to the public and only after PolitiFact Georgia questioned the initial numbers. PolitiFact has had others who’ve offered mea culpas when we’ve inquired about the accuracy of their claims. In those instances, PolitiFact will still report our findings and note the speaker admitted to making an error. The city fessed up, but that does not erase the initial error. We rate the city’s initial claim False.	None	City of Atlanta	None	None	None	2013-10-02T00:00:00	2013-09-23	['Atlanta']
pomt-00857	"The stock market has almost tripled since April of 2009."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/17/jim-webb/james-webb-says-stock-market-has-tripled-value-200/	Many Americans believe that the economic recovery has only recently picked up steam. But one group that is widely seen as benefiting in recent years are investors in the stock market. This is a point that former Sen. James Webb, D-Va. -- a potential longshot candidate for president who’s been taking an economic-populist approach -- made during an interview on ABC’s This Week. On the March 15, 2015, edition of the show, host George Stephanopoulos brought up a comment by Webb that "powerful financial interests spending billions to elect people who think the current drift toward a permanent aristocracy is OK." Webb explained his thinking this way: "If you see what has been happening to our country over the past 20 or 25 years or so, with the economic model -- first, the model itself has broken apart. ... The employment model that was based on full-time employment, manufacturing-based, taking care of your working people, (it) fell apart a lot, when the manufacturing sector itself was hurt so bad in the past 20 years. "But the other thing is … if you have capital, if you have assets, you're doing pretty well. The stock market has almost tripled since April of 2009. If you don't -- and this is particularly true right now with the generation that is coming into full adulthood -- they don't have that model anymore. They are doing part-time jobs, consultancy jobs, they've got student loans to pay off." We wondered whether Webb was right that "the stock market has almost tripled since April of 2009." So we looked back at the historical data. First, some background on the stock market. Companies that are publicly traded allow ownership shares to be sold on one of several stock exchanges. The values of a single share can rise or fall over time. Several different indexes are commonly used to measure the overall value of the market. We looked at four: the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is a smaller group of blue-chip stocks; the Standard & Poors 500, which offers a larger and broader mix of stocks; the NASDAQ Composite, which includes a lot of fast-growing technology stocks; and the Wilshire 5000, which includes the broadest list of publicly traded companies. The following table summarizes the growth of these three measurements between April 1, 2009, and today. Measure April 1, 2009 March 16, 2015 Increase (multiple) Dow Jones Industrial Average 7,762 17,977 2.3 times higher Standard & Poors 500 811 2,081 2.6 times higher NASDAQ Composite 1,552 4,930 3.2 times higher Wilshire 5000 8242 21949 2.7 times higher These numbers show that Webb is definitely right for the NASDAQ Composite (in fact, he underestimates a bit) and that he’s just about on target for the S&P 500 and the Wilshire 5000 if you round the figures upwards. Webb’s claim that the stock market "almost tripled" overshoots the increase for the Dow, which is 2.3 times higher now than in April 2009. Still, Lawrence J. White, an economist at New York University’s Stern School of Business, warned that comparisons like Webb’s are sensitive to the choice of start and end dates, among other issues. "For example, if one takes the Dow Jones Industrial Average and instead makes the comparison with its previous high in 2007, the increase is only 25 percent -- not the more-than doubling that occurred from its low point in 2009," he said. "And if one nets out inflation from that 25 percent increase, the 'real' increase in the stock market has been only about half of that increase." Our ruling Webb said that "the stock market has almost tripled since April of 2009." There are different ways to measure "the stock market." For three of the four most common yardsticks, Webb is basically right; for the other one, he’s off base, but not dramatically so. And it's worth noting that the period Webb chose maximizes the increase; a longer time horizon makes the gain more modest. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Jim Webb	None	None	None	2015-03-17T16:13:24	2015-03-15	['None']
pomt-06303	The United States' regulations "are among the most difficult in the world."	false	/florida/statements/2011/nov/16/rick-scott/rick-scott-us-regulations-are-most-difficult-world/	Republican Gov. Rick Scott repeated a familiar politician's mantra when he bashed "overregulation." In a Nov. 14, 2011, press release, Scott criticized President Barack Obama for accusing America of being "lazy" in attracting investment: "Obstacles to job creation in America are a result of policy, not of motivation," Scott said. "Our business taxes are among the highest in the world. Our regulations are among the most difficult in the world. If you need evidence, look no further than the companies who have moved their oil rigs from the Gulf coast to foreign countries in the last year because of the regulatory environment. Just last week, yet another major medical device manufacturer announced they were cutting more than 1,000 jobs because of new Obamacare taxes. "The president's comments indicate a belief that more taxes, more regulation and more government is the solution, yet those are the very things standing in the way of those of us who are trying – very energetically – to recruit businesses and jobs to our states." Scott made a few strongly-worded claims in that statement, but for this Truth-O-Meter we will explore whether "our regulations are among the most difficult in the world." Scott has portrayed himself as a slayer of regulations. He promised to freeze all regulations in Florida during his 2010 campaign. We went in search of data about the U.S. and overregulation. We found several measures that contradicted Scott's statement: • The World Bank publishes an annual "Doing Business" ranking that examines the business climate in 183 countries. In its most recent report, released in October 2011, it gave the U.S. an overall ranking of fourth, behind Singapore, Hong Kong and New Zealand. The U.S. scored particularly high compared to other countries in getting credit (4), protecting investors (5) and starting a business (13). • The conservative Heritage Foundation, together with the Wall Street Journal, publishes an annual "Index of Economic Freedom," which in 2011 placed the U.S. 9th out of 179 countries with a score of 77.8 out of 100. This index looks at several factors including government spending, property rights and business freedom. On business freedom -- on which the U.S. scored 91 -- Heritage wrote, "The overall freedom to create and run a private enterprise, regulated primarily at the state level, is strongly protected. However, new regulatory uncertainty hampers business expansion and employment creation." Heritage's index relies heavily on the World Bank's report. • The libertarian Cato Institute publishes an "Economic Freedom of the World" report that stated that ranked the U.S. 10th among 141 countries in 2009. "The world's largest economy, the United States, has suffered one of the largest declines in economic freedom over the last 10 years, pushing it into tenth place. Much of this decline is a result of higher government spending and borrowing and lower scores for the legal structure and property rights components," the report said. The report shows that "the U.S. is still more free by comparison to much of the world," said Ian Vásquez, director of the Cato Institute's Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity, in an e-mail to PolitiFact. "But that measure only captures regulations that can be compared across countries and misses a lot. There is no good global index on this issue. Bottom line, the statement is probably true about some regulations, but not overall in the world." What experts told us We sent Scott's claim -- and the examples he cited about oil rigs moving overseas and job cuts at a medical manufacturer -- to several experts. (Scott's press release didn't identify the medical manufacturer.) None of them fully defended Scott's statement that the United States' regulations are among the most difficult in the world. Several referred us to the World Bank report we mentioned above, while others warned that comparing regulations among countries can be difficult. The U.S.'s ranking "is a far cry from 'most difficult," wrote Lawrence J. White of New York University in an e-mail, pointing to the World Bank ratings. James Gattuso of the Heritage Foundation said that the trends in the World Bank report are mixed for the U.S. and pointed to an Oct. 28 Wall Street Journal report (subscription required to view full article) that said that although the U.S. is ranked fourth, it has dropped in some categories in recent years including on paying taxes and ease of registering property. And the cost of starting a business measured as a percentage of per capita income as well as the cost to import have increased. Paul Portney, an economics professor at the University of Arizona, was chief economist for the White House Council on Environmental Quality in 1979-80 under President Jimmy Carter. He sent us an answer as it pertains to environmental regulations, which is relevant here because half of Scott's evidence cited in his press release related to oil rigs moving from the Gulf to foreign countries due to regulation. "The U.S., like many of the world's developed countries, does have stringent environmental regulations. Ours are in general about as stringent as those in Europe and Japan, though I'd say that Europe's are now tougher than ours. In some respects, though, we go beyond what other countries do (an example is the regulation of auto emissions, though that is more the doing of the State of California than federal standards). Compared to China, India, Russia and Brazil--the rapidly developing countries of the world--our standards are much tougher, and that has no doubt played some role in the relocation of industry to those places. However, you have to remember that there are benefits that accompany the higher costs of regulation in the U.S. My guess is that few Floridians would be willing to tolerate Beijing, Mumbai, Moscow or Rio de Janeiro air quality, to take but one example. ... I'd say that there are other, more important factors that affect business location than regulatory burdens, even while acknowledging that we can and must streamline our regulatory process." Gov. Scott responds Scott spokesman Brian Burgess e-mailed us a response. "I hope you aren’t missing the forest for the trees…but the phrase you have chosen to zero in on is rather vague, not really quantifiable, and simply refers to the difficult long-term outlook that American job creators are facing." Burgess directed us to the Florida chamber's small business survey which stated "The top issues facing Florida’s small businesses continue to include government regulations, access to capital, healthcare, taxes." Burgess also stated in an e-mail that federal regulations have been on the rise in recent years and that thousands more are in the works -- but that wasn't what Scott said. As for the World Bank study, Burgess wrote that the World Bank study notes that it is limited in scope and quoted from the preface: "It does not attempt to measure all costs and beneﬁts of a particular law or regulation to society as a whole. Nor does it measure all aspects of the business environment that matter to ﬁrms and investors or affect the competitiveness of an economy." Burgess concluded: "In short, the governor’s comment is based on his own experience in international business, his conversations with other business owners, entrepreneurs and other job creators in Florida and throughout the world, and the hard data that shows that the U.S. regulatory environment has grown progressively worse in recent years and is projected to continue down that path – an outlook that makes the United States regulatory environment among the most difficult in the world. The statement was worded carefully because the subject matter is difficult to quantify. Even World Bank admits as much." Our ruling Scott said "our regulations are among the most difficult in the world." As his evidence, he cites companies moving their oil rigs from the Gulf Coast overseas and a medical device manufacturer cutting more than 1,000 jobs "because of new Obamacare taxes." Even if some companies move overseas or cut jobs and attribute those actions to overregulation, that doesn't mean that regulations in the U.S. are among the most difficult in the world. The reports we found ranked the U.S. between 4th and 10th for business climate. Scott, along with other political or business leaders, certainly can point to concerns about the number, cost or impact of regulations. But Scott hasn't proven that our country's regulations are among the most difficult in the world. In fact, the evidence we found points in the opposite direction. We rate this claim False.

pomt-13409	Says "Marco Rubio would take away a woman’s right to choose for victims of rape or incest."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/sep/23/patrick-murphy/rubio-would-not-allow-rape-or-incest-exceptions-ab/	U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy said Sen. Marco Rubio has a zero-compromise position on abortion. In a new campaign ad that started appearing Sept. 20, 2016, Murphy’s campaign said Rubio, the Republican incumbent, refuses to give ground on the issue, even in extenuating circumstances. "Marco Rubio would take away a woman’s right to choose for victims of rape or incest," the ad said. It included video of Rubio saying, "I don’t require there to be an exception for rape or incest." Murphy has faced criticism that he’s a conservative in Democrat’s clothing, so his ad touted his own support for abortion. The ad goes on to say Rubio wouldn’t allow the procedure for pregnant women with Zika. Rubio has previously confirmed he would oppose allowing a woman who has contracted the virus to abort a fetus that potentially had severe microcephaly. He said he preferred "to err on the side of life" rather than allow the procedure. But what has Rubio said about allowing exceptions for rape and incest victims? We checked his record and found that even though Rubio strongly opposes abortion, his stance on granting exceptions is a bit more nuanced than Murphy described. Rubio’s record Rubio’s history against abortion is well documented. He has advocated for further restrictions on abortion, including banning the procedure after 20 weeks of pregnancy. But allowing abortions for rape and incest victims is a trickier subject, which came up while Rubio was running for the GOP presidential nomination. During an Aug. 6, 2015, Republican debate in Cleveland, Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly pointed out Rubio favored a rape and incest exception to abortion bans, which Rubio refuted. "I have never said that. And I have never advocated that," Rubio said. "What I have advocated is that we pass law in this country that says all human life at every stage of its development is worthy of protection. In fact, I think that law already exists. It is called the Constitution of the United States." Rubio reiterated this view after that debate on Glenn Beck’s radio show, saying he personally supported banning abortion unless the mother’s life was endangered. "Now I recognize that other people don’t hold that view, and in order to save lives in this country, I have supported bills that had to have exceptions in them," he told Beck. Now back to running for re-election to the U.S. Senate, Rubio has supported legislation that contained rape and incest exceptions at least twice. Back in November 2013, he was one of 40 cosponsors for a Senate bill called the "Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act." The bill, which stalled in committee, banned abortions at 20 weeks or greater but includes exceptions, including rape and incest. Rubio also cosponsored a similar version in 2015 that required adult women to obtain counseling or medical treatment for the rape 48 hours before the abortion, with separate criteria for minors about reporting the rape to law enforcement. We also found examples of bills Rubio supported that did not appear to contain a rape exception. In 2000, then-state Rep. Rubio voted for a Florida ban on late-term abortions. The original version of that bill didn’t contain a rape exception, though it allowed a doctor to take steps to save the life of the mother. It became law in May 2000, but court decisions ended state enforcement of the ban. Another example is a 2013 U.S. Senate bill Rubio cosponsored that was similar to those earlier proposals but pertained to the District of Columbia. That bill made an exception to save the life of the mother, but not for rape or incest. Rubio’s own "Child Interstate Abortion Notification Act," which he introduced in 2015, would have made it illegal for a minor to cross state lines for abortions to get around parental notification laws. Rubio’s bill included an exception in order to save the mother’s life, but not if the mother was a victim of rape or incest. Recent rhetoric Rubio’s clear preference is that an abortion not be performed, but he is willing to support anti-abortion legislation that includes an exception for rape and incest. He says as much in the very soundbite Murphy’s ad uses. The clip is from a November 2015 event with pastors in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. If you review it in full context, Rubio says he prefers essentially all abortion to be illegal, but is willing to vote for legislation containing exceptions. It begins with Rubio stating his position, referring to the aforementioned Cleveland debate (the words plucked out by the Murphy campaign are in bold): "I’ve taken great criticism for it. You know, I stood up on a debate stage and was challenged about the fact that I don’t require there to be an exception for rape or incest, and this is a tough position," he said. Rubio stresses the word "require," and then continues: "And I’ve said, listen, I will vote for bills that have exceptions, because they save lives, and (a) 20-week abortion ban has exceptions. And I’ll vote for anything that saves lives. But I don’t require. That is not a majority position, even in the Republican Party. But I just don’t feel this is a political issue, I really don’t, but I will support those that have exceptions, because I’m in favor of anything that protects life." That same month, he told the Associated Press,"I, as president, will sign a bill that has exceptions," he said. "I've supported bills that have exceptions." Rubio has often repeated similar statements, sometimes turning the subject to falsely accuse Hillary Clinton of supporting late-term abortions. But his Republican primary opponents continued to attack him on the issue into 2016. In February, he told ABC’s George Stephanopoulos that as president, "if they pass a law in Congress that has exceptions, I’ll sign it because I want to save lives." But he still thought the unborn always deserved protection, even in the event of a "crisis pregnancy." Still, he understood that was not the popular position among the general electorate. "That’s why any law that limits abortions that passes will almost certainly have exceptions. And I’ll sign it with exceptions," he said. Our ruling Murphy said, "Marco Rubio would take away a woman’s right to choose for victims of rape or incest." Rubio has been a staunch opponent of abortion for years, but his position is subtly shaded. He thinks abortion should not be allowed unless the mother’s life is endangered. But he is willing to support legislation that contains exceptions allowing the procedure for victims of rape and incest. He has backed measures both with and without exceptions. Rubio has said if he had his way, he’d prefer to ban almost all abortions. But his record shows he’s willing to give at least a little ground on the issue, which Murphy has obscured in his ad. We rate the statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7568d76f-0a7f-449a-9cf5-135c627ee132	None	Patrick Murphy	None	None	None	2016-09-23T06:00:00	2016-09-20	['Marco_Rubio']
pomt-06809	The Republican National Convention "is a Super Bowl times four."	false	/florida/statements/2011/aug/12/reince-priebus/rnc-chairman-says-2012-gop-convention-super-bowl-t/	Just how big of a deal is it that the Republican National Convention is coming to Tampa next summer? Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus tried to put it in perspective while speaking to local reporters on a swing through the area this month. "This is a Super Bowl times four. This is probably the biggest event that the Tampa Bay community has ever put on thus far," Priebus said. The line was something of an exclamation point to Priebus' visit, becoming the focus of a local TV story that aired on Fox and a dominant quote in news coverage offered by CNN, the Associated Press and the St. Petersburg Times. But is it true? PolitiFact Florida decided to fact-check Priebus' claim about national political conventions to see if they are indeed four times a Super Bowl -- an event Tampa is more familiar with having hosted it several times, as recently as 2009. Where to start was aided by the context Priebus provided to reporters. "Estimates are that $175 million outside dollars will be spent here during the convention," he said at one point. And at another time, he said: "There's going to be over 45,000 people here at one time. They're going to be here for over a week every day doing different things in the community -- events, parties, gatherings, fundraisers. It's going to be extraordinary." A note of caution before we go any further. We're typically wary of economic impact studies because they rely on assumptions to reach their conclusions and are often attempting to predict outcomes. On top of that, they're usually paid for by groups with something to gain by presenting the data in one form or another. So, read any numbers with some skepticism. That said, comparing the economic impact generated by a Super Bowl and a national political convention is valid and worthwhile, because you can chart the relative size and scope of one event to the other. The Super Bowl and national political conventions are true mega-events that dramatically impact the local communities where they are held. For a few days, money and people pour into the area. Some of the economic benefits are obvious. Hotel rooms are filled, and hoteliers can charge more for the rooms they rent. Visitors need places to eat and shop, so money is funneled into that sector of the economy. Some rent cars, others ride the Ybor City streetcar. They go to Busch Gardens, or maybe even (who knows?) the Mons Venus strip club. Other benefits are less apparent but equally important. Money is pushed into the local economy, through taxpayer subsidies or private sources, to provide security. Some of that money -- and we're talking millions of dollars -- goes to things like barricades, vehicles and riot gear. Other funds pay for the huge overtime bills police departments will bear. "You try, to the extent possible, to focus on the new spending in a lot of instances," said Patty Silverstein, an economic researcher that attempted to estimate the impact of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in Denver. "To be honest, it can become very difficult. You have to make some very grandiose assumptions." PricewaterhouseCoopers has been attempting to calculate the economic impact of the Super Bowl since 1998. According to its analysis, direct visitor spending has ranged from a low of around $115 million in 2004 in Detroit, to high of $202 million in Dallas in 2011. The analysis is based on the participating teams, the attributes of the local market, national economic conditions and other factors. Other figures, calculated either by the National Football League or the host city often peg the impact even higher -- between $300 million to $400 million, depending on the analysis. A study examining the 2009 Super Bowl in Tampa said it resulted in spending totaling $375 million. Compare that to even Priebus' own figure that $175 million will be spent on the Republican National Convention in Tampa. That would put the convention on par with Super Bowls according to PricewaterhouseCoopers but below a Super Bowl according to the more boosterish figures being created by the NFL and the local host committees. Either way, not four times greater. (A second note of caution about these dollar figures. Boosters describe the millions of dollars spent in the area as "new" money for the community. While that's a difficult figure to pinpoint, an even tougher figure to arrive at is how much money is not spent as a result of a mega-event, mainly by members of the local community who alter their spending habits. Many economists argue those losses negate much of the "new" spending, while others say that the local spending is not lost but merely reshuffled to a different time.) Victor Matheson, an economist at the College of the Holy Cross who has studied the economic impacts of both Super Bowls and political conventions, helped us compare the two events in other ways. More out-of-town visitors come for a Super Bowl, anywhere from 60,000 to 100,000 depending on the estimate, compared to around 50,000 for a convention. But convention guests stay longer, Matheson said -- about six days on average compared to about four, according to information provided by the NFL and a study from The Beacon Hill Institute at Suffolk University. In the end, both events produce roughly the same number of visitor nights (guests multiplied by hotel nights): 300,000. So, not four times greater. And, Matheson said, the spending habits of a Super Bowl visitor and a convention visitor are typically around the same, about $400 a day. Also, not four times greater. The only measure that comes close when considering Priebus' claim is the number of event days -- the Super Bowl is one night, the convention is four. But even that's misleading. Anyone in Tampa, Jacksonville, Miami or any other city to host a Super Bowl knows that the week preceding the game is filled with related events and parties. We reached out to a spokesman for the RNC but did not hear back. Can Priebus claim a political convention is a "Super Bowl times four"? "No, he can't," said Andrew Zimbalist, an economics professor at Smith College. Added Matheson: "By any reasonable estimate the Super Bowl generates roughly the same amount of outside expenditure, so he is way off." We see no reason to disagree. Though you can debate about the overall economic impact of mega-events like the Super Bowl or a national political convention, there's no debate about the relative size of one compared to the other. They're about the same. We rate this claim False.	None	Reince Priebus	None	None	None	2011-08-12T11:42:32	2011-08-03	['Super_Bowl']

pomt-02251	Federal money for Medicaid expansion "is guaranteed for a few years and then goes away."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2014/apr/13/thomas-garrett-jr/state-sen-tom-garrett-says-medicaid-expansion-mone/	State Sen. Thomas A. Garrett Jr. says Uncle Sam is doling disappearing dollars to entice states to expand their Medicaid programs. "This money is guaranteed for a few years, and then goes away," Garrett, R-Louisa, wrote in an op-ed that ran earlier this month in The Free-Lance Star and the Richmond Times-Dispatch. We looked behind the curtains to see if the money really does vanish. Garrett’s claim comes as the General Assembly is locked in a largely partisan debate over expanding Medicaid eligibility to 400,000 additional low-income and disabled Virginians. The stalemate is blocking passage of a two-year state budget. The Democratic-controlled state Senate and Gov. Terry McAuliffe support expansion, saying it will help the needy and most of the cost will be borne by the federal government under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Garrett opposes broadening eligibility, echoing arguments from the Republican-led House that Medicaid already is fraught with waste and that Washington can not be trusted to keep its funding commitment. The expansion would make Medicaid available to people earning up to 138 percent of the federal poverty line, or about $16,104 in a one-person household and $21,707 in a two-person household. So far, 26 states and the District of Columbia have decided to participate. Virginia's average cutoff for adult eligibility is 32.7 percent of the federal poverty line, according to the state's Medicaid agency. That breaks down to annual earnings of about $3,846 for a one-person household and $5,144 for a two-person household. Virginia evenly split its Medicaid costs with the federal government. Obamacare calls for the federal government to pay the entire cost of expansion through 2016. The U.S. match drops to 95 percent in 2017, 94 percent in 2018, 93 percent in 2019 and 90 percent in 2020 and beyond. Why does Garrett say "the money is guaranteed for only a few years and then goes away?" His legislative assistant, Paul Allen, said Garrett was referring to the drop in federal funding for expanded enrollment from 100 percent now to 90 percent in 2020. "While Tom said `it’s guaranteed for a few years, then goes away,’ he means guaranteed full funding with federal dollars," Allen emailed us. "The burden then falls back on Virginia to make up those federal cuts." Garrett did not make that distinction in two references to federal funding he made in his op-ed. In addition to the one we’ve discussed, Garrett wrote that "once the federal money is gone, two things happen: 1) Virginians will have to make up the shortfall and 2) those arguing for expansion will try increasing taxes, doubling down on a broken program." We should note that if Virginia opts for expansion by July 1, it would receive $2.9 billion in additional federal Medicaid money over the next two fiscal years, according to the state's Medicaid agency. Our ruling Garrett wrote that the federal money that’s being offered for Medicaid expansion "is guaranteed for a few years, then goes away." His aide says that Garrett simply means the 100 percent federal match is only guaranteed for a few years. And sure, some money will go away as the U.S. match shrinks to 90 percent in 2020 and beyond under the Affordable Care Act. But Garrett does not make that distinction in his sweeping statement, which he repeats a second time in his column. He creates a misleading impression that Obamacare cuts off all money for Medicaid expansion after states opt to increase their enrollments. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-03826	Wall Street megabanks that received bailouts in 2009 now get taxpayer-funded advantages not available to community banks in Ohio.	half-true	/ohio/statements/2013/mar/20/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-taxpayers-give-big-banks-ad/	Partisan division may be wide in Washington, but bipartisan work does go on. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown was joined by Senate colleague David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, in working on legislation to address the issue of banks "too big to fail." Looking to prevent future economic collapse and taxpayer-funded bailouts, they have pushed the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to detail the annual advantage that such banks continue to receive from the U.S. government. (Brown, Democrat of Avon, chairs the Senate's Consumer Protection Subcommittee of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, and has worked for years on the "too big to fail" issue. Vitter is ranking member of the Economic Policy Subcommittee of the Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs.) "Most Ohioans would be surprised to know that the same Wall Street megabanks which received bailouts from taxpayers in 2009 also receive taxpayer-funded advantages today simply because of their 'too big to fail' status," Brown wrote in a newsletter to constituents. "This," he said, "gives them access to cheaper funding and more favorable borrowing terms than dependable Main Street institutions, like Huntington Bank or the Peoples Bank in Coldwater, Ohio." PolitiFact Ohio admits we were also surprised about the "taxpayer-funded advantages." We asked Brown's office for more information. His press office cited the explicit and implicit guarantee that the megabanks are, in fact, "too big to fail" -- and that the government will step in with a taxpayer-funded safety net during a financial emergency. The expectation of financial markets that megabanks have this government protection against failure is a subsidy that amounts to free insurance, Brown's office said. Because of this insurance, they said, megabanks can borrow money at lower rates than smaller institutions. The sources they cited include a study for the International Monetary Fund, which put the borrowing advantage at about 0.8 of a percentage point; the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, which says "too big to fail" banks enjoy subsidies that may lower their average funding costs a full percentage point relative to smaller competitors; and an analysis by Bloomberg View. Drawing on the IMF research, Bloomberg said the "taxpayer subsidy" for the 10 largest U.S. banks amounts to $83 billion a year. We looked further and found questions about Bloomberg's methodology figuring the size of what it referred to as a subsidy. Determining the size was one of the questions that Brown and Vitter put to the GAO. While its size may be in question, however, the existence of the implicit "too big to fail" guarantee is widely accepted as established fact. "Unsecured depositors and creditors offer their funds at a lower cost to TBTF banks than to mid-sized and regional banks that face the risk of failure," Dallas Fed President Richard Fisher said in Washington in January. What remains unclear from Brown's citations is whether lower borrowing costs for big banks result in any present-day costs for taxpayers. But PolitiFact Ohio did find an economist who contends that by granting the too-big-to-fail guarantees, the government is "giving something away of value" that should be accounted for as lost revenue. "Private entities such as insurance companies and hedge funds would charge a fair value for such options," said James Thomson, a vice president and financial economist in the research department at the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland. "But not doing so, the government is forgoing revenues that could be used for other purposes. So yes, the implicit subsidy (or any subsidy) is equivalent to a tax expenditure - like investment tax credits, fair housing credits, and so on." Economists don't agree on the size of the guarantee, Thomson said, though researchers including economists at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. claim to have measured it, in addition to the IMF, Dallas Fed and Bloomberg among others.. The most telling testimony about "Too Big to Fail" might be that of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to the Senate Banking Committee in February. Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, pressed Bernanke about the "free insurance policy" for the biggest banks, using Bloomberg's figure of $83 billion. Video of the exchange is posted online. Bernanke readily conceded existence of the implicit guarantee, though he maintained it is built on false expectation. "The subsidy is coming because of market expectations that the government would bail out these firms if they failed," he said. "Those expectations are incorrect.... That's the expectation of markets, that doesn't mean that we have to do it." "I understand that we’re all trying to get to the end of 'too big to fail,'" Warren responded. But until it is ended, she said, "it is working like an insurance policy. Ordinary folks pay for homeowners insurance. Ordinary folks pay for car insurance. And these big financial institutions are getting cheaper borrowing to the tune of $83 billion in a single year simply because people believe that the government would step in and bail them out. And I’m just saying, if they are getting it, why shouldn’t they pay for it?" "I think we should get rid of it," Bernanke said. Finally, we note the final report of the Congressional Oversight Panel on the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which said that the six biggest U.S. banks received a total of $1.27 trillion in government support during the financial crisis. The report notes the moral hazard and "distortion of the financial marketplace through [TARP's] implicit guarantee of 'too big to fail' banks." The report says: "It is not surprising that markets have assumed that ‘too big to fail’ banks are safer than their ‘small enough to fail’ counterparts. Credit rating agencies continue to adjust the credit ratings of very large banks to reflect their implicit government guarantee. Smaller banks receive no such adjustment, and as a result, they pay more to borrow relative to very large banks." The exact value of the "too big to fail" guarantee, or risk premium, or free insurance, remains in question -- and it is a question Brown and Vitter put to the Government Accountability Office. But the biggest banks that received bailouts in 2009 clearly do have a cost advantage in borrowing because of the implicit guarantee. And that advantage is not shared by smaller, community banks. That makes Brown’s statement partially accurate. However, at PolitiFact, words matter. Even if there is an implicit guarantee, it’s a stretch to call it a taxpayer-funded advantage the banks receive "today," because no money has actually been spent and no dollars change hands. And no money would be spent unless the banks fail. Even then, as Bernanke says, "that doesn't mean that we have to" bail them out. It might seem like a fine line, but there is a difference between a taxpayer-backed advantage and a taxpayer-funded subsidy. We rate Brown’s statement Half True.

pomt-09124	The White House has "refused" international help in dealing with the oil spill.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/jun/16/george-lemieux/white-house-refused-international-oil-spill-aid-fl/	Florida Sen. George LeMieux continues to be a leading critic of President Barack Obama's handling of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill. LeMieux, who was appointed to the Senate last year by Gov. Charlie Crist, has described Obama's response as "dereliction of duty," and said Obama appears more interested in photo-ops than solving the crisis growing in the Gulf. LeMieux also has pressed the federal government to add more skimmer boats off Florida's coast to collect encroaching oil. Now, LeMieux claims that offers of assistance from foreign governments are going ignored by President Obama and his administration. LeMieux let out his frustration in a posting on Twitter. "State Department reports today 17 countries have offered 21 times to send aid, including skimmers," LeMieux wrote on June 15, 2010. "Why has the White House refused help?" He repeated the same claim in a CNN interview on June 16. With such a scramble to contain the oil and prevent it from damaging Florida's beaches, we wondered if the federal government has been refusing offers of foreign aid. Since LeMieux says his information comes from the State Department, that's where we went to look. In a press briefing on May 19, reporters asked State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid of the possibility of international aid (The Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20). Duguid said that, at that time, 17 countries had offered some form of assistance. A reporter then asked why none of the offers had been accepted. "I don’t know that none of them have been accepted," Duguid said. "I know that BP has accepted some directly without going to the U.S. The offers were mostly for booms and dispersants. There are some offers of support which come in the form of 'If you let us know what you need, we'll be happy to see if we can provide that.' There are others that were for equipment that the U.S. or BP had in supply at the time and was not running short. So there were different types of offers, and I have an understanding that BP may have accepted one or two. I don’t have the details of that." So it was up to BP earlier? It’s not your decision?, a reporter asked. "The decision on what to accept is being done for the U.S. Government by the Coast Guard," Duguid said. "They are the authoritative agency to make those decisions. BP, being a private company, can accept the help that is offered to it directly. We don’t control that. However, the expertise that is there in the Gulf is working very hard to try and contain this spill and to cap that – cap the well." Another exchange between the State Department and reporters came a week later. State Department spokesman T.J. Crowley said 17 countries were still offering aid, as were four other entities -- the European Maritime Safety Agency, the European Commission’s Monitoring and Information Centre, the International Maritime Organization, and the Environment Unit of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the United Nations Environment Program. "My understanding is that two offers of assistance have been accepted thus far – I believe it's Mexico and Norway," Crowley said. "Those offers were actually accepted by BP as part of this Unified Area Command. But we also are working internationally. I think there's assistance flowing in through private as well as public sources, so this is something that we continue to evaluate. But I would defer probably to the Coast Guard in terms of explaining the process." A reporter then noted an apparent disconnect, with some governors calling for more booms while the federal government appears to be refusing some internationals offers for help. "Let me be clear, we are grateful for the assistance that we have been offered internationally," Crowley said. "It is something that we evaluate every day. But again, I would defer to others, particularly the Coast Guard, to go through where they are in the process of evaluating particular offers." Another series of questions followed June 9, and then again on June 14 and 15. On June 14, the State Department reported that booms from Canada had arrived in Alabama. Crowley then was asked to explain why it took weeks for some foreign offers of assistance to be accepted, and why others still hadn't. "First of all, the offers came in. Some of those offers were specific; some of those offers were general," Crowley said. "Secondly, the United States Government was looking to see what are immediately available sources of relevant equipment and technology there in the Gulf region." The State Department on June 14 released a list of the countries that offered to help -- Canada, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Russia, Spain, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and Vietnam. That's 17 countries. The State Department also detailed what offers had been accepted. From Mexico -- Two skimmers and 13,780 feet of boom (accepted in early May). From Norway -- Eight skimming systems (accepted in early May). From Netherlands -- Three sets of Koseq Rigid Sweeping Arms, which attach to the sides of ships and gather oil (accepted on May 23). From Canada -- 9,843 feet of boom (accepted on June 4). On June 15, Qatar, the 18th country, offered chains of containment boom and Sweden followed up on an earlier offer to provide skimmers. State Department officials also started making a distinction about the aid -- it wasn't coming for free. "There have been some questions about these offers of assistance. For the most part, they are offers to sell supplies," Crowley said. "And in determining whether to accept these offers, we look at the availability of domestic sources and also compare pricing on the open market. So that may be one of the reasons why, in some cases, we’ve been able to accept these offers and pursued them. In other cases, we’re holding them in abeyance as we continue to identify sources of important equipment that will be needed for this -- to handle this over the long term." The Washington Post reported about the decision to accept or decline foreign aid in its June 15 edition, noting that the decision to accept foreign aid came after weeks of delay, and that foreign governments were unsure if they should contact the government or BP. In some cases, the Post reported, the administration rejected offers because they failed to meet U.S. specifications: For example, the private consortium that serves as Norway's spill-response team uses a chemical dispersant that the Environmental Protection Agency has not approved. Japan was offering protective booms and the Swedish Coast Guard was prepared to send three ships that can each collect 370 barrels of oil an hour. The Norwegian Coastal Authority, the Post reported, has approved sending nearly a third of the nation's spill response equipment to the gulf if asked. Let's tie this all together. The State Department has received official assistance offers from 18 countries and another four groups. Some of those offers are vague, others are specific. Most all of them are offers to sell equipment or use the equipment. The State Department has accepted the offers of four countries -- Mexico, Norway, Netherlands and Canada -- and says it is reviewing and considering other offers. That's in contrast to LeMieux's statement, which is that the White House has "refused" international aid. But it's also clear the United States has either struggled to act on offers of foreign aid, or that processing the requests has been delayed. Japan, Sweden and Norway are all prepared to send resources or manpower to the Gulf should the U.S. sign off. Other countries also are willing to help, but have been kept on the sidelines. Taking that into account, we'll rate LeMieux's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	George LeMieux	None	None	None	2010-06-16T17:44:10	2010-06-16	['None']

pomt-03383	The Senate immigration bill "unleashes a massive increase in overall immigration. … We're talking about a population increase under the Senate bill of over 70 million people in 20 years."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/09/dan-stein/dan-stein-says-senate-immigration-bill-would-add-7/	As the immigration debate moves from the Senate to the House, supporters and opponents have been firing claims back and forth. A reader pointed us toward one claim raised by a critic of the bill on CBS’ Face the Nation. The "so-called path to citizenship amnesty program is a fraction of what the deal bills with," said Dan Stein, who heads a group that opposes the bill, the Federation for American Immigration Reform, or FAIR, on July 7, 2013. "Ultimately, it unleashes a massive increase in overall immigration ... . Essentially, it gives up on the American worker by simply suggesting that at every level of the labor market employers should be able to bring in foreign workers. We're talking about a population increase under the Senate bill of over 70 million people in 20 years -- 70 million people." The reader wondered whether the bill really "unleashes a massive increase in overall immigration" of "over 70 million people in 20 years." In asking us to check the item, the reader noted that such an increase in the immigrant population would amount to a 22 percent increase over the current U.S. population estimate of 316.3 million, an increase the reader said "sounds implausibly high." As support for Stein’s claim, Eric Ruark, FAIR’s director of research, pointed us to a paper by the Center for Immigration Studies. While the center has strong opinions on immigration policy -- it’s generally skeptical of expanding immigration -- the group’s study used data from two sources without a dog in the fight, the Congressional Budget Office and the Census Bureau. The paper noted that CBO, in a recent analysis of the immigration bill, projected that the U.S. will have 16.2 million more people in 2033 as a result of the immigration bill than it would if Congress passed no changes to the immigration system. CBO said this is "primarily because the legislation would loosen or eliminate annual limits on various categories of permanent and temporary immigration." Meanwhile, the Census Bureau has projected that the U.S. population -- on its own, and in the absence of an immigration bill -- was already set to rise from 316.3 million in 2013 to 365.3 million in 2033. That’s an increase of 49 million. If you add these two numbers together, you get a roughly 65 million increase in population. That’s pretty close to Stein’s 70 million figure. Stein’s comments suggested to us, and to the reader who urged us to check the claim, that it’s the immigration bill that caused the 70 million increase. But that’s not the case. In reality, roughly three-quarters of the 65 million population increase from 2013 to 2033 comes not from additional immigrants crossing the border and having children on U.S. soil, but rather from Americans already legally on U.S. soil having kids, and from immigrants coming to the U.S. legally under current laws. The Senate bill wouldn’t affect this population growth at all. Several population experts told PolitiFact that they had problems with Stein’s claim. "I don't see where the 70 million would come from -- certainly not from the countries mostly responsible for undocumented migration," said Douglas Massey, a professor at Princeton University's Office of Population Research. "Together, Mexico, El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras account for around three-fourths of all undocumented residents, but the combined population of these countries is only around 150 million. So 70 million (moving here) would represent 47 percent of their combined population, which is simply not credible." In an interview, Steven A. Camarota, the author of the Center for Immigration Studies paper, declined to assess the adequacy of how Stein phrased the statistic. However, he said it’s not unreasonable to focus on the impact of immigration on the nation’s population growth, even if the number isn’t as high as 70 million. "The basic question remains: Is 16 million additional residents a lot?" Camarota said. "This is on top of the 19 million from current immigration levels. ... The key question is what are the costs and benefits of significantly increasing the size and density of the U.S. population as a direct result of federal policy? The country lacks even a terse discussion of this issue." Our ruling Stein said the Senate immigration bill "unleashes a massive increase in overall immigration. … We're talking about a population increase under the Senate bill of over 70 million people in 20 years." While credible estimates do say the U.S. population could grow by 65 million between 2013 and 2033, only about 16 million of that would be increases resulting from the Senate bill. The remaining 49 million, or three-quarters of the total, would come from natural population growth among people already in America and by immigration that’s deemed legal under today’s laws -- and thus would have nothing to do with whether the Senate bill passes or not. We rate the claim False.	None	Dan Stein	None	None	None	2013-07-09T11:40:01	2013-07-07	['None']
pomt-08320	"The Recovery Act saved 60,000 jobs among law enforcement officials, firefighters in the state of Florida, plus another 20,000 educators."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/29/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-claims-recovery-act-stimulus-saved-t/	On the campaign trail for the U.S. Senate, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist defends his support for the federal stimulus by pointing to jobs saved by the emergency infusion. In a state that voted eight years ago to keep class sizes small, he’s especially fond of mentioning educators. He touted education jobs twice in a debate Oct. 24, 2010 — the second time adding detail about public safety workers. In the first few minutes, he said: "We utilized those moneys in order to stem the tide in losing jobs in the Sunshine State. 20,000 educators today would be out a job if we hadn't utilized the Recovery Act moneys. Another 60,000 of my fellow Floridians would be out of work today without the opportunity to be able to utilize those moneys in a responsible way." Before the debate with Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek had reached its halfway point, he added: "But I also agree with the congressman when he talks about the fact that the Recovery Act saved 60,000 jobs among law enforcement officials, firefighters in the state of Florida, plus another 20,000 educators." A comment that specific just begs for the Truth-O-Meter. Did the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 really save 60,000 jobs among law enforcement officials and firefighters, plus 20,000 educators? Crist’s campaign referred us to the governor’s office, where we caught up with press secretary Sterling Ivey. He sent us a link to the standard reference the governor would use for such data, the most recent Recovery Act Summary from the Florida Office of Economic Recovery. It breaks out two types of numbers for Florida: actual workers affected, and "jobs," measured in full-time equivalents. Quickly, things spiraled downhill for the "60,000" claim. The count for the Department of Justice — 935 jobs — would include some law enforcement officials, Ivey said. So would some of the 617 jobs attributed to the Department of Law Enforcement. Firefighters might be counted with Department of Homeland Security, but DHS claimed zero jobs in Florida funded by its $4.6 million award. As we looked at the document , Ivey summarized: "The numbers aren't going to add up for you." The educator claim fared better. A line item for "Education State Fiscal Stabilization" looked promising: It showed 19,767 jobs funded by the Recovery Act. Other state and federal education categories showed nearly 7,900 additional jobs. But Ivey couldn’t tell us how much of that work belonged to "educators" vs. other types of personnel. For that, we would have to ask the Florida Department of Education directly. The department was able to provide us with Recovery Act numbers for "instructional personnel," a reasonable synonym for "educators." In 16 categories, it identified 19,166 instructional full-time equivalent jobs affecting 31,003 employees for the quarter ending June 30, 2010. So, with a little rounding of the lower "jobs" number, Crist’s claim stands. And since he chose the word "educators," which refers to people, not jobs, he probably would have been safe even with the higher number. If he had widened his word choice to encompass all types of positions at the Department of Education, he could have touted support for 27,600 jobs or 42,600 workers. So how was Crist close — even conservative — on one number, and so woefully off on the other? Campaign spokesman Danny Kanner didn’t answer our request for an explanation. But the number of "actual workers" affected by Recovery Act funds in the quarter ended in June was near 80,000. Subtract from that about 20,000 educator jobs, and you have what sounds like a reasonable number for the rest: 60,000. Of course, there are two major problems here: 80,000 wasn’t the "jobs" number, it was the higher "actual workers" measure. "Jobs" totaled just 34,298. So a true statement would have been that the Recovery Act funded 20,000 jobs for educators and 14,000 other jobs. Or that it benefited 31,000 educators and 48,000 other Floridians. Either way, it’s simply inaccurate to attribute every non-education job or worker to law enforcement and firefighting. So how does the Truth-O-Meter rule? Crist absolutely mangled the claim about "60,000 jobs." He had a much better grasp on "20,000 educators." That makes him only a quarter right, so we rule his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01949	The proposed Gogebic iron ore mine is "just up the hill" from the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore caves along Lake Superior.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/23/al-jazeera-america/al-jazeera-america-documentary-says-gogebic-iron-o/	Controversy over the proposed Gogebic Taconite mine in far northern Wisconsin plays out in familiar fashion in "Wisconsin’s Mining Standoff," a documentary airing on the Al Jazeera America cable network. Co-produced by Milwaukee-based 371 Productions and Al Jazeera for the network’s weekly Fault Lines program, the film calls the debate over the proposed mine "a battle for the very soul of the state….pitting those who wish to extract natural resources against those who wish to preserve them." The piece about the mine was broadcast for the first time June 14, 2014. Al Jazeera America, which launched in 2013, is available in 52 million homes. Fault Lines also airs internationally on the Al Jazeera English cable network, which is not available in the United States. (Al Jazeera doesn’t provide an online link to the segment.) The film is also being screened throughout Wisconsin by 371 Productions. The documentary opens with a panorama of hundreds of bundled-up folks tramping across frozen Lake Superior to view scenic ice caves. Those spectacular caves, in the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore about 20 miles west of Bayfield, are normally only accessible by kayak or canoe. When the lake froze over the winter for the first time since 2009, the caves received considerable attention, and a record number of visitors. Standing on the frozen lake, Al Jazeera correspondent Josh Rushing refers to the importance of tourism to northern Wisconsin, discusses the size of the proposed mine and raises a question that’s an important theme in the 25 minute documentary. "Will all of these tourists want to come here if there’s an iron mine just up the hill?" he asks. The "just up the hill" impression is reinforced by the editing of the piece. In the opening minute, the film moves back and forth from the ice caves to the Penokee mountain range where the mine would be built. It shows heavy equipment digging into the earth -- part of initial rock sampling now under way -- and huge trucks rumbling down a snow covered road, then switches back to the frozen lake and the ice caves. There’s one problem: The mine and the caves are more than an hour apart. Google maps says it’s about 54 miles from Cornucopia, the town near the caves, to Mellen, the community closest to the proposed mine site. It would take 70 minutes to make the trip, according to Google. It’s not like this was an out-of-town correspondent losing his bearings in the North Woods. The script was written by 371 founder Brad Lichtenstein, who is also listed in the credits as director, senior producer and a principal photographer. Milwaukee-based 371 proposed the topic to Fault Lines and did much of the work on the segment. The company produced the 2012 documentary "As Goes Janesville," which included footage of Gov. Scott Walker telling a wealthy supporter he would use a "divide and conquer" strategy against unions. When we asked the 371 Productions about the "just up the hill" statement, we didn’t receive a response from the company. Instead, we heard from Al Jazeera in New York, which issued a statement that said the film would be edited due to our inquiry. "While we consider Josh’s statement to be a figure of speech that helps viewers understand the area broadly as a tourist destination, we can also understand that some viewers might take his narration to imply an exact measurement of the distance between him and the mine site," the statement said. "Because of the potential for confusion, we are removing this line of narration." Impact on the lakeshore That aside, could the mine hurt the Apostle Islands lakeshore? The mine site is some 20 miles inland, but there is plenty of concern from neighbors and the nearby Bad River band of the Lake Superior Chippewa that the project could pollute the Bad River, which flows into Lake Superior. But the mouth of the Bad River is miles away from the caves and on the opposite side of the Bayfield peninsula. The state Department of Natural Resources is responsible for enforcing federal clean water rules. DNR hydrogeologist Larry Lynch, the agency’s top administrator overseeing the mine project, said it’s too early to study any impact that a mine could have on the Bad River watershed and Lake Superior, because the mining company has not provided a specific plan for the project. For instance, Lynch said, if Gogebic plans a waste water treatment facility, would water be discharged into the river? If so, would the trip downstream dilute that discharge before it reaches the lake? "It would be a very involved process, obviously," Lynch said of the DNR water quality review. Gogebic Taconite spokesman Bob Seitz said the company had not studied the potential impact of the mine on tourism. He noted the site itself might draw visitors to what is a remote part of the state. "I am confident an operating mine (or one under construction) would bring far more people to this area daily to use tourism related businesses than currently visit the immediate area," Seitz said in an email. "Mines also draw tourists to view the project. I would anticipate some kind of overlook like mines in other places have to draw visitors." Other statements The Fault Lines piece included several other statements similar to ones we have reviewed. The documentary states that the project "would start with a 4.5 mile pit and could eventually stretch 22 miles." In another spot, he describes the mine as a "half mile trench that could eventually stretch 22 miles through the wilderness." That’s similar to a claim from writer and musician Dan Kaufman that the mine "could be extended as long as 21 miles." We rated that Half True. While that is the size of the ore deposit that Gogebic holds the rights to, the first phase calls for a four-mile site to be mined. Tentative plans call for it to be not a single trench, but two separate pits. Any additional mining would require another permitting process and would be decades away -- and only if the company decides it’s worth the effort. And it would not be a single pit, but a series of excavations, Lynch and the company have said. The program also mentions the state law written to make it easier for the company to develop the mine. The law allows the company to fill in streams and ponds providing it re-creates the bodies of water elsewhere, the program notes. Kaufman’s statement on that subject was Mostly True because he left out the important point that a remediation plan would have to be included. Our rating Al Jazeera’s Fault Lines program about the Gogebic mine states that the proposed mine site is "just up the hill" from the Apostle Islands National Lakeshore caves. That statement, and the way footage from the caves is interwoven with scenes from the mine site, leaves the unmistakable impression that the mine would be close to the caves. But it’s more than 50 miles from the caves to the mine site. And Al Jazeera officials pledged to edit out the inaccurate statement after we asked about it. We rate the claim False.

pomt-08548	Peter DeFazio "will sneak in a 1 percent tax on all banking transactions."	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/01/chain-email/e-mail-claims-defazio-wants-tax-transactions/	An intriguing e-mail landed in the inbox of Oregon PolitiFact. We couldn’t figure out who was circulating the message -- but it accused Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., of the unspeakable: a tax on everyday banking transactions. The e-mail, forwarded Sept. 24 by a reader, claims that DeFazio wants to levy a 1 percent tax on every financial transaction, like depositing a Social Security check or cashing a paycheck. The letter claims his proposed legislation had the blessing of President Barack Obama’s "finance team" and that Democrats are waiting until after the Nov. 2 election to pass H.R. 4646. (DeFazio faces opposition from relative unknown Republican Art Robinson this fall.) The e-mail repeats language from -- and links to a letter to the editor -- posted to the website of the Standard-Examiner in Ogden, Utah. That letter reads, in part, regarding Obama:: "His plan is to sneak it in after the November election to keep it under the radar. This is a 1% tax on all transactions at any financial institution i. e. Banks, Credit Unions, etc. Any deposit you make, or move around within your account, i. e. transfer to, will have a 1% tax charged. If your pay check or your social Security or whatever is direct deposit, 1% tax charged. If you hand carry a check in to deposit, 1% tax charged, If you take cash in to deposit, 1% tax charged." But the letter on the Standard-Examiner website made no mention of DeFazio. How curious. We decided to check it out. And we learned that H.R. 4646 is indeed actual legislation whose subject has something to do with taxation. But that’s where the similarities end. The "Debt Free America Act" was introduced by U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Penn, in February 2010. He proposed a 1 percent tax on all money transactions, "including cash transactions, checks, credit cards, those processed through the Federal Reserve Bank, and those collected at the point of sale." Fattah’s idea was to use the money to pay down the national debt, and eventually replace the income tax. He has proposed similar legislation since 2004. H.R. 4646 had no support -- and certainly not from Obama’s "finance team" -- and is now dying a quiet death in committee. Yet the resolution continues to live online, where the DeFazio connection has been repeated by a former Hernando County (Fla.) commissioner. DeFazio did introduce, along with Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and other House Democrats legislation in December 2009 to assess a 0.25 percent tax on stock transactions. HR 4191 would not affect retirement accounts such as 401(k)s, education accounts or health savings accounts. And regular investors would not be affected because the first $100,000 traded each year would be exempt. The idea was to make Wall Street shoulder more of the costs borne by Main Street. The bill is in committee. Penny Dodge, DeFazio’s chief of staff, says the congressman opposes H.R. 4646. An unamused DeFazio doesn’t know who is behind the e-mail attack. "It’s slanderous," DeFazio said of the electronic claim. "I have nothing to do with the bill, no one pays any attention to the bill. It’s chronically introduced, and never received any attention before this." He gets backup from Fattah, whose press secretary sent PolitiFact Oregon a statement: "There have been many misleading and flat-wrong assertions about my bill, H.R. 4646, the Debt Free America Act. Congressman Peter DeFazio is not a cosponsor of H.R. 4646 and it is completely inaccurate to say he is a proponent of the Debt Free America Act. The statement is not accurate -- and makes a ridiculous claim. We rate this Pants on Fire. Comment on this item.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2010-10-01T06:00:00	2010-09-30	['None']

pomt-02130	"When Deborah took office, the (Sellwood Bridge) project had languished for years, with only $11 million in funds. With her leadership the remaining funding was secured that got the project moving forward."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2014/may/08/deborah-kafoury/did-deborah-kafourys-leadership-take-sellwood-brid/	Awful things happen when bridges collapse. The 2007 collapse of the Interstate 35W Mississippi River Bridge in Minneapolis, for instance, left 13 dead and scores more injured. The calamity was blamed on a 1960s design flaw in plates used to connect bridge beams. Closer to home, Multnomah County officials worried about the stability of the Sellwood Bridge for years. No one thought the bridge was about to fall down, but everyone knew it needed to be replaced. Cracks in the structure’s concrete and steel, along with extraordinarily high use -- it’s the busiest two-lane bridge in Oregon -- earned it a two on a federal bridge-safety scale of 100. The Claim Deborah Kafoury was a former state legislator and a Multnomah County commissioner when she stepped down in October 2013 to run for Multnomah County chair. She faces attorney Jim Francesconi and four other candidates in the May 20 primary. Her campaign website lists the Sellwood Bridge among her accomplishments. "When Deborah took office," it claims, "the project had languished for years, with only $11 million in funds. With her leadership the remaining funding was secured that got the project moving forward." We wondered if Kafoury deserved that much credit. The Analysis We called Mike Pullen, a Multnomah County spokesman, and asked about the $11 million figure. He emailed an internal budget document titled, "Sellwood Bridge Funding Plan." It was dated June 4, 2009, which was five months after Kafoury took office as a commissioner. The document listed four possible financing scenarios. Each added up to the $321 million the project was then estimated to cost. They differed in the amounts expected to be collected from various contributing sources. All four scenarios included $11 million budgeted but unspent in completing a federally mandated environmental impact statement. That backed Kafoury’s claim that only $11 million of the projected $321 million needed to build a new Sellwood Bridge was on hand when she took office. Did her "leadership" help vacuum up the rest? Construction is now well under way so we know who’s paying for what. By far the single biggest source is the $141.7 million coming from a $19-a-year Multnomah County vehicle registration fee. We started our check there. Kafoury, who had been a legislator for six years before winning election as a commissioner, told us in a telephone interview that she took the lead in lobbying for a new bridge during the 2009 legislative session. She focused primarily on House Bill 2009, which included a provision giving Multnomah and Clackamas counties the authority to divert increased vehicle registration fees to the bridge. (Clackamas County, on a public vote, later pulled out of the plan.) Kafoury said she traveled frequently to Salem, meeting with, among others, Senate President Peter Courtney, D-Salem, and state Sen. Bruce Starr, R-Hillsboro. We called Courtney. "She drove me nuts over that bridge," he exploded. "I’m not making this up. To me, the Sellwood Bridge is Deborah’s bridge." Multnomah County commissioners are elected on a nonpartisan basis. Still, Kafoury is a Democrat, so naturally Courtney might support her. For balance, we called Starr, a Republican. "I was managing the funding package for that bill and, based on my conversations with her, the Sellwood Bridge was added to that package," Starr said. "As far as I’m concerned, she was the only person in Multnomah County I dealt with on that issue." Did Kafoury have as strong a hand in the bridge’s other significant funding sources? The city of Portland, through then-Mayor Sam Adams, had already come out in favor of building a new bridge. Adams caught considerable flak for proposing to spend city money on a bridge it didn’t own. Adams and Ted Wheeler, then county commission chair, were in talks about the bridge when Kafoury joined the commission. When Jeff Cogen succeeded Wheeler, those discussions continued. The aim was inking an intergovernmental agreement specifying the duties and contributions of each. "But until we had the money in hand from the vehicle registration fees, nothing was going anywhere," Kafoury said. "When I went to Salem and got the funding, I called Sam and asked him for a firm commitment. We’d never have gotten the IGA if I hadn’t gotten the money." Adams, now executive director of the City Club of Portland, did not dispute Kafoury’s statement. The city’s portion of the project, now with an overall budget of $307.5 million, is $74.5 million. One last piece of the bridge’s financing collage we looked at was a $17.7 million federal grant, awarded in December 2011. Kafoury did join a county delegation that traveled to Washington, D.C., earlier that year to lobby for the grant, according to her and other county workers. But the extensive time spent preparing the grant was substantially "staff-driven," the county’s Pullen said. Without that money, the county would have still been looking at a $20 million funding gap. The Ruling Kafoury, in her campaign for Multnomah County commission chair, cites construction of a new Sellwood Bridge as a major accomplishment. When she took her seat on the commission in 2009, she said, "the project had languished for years, with only $11 million in funds. With her leadership, the remaining funding was secured that got the project moving forward." Budget documents confirm that only $11 million was on hand in 2009, and efforts to replace the aging span had been going on for at least several years. It’s also clear that without a lot more money, the project was going nowhere. State legislators from both parties say Kafoury was instrumental in including the Sellwood Bridge in a huge transportation funding bill approved not long after she took office. Yet while that money was key to getting the city of Portland to commit cash, important discussions between the city and county not directly involving Kafoury took place both before and after she was elected. Kafoury also lobbied federal officials for a grant that closed a remaining funding gap, but work around that grant was largely staff-driven. Kafoury played a pivotal role in securing the bridge’s first big chunk of money, which was key to getting it going. But she wasn’t the only to show "leadership" on the project. Other legislators had to buy into the transportation bill, and leaders such as Adams, Wheeler and Cogen helped secure money from the city of Portland. We rate Kafoury’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-03692	Says under his utility rate plan, "An estimated 50 percent of our residential households will see a decrease in their water and wastewater bills."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2013/apr/22/dwight-jones/dwight-jones-says-his-budget-would-lower-water-bil/	Richmond Mayor Dwight Jones sees his plan to overhaul the city’s water and wastewater rates as a glass half full. His plan cuts in half the base rates that all customers pay simply to have access to the city’s water system. It also more than doubles a second charge to customers based on the amount of water they use and flush into the sewer system. "Through this rate structure change, an estimated 50 percent of our residential households will see a decrease in their water and wastewater bills," Jones said in a March 12 news release announcing the plan. We wondered if the mayor was correct. Under his plan, the monthly base rate charged to all customers for water and wastewater service would drop from $49.40 to $26.11. Meanwhile, the second monthly payment based on the volume of water used would rise from $4.22 to $9.03 for every 100 cubic feet that comes into their taps or leaves their home as wastewater. That 100 cubic feet, listed as a "ccf" on a resident’s water bill, amounts to about 750 gallons -- roughly 15 bathtubs full. The new rates are part of Jones’ proposal for a Richmond budget that is scheduled for a City Council vote May 13. Jones said his rates are not aimed at generating more revenues but were designed to shift more of the burden of supporting the utility to the residents who use the most water. Tammy Hawley, a spokeswoman for the mayor, sent us a Department of Public Utilities chart breaking down the number of residential customers by their water use. The chart showed that 25,904 customers were billed for using 400 cubic feet or less each month in the 2012 fiscal year, the most recently completed budget cycle. That comes to about half of the city’s 51,832 residential customers. Another chart Hawley sent shows that anyone charged for using 400 cubic feet or less would see lower bills. That’s because the increase in their volume fee would be less than the savings they would get from the halving of the base rate. People right at that 400 cubic foot threshold now pay $66.28 a month. The new rates would drop their monthly bills to $62.23 -- a savings of $4.05. The less water they use, the greater their savings. For example, customers who use 200 cubic feet would save $13.67 each month. Their monthly bills, now $57.84, would drop to $44.17. City charts show that the biggest savers would be the 13.7 percent of customers who use "0 ccf" a month. That doesn’t mean these households don’t use water, just that they consumed less than the 750 gallons threshold necessary to trigger a volume charge, said Angela Fountain, a spokeswoman with the Richmond Department of Public Utilities. So these users, who only pay the base rate, would save $23.29 a month. But 750 gallons is precious little water to use in a month. Such a household would be limited daily to a 5-minute shower, one tooth brushing, one hand washing and several toilet flushes and monthly to two loads of laundry and several dish washings, according to estimates from the U.S. Geological Survey. We wondered if some of those households might be properties where no one is living but where someone still pays a water bill, such as a vacant apartment. Fountain said no one knows. "If we’re sending them a bill, then we believe the property is occupied, that someone is using water there," she said. "We can’t tell you how many people, how often they’re there. We just don’t have that information." So the mayor is correct that his plan cuts water and wastewater rates for half the city households. The unsaid part, of course, is that it raises rates for the other half -- those billed monthly for using 500 cubic feet or more. We should note that the average residential household uses 600 cubic feet in water and wastewater each month, according to Raftelis Financial Consultants, a group that examined the Richmond’s utility pricing in a March 2013 report. Such customers will see their bill rise from $74.72 to $80.29 -- a $5.57 increase. Our ruling The mayor said that under his plan, half of the city’s residences would see a drop in water bills. His carefully worded statement is accurate. The unspoken part is that 50 percent will see their bills increase. The mayor also omits that his proposal would lead to a modest rate hike for the average water user. The mayor is correct, but his statement benefits from additional information. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Dwight Jones	None	None	None	2013-04-22T06:00:00	2013-03-12	['None']
pomt-13678	Says Sen. Pat Toomey "even tried to shut down the federal government in order to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/aug/02/majority-forward/attacking-pat-toomey-did-he-try-shut-down-governme/	The latest ad from the PAC Majority Forward goes after Pat Toomey’s stances on abortion. It accuses the senator of voting against Planned Parenthood, being against a woman’s right to choose and supporting the overturning of Roe v. Wade. In one segment, Majority Forward, which bills itself as an organization with a goal of increasing voter registration and turnout and is associated with the pro-Democrat Senate Majority PAC, claims Toomey "even tried to shut down the federal government in order to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood." Planned Parenthood was a major point of contention last year, and Toomey has long been an opponent of the organization. But did Toomey really try to shut down the federal government? The dispute over Planned Parenthood peaked last September after a series of undercover videos of its executives and technicians discussing aborted fetuses had been released by the Center for Medical Progress. House and Senate Republicans, primarily Tea Party figures, responded by calling for Congress to defund the organization. The debate caused complications as legislators worked toward a spending deal needed to keep many government programs running. Planned Parenthood gets about $450 million each year in federal funds, mostly out of funding from Medicare and Medicaid. On September 24, the Senate voted on a spending bill containing language to defund Planned Parenthood. Toomey was one of 47 senators who voted in favor of the bill -- not enough for it to pass. On September 30, the day before the deadline for the government shutdown, the Senate passed a spending deal that didn’t contain language to defund Planned Parenthood. Toomey was one of 20 senators to vote no on the final bill, compared to 78 senators who voted yes. This came about a week after Toomey told New York magazine he didn’t think it was a good idea to cause a government shutdown over Planned Parenthood. A government shutdown was a possible result if the bill did not pass. "He voted against the continuing resolution that funded Planned Parenthood and the government," said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at Georgetown’s Government Affairs Institute. "Whether he was threatening to shut down the government may be rhetorical." Last year, after Toomey voted against the spending plan, he released a statement saying, "I have strongly supported efforts to permanently stop government shutdowns. Shutdowns are no way to conduct the nation’s business....It is now apparent that the government will not shut down, so the question before the Senate is whether taxpayers should be forced to fund Planned Parenthood’s outrageous extremist practices. I voted against that, and I am instead in favor of shifting Planned Parenthood’s funding over to health centers that provide essential services to women in need." Toomey’s campaign condemned the Majority Forward ad, saying the PAC was lying and said Toomey has fought to end government shutdowns. Majority Forward did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling With Republicans calling to defund Planned Parenthood last year, a federal spending plan was pushed to the brink. Had a plan not passed before Oct. 1, the government would have shut down like it did in 2013. On September 30, a few days after voting for a failed spending bill that would have defunded Planned Parenthood, Senator Pat Toomey voted no on a final spending bill overwhelmingly approved by the Senate. So Toomey voted against a bill that averted a government shutdown. By doing so, he didn’t do the same thing as try to "shut down the government," as Majority Forward claims.

pomt-01595	"McDonald’s hamburgers are only 15 percent ‘real beef.’ The other 85 percent is meat filler cleansed with ammonia, which causes stomach and intestinal cancer."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/03/facebook-posts/blogger-claims-mcdonalds-burgers-are-made-85-perce/	An unsavory Facebook meme is reigniting alarm about the content of Big Macs. According to the meme, the patties at McDonald’s are skimpy on real beef and heavy on "meat filler," which the meme links to cancer. Meat filler is also called "pink slime" -- a nickname the beef industry insiders consider pejorative -- and made waves with consumers several years ago after a 2011 episode of Jamie Oliver’s Food Revolution and an 11-part ABC News investigation. McDonald’s said back then that it pulled the product from its grills. But a meme circulating this summer suggests otherwise. The claim has been around in some form since 2002. One of the most recent versions, sourced from an anonymous blogpost on Raw For Beauty, says "McDonald’s hamburgers are only 15 percent ‘real beef,’ the other 85 percent is meat filler cleansed with ammonia, which causes stomach and intestinal cancer." We wanted to know more about this "meat filler," what place, if any, it has in McDonald’s burgers, and if it is linked to cancer. Big Mac smack First, McDonald’s says it no longer uses the "meat filler" in question. This claim has been debunked numerous times since 2011, and it has also been addressed multiple times by McDonald’s. In an FAQ about its meats, the fast food giant acknowledged that it once used "pink slime" -- or the industry preferred term, "lean, finely textured beef" -- in its products but has since stopped the practice: "McDonald’s USA had begun the process of removing it from our supply chain prior to widespread media coverage on its use and it was completely removed from our supply in 2011. While select lean beef trimmings are safe, we decided to stop using the product to align our global standards for beef around the world." As for what exactly is in the patties, McDonald’s writes, "Our burgers in the US are made using only 100 percent USDA-inspected beef. There are no preservatives, no fillers, no extenders and no so-called ‘pink slime’ in our beef. The only thing added to our burgers is a bit of salt and pepper during grilling." The "pink slime" rumor oozed its way to Down Under, too, forcing McDonald’s Australia to release a video and tell a concerned customer, "Rest assured, Dana, it’s not true. Our beef patties are all 100 percent export quality Aussie beef, free of preservatives, additives, fillers and binders." Despite rising costs of beef, McDonald’s has no plans to reintroduce lean, finely textured beef (the preferred industry term term for what critics call "pink slime"), said McDonald’s spokeswoman Lisa McComb. Primer on "meat filler" But what exactly is lean, finely textured beef, and is it considered "real beef"? When Beef Products Inc., began making the product in 1991, the industry cheered it as revolutionary. Essentially, the goal is to get every piece of meat off of the bone, and then sanitize it so it is safe to eat. Here’s how the process works: About 25 percent of the carcass remains after taking whole muscle cuts (sirloins, briskets, ribs, etc). The remaining fat trimmings with bits of meat still attached are then put through a heat and centrifuge process, which separates the fat and produces 93 to 97 percent lean meat, according to BPI. Because the trimmings often are more susceptible to contamination, the meat is then treated with ammonium hydroxide gas to kill pathogens, like salmonella and E. coli. The U.S. Department of Agriculture does not require ammonium hydroxide to be included in the ingredients, considering it part of the process rather than part of the meat. The resulting meat has a finer texture. "That’s why you wouldn’t have a hamburger that would be made from nothing but LFTB – the texture would be softer," said Eric Mittenthal, a spokesperson for the American Meat Institute, a national trade association. The lean beef typically comprises no more than 15 percent of a burger, which consumers actually prefer over 100 percent coarse muscle meat, according to Edward Mills, a professor of meat science at Pennsylvania State University. At 25 percent, most people will notice an obvious difference in taste. So a burger with 85 percent of the lean product -- the amount pinpointed in the meme -- is not realistic. Several meat science professors we interviewed consider this product to be "real beef," even if consumers don’t. That perspective aligns with the U.S. Department of Agriculture definition of meat, which is meat "derived from advanced meat/bone separation machinery which is comparable in appearance, texture and composition to meat trimmings and similar meat products derived by hand." Under this definition, lean, finely textured beef -- the official term for "pink slime" -- is real beef, and a hamburger containing it could still be labeled 100 percent beef. The USDA does not require disclaimers of lean, finely textured beef in meat labels, but some companies, such as food giant Cargill, have opted to sticker their products if it includes this product. A cancer link? Now let’s look at the potential health effects of eating this kind of beef. Could it really lead to stomach and intestinal cancer? PolitiFact Georgia looked into a claim that "pink slime" is safe and rated it Mostly True. A 2009 New York Times piece detailed how the much-lauded sanitation process behind lean, finely textured beef was not as effective in killing pathogens as BPI said -- even as the meat spread to school cafeterias through the federal school lunch program. Between 2004 and late 2009, the product tested positive for salmonella 36 times out of 1,000, a rate four times greater than other suppliers, the Times reported. The story also quoted a USDA scientist referring to the product as "pink slime." Gerald Zirnstein wrote to USDA colleagues in 2002, "I do not consider the stuff to be ground beef, and I consider allowing it in ground beef to be a form of fraudulent labeling." The story raised a lot of eyebrows, spurring petitions and additional coverage from Oliver’s food show and others. McDonald’s joined Taco Bell and Burger King in no longer using meat treated with ammonium hydroxide in 2012, the Daily Mail reported. But meat experts said BPI’s product is just as safe -- or unsafe -- as all other beef products. The poultry industry has used meat from fat trimmings for 40 years, said Ted LaBuza, a professor of food science at the University of Minnesota. And ammonium hydroxide is used in many food products, such as puddings and cheese, and at levels 10 times higher than in meat, said Mittenthal and Mills. We could not find any studies to suggest that ammoniated beef can lead to stomach cancer or other intestinal disease. Even if you eat a burger with lean, finely textured beef every day, "you wouldn’t even come close" to posing a serious hazard to your health -- at least, not because of the ammonium hydroxide, said Mills. And it’s fairly common to use ammonia and other chemicals -- such as citric acid, which can leave a sour flavor -- to treat meat, LaBuza said. Chances of becoming sick are actually lower with beef from McDonald’s compared to a local butcher, who is beholden to less stringent standards than fast food restaurants, he said. Our ruling An Internet meme accuses McDonald’s of using hamburger meat that contains only 15 percent "real beef," with the rest made up of a "meat filler cleansed with ammonia, which causes stomach and intestinal cancer." McDonald’s stopped using the "filler" in question -- lean, finely textured beef or its somewhat misleading nickname "pink slime" -- back in 2011. When the product was on the grills, the burger most likely contained nowhere near 85 percent of meat filler, as experts said most consumers would notice a difference in taste after 25 percent. What’s more, the lean beef does not have any documented links to cancer. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2014-09-03T17:57:43	2014-08-27	['None']

pomt-09791	Health insurance companies deny "1 out of 5 treatments prescribed by doctors."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/18/health-care-america-now/tv-ad-overstates-health-insurance-denials/	Supporters of health care reform have portrayed insurance companies as insensitive and too quick to deny claims. In a recent television ad, Health Care for America Now, a group supporting the Democrats' health care reform bill, says insurance companies get wealthy by denying those claims. The group's ad mockingly explains "how to get rich" by showing a "book" written "by America's health insurance companies." Chapter 3 reads, "Deny 1 out of 5 treatments prescribed by doctors." A news release issued by HCAN attributed this statistic to a study released Sept. 2, 2009, by the California Nurses Association titled, "California's Real Death Panels: Insurers Deny 21% of Claims." (We checked another claim from the ad, about insurance companies paying CEOs $24 million per year, and rated it Barely True.) In a news release summarizing the findings, the nurses' group — an influential union — explained that researchers from its staff and its affiliate, the National Nurses Organizing Committee, examined data disclosed by insurers to the California Department of Managed Care, the state agency that regulates HMOs. The researchers reported that from 2002 through June 30, 2009, six of the largest insurers operating in California rejected 47.7 million claims for care, or 22 percent of all claims. According to the nurses' group, during the first six months of 2009, PacifiCare denied 39.6 percent of claims; Cigna denied 32.7 percent; HealthNet denied 30 percent; Kaiser Permanente denied 28.3 percent; Blue Cross denied 27.9 percent and Aetna denied 6.4 percent. But the California Department of Managed Care told us the study was misleading. Lynne Randolph, the department's deputy director of communications, said that what the nurses' group portrayed as denials are not necessarily what most consumers would think of as denials. Most patients probably think of a denial as when their claim is rejected because the plan doesn't cover a treatment or a particular doctor, or because the patient has hit a limit on coverage. But Randolph said that a sizable chunk of the denials counted by the nurses' group — though the exact amount is unclear — are for other reasons that are simply part of the health care bureaucracy that do not really affect a consumer's care. For instance, a claim might be denied because it was sent to the wrong insurer. (This is a common occurrence in California, Randolph and other experts said, because the state has many complicated business relationships between health plans and groups of doctors, and it's easy for claims to be unintentionally misdirected.) In fact, a patient may never even know that a given claim has been sent to the wrong place. Yet in the data used by the nurses' group, these claims are counted as denials. For that matter, any claim denied during a given quarterly report is counted as a denial, even if that claim is eventually paid during a subsequent quarter. Claims could also be counted as denied because information on the form was missing or incorrect, even if that is later corrected and the claim is paid. And a claim sent simultaneously to two payers is counted twice, meaning that the same claim might be counted as both a completed payment and a denial. Asked whether the nurses' group remains comfortable with its 1-in-5 estimate, spokesman Charles Idelson said it is. He noted that in the wake of the study's release, the state attorney general's office announced an "independent inquiry into how health maintenance organizations review and pay insurance claims submitted by doctors, hospitals and other medical providers." And he added that the group has received hundreds of reports from Californians about denied payments. "There's no doubt that these type of denials are occurring," Idelson said. Idelson added that even if the caveats cited by Randolph are valid, the fact that one of every five claims is denied at some stage adds to an administrative burden that hikes the cost of health care without improving care for patients. Randolph and Idelson actually agree on one point: Reliable statistics on why denials are made are not currently available. While the department undertakes periodic audits by sampling claims data, Randolph said, officials do not have good data on the causes of denials, forcing them to speculate. Idelson said he hopes the attorney general's investigation provides a better handle on the reasons for denials. The nurses' union numbers are significantly higher than other studies of denial rates. In 2007, America's Health Insurance Plans — a group representing insurers — conducted an internal survey of data from 19 health plans to determine the percentage of claims denied for "reasons that could affect consumers, including non-covered services, authorization issues, or network issues." The survey found that 2.36 percent of claims were denied. Specifically, 1.2 percent were denied due to non-covered services, 0.36 percent were denied due to benefit limits having been met, and 0.34 percent were denied due to pre-authorization, referral or utilization review issues. Smaller percentages were denied for the provider not being in the patient’s network, for issues with eligibility or pre-existing conditions and for issues related to experimental or unapproved treatments. A second study was produced by the American Medical Association, the main group representing doctors. The 2008 National Health Insurer Report Card found that for the biggest health insurers, rejection rates ranged from 2.65 percent to 6.8 percent — higher than AHIP's figures, but well below the nurses' study. It should be noted that all three groups have vested interests in the health care debate. In fact, it's also worth noting that the nurses' group has clashed with California's Republican governor, Arnold Schwarzenegger, who appointed the head of the California Department of Managed Care, although the department is mostly staffed by civil servants. Meanwhile, the state attorney general who is overseeing the investigation sparked by the nurses' report is Democrat Jerry Brown, a former governor who is running for an open gubernatorial seat next year. Now that we have the politics out of the way, let's recap. The Health Care for America Now ad said that insurers "deny 1 out of 5 treatments prescribed by doctors." But that claim is based solely on one study in one state, and in our view it doesn't provide enough evidence to back up the claim. The independent state agency that collected the data used in the nurses' study has raised significant doubt on the group's interpretations of that data. Many "denials" that were counted were not really what most people would consider a denial. And studies by other groups show much lower denial rates. So we rate this claim False.

pomt-14787	"California has more kids in poverty ... than virtually any other state."	mostly true	/california/statements/2015/dec/04/common-sense-kids-action/does-california-have-most-children-poverty/	A coalition of health and education advocates wants to keep alive an income tax on the wealthiest Californians through an extension of part of Proposition 30. Voters approved that measure in 2012 to pay for schools and balance the state’s budget. The income tax is due to expire in 2019. Common Sense Kids Action, a child advocacy group, stated in September that the tax on the wealthy should be extended, citing continued health and education needs for California’s large number of impoverished children. "California has more kids in poverty and greater income inequality than virtually any other state. The Invest in California’s Children Act asks the wealthiest to pay a little more so we can make the investments every California kid needs to have a great start in life," the advocacy group said. It said this in a press release unveiling one of multiple proposals to extend Proposition 30 that California voters will likely decide in November 2016. Here, we wanted to fact-check whether California has more kids in poverty than any other state, an eye-opening claim. Staff at Sacramento Food Bank & Family Services help clients in north Sacramento. Photo by Andrew Nixon/Capital Public Radio Our research The facts are pretty clear: California does have the most children under the age of 18 in poverty at 2.05 million, according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau report on the topic. That’s far more than Texas, the state with the next highest number of children in poverty with about 1.7 million. "The fact that the state has the most children in poverty is mainly driven by the fact that it is the most populous state," said Caroline Danielson, who studies poverty at the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC), a nonpartisan research group. At nearly 39 million, California’s population dwarfs second place Texas, which is home to about 27 million people. Third place Florida, with its nearly 20 million people, has about 650,000 children in poverty. To get a deeper understanding of child poverty in California, we wanted to see what percent of the state’s children are impoverished and how that compares with other states. The answer, it turns out, is hard to find and depends on what poverty measurement you look at. The census bureau’s standard reports show 22.7 percent of California’s children live in poverty. But fourteen other states had higher child poverty rates. The top three are New Mexico at 29.5 percent; Mississippi at 29.4 percent; and Louisiana at 27.9 percent, according to the bureau. California ranks as the most impoverished state in the bureau’s "supplemental poverty measure," which researchers consider more meaningful because it accounts for cost of living. That measure, however, does not distinguish between child and adult poverty. To hone in on the state’s child poverty rate, PPIC, created a California Poverty Measure. Through that analysis, which takes into account cost of living and government assistance programs, PPIC found California’s child poverty rate for 2012 was 24.9 percent, higher than the census bureau’s rate. The institute only studied California’s child poverty rate, so we can’t compare it with other states. And if that comparison were possible? "I would suspect that California’s child poverty rate would be in the top five in the nation," Danielson said. Our ruling Common Sense Kids Action says "California has more kids in poverty ... than virtually any state." The census bureau shows in its most recent standard report that California, indeed, has more people under 18 in poverty than any other state. But that doesn’t necessarily mean California has a bigger problem with child poverty — per capita — than all other states. There are 14 states, led by New Mexico and Mississippi, with higher child poverty rates, at least by the official measure. In conclusion, the statement is literally accurate. But it should be noted that California’s population is so large it leads the nation in practically everything. We rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-06202	"The Fed created $15 trillion in the bailout process" and $5 trillion went overseas.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/09/ron-paul/did-fed-create-15-trillion-during-bailout-and-send/	For Texas congressman and Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul, the causes of this country’s economic problems are both simple and profound. The government spends far too much, and the reason it can get away with this lies in the power of the Federal Reserve Bank to create more dollars out of thin air. As this argument goes, this drives down the value of the dollar, which creates an invisible tax paid by every business and household. Paul often speaks of the recklessness of the Fed, and at a house party in Rochester, N.H., he backed up this point by saying, "The Fed created 15 trillion dollars in the bailout process. Five of them were going overseas." We are checking both parts of that claim: that the Fed created that much money and about a third ended up outside our borders. To back up both points, the Paul campaign cited a report from the Government Accountability Office from July 2011 that assessed a handful of emergency loan programs run by the Federal Reserve between 2008 and 2010. The campaign highlighted tables 8, 20 and 30 in that report. Table 8 is the most comprehensive and contains the biggest numbers. At first blush, it appears Paul understates the situation. Between December, 2007 and July, 2010, more than $16 trillion passed from the Fed to the biggest banks, both domestic banks and subsidiaries of foreign-owned institutions. Tally up the amounts that went to subsidiaries, and about $6 trillion went to banks such as Barclays and the Royal Bank of Scotland. But Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, says that doesn’t mean that much money was created or left the country. "Paul presents half the picture," Calabria said, "And you could argue that it’s misleading." This is a case, Calabria says, where you can be factually correct and, in his words, "incoherent". Two big missing pieces put the accuracy of Paul’s statement on very shaky ground. It’s incorrect to say the Fed created $16 trillion because that’s a running total of lending, and the running total ignores a key reality. The dollars in those loan programs went out and came back in through a revolving door. Orice Williams Brown, managing director financial markets at the GAO, gives as an example a bank borrowing $10 billion at night, repaying it the next morning and then borrowing it again in the evening. The running tally would count that as $20 billion borrowed. "But if you look at it, it’s the same $10 billion dollars," Brown said. The GAO did figure out what the total would look like if you accounted for this churn of dollars. That’s in Table 9, which the Paul campaign did not cite. The grand total there is about $1.1 trillion which is a lot of money but much less than $15 trillion. The other missing piece is the current status of those loan programs. Also not cited by the Paul campaign, the GAO reported that after all that lending, the total amount still outstanding is $13 billion dollars. The money was created out of thin air, but when it was repaid, it no longer existed. This is where the Federal Reserve is different from any other bank in the US. "I think you’re creating money, because you’re certainly loaning it out," said Calabria. "But I also think you’re extinguishing it later." Calabria says at the end of the day, those tables in the GAO report don’t tell you much about the creation of money in any enduring respect. For that, you would look at the money supply. A common measure of the dollars in circulation is called the M2, and there’s no question it has gone up a lot. According to data from the Federal Reserve, we now have $2.1 trillion more floating around than we did four years ago. If one is concerned about the value of the dollar, this is an important figure. It isn’t the $15 trillion Paul mentioned, and it has just about nothing to do with the GAO report, but it is a real issue for anyone who cares about diluting the power of the dollar. In addition to the accuracy problems we just described, there’s another weakness in Paul’s assertion that $5 trillion went overseas. Whatever money was lent went to banks in the US that are owned by foreign banks, there is no way to know if any of those dollars went overseas, said John Makin, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. "If it went to a New York branch, it hasn’t gone overseas," Makin said. "Maybe it has, but it would be difficult to disentangle that." This is the consensus among economists. Dollars are fungible. A dollar in one account in New York might allow a dollar in another account in London to be put to use, but the reverse could also be true. If the banks had been doing a lot of lending -- that is, actually putting those dollars to work to rebuild the economy as the Fed intended -- one might be able to look at where those dollars ended up, Makin said. But for the most part, the banks have been sitting on their cash, he said. The GAO study tells us nothing definitive about where the money went. The only people who would know would be officials at the banks themselves. Not only is Paul’s number exaggerated, it isn't supported by the source his campaign cites. Our Ruling Apart from anything Paul said, it is true that the Fed has created about $2 trillion. But that's not what we're assessing. When Paul says the Fed created $15 trillion, he is misstating the work of the GAO, and he fails to account for the special power of the Federal Reserve to destroy the dollars it creates. His assertion that a great deal of money went overseas might be true, but no one knows, and again, Paul misinterprets the source he used. For that reason, we rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-00928	Says Debbie Wasserman Schultz "voted repeatedly to send terminally ill patients to prison."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/feb/26/drug-policy-alliance/pro-pot-group-says-debbie-wasserman-schultz-repeat/	As U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., weighs a potential presidential bid in 2016, a long list of politicians are considering whether to run for his Senate seat. That includes U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Weston, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, according to a Politico report on Feb. 17. (She’s not a lock on the Democratic side. A Tampa Bay Times Florida Insider Poll suggests U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy of Palm Beach County and newly elected U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham of Leon County could also be strong contenders.) One group was quick to attack Wasserman Schultz’s potential candidacy: The pro-pot lobby. Last year, she opposed Florida’s medical marijuana ballot initiative, which received almost 58 percent support, two points shy of passage. She also voted against a congressional amendment supported by advocates for medical marijuana. "She’s voted repeatedly to send terminally ill patients to prison. And we’re certainly going to make sure Floridians know that — not to mince words," Bill Piper, national affairs director with the Drug Policy Alliance, told Politico. Did Wasserman Schultz repeatedly take votes to send dying patients to prison? Politico reported in a follow-up article that Wasserman Schultz offered to change her opposition if Orlando lawyer John Morgan, the force behind the Florida ballot initiative, stopped bashing her, which she denied in an interview with the Sun Sentinel. Morgan hopes to get a revised version on the ballot in 2016. Wasserman Schultz’s marijuana voting record The Drug Policy Alliance pointed to several of Wasserman Schultz’s votes, including on a congressional amendment that banned the use of federal money to interfere with state medical marijuana laws. The goal of the amendment, sponsored by U.S. Rep. Dana Rohrabacher, R-Calif., was to prevent federal agents from raiding retail operations in states where medical pot is legal. (We looked at a similar claim by another pro-pot group about her vote in 2014.) Wasserman Schultz, one of 17 Democrats in the House to vote against the amendment on May 30, 2014, said she didn’t want to "limit the executive branch’s ability to enforce current federal law at their discretion." The language was attached to another bill and signed into law in December. (She voted against similar failed amendments four times between 2005 and 2012.) Her vote on those amendments "was very much focused on patients, and the fear of arrest they and their caregivers live under," Piper told PolitiFact Florida. He also argued that the Florida ballot measure -- which Wasserman Schultz opposed -- would have protected patients using medical marijuana. Last year, she said the Florida ballot initiative was "written too broadly and stops short of ensuring strong regulatory oversight from state officials." Piper also pointed to Wasserman Schultz’s "no" vote on an April 2014 congressional amendment on a spending bill for Veterans Affairs. The amendment, which failed, would have allowed VA doctors to talk to their patients about medical marijuana in states in which it is legal. But it’s a stretch to say that her "no" vote means she wants dying patients to go to prison. Wasserman Schultz spokesman Sean Bartlett told the Washington Post at the time that she felt it was premature to vote on the amendment. She wanted to wait for the results of a study approved by the federal government to look at marijuana’s potential effects on post-traumatic stress disorder. Do feds put terminally ill patients in prison? Do these votes mean she repeatedly voted to send terminally ill patients to prison? That’s a stretch. Even before her 2014 congressional votes, there were reasons that users were not a priority for the feds. In 2013, U.S. Deputy Attorney General James Cole issued a memorandum to federal attorneys telling them to focus on cartels or other criminal organizations. Beyond that, the Justice Department said it was content to allow state and local agencies "to address marijuana activity through enforcement of their own narcotics laws." The pro-pot lobby has pointed to cases of growers prosecuted for serving ill patients, including transplant recipient Jerry Duval, who was sentenced to 10 years in prison. Duval was a state-registered caregiver but prosecutors argued he peddled pot to non-patients. One high-profile case remains pending -- initially dubbed Kettle Falls 5, named for defendants in eastern Washington. Prosecutors say the five defendants were conspiring to manufacture and distribute marijuana, and they were also charged with possessing firearms. One defendant, Larry Harvey, told USA Today that the pot he grew was for personal medical use. On Feb. 18, the Justice Department dropped the charges against Harvey, 71, who was recently diagnosed with stage-four pancreatic cancer. However, the charges remain for his wife, two other relatives and a family friend. Law professors we interviewed told us that the federal government hasn’t focused on individuals who simply use marijuana for their own medical needs, and that was true even before the congressional amendment passed. "The feds don't send people to prison for using marijuana," Vanderbilt law Professor Robert Mikos told PolitiFact Florida. "They do deny some benefits to users (like access to some VA services). And the law authorizes prison for users. But the law is not enforced so rigidly." George Mason University law professor Ilya Somin, an adjunct scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that the amendment passed last year "may well constrain federal prosecution of medical marijuana suppliers in states where their activities are legal." However, he added, the fact that the Kettle Falls case is still going forward shows such prosecutions still can happen. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz "voted repeatedly to send terminally ill patients to prison," Piper said. She voted against amendments to ban the federal government from interfering with state medical marijuana laws. In theory, advocates believe that the amendment -- which passed late in 2014 after multiple attempts -- prevents the feds from going after sick marijuana users in states that allow medical marijuana. However, even before the amendment passed, dying patients who simply smoked joints that they obtained legally were not being hauled off to prison en masse by federal agents. Instead, the federal government focused on major suppliers or distributors. Saying Wasserman Schultz voted to send people to prison significantly exaggerates the issue. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/20f4b2f1-a33c-45f8-b2cb-8f8dad9c3b5b	None	Drug Policy Alliance	None	None	None	2015-02-26T12:02:24	2015-02-19	['None']
pomt-11755	"Only 20 percent of our current graduates from Texas high schools go ahead and achieve either a national certificate or a community college degree -- or a college degree."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2017/dec/05/tom-luce/tom-luce-understates-share-texas-students-succeedi/	Former gubernatorial hopeful Tom Luce, the Dallas lawyer long associated with Ross Perot and the landmark 1984 overhaul of state education laws, recently declared that few Texas students succeed in formal schooling past high school, we learned from a reporter’s tweet. Luce, the lead witness at a mid-November 2017 hearing held by the Texas House Select Committee on Economic Competitiveness, said: "Here are the facts: Only 20 percent of our current graduates from Texas high schools go ahead and achieve either a national certificate or a community college degree -- or a college degree. Now stop and think about that: Just 20 percent of our youngsters achieve one of those three credentials." Luce went on to say the state should be at 80 percent instead. That 20 percent figure was familiar. In March 2016, the state’s commissioner of higher education, Raymund Paredes, told lawmakers that just 20 percent of Texas eighth-graders earn a college degree or other advanced certificate within 11 years (or six years after high school). That conclusion tied to a research approach initially laid out in a February 2012 report commissioned by the Houston Endowment stating that researchers conducted a "cohort analysis of every student who started 8th grade in a Texas public school in 1996, 1997, and 1998," subsequently tracking progress over 11 years. By phone, Luce told us he got his figure from that same longitudinal research posted by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. Luce also provided a document headlined: "Given current trajectory, Texas at risk for decreasing educational attainment." The document states that 20.9 percent of the state’s eighth-graders in 2005 later earned a certificate or degree from a Texas college or university within six years after high school graduation--with achievement rates varying by ethnicity and economic status. A Coordinating Board staff spokeswoman, Kelly Carper Polden, responded to our emailed inquiry about educational attainment after high school by pointing out a page in the agency’s April 2017 Texas Public Higher Education Almanac indicating that by 2016, of every 100 students enrolled in eighth grade in fall 2005, 74 had graduated from a public high school, 54 had enrolled in higher education in the state and 21 had received a Texas higher education degree or certificate within six years of leaving high school. Of the 21, the almanac says, one student received a certificate, four received an associate degree and 15 received a bachelor’s degree or more. On point to Luce’s focus on high school graduates, Polden also told us that 27 percent of eighth-graders in fall 2005 who went on to graduate from high school had completed a Texas college degree or certificate by 2016. Graduates going to college out of state We recognized, though, that the provided percentages don’t take into account post high-school achievements outside Texas. Polden said the almanac figures do not fold in such students "because we don’t consistently have that data." We wondered how to account for students ultimately earning certificates or college degrees out of state. According to a February 2017 board document, about 5 percent of Texas high-school graduates in recent years enrolled the subsequent fall at an out-of-state college. By phone when we asked, David Gardner, the board’s deputy commissioner for academic planning and policy, estimated that at least 30 percent of all high school graduates who were in eighth grade in fall 2005 have since earned a post-high-school degree or certificate. Gardner said too that many students have accumulated college credit but not yet landed a degree. John Wyatt at the agency emailed us a pie chart indicating another 3 percent of high school graduates had completed a degree or certificate out of state by 2016. That chart indicates that 70 percent of those graduates hadn’t attained a post-high-school degree or certificate by 2016. SOURCE: Email, John Wyatt, director of external relations, THECB, Dec. 1, 2017 Another agency’s analysis We also queried the Texas Education Agency, which oversees public schools. By email, spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson told us how to generate an agency report gauging students who went on to get degrees from Texas institutions. Upshot: Some 24 percent of the state’s 2008-09 high-school graduates earned a Texas community college or four-year college degree by 2015-16: SOURCE: Report, "2015-16 Texas Public Schools State Summary," Texas Education Agency (fetched from website, "Education Summary - Statewide," Texas Public Education Information Resource, TEA and THECB, Nov. 29, 2017) We circled back to Luce, who said by phone that if 27 percent of high school graduates got a Texas college degree or certificate within six years of graduation, that’s "still a problem." Our ruling Luce said: "Only 20 percent of our current graduates from Texas high schools go ahead and achieve either a national certificate or a community college degree -- or a college degree." This claim has an element of a truth in that a minority of Texas high school graduates shortly earn college degrees or other certificates. But Luce's 20 percent figure is incomplete and inaccurate. Notably, it's limited to students landing degrees in Texas only, leaving out students who attended college out of state. In contrast, we found that some 30 percent of high school graduates landed a college degree or other post-high-school certificate within six years of graduation — which leaves Luce's percentage off by 50 percent. The number closest to what Luce cited applies to eighth-graders enrolled in fall 2005; 21 percent of them ultimately earned a college degree or other educational certificate from a Texas institution. We rate Luce’s statement at the hearing Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-04989	Says stimulus money went to buy electric cars from Finland as a payback to Obama supporters.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/20/mitt-romney/romney-ad-says-stimulus-money-went-buy-electric-ca/	In the presidential battle over who sent more jobs overseas, Mitt Romney and his supporters are fond of citing the example of Fisker Automotive, the maker of a high-end plug-in electric sedan. In an ad called "Where did all the money go," the Romney campaign suggests President Obama has a lot of explaining to do. "Where did all the Obama stimulus money go? Friends, donors, campaign supporters, special interest groups. Where did the Obama stimulus money go? Solyndra. $500 million taxpayer dollars. Bankrupt. So where did the Obama stimulus money go? Windmills from China. Electric cars from Finland." The day after that ad launched, Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus expanded on the attack in Philadelphia. "President Obama took half a billion dollars of your taxpayer money and gave it to Fisker Automotive because they promised to create jobs at their Wilmington plant.... " Priebus said. "But they didn't create jobs for you. Their factory in Delaware... was supposed to be open today, but instead it's closed. And Fisker is still building their cars in Finland." There’s a few things to check here. Did stimulus money go to Finland? What is the financial deal between the United States and Fisker and did it produce jobs in the U.S.? Was that deal a payback to special friends of the Obama administration? PolitiFact tackled many of these questions in some detail last April. Back then, an ad from the conservative group, Americans for Prosperity asserted "The Obama administration admitted the truth, that $2.3 billion of tax credits went overseas ... Half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland." What Fisker got In 2009, an American car company, Fisker Automotive, won a total of $528 million in loan guarantees to build two high-end electric hybrids, the Karma and the Atlantic (originally named Nina). The ultimate goal was to build the Atlantic at a defunct auto plant in Delaware. Work on the Atlantic is currently on hold, and the Delaware plant has yet to open. The engineering and design for the Karma was done in the United States, but according to the U.S. Energy Department, the plan from the beginning was to build the cars in Finland. Fisker Automotive told ABC News this work employed about 500 Finnish workers. Company spokesman Roger Ornisher told PolitiFact that the plant has produced over 1,500 Karmas so far. Not stimulus dollars The claim about American stimulus dollars paying for jobs in Finland is flawed in several important respects. First, the money did not come from the stimulus. This nuance seems to slip through the cracks again and again, so the correct information bears repeating. That money came as a loan -- not a grant or a tax credit -- through the Energy Department’s Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program. That program predates the Obama administration. It was not part of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, also known as the stimulus. In fact, it’s a program signed into existence by President George W. Bush in 2007 and first funded by legislation Bush signed in 2008. The only reference to this loan program in the stimulus is that it received $10 million for administrative expenses. The Bush administration was in charge when Fisker Automotive filed its application. The Obama administration was in charge when the company’s loan was approved. The stimulus bill had nothing to do with it. Not half a billion dollars Even as a loan, Fisker Automotive has not received anywhere close to half a billion dollars. So far, Fisker has drawn down about $193 million, and the Energy Department won’t release any more until the company completes more work. The government loan package came in two parts. An initial $170 million was for design and engineering to complete the Karma using at least 65 percent American-made parts. A second $360 million loan would be to open an American plant to build the Atlantic. Just about all of that second part is still in government hands. For those who would say that money is fungible and there’s no guarantee that some of the federal dollars were not used to pay Finnish workers, the company has an answer. It says it raised much more money from private investors; Ornisher told us the total is now over $1 billion. While Ornisher won’t say how much Fisker spent in Finland, he says it was "easily within" the amount of that private money. Fisker Automotive also says that the accounting firm of PriceWaterhouseCoopers audits its accounts to ensure that all federal dollars are spent in the U.S. The jobs Ornisher says the Karma and Atlantic projects support some 500 Fisker employees in the United States. He says it’s much harder to estimate the number of jobs associated with the supply of parts -- 65 percent of which are supposed to come from American companies. Ornishers also says the company has sold about 1,000 cars in the U.S. and that provides work at some 45 retailers across the country. Political connections The ad hints darkly that a lot of this is tied to political friends of the president. During a campaign briefing, senior campaign adviser Ed Gillespie singled out the Fisker Automotive deal and one of its investors, John Doerr. "You know you have John Doerr, who raised a lot of money for President Obama (and) got appointed to an economic recovery advisory board. "And then, his firm had a big investment in Fisker Automotive, which got over half a billion dollars in loan guarantees from the Department of Energy, which did not result in jobs being created in America, but actually jobs being created overseas in Finland. But Kleiner Perkins (Doerr’s firm) did quite well." According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Doerr is a big Democratic donor -- over $175,000 since 2008. And Ornisher described Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers as "one of the major investors" in Fisker. But as the Washington Post noted, Kleiner has many partners, and some of them are hefty donors on the Republican side. One, Ray Lane, backed John McCain in 2008. Our ruling The Romney campaign ad said that stimulus dollars paid for jobs in Finland. There is nothing accurate in this claim. The federal loan guarantees the company received were not part of the stimulus, and there is no evidence that any government dollars paid for work done by Finnish workers. Ornisher, the company spokesman, told us the contract to produce the cars in Finland had been signed before the federal loan was approved. Also, measures were put in place to ensure that taxpayer dollars only went for work done in America. Fisker Automotive has yet to open the factory in Delaware but it also hasn’t received the large government loan needed to do that. The ad’s suggestion that the Fisker loan was a reward to a political supporter also falls flat. The program was approved initially by the Bush administration. We rule the claim False.

pomt-09218	John Mica's brother is an oil lobbyist and his daughter represents the natural gas industry.	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/may/18/heather-beaven/us-rep-john-mica-family-oil-ties/	A relatively unknown Democrat looking to unseat longtime Florida U.S. Rep. John Mica is using the Deepwater Horizon oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico as a way to play up Mica's family ties to the oil industry. Mica, R-Winter Park, has represented Florida's 7th Congressional District since 1993. The district, which covers the northeast coast of Florida, has been considered a safe seat for Republicans (John McCain carried the district by 7 percentage points in 2008). Democrat Heather Beaven, a Navy veteran, said in a May 12, 2010, e-mail to supporters that Mica's brother is a lobbyist for the oil industry and that his daughter represents an interest group that supports increased offshore drilling for oil and natural gas. "Brother of only Fla. lawmaker to support offshore drilling is an oil lobbyist," Beaven said in the e-mail, copying a headline from the Orlando Sentinel. Later, she said, "John Mica's daughter represents the Consumers Alliance for Affordable Natural Gas and the Citizens Alliance for Energy Security in support of increased access to offshore oil & natural gas." The e-mail includes other ties between Mica and the oil industry then asks "Disgusted yet?" An accompanying link directs supporters to Beaven's online campaign contribution page. In this item, we wanted to see if Beaven's description of Mica's family connections to the energy industry is accurate. Mica has been a longtime supporter of offshore oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, advocating for drilling well before gas prices neared $4 a gallon in 2008. Mica was the lone member of the Florida Congressional delegation to not sign a letter in 2003 to stop the federal government from surveying Florida coastal waters for oil and natural gas. In 2006, the Palm Beach Post reported that Mica was only one of two Florida House members to vote to allow gas drilling within 9 miles of Florida's Gulf Coast. That measure failed. Even now, Mica touts on his campaign website that he scored a 100 percent rating on the "Freedom From Oil Scorecard," published by the conservative political advocacy group Americans for Prosperity. Mica maintained his support for offshore oil drilling in a May 13 statement provided to PolitiFact Florida. My position on drilling for gas and oil remain the same. I have always advocated drilling based on sound science, technology and employing safe measures, taking into consideration depths and currents. Unfortunately most of the past restrictions on drilling have been based on politics rather than sound science and safe procedures. Based on what has occurred in the Gulf, I would urge Congress to make certain that proper safeguards are required including a failsafe shutoff valve, and having a standby mechanism like the dome in place with tried and proven technology available before rather than after the fact. With 3,400 oil and 600 gas rigs already in the Gulf of Mexico, action on insuring against another disaster is important. Furthermore, even if Florida has a 100, 125, 150 or 200 mile ban and other states and countries like Mexico allow close or deepwater rigs, our state can still remain at risk without these protective measures. Now, onto his family. The brother Beaven is referring to in her e-mail is David Mica. He currently serves as executive director of the Florida Petroleum Council, a group that --- the name kind of gives it away --- supports increased offshore drilling. David Mica has called on the Florida Legislature to open up state waters as close as 3 miles offshore to oil and gas drilling, and has continued to push a pro-drilling position even after the Deepwater Horizon leak. As Beaven claimed, he also is a registered lobbyist in Florida. "We've got to keep our commitment to explore, develop, and produce oil and gas," David Mica told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel in an article published April 30, 2010. "You can't give up on technology." And in the Florida Times-Union, he equated the leak to the airplane industry. "At the end of the day, we can't stop flying airplanes when one crashes," Mica said. Mica's daughter, D'Anne Mica, is the founder of Mica Strategic Communications, a communications and public relations company in Winter Park. Among the clients listed on her website are Consumers Alliance for Affordable Natural Gas and Citizens Alliance for Energy Security. Consumers Alliance for Affordable Natural Gas was formed in 2004 by a group of chemical companies to push for, among other things, increased natural gas exploration. The group, however, is dormant. It hasn't been mentioned in a newspaper article since 2007 and we couldn't find the group's website, if it ever had one. A representive for PR firm Dutko Worldwide, which also has done work for Consumers Alliance for Affordable Natural Gas, said the group has not been operating for a few years. "The Alliance is no longer together," said vice president Tracy Hammond. "I don't believe it's been operating for a couple of years now." We couldn't find any reference to the other group -- Citizens Alliance for Energy Security -- outside of Beaven's e-mails, D'Anne Mica's client list and her online business profile. We called Mica Strategic Communications to see if the two groups remain clients, but the phone number appears to have been changed or disconnected. We got this message: "TheOnStar subscriber you're trying to reach is unavailable." And we couldn't find a Mica Strategic Communications listed in the Florida Department of State Division of Corporations. That leads us to believe the business may be dormant as well. In a January 2010 interview with ABC News, D'Anne Mica suggested that her business was still active, but did not discuss her energy clients. D'Anne Mica was being interviewed after being arrested for driving under the influence. After her arrest, questions surfaced about some of her PR work and how it may have overlapped with her father's congressional priorities. "My father has no idea what I do in my business," she told ABC News. "And I have no idea what he does in his." In every case, the Micas have denied any connection between their relationships and their work. That brings us back to Beaven's e-mail. In trying to use the Deepwater Horizon oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico as a way to play up John Mica's family ties to the oil industry, she claimed that Mica's brother is an oil lobbyist and that his daughter represents a group that promotes offshore oil and gas drilling. Mica's brother, David Mica, is currently a lobbyist and executive director of the Florida Petroleum Council. Mica's daughter, D'Anne Mica, once listed Consumers Alliance for Affordable Natural Gas as a PR client, a group that lobbied for increased natural gas drilling. The only real question is if D'Anne Mica currently represents the oil and gas group as Beaven suggests in her e-mail. On that point, there's slim evidence she does. The group hasn't been mentioned in a newspaper article since 2007, doesn't have an active website we can find and a person who worked for the alliance said they've been out of operation for a couple of years. Finding no additional supporting material, we rate Beaven's claim Half True.	None	Heather Beaven	None	None	None	2010-05-18T15:24:52	2010-05-12	['John_Mica']

pomt-14452	On Donald Trump's track record in business	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/06/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-praised-donald-trumps-business-skill-2/	Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican nominee for president, burst onto the 2016 presidential campaign on March 3, giving a speech in which he tore into Republican frontrunner Donald Trump. "Let me put it plainly: If we Republicans choose Donald Trump as our nominee, the prospects for a safe and prosperous future are greatly diminished," Romney said. Part of Romney’s speech addressed Trump’s record as a businessman. But many observers were quick to point out that Romney was singing a different tune when he accepted Trump’s endorsement early in the 2012 presidential primary season. This backstory came up when Romney appeared on the March 6 edition of NBC’s Meet the Press. "Were you just sort of saying something you had to say four years ago in order to accept his endorsement?" asked host Chuck Todd. Romney responded, "Well, Donald Trump has made a lot of money for himself. And there’s no question that he’s got a lot of money in his pockets and has been successful on that score. But if you look at his record overall … you say, ‘OK, he made a lot of money for himself, he inherited a lot of money from his dad, but this is not a guy who is a self-made man, and this is a guy who’s crushed a lot of people along the way.’ " Then, Todd asked Romney, "Why’d you say so many things about his business career, when clearly you’re not impressed?" Romney responded, "You know, he’s made a lot of money for himself, and I’m gracious enough in a setting where someone has endorsed me to point out that he’s been successful and made a lot of money -- he has a lot of hotels and so forth. But you can’t also ignore the fact that he’s had a lot of failures." We took a look at Romney’s remarks now and in 2012 to see whether he’s flip-flopped on Trump’s business record. Here’s what Romney said during his March 3 speech when he criticized Trump: "But wait, you say, isn’t he a huge business success that knows what he’s talking about? No, he isn’t. His bankruptcies have crushed small businesses and the men and women who worked for them. He inherited his business, he didn’t create it. And what ever happened to Trump Airlines? How about Trump University? And then there’s Trump Magazine and Trump Vodka and Trump Steaks, and Trump Mortgage? A business genius he is not." And here’s what Romney said in 2012 at a news conference in Las Vegas with Trump at his side: "Being in Donald Trump's magnificent hotel and having his endorsement is a delight. I'm so honored and pleased to have his endorsement. ... Donald Trump has shown an extraordinary ability to understand how our economy works to create jobs for the American people. He's done it here in Nevada. He's done it across the country. ... I spent my life in the private sector. Not quite as successful as this guy. But successful nonetheless." Romney’s comments in Las Vegas are less specific than what he said in 2016 -- he never singled out specific business ventures, other than the hotel where the endorsement event was being held. Still, in 2012, Romney communicated an overall admiration for Trump’s business acumen, citing his "extraordinary ability" to understand how to create jobs "across the country." Romney even said that his own -- and not insubstantial -- business accomplishments were "not quite as successful" as Trump’s. When we contacted Romney’s camp, they urged us to review the entirety of Romney’s interviews after making his anti-Trump speech, including with NBC’s Matt Lauer, Fox Business News’ Neil Cavuto, CNN’s Gloria Borger, and Bloomberg’s Mark Halperin. Not all of these interviews addressed Romney’s views of Trump’s business skills -- in the Fox Business and Bloomberg interviews, for instance, he emphasized as a reason for his change of heart some of the things Trump has done and said during the campaign, such as his comments about Muslims and Mexicans, his criticism of former President George W. Bush and his mixed signals on condemning the Ku Klux Klan. But when Romney did address direct questions about his views on Trump’s business record, his message seemed to be that he was focusing on the positive part of Trump’s business history in 2012 and giving a more detailed, nuanced recounting in 2016. "Oh, let me tell you, this is a guy if we look at the past, this is a guy who was very successful and made a lot of money for himself," Romney said in an interview on the March 6 Fox News Sunday. "But at the same time, take a very close look and look how many small people he crushed along the way and how many failures he had." And in his interview with Lauer, Romney said, "Oh, he's a successful guy -- he's made a lot of money -- but he hasn't been uniformly successful, and he's far from a business genius. Look, Trump University, Trump steaks, Trump mortgage, Trump vitamin company. One after the other, failure after failure. So just because he's made a lot of money, one, you don't measure your life by how much money you've made, but just because he's made a lot of money doesn't mean that his economic policies are right for America." Still, we see his comments four years apart as being fundamentally different in their message. Hearing Romney’s 2012 comments, a listener would not have picked up on the notion he asserted in 2016 -- that "a business genius (Trump) is not." We rate Romney’s view on Trump’s business record a Full Flop.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2016-03-06T18:12:22	2016-03-06	['None']

pomt-07511	"Fifty percent of our students who enter higher education need to take remedial courses because they are not prepared for college-level work."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/apr/09/donna-howard/state-rep-donna-howard-says-50-percent-students-wh/	As floor debate on the Texas House’s version of the 2012-13 state budget wound down Sunday, state Rep. Donna Howard decried balancing the budget with spending cuts alone. The Austin Democrat, who voted against the bill, said lawmakers have falsely painted the state’s government as "bloated," with enough revenue to run Texas. "I have a hard time believing that when when 50 percent of our students who enter higher education need to take remedial courses because they are not prepared for college-level work," Howard said. We wondered whether half of the state’s 1.3 million students enrolled in higher ed really start off needing to catch up. To back up Howard’s statement, Eleanor D’Ambrosio, her chief of staff, passed on data from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, the agency that oversees higher education in the state. But first, some background: As of fall 2003, state law requires students entering public higher education institutions in Texas to pass a Texas Success Initiative exam assessing their readiness in reading, mathematics and writing — unless they meet one of six exemption standards, including a combined verbal and math SAT score of 1,070, with a minimum of 500 on either portion of the test. Students must take and pass the exam before they’re eligible to enroll in college-level classes. Those who don’t pass one or all parts of the exam are placed in a "developmental education program designed to help the student achieve college readiness," according to a June 2010 overview of the initiative by the coordinating board. According to an e-mail to Howard’s office from Lizette Montiel, a spokeswoman with the coordinating board, in fall 2008, 48.6 percent of students entering community colleges directly after graduating from high school failed to meet Texas Success Initiative standards in at least one area. The coordinating board collects the data from public institutions of higher education, the e-mail says. According to the e-mail, that rate has dropped from 54.3 percent in 2003. D’Ambrosio also sent us a link to a October 2008 column on the coordinating board’s website by Higher Education Commissioner Raymund Paredes. Paredes, arguing that some pre-Advanced Placement classes in Texas high schools aren’t rigorous enough, wrote that coordinating board data "show that 50 percent of entering Texas college students require remedial education." She also passed on the agency’s strategic June 18 plan for fiscal years 2011-15. Addressing challenges Texas colleges may face in bringing under-prepared students up to college standards, the report says: "Nearly half of all first-time college students are not college ready in at least one of the core academic areas of math, reading or writing." Case closed? Not quite. Board spokesman Dominic Chavez told us that in academic parlance, "college" refers solely to the state’s community colleges. Texas has more than 50 community college districts, some with multiple campuses. The board refers to four-year institutions as universities, Chavez said. Calling the June 2010 report "a poorly-worded document," Chavez said those involved with higher education would catch that distinction, but there’s "no way that someone from the general public would look at that and know that there’s a nuance there." Howard "read exactly and said exactly what’s in the report," Chavez said. The report does not specify that "college students" only refers to people enrolled in community colleges. So, nearly half of all students who enroll in community college immediately after high school aren’t college-ready in at least one academic area, Chavez said, but that statistic changes when you include four-year universities. In fall 2008, 31 percent of students who enrolled in public higher education institutions — both community colleges and four-year universities— immediately after high school weren’t ready in at one academic area. The rate is even lower for students who enrolled in four-year universities right out of high school. Only about 14 percent of those students aren’t college-ready in one or more academic area. Include freshman university students who have been out of high school for longer, and the not-ready rate rises to about 28 percent. Add community college students who have been out of high school for a few years, and that figure jumps to 38 percent. "Community colleges traditionally serve students who are less prepared," Chavez said. But "most students who are enrolled in our universities are college-ready." Do all students who fail to meet the Texas Success Initiative standards in at least on area require remedial coursework? In most cases, yes, Chavez said. When we followed up with Howard’s office, D’Ambrosio told us that Howard was "trying to convey (in her own words) a data point that had been presented to her" by the coordinating board. "Rep. Howard relies on state agencies to provide her with information and statistics on various topics," D’Ambrosio said. "Rep. Howard did not ask for clarification when she was presented with information that said nearly half of all first-time college students are not college ready in at least one of the core academic areas of math, reading or writing." Upshot: Howard based her statement on a state report that says nearly 50 percent of all incoming college students fresh out of high school are underprepared for college and require remedial attention. However, the report doesn’t explain — and Howard didn’t realize — that the statistic excludes students at four-year universities. Taking into account all students who enroll in a Texas institution of higher education, nearly 40 percent aren’t prepared for some aspect of college-level work. And if you only look at students who enter higher education directly from high school, that rate drops to 31 percent. We rate Howard’s statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12815	Graduation rates in Buffalo’s school district, which were "around 48 percent are now up to 64 percent" since Say Yes Buffalo launched.	true	/new-york/statements/2017/feb/10/byron-brown/buffalo-schools-graduation-rates/	Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo wants to give $10 million to Buffalo’s Say Yes to Education program as part of his proposed state budget. The money would come from a proposed $500 million second phase of the Buffalo Billion program. The Say Yes program provides college scholarships to public and charter school graduates in Buffalo. The program has helped boost graduation rates in the city’s school district, Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said at a budget hearing in Albany. "Since the program has been in place in our community, high school graduation rates, which sadly were abysmally low in Buffalo hovering around 48 percent are now up to 64 percent," Brown said at the hearing. Is Brown right about the district’s graduation rates? Say Yes to Education The Say Yes program was launched in Buffalo in December 2011. Buffalo became the second city with the program, following Syracuse. The first graduates eligible for the program graduated in 2013. The program opened with $15 million in funding and has since raised $25 million from private donors. Graduation rates The city school district recorded a 46.8 percent four-year graduation rate through June of the 2011-2012 school year, according to the New York state Education Department. The rate increased to 53.4 percent in 2013, the first year graduates were eligible for the program. The graduation rate then dropped to 52.8 percent in 2014, but climbed to 58.4 percent in 2015. The district had a 61.7 percent graduation rate through June 2016, the state Education Department said Friday. The rate is 64 percent when August graduates are included. That information was not publicly available when Brown made his claim. Our ruling Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown said graduation rates, once "around 48 percent are now up to 64 percent" in Buffalo’s school district since the Say Yes program began in Buffalo. Brown is right that graduation rates have improved since the program was first offered to graduates in 2013. Close to 47 percent graduated the year before the Say Yes program was first offered, and the graduation rate through August 2016 is 64 percent according to data released today. We rate his claim as True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ad3583b7-e18a-4a1b-8d6d-9b1bf51f69a9	None	Byron Brown	None	None	None	2017-02-10T16:00:00	2017-01-30	['None']
pomt-08672	Like me, Scott Walker opposed the 1998 transportation bill and the $9 billion of wasteful spending.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/11/jim-sensenbrenner/jim-sensenbrenner-says-scott-walker-opposed-massiv/	If a Mark Neumann TV ad in response to a Scott Walker TV ad is the political equivalent of tit-for-tat, what do you call a response to the response? In this case, more confusion for voters. The ad in question is a radio spot by Walker that features U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, talking about a 1998 transportation spending bill that has become a central issue in the GOP gubernatorial primary. Neumann, in Congress at the time, voted for it. Sensenbrenner opposed it -- and says Walker, then a state lawmaker, opposed it, too. "Let me set the record straight," Sensenbrenner says in the 60-second spot."I served with Mark Neumann. Mark Neumann voted for $9 billion in pork projects when he was in Congress. He voted yes for wasteful transportation spending. I voted against that bill because it was full of waste and payoffs to special interests. Like me, Scott Walker opposed the bill and the $9 billion of wasteful spending." So does the blunt-talking Sensenbrenner set the record straight? Hardly. Neumann did vote for the bill but argues Walker was way off base to link him to Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi based on that vote. PolitiFact Wisconsin rated the connection False. In his counter-ad, Neumann says Walker supported the bill at the time. We rated that Barely True -- Walker publicly supported a provision of the measure relating to how some $241 million in federal money for the area could be spent, not the whole bill. We turned to the Sensenbrenner to ask for support for his statement. His longtime chief of staff, Tom Schreibel, referred us to Walker, saying they got the information from him. Jill Bader, Walker’s campaign spokeswoman, said the basis was Walker’s own recollection this week. "We had a conversation with Scott in which Scott recalled opposing the bill," Bader said. Neither Bader nor Schreibel could identify any public statements from the time indicating Walker’s opposition to the bill. In fact, the only public statements that have surfaced are the ones related to a provision in the bill authored by U.S. Rep. Tom Petri, R-Fond du Lac. That change allowed money set aside mainly for a proposed light rail system to go to freeway reconstruction projects. Walker joined five other state lawmakers representing Milwaukee County in applauding that piece of it. Any other evidence? Schreibel said it’s common in Washington for lawmakers to support an amendment to a bill, but vote against the final product: "The pig's ears might be cute, but do you want to buy the whole pig?" And Bader suggested that because Sensenbrenner was Walker’s congressman, he would have supported Sensenbrenner’s position. That’s all as much of a reach as the original move by Walker to tie Neumann to Pelosi. So far the only information on the record from the time shows Walker supported at least a portion the bill. It’s possible that more evidence will surface to back up Sensenbrenner’s claim that Walker joined him in opposing the bill. But for now we rate it False.

pomt-04867	"Gov. Romney himself, with 28 other Republican governors, supported policies that would have eliminated the time limits in the welfare reform law and allowed people to stay on welfare forever."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/09/jay-carney/carney-says-romney-favored-welfare-forever-legisla/	The White House has come out swinging against false charges from Mitt Romney that President Barack Obama is dropping work requirements for people who receive public assistance. In a tough television ad, the Romney campaign claims Obama wants to dismantle welfare reform so that recipients don’t have to work or seek job training. "They just send you your welfare check," the ad says. We found the ad’s claim wrong and inflammatory, and rated it Pants On Fire. In the meantime, White House spokesman Jay Carney called the ad "categorically false" and "blatantly dishonest." Then he added this: "Now, the ad is particularly outrageous as Gov. Romney himself, with 28 other Republican governors, supported policies that would have eliminated the time limits in the welfare reform law and allowed people to stay on welfare forever," Carney said. The notion that 29 Republican governors ever favored legislation allowing lifetime memberships on welfare struck us as stunning, to say the least. This called for a fact-check. First, some background Both controversies are about Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the modern federal welfare program. TANF, as it’s called, limits how long families can receive aid, and it requires recipients to eventually go to work. It also includes stringent reporting requirements for states to show they are successfully moving people off welfare and and into the workforce. In July 2012, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services put out a memo saying that the department wanted to give states more flexibility in meeting those requirements. The memo notifies states "of the Secretary’s willingness to exercise her waiver authority ... to allow states to test alternative and innovative strategies, policies, and procedures that are designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families." The memo specified several times that any states seeking waivers must show that employment will grow under their pilot programs. But Romney’s campaign, as well as several other leading conservatives, characterized the plan as "gutting welfare reform" by opening the door to greatly relaxed standards for what qualifies as work. Carney’s response In addition to Romney’s claim being untruthful, the Obama campaign and the White House say it’s hypocritical. They point to a 2005 letter that Romney and 28 other Republican governors signed in support of legislation to extend the welfare reform law. The governors wrote that an extension was needed so they could effectively implement TANF block grants in their states, and they emphasized the positive aspects of a bill being considered in the Senate known as the PRIDE Act. Those included a stable funding stream, support for abstinence education, child care and, mostly notably "state flexibility." "The Senate bill provides states with the flexibility to manage their TANF programs effectively and serve low-income populations. Increased waiver authority, allowable work activities, availability of partial work credit and the ability to coordinate state programs are all important aspects of moving recipients from welfare to work," the letter states. That sounds an awful lot like what the Obama administration has outlined in its memo about state waivers. But Carney went a step further, claiming that Romney "supported policies that would have eliminated the time limits in the welfare reform law and allowed people to stay on welfare forever." The White House pointed us to a provision of the PRIDE Act allowing waivers of "any requirement applicable to the program." The bill listed several exclusions from what could be waived. The list does not specifically prohibit time limits from being waived. So the White House is basing its claim on Romney’s support for a law that did not explicitly prohibit the possibility of lifetime welfare benefits. But nothing in the bill eliminates those limits outright, and drawing that direct connection is a huge and unsubstantiated leap of logic. We reviewed news coverage of the bill as well as academic analyses of it, and found no discussion at all of time limits being waived. Jill Kozeny, spokeswoman for Sen. Charles Grassley, told PolitiFact the bill would not have permitted time extensions. Grassley, R-Iowa, was the bill's sponsor. Ron Haskins, a fellow with the centrist Brookings Institution who helped draft versions of the 1996 reform law as a congressional staffer, added that if a state sought any major relaxing of time limits, it would be unlikely to get approved at the federal level. "You could ask for some waiver that would say something like, you could have 50 percent of your caseload on for 10 years or more. I don’t think any secretary would grant that, but you could ask for it," Haskins said. Beyond that, Romney displayed no intention of seeking any such waiver. The same year he signed the letter, he was battling the Democratic-led legislature in Massachusetts. As governor, he sought a plan that would have roughly doubled the number of welfare recipients in Massachusetts who were required to work. His plan, according to the Boston Globe, eliminated "exemptions for pregnant women in the third trimester, mothers with children between 1 and 2 years old, and about 5,600 people who are considered disabled under state standards but not under federal ones." More importantly, Romney’s plan also imposed a five-year lifetime limit for receiving benefits. At the time, Massachusetts families could only receive benefits for two years in any five-year period. Our ruling Carney said that Romney "supported policies that would have eliminated the time limits in the welfare reform law and allowed people to stay on welfare forever." The claim stems from Romney’s support for a federal bill reauthorizing TANF, which allowed for certain waivers but did not specifically prohibit waivers of the time limit that people could stay on welfare. But the bill itself and numerous discussions of it indicate that time limits were simply not an issue. Carney’s claim takes the absence of a mention of them and turns it inside out to accuse Romney of supporting "welfare forever" policies. It’s a distortion that makes something out of nothing. We rate it False.	None	Jay Carney	None	None	None	2012-08-09T14:59:35	2012-08-07	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Mitt_Romney']
pomt-01658	Under Rosemary Lehmberg, the "Travis County D.A.’s office" convened the grand jury that indicted Rick Perry.	false	/texas/statements/2014/aug/21/sarah-palin/palin-incorrect-rosemary-lehmberg-convened-grand-j/	In an online commentary, Sarah Palin suggested a sign of Democratic corruption is the Texas district attorney whose resignation was sought by Republican Gov. Rick Perry convened the grand jury that indicted him. We can't judge Palin’s corruption opinion. But the former Alaska governor's claim about the DA’s connection to the grand jury is incorrect. Palin, in a commentary posted on the Fox News website Aug. 17, 2014, said: "This ridiculous politically motivated ‘indictment’ of" Perry "stems from the ugly thug tactics of the ‘politics of personal destruction’ that the left is known for." "First and foremost," Palin said, "today's liberals have no shame. Case in point: Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg." Palin recapped Lehmberg’s drunken driving conviction from 2013 and noted that Lehmberg refused to resign afterward. "Lehmberg's D.A.’s office runs the state’s Public Integrity Unit, which prosecutes public crimes like government corruption," Palin wrote, and after Perry tried to get her to resign or face his veto of the unit’s state funding, Palin said, Democrat Lehmberg’s "liberal supporters filed an ethics complaint against Perry..." Subsequently, Palin wrote, the "Travis County D.A.'s Office, still under Lehmberg, convened a grand jury, and – surprise, surprise! – Perry was ‘indicted.’" It’s a fact that a liberal-leaning group, Texans for Public Justice, which monitors the influence of money in state politics and the courts, submitted a complaint to the Travis County district attorney’s office on June 14, 2013 about Perry’s actions. The complaint was submitted a day after the Austin American-Statesman revealed Perry was threatening to veto a $7.5 million, two-year appropriation to the Public Integrity Unit, housed in the district attorney’s office, unless Lehmberg resigned. Texans for Public Justice’s complaint alleged that the threat amounted to a violation of state laws prohibiting coercion of public officials. The day the complaint came in, Gregg Cox, the attorney who heads the Public Integrity Unit, told the Statesman that Lehmberg’s office would not investigate it. "It’s clear, it would not be appropriate for us to have any role in this," Cox said then. Upshot: Lehmberg subsequently recused herself from the matter, which ended up being overseen by a Republican judge from Bexar County and a San Antonio-based special prosecutor appointed by the judge, neither one picked by Lehmberg or her office. In checking Palin’s claim, we reached out to relevant judges and Lehmberg’s office, finding no sign the DA’s office played a role in convening or guiding the grand jury that indicted Perry. By telephone, Bert Richardson of San Antonio, the senior state district judge overseeing the Perry case, and Republican Billy Ray Stubblefield, the Williamson County state district judge who appointed Richardson to oversee the review, declined to comment on Palin’s claim. But an Austin-based judge who momentarily managed the complaint and the Travis County assistant district attorney who works with most grand juries each said Lehmberg’s office had no role in convening the grand jury that indicted Perry. Julie Kocurek, who presides over the 390th criminal district court in Travis County, called Palin’s statement "completely and absolutely false." And why? Kocurek said that after Lehmberg’s office received the complaint about Perry, lawyers from the office brought it to Kocurek in her capacity as presiding judge for the county’s criminal district courts. The DA’s office also brought a motion to recuse its attorneys from acting on the complaint because, Kocurek said, Lehmberg was obviously entangled. Similarly, Kocurek said, she recused herself as a judge in the matter given that she had worked for the DA’s office in the past and continued to routinely work with Lehmberg on matters of criminal justice. In accord with state law, Kocurek said, her next step was to turn the matter over to Stubblefield, the presiding judge of the 3rd Judicial District that includes Travis County. Kocurek said Stubblefield then appointed Richardson, "a very non-partisan straight-shooter judge," to handle proceedings involving the complaint. Richardson’s job, she said, was to appoint an attorney to serve as the district attorney in the matter; that appointee, Michael McCrum of San Antonio, subsequently worked with the Travis County special grand jury named in April 2014 that ultimately indicted Perry. McCrum didn’t respond to our telephone inquiry. Richardson, Kocurek said, sat in her courtroom to impanel the grand jury, which consisted of a dozen residents and two alternates drawn from a pool of 80 county residents created at random. "They didn’t know what case they’d be hearing," Kocurek said. We also drew a recap of the Perry matter from Lehmberg’s office. Gary Cobb, director of the office’s grand jury division, said by phone that when the TPJ complaint was received, the office recognized it couldn’t reasonably handle the topic. "Because of a clear conflict of interest, we didn’t do anything but receive the complaint and recuse ourselves, putting in motion the process of having a special prosecutor assigned to it," Cobb said. The office-wide recusal, Cobb said, was sought so that "later on we wouldn’t be accused of having some kind of undue influence." We asked if Lehmberg’s office played some role in choosing who would serve on the special grand jury that indicted Perry. Cobb said not, adding that Richardson or Kocurek would have notified the district clerk’s office that a pool of potential jurors, chosen randomly from adult residents of the county with a Texas driver’s license or state-issued identification card, was needed on the date (April 14, 2014) Richardson wanted to impanel the grand jury. The DA’s office "had no role" in the grand jury’s impaneling, Cobb said. "We don’t even show up." Generally, Cobb said, the office has no role in determining which residents are in the larger pool of potential jurors; that duty, he said, resides with the county’s district clerk. After the special grand jury’s initial three-month term ended, Cobb said, its term was extended another three months. "They have a right and can request an extension for an additional three months in order to complete business," Cobb said. "They did make the request and they did extend." Generally, Cobb said, "we went out of our way to make sure we didn’t do anything that even gave the appearance of having any kind of involvement in the investigation for this case against Rick Perry," though occasionally the office had to coordinate schedules so different grand juries weren’t simultaneously trying to occupy the room the county sets aside for grand juries. Our ruling Palin said that under Lehmberg, the "Travis County D.A.’s office" convened the grand jury that indicted Perry. A special grand jury consisting of Travis County citizens indicted Perry in August 2014. But Lehmberg’s office played no role in organizing the jurors. Early on, Lehmberg’s office recused itself from handling the complaint that eventually resulted in the grand jury whose secret deliberations culminated in Perry’s felony charges. A senior district judge from San Antonio, chosen by a judge based in Williamson County, impaneled the grand jury. The San Antonio judge picked a San Antonio lawyer to prosecute the case.

pomt-09746	"Baseball and insurance are the only industries exempt from antitrust laws."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/13/americans-united-change/liberal-group-says-health-care-baseball-are-only-i/	Supporters of the Democratic health care plan have invoked baseball in their latest television ad that tries to demonize the health insurance industry. In the 30-second ad, the liberal group Americans United for Change asks, "How are professional baseball and insurance companies alike? Baseball and insurance are the only industries exempt from antitrust laws. How are they different? Insurance industry executives are scared of competition. Baseball players aren't. When baseball players fix the games, they get in trouble. When health insurance executives fix the games, they get rich. Time for competition when it comes to health insurance. We need the choice of a public health insurance plan." In this item, we'll focus on their opening claim, that "baseball and insurance are the only industries exempt from antitrust laws." Let's first explain what "antitrust" means. Antitrust laws protect against anticompetitive conduct by cartels and monopolies. Federal antitrust laws target price-fixing, predatory pricing and mergers that reduce competition. Courts have consistently ruled that the federal government has the authority to pass laws that police competition in "interstate commerce" — that is, business activity that crosses borders and ripples through the national economy. While federal antitrust laws do cover most industries, some are exempted, thanks either to the courts or Congress. The Americans United for Change ad cites what is probably the best-known exemption: baseball. Baseball's sweeping exemption stems from a 1922 U.S. Supreme Court decision. The justices, presented with an upstart league's lawsuit against the well-established National League, ruled that teams' travel across state lines was not "essential" to the business. As a result, the justices ruled, the federal government had no antitrust power over baseball, since games were essentially events held in one state. Most notably, the exemption allows Major League Baseball to prevent teams from moving without the league's consent. In more recent challenges, the high court declined to overturn baseball's exemption, saying it was up to Congress to rescind it. Despite numerous bills, lawmakers have so far declined to do so. So, the ad is correct that baseball has an antitrust exemption. Does insurance have one too? It does. Insurance — in fact, all kinds of insurance, not just health coverage — is exempt from federal antitrust laws, though these protections are more limited than they are for baseball teams. A 1945 law exempts from federal antitrust law the "business of insurance" as long as it is "regulated by state law." However, in some contexts — such as if the conduct involves an agreement to "boycott, coerce or intimidate" — federal antitrust law does apply. This is hardly an arcane issue. As Congress struggles with health care reform legislation, some lawmakers are seeking to lift health insurers' antitrust exemption. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., has introduced the Health Insurance Industry Antitrust Enforcement Act, which would, among other things, "repeal the federal antitrust exemption for health insurance and medical malpractice insurance companies for flagrant antitrust violations, including price-fixing, bid rigging, and market allocations." Reps. Diana DeGette, D-Colo., and John Conyers, D-Mich., have introduced an equivalent measure in the House. Both measures are pending. Even though baseball and insurance have somewhat different types of antitrust exemptions, we find they are similar enough to justify the ad's pairing of the two. But when the ad says that baseball and insurance are "the only industries exempt from antitrust laws," it's wrong. For starters, three additional industries — agricultural cooperatives, fishing cooperatives and maritime shipping — have, like baseball and insurance, what the American Bar Association calls "general" antitrust exemptions. Each of these exemptions stem from a law passed by Congress. For example, they permit co-ops, from milk producers to cranberry growers, to jointly market their products, including setting prices and output. (Congress has also exempted labor unions from antitrust law, but unions aren't an "industry," so we won't include them in our calculations.) Also, other industries benefit from more limited forms of antitrust exemptions, usually laws that protect specific practices rather than invoking a blanket exemption for business activity. Studies by the ABA and a federal commission counted almost two dozen such partial exemptions. These govern a wide range of activities, including the actions by broadcasters to curb violence in television shows, efforts by airlines to ease airport congestion, attempts by financially troubled newspapers to merge some functions with competitors, and activities by soft drink producers to draw up exclusive sales territories. The Americans United for Change ad is generally correct to equate the antitrust exemptions of baseball and health insurance, but the one for health insurance is more limited. And the ad is incorrect to say that these are the "only industries exempt from antitrust laws." Agricultural and fishing co-ops and maritime shippers have similar exemptions. And a host of other sectors, notably freight rail, have some pretty significant antitrust protections as well. We rate the ad's claim False.

pomt-15111	"After Texas defunded Planned Parenthood, both the unintended pregnancy and abortion rates dropped."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/sep/13/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-defunding-planned-parenthood-preceded-/	In a tweet, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott suggested a legislated end to government aid to clinics affiliated with abortion providers including Planned Parenthood fueled fewer pregnancies and abortions. "After Texas defunded Planned Parenthood, both the Unintended Pregnancy & Abortion Rates Dropped," Abbott wrote on Twitter Aug. 25, 2015. Abbott’s tweet included a web link to a LifeNews.com post headlined: "When Planned Parenthood is De-Funded, Abortion and Unintended Pregnancy Rates Drop." The linked article, by Michael New, a visiting associate professor of economics at Ave Maria University in Florida, mentioned unintended pregnancies but it hinted at other indicators, stating that "in Texas, both the birth rate and the abortion rate have declined since 2011." Rewind: 2011 was the year the Republican-led Legislature voted to bar government aid covering women’s health services, including contraception and cancer screenings, from going to Texas clinics affiliated with abortion providers. That cut-off took full effect by January 2013 as the state directed funding to clinics lacking such affiliations.. So, did the legislative action, signed into law by then-Gov. Rick Perry, hasten reductions in abortions and unintended pregnancies? Abbott’s office didn’t respond to our inquiry requesting his backup. New’s article laid out no data either. But New engaged by email, in part agreeing that in keeping with the 2011 action, state aid to clinics affiliated with Planned Parenthood was cut off in 2013; litigation to stop the cutoffs, he noted, had failed in 2012. "As such, I think comparing data from 2011 to 2013 is reasonable," New wrote. So, New said, state-collected figures suggest that in 2013, there were 81.1 pregnancies per 1,000 women in Texas aged 15 to 44, a decrease from the 82.9 pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15-44 in 2011. (The 2013 rate also was down from the 2012 rate of 82.1 pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15-44, according to the Texas Department of State Health Services.) Conversely, New said, abortions provided in Texas totaled 61,513 in 2013 compared with 69,431 in 2011; the 2013 abortion rate of 11.09 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15-44 was down from the 2011 rate of 12.86. (The 2012 rate, the state says, was 12.0.) "As a social scientist I always am interested in more data," New said. "The more data we have, the more reliable the findings (usually). That said, the short-term data that we have from the Texas Department of State Health Services indicates that excluding Planned Parenthood clinics from the state family planning program did not cause short-term public health problems (more abortions or more unintended pregnancies) than some predicted." He also told us to keep in mind his article was an editorial (as in opinion piece). Of course, Abbott’s tweet did not speak to whether the 2011 actions caused public health problems. We sought evidence that abortion and unintended pregnancy rates were driven down thanks to the statutory restrictions. Abortions down Mindful of how New reached his figures, we turned to Carrie Williams, spokeswoman for Texas State Health Services. By email, she provided a chart tallying abortions in the state each year from 2000 through 2013. Over the 14 years, the count crested at 82,056 in 2006 and decreased for five straight years starting in 2009 when the agency noted 77,850 abortions. In 2013, according to the chart, there were 63,849 Texas abortions. Over this span, annual percentage drops ranged from less than 1 percent (2009 to 2010) to 5 percent (from 2008 to 2009) to 7 percent (from 2010 to 2011 and 2012 to 2013). And in 2014, there may have been a greater plummet; Williams said the state’s abortion count for that year isn’t final but the "provisional" count is 54,191 abortions. If that holds up, it would represent 9,658 fewer abortions than in 2013 — a 15 percent single-year decrease. Total Induced Abortions Reported in Texas by Year, 2000-2013 Year Abortions 2000 76,121 2001 77,537 2002 79,929 2003 79,166 2004 75,053 2005 77,374 2006 82,056 2007 81,079 2008 81,591 2009 77,850 2010 77,592 2011 72,470 2012 68,298 2013 63,849 Total 1,069,965 SOURCE: Texas Department of State Health Services (received by email from Carrie Williams, director of media relations, Aug. 31, 2015) For national perspective, we turned to the New York-based Guttmacher Institute, which promotes reproductive health and and abortion rights. The institute tallies abortions by surveying abortion providers — and, we noticed, its Texas counts published for 2008, 2010 and 2011 exceeded by 700 to about 3,100 what the state tallied each of those years. Guttmacher said in a March 2014 article: "For abortion counts, most but not all states conduct annual surveillance of abortions provided in the state and the number of abortions obtained by residents. However, abortions are almost always underreported to state surveillance systems." By email, Guttmacher spokesman Joerg Dreweke said the Texas abortion rate declined in 2013 and previously declined from 2008 to 2011. Dreweke said the institute isn’t aware of published evidence linking the 2013 decrease to the 2011 legislative actions. Texas pregnancies We didn’t find primary evidence for unintended pregnancies going up or down due to the 2011 legislative action. New, responding to us, noted accurately that in 2013, there were 81.1 pregnancies in Texas per 1,000 women ages 15-44, down from 82.9 pregnancies per 1,000 women of child-bearing age in 2011, the year lawmakers acted. That 2013 rate, state tallies suggest, was the lowest since at least 2004, which is as far back as we checked. On the other hand, the Texas pregnancy rate has declined every year starting in 2008, according to the state, when there were about 92 pregnancies per 1,000 women of child-bearing age compared to about 93 pregnancies per 1,000 women aged 15-54 in 2007. Through 2013, that is, the pregnancy rate had decreased six straight years. Regardless, Abbott’s tweet proclaimed a drop in "unintended" pregnancies after the defunding. But on that point, we found no timely data. By email, Williams of State Health Services told us the state’s latest estimates of unintended pregnancies cover 2011. Some 43 percent of Texas pregnancies in 2011 were unintended — with 34 percent of those "mistimed," meaning the mother said she wanted to be pregnant later, and 9 percent of them unwanted, meaning the mother said she didn’t want to be pregnant then or at any future time. These percentages appeared in the agency’s latest Texas Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System report (published in 2013) based on a survey of 1,316 women who gave birth in 2011 about their maternal attitudes and behaviors before, during and after pregnancy and conducted in partnership with the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — an annual survey effort that Texas joined in 2002. The CDC, the report said, defines an unintended pregnancy as one that is mistimed (wanted later) or unwanted at the time of conception. "Unintended pregnancies occur primarily due to the lack of birth control," the report said, "or because of incorrect or inconsistent use of birth control methods." Guttmacher takes a broader look at unintended pregnancy rates by state by folding in pregnancies ended by abortion. By email, Dreweke told us its research shows unintended pregnancies decreasing by nearly 8 percent in Texas between 2002 and 2010 (before the actions touted by Abbott occurred). In 2010, according to a January 2015 institute report, there were 56 unintended Texas pregnancies per 1,000 women of child-bearing age. That rate, the report said, was down from 58 unintended pregnancies per 1,000 women of child-bearing age in Texas in 2008 and 61 per 1,000 women of child-bearing age in 2006. In 2002, the report said, there were 60 unintended pregnancies in Texas per 1,000 women of child-bearing age. Dreweke also put us in touch with Guttmacher researcher Rachel Jones, who said it might be 2020 before data are available showing changes in unintended pregnancies for 2012 or later. We asked New whether it’s reasonable to presume the unintended pregnancy rate decreased due to the cutoff of aid to clinics associated with abortion providers including Planned Parenthood. Reminding us that available figures suggest declining Texas abortion and birth rates, whether due to unintended pregnancies or not, New also said that based on available data, he couldn’t tell us if defunding Planned Parenthood caused declines in the abortion rate and the unintended pregnancy rate. "That would require more data from more years and (preferably) more states," he said. New also suggested Abbott did not say defunding Planned Parenthood caused the proclaimed declines. That’s not how we read the governor’s tweet. Our ruling Abbott said: "After Texas defunded Planned Parenthood, both the Unintended Pregnancy & Abortion Rates Dropped." Abortions were already declining before the described defunding while data directly gauging unintended pregnancy rates since the defunding don’t yet exist. So, half this claim draws on cherry-picked statistics, the other half lacks factual backup and the full statement implies causation, which is unproved. We rate this declaration Mostly False.

pomt-12412	Says Texas tax legislation would "save the average homeowner in Texas $20,000 a year over the next 20 years or so."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2017/may/23/dan-patrick/dan-patricks-20000-tax-savings-claim-proves-incorr/	Texas Lt. Gov . Dan Patrick made such a dramatic claim about "must-pass" tax-rate legislation--$20,000 in savings for the average homeowner every year!--we launched a fact check. Patrick, during 17 minutes of remarks to Capitol reporters May 17, 2017, named Senate Bill 2, authored by Sen. Paul Bettencourt, R-Houston, as one of two measures--along with the Senate-backed proposal barring local governments and school districts from letting transgender residents use bathrooms of choice--that must pass, in Patrick’s view, for lawmakers to avoid one or more special sessions possibly called by Gov. Greg Abbott after the regular session that must end by midnight Memorial Day. Patrick, mindful the House then had yet to vote on SB 2, said the Senate-approved version of the measure "would bring about the largest property tax reform in Texas history. It would bring local government spending under control, give the voters an automatic election on government spending, of anything over 5 percent, and," Patrick said, "save the average homeowner in Texas $20,000 a year over the next 20 years or so." Patrick aide: He meant $20,000 cumulatively Is that correct? To our inquiry, Patrick spokesman Alejandro Garcia said by email that Patrick had intended to tout savings adding up to $20,000 over 20 years. He pointed out a Texas Tribune news story posted two days after Patrick spoke quoting an unnamed Patrick staffer saying the same. The Tribune story said Patrick provided its reporter with a sheet of figures suggesting $20,856 in cumulative savings to the average homeowner, a conclusion predicated on local tax-rate hikes running higher than usual. The story quoted Dick Lavine, a tax analyst for the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities, which opposes SB 2, saying: "This calculation certainly does not portray what an ‘average’ homeowner could expect in any given year, to say nothing of experiencing these ‘savings’ every year for the next 20 years." Bettencourt offers backup We didn’t draw any backup from Patrick. But Bettencourt replied to our inquiry by offering a chart suggesting escalating savings for what he described as the owner of the median-valued Texas home based, he said, on research by the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, which drew on data on home sales culled monthly by the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University: SOURCE: Chart projecting homeowner savings from Senate-approved version of Senate Bill 2 (received by email from Lauri Saathoff, director of communications, state Sen. Paul Bettencourt, May 17, 2017) In phone messages, Bettencourt noted that the association’s analysis suggests that over five recent years, through 2015, the owner of a median-valued home saw a nearly 34 percent escalation in property taxes paid to the local government entities targeted by SB 2, which averages out to increases of more than 6 percent a year. Those entities are cities, counties and special districts though not school districts. How the chart gets to a $22,761 cumulative savings in year 20 figure: It shows first-year savings under SB 2 for the median-value homeowner of $46, second-year property tax savings of $99 with annual savings exceeding $1,100 starting in year 12--and topping $2,100 a year starting in year 17. Each year’s savings, the chart shows, reflects the difference between what the homeowner would face in local property taxes if all government units raised taxes 8 percent minus what the homeowner would face if the local government entities all raised taxes 5 percent. Under existing law, local governments may raise effective tax rates up to 8 percent without residents being able to petition for a rollback election. The "effective rate" refers to the rate needed for the governing unit to raise the same total amount of taxes from the same local properties as the unit garnered the year before. Under the Senate’s version of SB 2, any of the affected entities could raise such taxes up to 5 percent with any additional bump automatically touching off a rollback election. Realistic tax-rate assumptions? We asked Bettencourt about the basis of the chart’s assumption that local governments will every year across-the-board raise effective tax rates 5 percent and if it’s realistic to compare that to an assumption that such governments would otherwise uniformly be driving up rates 8 percent every year. In phone messages, Bettencourt stressed the TTARA chart showing the recent average 6-percent-plus increases in property taxes charged the owner of a median-valued home. Separately, Dale Craymer of TTARA declined to comment. Bettencourt also gave us an alternate savings projection premised on all government entities affected by SB 2 annually raising effective rates 6 percent (rather than 3 percent) without a change in law. Upshot: Cumulative "savings" to the median-value homeowner would exceed $17,000 in year 20, the second chart suggests. We asked Bettencourt about available data showing local governments had widely maximized tax rates every year of late. In writing, he replied that he’d heard testimony along those lines from an Arlington and a Dallas official during pre-session hearings of the Bettencourt-chaired Texas Senate Select Committee on Property Tax Reform and Relief. Actual county, city tax rate changes Advocates for cities and counties say the senator’s assumption--that local governments will always uniformly raise effective tax rates to the maximum level allowable without risking a rollback vote at the polls--doesn’t reflect what Texas governments have been doing. By phone, Don Lee of the Texas Conference of Urban Counties, representing 38 member-counties home to most of the state’s residents, said that from 2014 through 2016, the counties averaged 2.2 percent effective tax rate increases, falling far short of the 8 percent rate that would open the way to a rollback vote. Lee emailed us a spreadsheet indicating the member counties averaged effective tax rate increases of 3.1 percent in 2014; 3.2 percent in 2015; and 0.7 percent in 2016. We also queried the Texas Municipal League, which says it represents most of the state’s cities, and whose legislative counsel, Bill Longley, emailed spreadsheets he described as based on effective city tax rates posted by the Texas state comptroller’s office for a couple of recent years. The sheets show, Longley noted, that the "vast majority of cities haven’t been increasing their tax rates above the current 8 percent rollback rate." According to the sheets, in 2014 and 2015, respectively, about 21 percent of the state’s cities adopted effective rates equal to or exceeding 8 percent. And, in keeping with SB 2’s proposed 5 percent rollback rate, how many cities lately have escalated rates that much or more? According to the sheets, 38 percent (382 of 1,002 cities) in 2014 and 39 percent (376 of 963 cities) in 2015. "In both cases," Longley wrote, "more than 60 percent of cities were under a 5 percent rollback rate, if it had been in place." Texas A&M expert For an outside perspective, we asked Jim Gaines, chief economist of the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University, to appraise Bettencourt’s analysis and chart. By phone, Gaines said TTARA presented an accurate figure on its spreadsheet for a median-valued Texas home. But Gaines called "highly questionable" the assumptions behind the dollar figures in Bettencourt’s chart--both of local governments uniformly and annually driving up effective tax rates 8 percent without a change in law and of such governments under SB 2 all increasing rates 5 percent year after year. Counties, for instance, don’t act identically, Gaines said. "Each county is going to be unique," he said. Comptroller makes no homeowner savings estimate Next, we checked the fiscal note on the Senate-approved version of SB 2 that was public by the time Patrick spoke (a more recent version appeared May 19, 2017). The March 16, 2017, note, prepared by the advisory Legislative Budget Board staff, states up front that the financial effects of reducing the rollback rate can’t be estimated. However, it also says, "the table below is a hypothetical example of potential costs of the bill to counties, cities, and special districts" based in part on assuming that no voters approve rates exceeding the 5 percent rollback rate and that future "rate-setting practices would be similar to the rate-setting practices demonstrated in the available historical tax rate data." And in fiscal 2019, the first year of tax effects, cities, counties and special districts would lose nearly $199 million in revenue, the comptroller’s office estimated, an indication of some taxpayer savings, it seemed to us. The hypothetical shows additional costs to affected government entities in subsequent years. Does the hypothetical lost revenue, we wondered, mean the comptroller got a fix on how much homeowners and other property taxpayers might save? By phone, a spokeswoman for the comptroller’s office, Lauren Willis, said the agency has not estimated particular savings for homeowners. Tim Wooten, a comptroller consultant who worked on the table, told us by phone that’s because "we can’t predict what local taxing entities will do" in setting rates or if voters indeed will reject all increases at the polls. We asked Wooten to unpack how he reached the hypothesized revenue losses. Wooten said he applied the SB 2 limits to 2015 tax rates set by the targeted entities, finding that in that year, 60 percent of cities and special districts and 70 percent of counties did not set rates high enough to touch off the rollback elections envisioned in SB 2. Wooten said too that a lot of the remaining government entities would have sustained small 2015 losses in revenue if SB 2 had been law then. Bettencourt stands by $20,000-plus figure Following up, we asked Bettencourt if most local entities covered by SB 2 don’t reach existing or proposed rollback tax rates, aren’t homeowner savings impossible to precisely forecast? "Of course," Bettencourt said in writing, "because we are dealing with future projections to a 20-year degree. However, downward pressure on property tax rates means tax rate reductions across the board in probability." When we said it looked to us like his projected homeowner savings were based on unrealistic assumptions about all the affected government entities maximizing tax rates every year, Bettencourt replied: "Disagree strongly," urging us to revisit the spreadsheet he attributed to TTARA. Our ruling Patrick said legislation targeting local tax rate growth will result in the average Texas homeowner saving $20,000 a year over 20 years. That’s an absurd amount. Even if we look at what Patrick purportedly meant to say — $20,000 over 20 years — we find major flaws in the assumptions underlying that calculation. To reach that amount, one must assume that every city, county and special taxing district will raise tax rates by 8 percent every year without this legislation in place and by 5 percent a year with it. Neither assumption is in line with recent history, making the total savings figure highly suspect, at best a wild guess. Pants on Fire!

pomt-08743	"In this country, we have a 25 percent dropout rate."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/30/arne-duncan/education-secretary-arne-duncan-says-one-quarter-u/	The Aug 29, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour featured a discussion of education policy chock full of education statistics. Here, we decide to look at one offered by Education Secretary Arne Duncan. "In this country, we have a 25 percent dropout rate," he said. "That's 1.2 million students leaving our schools for the streets every single year. That is economically unsustainable, and that is morally unacceptable." Is it really true that one of every four American high school students drops out before graduating? While Duncan is using a commonly cited statistic, education statisticians we contacted cautioned that it's an imperfect measurement. First, a bit about the complex world of measuring dropout rates, drawing liberally from a prior article by our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas. Researchers and governments have many different ways of measuring how many students leave school before graduating. "A dropout rate seems like it should be the most intuitive thing in the world, but it’s not," said David Bills, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Education who specializes in comparative statistics. "There are almost as many ways of calculating state dropout rates as there are states." One way to calculate it is to track individual students as they progress from freshman year of high school until graduation. This provides the most accurate data, but tracking students this way requires a lot of effort, so many school districts do not do it. The main alternative is to track the decline in enrollment between freshman year and graduation. This is known as the AFGR, or averaged freshman graduation rate. It's much easier to do -- and it's the most consistent "apples to apples" statistic across the 50 states -- but it is undermined by a greater risk of error. That's because AFGR does not necessarily distinguish between students who actually dropped out and those who left for other reasons, such as moving to a school in another state, leaving to follow one's parents to a new military assignment, graduating early or graduating late. "If a kid leaves one school but is never tracked if he enrolls in another school, that can count as a dropout," Bills said. "Also, a lot of kids who leave high school but later get GEDs are often counted as dropouts. And sometimes dropout rates are calculated as the number of people aged 16-24 not in school and without a degree, which can also inflate the number." Students who leave for other reasons can be excluded, but this is not always done, and not doing it tends to inflate the apparent number of dropouts. Standardization mandated by provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act has reduced these errors over time, but the statistics are not yet perfect, our experts said. And, needless to say, analyzing different data with different methods will inevitably yield varying results. To add to the confusion, any of the measurements cited above might be termed the "dropout" rate in public discourse. At the Education Department, we spoke to Tracy Dell'Angela, director of outreach and communications with the Institute of Education Sciences, which oversees the department's National Center for Education Statistics, which among other things calculates AFGR. She said that when Duncan talks about the dropout rate, he tends to subtract the AFGR (nearly 75 percent for the last available year, 2007-2008) from a full student universe of 100 percent to get a 25 percent dropout rate. In one sense, Duncan is on solid ground -- his calculation is certainly a common way to use the statistics. But the numbers require some important caveats. In addition to the issue of transfer students cited earlier, the statistics do not necessarily treat home schoolers accurately (they may be counted as dropouts if they begin home schooling after 9th grade and eventually graduate from home school). In addition, Education Department data has sometimes left out entire states, including South Carolina in 2007-2008. Also, the AFGR statistics only refer to public school students. In fact, there is no comprehensive data on graduation and dropout rates from private schools, which account for about 8 to 9 percent of high school students. Since parents paying tuition are likely to be especially motivated to see their children finish school, the true national dropout rate reported probably overstates the actual percentage of American children failing to graduate from high school. Several of our statistical experts said that it's common for politicians everywhere to skip the warnings when decrying American dropout rates. We understand the need for simplicity in a televised interview, but Duncan could have easily said the dropout rate "may be as high as 25 percent." Since he presented the figure as a hard and fast fact, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Arne Duncan	None	None	None	2010-08-30T18:54:53	2010-08-29	['None']
pomt-13565	Says Scott Walker's "listening sessions" are "invite-only and excluding the press."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/aug/24/dana-wachs/general-public-and-press-not-allowed-attend-gov-sc/	Wisconsin state Sen. Chris Larson earned a Pants on Fire when he claimed, more than halfway into 2013, that Gov. Scott Walker "hasn't done a public event" the entire year. The Republican governor had attended public meetings, presided over military ceremonies and given speeches, among many other public events. Nevertheless, Walker has been criticized for not being more accessible. And on July 15, 2016, a claim made by another Democratic lawmaker caught our attention. State Rep. Dana Wachs of Eau Claire, a lawyer and four-year lawmaker who has been mentioned as a possible 2018 gubernatorial candidate, said in a tweet: "Walker holding listening sessions: Good. Making them invite-only & excluding the press: Not so good." Is he right that the listening sessions are invitation only and exclude the media? Wachs’ evidence Wachs’ tweet included a link to a Capital Times news article that was posted the same day. The article said that, according to state records, Walker's office had asked lawmakers, lobbyists, state agency heads and local economic development agencies to help select attendees for his invite-only listening sessions throughout the state. The article said Walker had held 50 such sessions, all of which were open only to invited guests. The general public and the press were excluded. This wasn't disputed. The governor’s office issued a statement in connection with the 50th session that quoted Walker as saying: Before every listening session, we’re in contact with area state legislators, no matter what party they represent, as well as community leaders to help us reach out and invite a good cross-section of people with different experiences and opinions. We also focus on ensuring those from a particular community are the primary attendees. The statement continued: Advance notice of participation is intended to ensure that there are no threatening criminal backgrounds and to avoid people whose intent is to be disruptive. While listening sessions are closed to members of the press to encourage an honest and candid conversation between attendees, local members of the media are given the opportunity to sit down for one-on-one interviews following the listening session in the interest of transparency. A few weeks earlier, residents in Pierce County held signs outside one of Walker’s listening sessions to protest not being allowed in. But such protests have not been common. Walker had touted the tour six months earlier in his "State of the State" address. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel noted criticism from Democrats, including Russ Feingold, who is running against Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson for the seat he lost to Johnson in 2010. As a senator, Feingold’s listening sessions were open to the public, and that wasn't always pleasant during the emotional debates over President Barack Obama's health-care law in 2010, the Journal Sentinel noted. If the meetings aren’t open to the public, Feingold told the newspaper, "you're going to have a pre-selection process and you're not going to get the full picture." Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said the governor speaks to local media after each session. Our rating Wachs says Walker's "listening sessions" are "invite-only and excluding the press." As he travels Wisconsin to meet with residents, Walker asks various people, including Democratic lawmakers, for suggestions on who to invite to his listening sessions. But the sessions are not open to the public or to the press, only to people who are invited. We rate Wachs’ statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0c49b107-14c9-4af7-87b3-1be6a83985b7	None	Dana Wachs	None	None	None	2016-08-24T05:00:00	2016-07-15	['None']

pomt-02104	"Ninety-seven percent of the time. That’s how often Mark Warner votes with President Obama."	true	/virginia/statements/2014/may/15/republican-party-virginia/virginia-gop-says-warner-voted-obama-97-percent-ti/	U.S. Sen. Mark Warner isn’t the moderate you thought you elected, Republicans say. "97 percent of the time. That’s how often Mark Warner votes with President Obama," a recent web video by the Republican Party of Virginia said. Warner, a Democrat, is running for a second term this year. Ed Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Party and adviser to President George W. Bush, is expected to win the GOP nomination at a state convention next month. A key strategy for Republican challengers in Virginia and across U.S. this fall will be to tie Democrat incumbents to President Barack Obama, whose national approval ratings have been hovering at around 44 percent. Our colleagues in other PolitiFact bureaus have already examined claims that Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Mark Begich of Alaska are in lockstep with the president. We asked Garren Shipley, spokesman for the state GOP, to back up the claim on Warner’s voting record. He sent us presidential support data compiled by CQ Weekly, a nonpartisan Washington news service that was once known as Congressional Quarterly. The statistics track the percentage of times a member of Congress votes with the stated preference of the president on legislation. Warner, as it turns out, did vote with the president’s wishes 97 of the time both last year and since entering the Senate in 2009. That’s slightly higher than the average for all Democratic senators, who backed Obama when he clearly stated a position 96 percent of the time last year and 95.4 percent of the time since 2009. Here’s Warner’s annual percentage and his ranking in presidential support among all the senators who caucused with the Democrats each year: 96 percent in 2009, 30th out of 60 97 percent in 2010, 30th out of 58 99 percent in 2011, tied for 1st out of 53 96 percent in 2012, 21st out of 53 97 percent in 2013, 39th out of 55 There’s a few things that should be understood about presidential support statistics. For starters, they deal with only a fraction of the votes Warner has cast. CQ found that Obama staked out a "clear position" on only 419 of 1,473 roll call votes in the Senate -- or 28 percent -- since Warner became a member in 2009. Warner voted with the president’s position on 406 of those 419 votes. More than half of them, 226, were to confirm presidential nominations for federal posts. He voted with the president on a number of high profile issues: The Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare Extending the Patriot Act, allowing increased surveillance of people suspected of terrorist activities A farm bill expanding crop insurance and trimming the food stamp program Extending a period offering lower rates for student loans Increasing debt limits On key issues, Warner has opposed the president by voting: Against regulating assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices Against delaying the start of sequestration in 2013 that started a series of automatic spending cuts To overturn Environmental Protection Agency regulations to cut mercury and other emissions from coal-fired electric generation facilities Warner campaigned for the Senate in 2008 as a "radical centrist" who would seek bipartisan compromise. David Turner, Warner’s campaign spokesman this year, was dismissive of the state GOP’s effort to define Warner by his presidential support votes. "Solely tallying an arbitrary number of procedural votes does not accurately depict the sum total of a U.S. Senator’s work," he said. Turner sent us links to other vote studies and news articles that praise Warner for his bipartisan work. For example, National Journal rated Warner the 46th most liberal member of the 100-seat U.S. Senate in 2013, based on an analysis of 117 roll call votes on key economic, foreign and social issues last year. And Open Congress, found that Warner voted with the majority of his party on 90 percent of all Senate bills last year, ranking him 42nd among the 51 Democratic senators. Some of the articles Turner sent concerned Warner’s persistent but unsuccessful efforts to build bipartisan consensus for a debt reduction plan that would cut spending and raise taxes. Turner also noted that some of Warner’s legislative efforts in opposition to Obama’s policies have not advanced to a vote on the Senate floor and, therefore, were not counted in CQ’s presidential support ratings. Warner, for example: Co-sponsored legislation in 2012 to open offshore oil and gas drilling off the coast of Virginia. Co-sponsored a bill this year to approve the Keystone XL pipeline. Backed a proposal last year to impose tougher sanctions on Iran in December if its nuclear program negotiations with the White House broke down. We asked two political scientists for their thoughts on presidential support ratings: Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia and Stephen Farnsworth of the University of Mary Washington. They both said the high level of support by Democrats and the low level by Republicans -- who have backed Obama only 46 percent of the time since 2009 -- speaks to the partisanship in the Senate. Both professors said that the rating, which tracks a relatively small number of overall votes, paints an unsophisticated picture of any congressman’s total record, including Warner’s. "Warner’s Obamacare vote was critical," Sabato said. "But using the 97 percent number really doesn’t tell you much more than he’s a Democrat." Farnsworth noted that Obama did not take a position on the vast majority of bills that have come before the Senate. "To imagine that Warner votes like a politburo member for the president would be misleading," he said. Our ruling The Republican Party of Virginia says Warner has voted with Obama "97 percent of the time." Warner, since entering the Senate in 2009, indeed has taken the same position as the president 97 percent of the time when Obama outlined a clear position, according to Congressional Quarterly. That includes voting for Obamacare. The presidential support rating is by no means a wide measure of performance by Warner or any other member of Congress. The president staked out a position on only 28 percent of the Senate roll call votes since 2009 and more than half of those were to confirm presidential appointments. Senate Democrats, on the whole, have backed the president 95.4 percent of the time during Warner’s term. It should be noted that broad voting studies by the National Journal and Open Congress rate Warner as one of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate. Warner’s presidential support rating, however, is what it is: 97 percent. So we rate the GOP’s statement True.

pomt-05139	"Since the beginning of the economic downturn in FY 2008, the state workforce has been reduced by 12.4 percent as part of overall cost savings measures to balance the budget to reduce revenues."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2012/jun/22/nathan-deal/cuts-state-workforce-not-steep-deal-said/	Georgia begins a new budget year July 1 with a smaller state workforce -- but how much smaller? In a May 7 news release acknowledging Gov. Nathan Deal’s signing of the new budget, Deal’s office said the state had trimmed its workforce by 12.4 percent since the recession began in the 2008 fiscal year. We thought a claim that the state has shed one out of every eight of its employees deserves a second look. The boast of job cuts was a throw-in line in a news release in which Deal talked about using his line-item veto power to "eliminate wasteful or inefficient spending," but the statement made its way into news accounts across the state, including an Associated Press story. Deal spokesman Brian Robinson said the numbers originated from the State Personnel Administration, a department that essentially serves as the human resources department for much of state government. The department has kept a running tally of state workers since 1998. Robinson forwarded a spreadsheet showing the ebbs and flows of state offices from accounting to workers’ compensation. Fiscal 2008 -- which ended June 30, 2009 -- was the peak year with 82,080 workers drawing a state paycheck. Since then, the overall number has declined each year. Among the offices taking the most losses: -- The Governor’s Office of Consumer Protection, which went from 96 employees in 2008 to 47 by the end of fiscal 2011, a cut of 51 percent. -- The Student Finance Commission, which dropped from 41 employees in 2008 to 29 in 2011 a loss of 29.3 percent. -- The Insurance Commissioner’s Office, which fell from 251 employees to 190, a decline of 24.3 percent. Deal just took office in 2011, so he cannot claim all the credit for shrinking state government. But the trend has continued under his leadership. Not every area of state government shrank, though. The state Defense Department, the State Road and Tollway Authority and the Technical College System all added workers. Most departments showed a loss of some sort, but is the 12.4 percent brag accurate? Robinson said the news release compared the 2008 figure with the "most recent workforce number available," which he said was a December 2011 figure of 71,881. That’s a difference of 10,199 employees from the end of fiscal 2008 -- a 12.4 percent decrease. Right on the button. (For sticklers, these measurements are of actual full-time workers, not positions that may or may not be filled, so it is a more accurate measure of the size of the government’s workforce.) But there was something missing. The spreadsheet lists 76 different offices and departments, but the University System of Georgia was not among them. Why? Robinson said the Office of Planning and Budget provided the information and the OPB considers University System employees different from other state workers for a couple of reasons. The first is where they get their money. A statement from the OPB forwarded by Robinson said the University System can offset budget cuts with higher tuition and avoid cuts where other offices don’t have that option. That’s true to a point. Other areas of government can offset state budget cuts by increasing revenue elsewhere, such as Georgia Public Broadcasting with fundraising. The other reason the University System was left off was a matter of interpretation. According to the statement, the OPB believes "there is a distinct difference" between education and the rest of state government. Without arguing that distinction, the figures Robinson initially provided include the Department of Education, the Department of Early Care and Learning, and the Technical College System. So some educational figures were included in the overall state count. Perhaps the most persuasive reason Deal’s news release didn’t include the university employment numbers is because they weren’t available. That data is kept by the Board of Regents and is not integrated into the state’s human resource database. Robinson said the governor’s office asked for employment figures and worked with what it had. "According to OPB, what we used accurately reflects how the state has historically discussed state job numbers," he said. Are university employees "state workers"? A reasonable person might conclude they are, so we asked for those numbers. What we found was significantly higher employment among the state’s colleges and universities. In fiscal 2008, the University System had 40,155 employees. Today, 45,592 are on the payroll. That’s a 13.5 percent increase. Add those figures to the rest of state employment and you get 122,235 workers in 2008 and 117,473 today -- a 3.9 percent decrease. The statement in Deal’s news release about the shrinking of state government overreaches significantly. It does not include University System employees, a striking omission. Include those employee and you still see a decrease. But it’s a much smaller one than the governor claimed. We rate Deal’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-13844	Says Hillary Clinton has been given tens of millions of dollars by countries that "treat women horribly ... and countries that kill gays."	half-true	/arizona/statements/2016/jul/11/donald-trump/did-hillary-clinton-take-money-countries-treat-wom/	Donald Trump continues to attack Hillary Clinton on everything from campaign spending to ISIS. At a rally in Phoenix, he accused her of taking money from countries that have a poor rapport with women and gay people. "She's been given tens of millions of dollars by countries that treat women horribly," Trump said June 18. "And countries that kill gays, they kill gays, they push them off of buildings." Trump, whose campaign did not return a request for comment, seems to be referencing donations given to the Clinton Foundation. Trump has referenced her foundation ties in the past, saying she needs to "return the $25 million" Saudi Arabia gave the foundation. The William J. Clinton Foundation was incorporated in 1997. The foundation agreed to disclose its donors when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009. We wondered whether the Clintons’ donor list holds up to Trump’s claim. But first, it is important to note that political candidates cannot take money from foreign entities. "The prohibition in the Federal Election Campaign Act is against candidates or political committees soliciting, accepting or receiving contributions from foreign nationals, not only governments," said Michael Malbin, a political science professor at the University at Albany. Hillary Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin also noted that the former first lady played no role in the foundation while she was secretary of state. "Further, she did not blink before standing up to countries that oppressed their people and denied them of their rights, from LGBT rights to women's rights," Schwerin said. Nonetheless. looking at the Clinton Foundation’s donor list, Saudi Arabia gave between $10 million and $25 million. But the foundation reported the Saudi money in December 2008, and the amount hasn’t changed since. Clinton Foundation spokesman Brian Cookstra pointed out that Saudi Arabia did not give to the foundation while Secretary Clinton was at the State Department. The foundation has also taken between $1 million and $5 million each from United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman. As The Wall Street Journal reported, several of these donations came in 2014, after Clinton's tenure at the State Department. We've fact-checked a similar claim before when Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said in April 2015 that Clinton took money from the kings of "Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Oman and Yemen." Every country except Yemen has contributed to the Clinton Foundation, but Preibus' claim made it seem like Clinton herself took the money. We rated it Half True. Women’s rights Human Rights Watch tracks how women are treated in each of these countries. In Saudi Arabia, a woman needs "male guardian" approval on everything from obtaining a passport to seeking higher education. They also have no divorce rights. The same male approval is needed for marriage in United Arab Emirates, plus laws there also allow a husband to assault his wife and children. In Qatar, marital rape is permitted. Women need a male guardian to approve a marriage contract, and one law specifies that a wife must obey her husband. And in Oman, Human Rights Watch notes that while there is a nondiscrimination law, women still face discrimination when it comes to domestic issues such as child custody and divorce. Gay rights According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, all sex outside of marriage, including same-sex intercourse, in Saudi Arabia is punishable by death. For a married man, the penalty is death by stoning. An unmarried man faces 100 blows of a whip. In Qatar, any sexual act outside of marriage is punishable by death. The United Arab Emirates also bans sex outside of marriage, and the death penalty could apply to consensual "same-sex relations." As for Oman, the country punishes same-sex acts by up to three years in prison. As for Trump's claim that these countries are throwing gay people "off of buildings," he may be referring to the Islamic State. There is evidence that ISIS has engaged in these acts, but in Syria. Executions in Saudi Arabia specifically have increased recently, but specific convictions, and whether are they related to homosexuality, are hard to measure. Not Clinton directly Experts we spoke with questioned whether the donations to the foundation are directly attributable to Hillary Clinton. Indiana University public affairs professor emeritus Leslie Lenkowsky said Trump’s claim is hyperbolic. "These were not donations to Secretary Clinton as such, but to an organization with which she was closely involved (when not in office or seeking it), including serving as a director," Lenkowsky said. According to Brian Mittendorf, an accounting professor at Ohio State University, nonprofits often have to consider donors’ actions when they give money. The stakes are usually higher when the nonprofit involves a political figure. "These are gifts not to Clinton herself but to the foundation that shares her name," he said. The United States remains allies with some of these countries, such as Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar, despite their poor record with human rights. Our ruling Trump said that Hillary Clinton has "been given tens of millions of dollars by countries that treat women horribly...and countries that kill gays." Trump's comment oversimplifies donations to the Clinton Foundation to make a quick attack against his Democratic rival. He makes it sound as if Clinton personally received money from foreign governments with poor records on human rights. But political candidates cannot accept donations from foreign governments. However, several countries with harsh rules for women and that kill gays have contributed to the Clinton Foundation both before and after her tenure at the State Department.

pomt-00538	"For most black people in the history of this country … it was illegal to pass as a white person. You were actually put in jail if you tried to pass."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/18/michael-skolnik/amid-rachel-dolezal-controvery-pundit-claims-black/	White or black? By now, most of you have probably heard about the controversy surrounding former NAACP leader Rachel Dolezal, who self-identifies as black but has white parents. Dolezal’s "passing" for black unleashed criticism that Dolezal used her racial identity as it suited her, a tool for progressing her own goals. One CNN article reported that some people felt that Dolezal had "diminished the real struggles of African-Americans by claiming she had suffered hurtful racism like them." Count Michael Skolnik, Russell Simmons’ political director and the president of GlobalGrind.com, among that group. Dolezal "took the space of a black woman, who could have been a leader of (the NAACP). ... Black people in this country don’t have that convenience," Skolnik said in a June 16 interview with CNN's Brooke Baldwin. "In fact, for most black people in the history of this country who passed, it was illegal to pass as a white person. You were actually put in jail if you tried to pass. For black people, passing was about survival, it wasn’t about acceptance." Leaving aside the question of Dolezal’s actions, PunditFact was struck by Skolnik’s statement that "it was illegal to pass as a white person (and) you were actually put in jail if you tried to pass." Was it illegal to pass as a white person? And was jail the consequence? The short answer is that experts say there were never laws explicity saying African-Americans could not pass a white person. But if discovered, those people passing as white would be subject to laws on the books for African-Americans, many of which could include jail time. Passing as white First, we have to address the question of what it meant to be black in the United States in the 19th and 20th centuries. In his book Who is Black? One Nation’s Definition, author F. James Davis stated that "the nation's answer to the question 'Who is black?" has long been that a black is any person with any known African black ancestry … In the South it became known as the ‘one-drop rule,’ meaning that a single drop of ‘black blood’ makes a person a black." Using this rule, a person who identified as white could be accused of being black if any information or documents surfaced claiming that he or she had a black ancestor. Virginia's Bureau of Vital Statistics registrar Walter Plecker, for instance, became infamous in Virginia during the 20th century for using birth and death certificates, data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Confederate War Department, as well as other sources to determine who had any "colored" blood. Because of this, fair-skinned individuals who could pass for white would be legally identified as black. Skolnik told us he was referring specifically to slave times. "If a slave tried to pass for white and was caught, they were oftentimes jailed and sent back to their slave masters," Skolnik said. That’s true, though not because they passed as white, but because they were declared someone else's property. Under the Fugitive Slave Acts in place until the Civil War, citizens and local governments were under the obligation to capture and return slaves to their owners. Failure to do so would result in penalties. Jail and other consequences After the Civil War came the rise of black codes and Jim Crow laws. While these laws were designed to create different sets of rules for blacks and whites on everything from marriage to education to the use of public facilities, they didn't target blacks specifically for passing as white. Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham is a Harvard University professor of history and African American studies. "I don’t believe that passing itself, although it remained the focus of numerous court cases, ended generally in imprisonment unless attached to another illegal practice, such as interracial marriage, theft, etc.," Higginbotham said. "The consequences of being exposed were usually being put out of a school, losing one’s job, sued for divorce, denied access to public accommodations, and disgraced in one’s former social circles." Martha S. Jones, associate chair of the Department of Afroamerican and African Studies at the University of Michigan, agreed. "The consequences for attempting to ‘pass’ were that one might be denied a license to marry, or … one might be denied entry into the United States or naturalization as a citizen if discovered to be passing," Jones said. In Florida, for example, it was illegal for a black man or woman to cohabitate with a white man or woman, and the punishment included up to one year in prison. But the crime wasn't passing as white. Elizabeth Smith-Pryor, a history professor at Kent State University, explained one such case for us. Under Alabama law, people could be imprisoned if found to be married to someone of the other race. In 1935, in the case of Keith vs. Commonwealth, Keith was accused of having a black ancestor -- and therefore being black -- making his marriage to a white woman illegal. The court ultimately ruled there was not enough evidence to convict. Our ruling Skolnik said that "for most black people in the history of this country who passed, it was illegal to pass as a white person. You were actually put in jail if you tried to pass." Skolnik said he was referring to the Fugitive Slave Acts, which could result in prison time for runaway slaves until they were returned to their owner. But those acts had nothing to do with passing as white, as slaves were considered property. Post-Civil War Jim Crow laws did not include passing as white as a crime that could send someone to jail. However, blacks exposed as passing as white would be treated like other blacks under the law. And that, depending on the crime, could result in imprisonment. Skolnik’s statement is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.	None	Michael Skolnik	None	None	None	2015-06-18T17:40:30	2015-06-16	['None']

pomt-05520	Says New Jersey Devils managing partner Jeff Vanderbeek "took us into arbitration."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/12/cory-booker/cory-booker-claims-jeff-vanderbeek-took-us-arbitra/	A day after a panel of arbitrators ruled that Newark owed money to the New Jersey Devils, Mayor Cory Booker stood outside the Prudential Center and lambasted Jeff Vanderbeek, the team’s managing partner. But the mayor should remember it was city officials who initiated that arbitration process. Yet Booker claimed twice during his April 4 news conference that Vanderbeek "took us into arbitration." "He’s dragged my team through courts for five and a half years, millions and millions of dollars of legal fees he has swept up from the city pressing frivolous claims," Booker said. "How do I know they’re frivolous claims? Think about how much of a pathetic penny pincher he’s been. "He took us into arbitration, not just for that one letter that I mentioned. He took us into arbitration because he said, ‘Oh, you didn’t get the streets straightened in time.’ He was responsible for the construction of this arena, but he said, ‘Oh, it wasn’t done on time,’" the mayor continued. "Every legal manipulation and exploitation he could pursue to get another dime and dollar out of our city, he’s gone after." After reviewing the arbitrators’ decision and an application filed on the city’s behalf, PolitiFact New Jersey determined that Booker is wrong. The arbitrators’ decision resulted from an arbitration request filed in 2010 by the Newark Housing Authority, which owns the arena. In a series of e-mails, Booker spokeswoman Anne Torres acknowledged that the authority initiated the process, but claimed that the Devils left city officials with no choice. "The Newark Housing Authority would never have demanded an arbitration if the Devils had paid their rent, however, because of their recalcitrance and failure to follow through on their commitments, the Newark Housing Authority and the city were forced into arbitration," Torres wrote. "It should be noted that these were the facts behind the Mayor’s statement." Torres later added, "The Mayor knows that the Housing Authority initiated the arbitration, that’s no secret. What I am saying is that when he says ‘they took us into arbitration’, he’s saying this because they left us with no choice." Let’s explain the timeline of events leading up to arbitration. The Devils and the authority approved a lease agreement in February 2005 for the Prudential Center, which later opened in October 2007. But the two sides became divided over a host of issues, including unpaid rent and parking revenues. Following years of negotiations, the authority sent a "notice of dispute" to the hockey team, starting the process toward arbitration, according to a May 2010 Star-Ledger article. The lease agreement provides for arbitration as a method of resolving disputes. In June 2010, the authority filed a "demand for arbitration" with the American Arbitration Association, according to the arbitrators’ decision and the application filed at the time. The arbitrators’ decision released last week addresses the unpaid rent, parking revenues and other issues, but ultimately leaves Newark owing about $600,000 to the Devils. Our ruling At an April 4 news conference outside the Prudential Center, Booker claimed twice that Vanderbeek "took us into arbitration." But as a spokeswoman for the mayor acknowledged, the Newark Housing Authority initiated the arbitration process. We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-14210	Wisconsin pays criminal defense lawyers who represent the indigent $40 per hour, "the lowest in the country."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/apr/20/jerome-buting/making-murderer-lawyer-wisconsin-pays-lowest-rate-/	The Netflix series Making A Murderer made rock stars of Wisconsin criminal defense attorneys Dean Strang and Jerome Buting, even though Steven Avery, their client and the central figure of the series, was found guilty of murder. The two are doing a speaking tour in North America, to be followed by one in Australia. Strang is getting a TV series. Buting is in demand, too -- and taking a whack at criminal justice in Wisconsin while he’s at it. While in Belfast to address a European bar association conference, Buting told the Irish Legal News in an April 11, 2016 article that Wisconsin is last in America when it comes to paying lawyers who represent poor defendants in criminal cases. "We have a staffed indigent defense program statewide, but only about 60 percent of cases are handled by those salaried lawyers," Buting said, referring to Wisconsin public defenders, who are state employees. "The remainder (of the cases) get appointed out to private attorneys on an hourly basis. The hourly basis is $40 an hour. It is now the lowest in the country, worse than the Deep South of America, which has historically been the least generous when it comes to this sort of thing." He added: "It’s easy for politicians to demagogue and say ‘we’re going to cut this and cut that,' but what’s happened in Wisconsin should be a warning to Northern Ireland and other countries. I do think that not only lawyers but the public has to stand up to these attempts to try to cut the quality of defense for people accused of crimes." Leaving aside the question of whether pay affects quality, we found that Buting’s claim is mostly on target. The only caveat is that a complete comparison isn’t possible, given that 20 states don’t use set hourly rates like Wisconsin does. How the system works In Wisconsin, the first line of defense for people who are charged with a crime and can’t afford an attorney is a public defender. But because of heavy caseloads, and for other reasons, public defender offices throughout the state assign some of their cases to private attorneys who have agreed to take such appointments. As Buting said, Wisconsin pays those private attorneys $40 an hour. That amount has not changed since 1995. The $40 is for "for time spent related to a case," in court or out of court, excluding travel. For travel time, the rate is $25 per hour, if the travel meets certain distance requirements. Other states To back his claim about where Wisconsin ranks, Buting cited a 2013 report from the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. The report said 30 states, including Wisconsin, Iowa and Indiana, had established a statewide pay rate for private attorneys who handle criminal cases, with the average being about $65 per hour. Among those 30 states, the report said, "Wisconsin has the lowest rate in the nation at $40 an hour." So, Buting is essentially on track. The report also noted, however, that 20 states don’t set hourly rates. In those states, the pay for the private attorneys is generally either set by a judge on a case-by-case basis, or through a contract between the state and the attorney. But even within some states, there are variations. In Illinois, Cook County (which includes Chicago) pays $40 per hour for in-court and $30 for out-of-court work, while all other counties establish their own rates. In other words, the report doesn’t provide an hourly breakdown for all 50 states. Randy Kraft, spokesman for the State Public Defender in Wisconsin, told us his office in fall 2015 essentially updated the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers report by checking the laws in all 50 states and found no other state hourly rate had slipped below Wisconsin’s. Our rating Buting says Wisconsin pays criminal defense lawyers who represent the indigent $40 per hour, "the lowest in the country." According to the latest available data, Wisconsin’s rate was lowest among the 30 states that set hourly rates. But it’s worth noting that the effective hourly rates for the other states couldn’t be determined, because they use different systems. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a48d5842-ce9e-4179-a42d-4b356c874507	None	Jerome Buting	None	None	None	2016-04-20T05:00:00	2016-04-11	['None']
pomt-04377	Says Connie Mack voted to redefine "rape" as "forcible rape."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/oct/19/bill-nelson/nelson-ties-mack-forcible-rape-measure/	The allegiance of female voters was in play during Wednesday’s U.S. Senate debate. Sen. Bill Nelson attacked U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers, for his views on violence against women. "Mack voted to redefine rape as forcible rape," Nelson said. "So I think it's pretty clear where he is standing on women's issues." Mack shot back: "What he just said is not true, and we cannot let it stand. Senator, you need to do a better job of explaining your own record, because you're really messing up my record." We are checking whether Nelson got it right. Did Mack vote to define rape as forcible rape? Federal funding for abortion Nelson based his claim on the role Mack played in co-sponsoring a House bill that aimed to block any possible way that federal dollars might underwrite the cost of an abortion. For many years, lawmakers have barred the use of money for abortion through the Medicaid program and at military hospitals and in other programs. There are long-standing exceptions, though, for rape, incest or the life of the mother. This bill Mack co-sponsored, the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, sought to restrict abortion even further. It said medical bills related to an abortion would not qualify as a health expense when people file their income taxes. It blocked any federal subsidy for insurance policies that include abortion services. The bill’s most controversial clause, though, focused on rape. It added an important qualification to the traditional exception: The new language said federal funds could only be used in cases of "forcible rape." The bill never defined the term "forcible," and it drew a wave of criticism. Women’s organizations accused the bill’s sponsors of trying to redefine rape. They said rape by its very nature is an act of force. They questioned whether the new term would exclude cases when the victim is unconscious due to alcohol or drugs, or cases of statutory rape. (Statutory rape includes consensual sexual relations when an individual is not old enough to legally consent.) The controversy led Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee to drop the word "forcible." The bill then passed in the House but was never taken up by the Senate. So the main purpose of the legislation was not redefining rape, but limiting the use of federal funds to pay for abortion. Vote vs. co-sponsoring The version of the bill that Mack voted on did not have the clause on forcible rape. When Nelson claimed that Mack had voted for that measure, he was wrong. "The senator misspoke," said Dan McLaughlin, Nelson’s communications director. "He knew that Mack was a co-sponsor, but it came out wrong." Indeed, Mack co-sponsored the bill on January 24, 2011, four days after it was introduced. Mack put his name behind the bill long before the forcible rape language was removed. Still, the forcible rape language has become an issue in this year’s campaign. Paul Ryan, the vice presidential nominee who also was a co-sponsor of the bill, answered questions from Fox News about the matter on Aug. 27, 2012. "Well, look, all these bills were bills to stop taxpayer financing of abortion," Ryan said. "Most Americans agree with us, including pro-choice Americans that we shouldn't use hard-working taxpayer dollars to finance abortion. Rape is rape period. "This is language, stock language used for lots of different bills, bills I didn't author. And that language was removed to be very clear, and I agree with that, removing that language, so we are very clear. Rape is rape. Period. End of story." So that’s how Ryan felt about the matter, but what about Mack? We asked the Mack campaign several times how he felt about the "forcible rape" language but did not receive a response. So we don’t know whether Mack supported removing the wording or not. (Editor's note: After we published this report, we received a comment from the Mack campaign. We have included it below our ruling.) Our ruling Nelson said that Mack voted to redefine rape as forcible rape. The bill in question was intended to limit federal funding for abortion. As part of that, the bill did originally aim to limit that funding from "rape" to cases of "forcible rape." Redefining rape, though, was not its primary purpose. And, this part of the bill was so controversial it was struck from the bill before it came to a vote. So Nelson was wrong to say Mack voted on the language. Still, Mack was an early co-sponsor when the bill did include language on forcible rape. We asked the Mack campaign multiple times if Mack supported or opposed the removal of that language. We did not receive a response. So we don’t know if Mack supported or opposed removal of the language that was in the bill when he co-sponsored it. We rate the statement Half True. Editor's note: After we published this report, the Mack campaign provided us with this response: "Congressman Mack strongly supported the removal of the term 'forcible' rape from the bill before it came up for consideration. Congressman Mack was one of 227 house co-sponsors on the bill which had the primary intent of providing greater protections against the use of federal taxpayer dollars to pay for abortions."

obry-00056	On her campaign website, Republican candidate for Wisconsin’s 68th assembly district Kathy Bernier, a three-term assemblywoman, claims she “voted for the first balanced budget Wisconsin has seen in decades.” She furthers her statement by claiming that “these hard choices helped eliminate the state’s $3.6 billion deficit.” Bernier, who has served in the state assembly since 2010, is referring to her vote in 2011 in favor of Wisconsin Act 10, or the Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill, that Gov. Scott Walker introduced. The bill, arguably the most controversial of Gov. Walker’s tenure, addressed a projected $3.6 billion budget deficit. Cuts were felt across the the board for public sector employees, affecting collective bargaining rights and a wide range of benefits. Gov.

pomt-13877	"Google search spike suggests many people don’t know why they voted for Brexit."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2016/jul/01/daily-mail/what-google-trends-tell-us-and-doesnt-about-brexit/	One of the punch lines in the Brexit vote fallout has been that people in the United Kingdom didn’t even know they were voting to leave the European Union. The evidence came from Google. News stories and Facebook posts pointed out that searches in the UK on basic questions like "what is the EU?" and "what does it mean to leave the EU?" spiked after the Brexit vote. Daily Mail, a daily British tabloid, posted an article with the headline: "Google search spike suggests many people don’t know why they voted for Brexit." The paper pointed to a spike in the query "what happens if we leave the EU," as evidence voters were unaware they voted to leave. The Washington Post also posted an article on the trend implying that voters in the United Kingdom didn’t know exactly what they were voting for. Even John Oliver poked fun at the trend on HBO’s Last Week Tonight. "It’s frankly hard not to think that some Britons may not have fully thought this through," Oliver said "Especially when you look at some of the top search terms concerning the EU the next day." But the Google Trends don’t show that at all, in reality. Here’s why. What Google Trends tells us (and doesn’t) Google Trends launched 10 years ago as a way to allow users to track the popularity of a search item in relation to an event. The search data categorizes searches into related groups and then measures the interest in a particular topic across searches from around the world, right down to cities. For example, these were the top five questions in the United Kingdom on Google Trends after the Brexit vote on June 23. The queries represent the most-searched items relating to the European Union. What Google Trends doesn’t tell us is who is actually doing the searching. So there’s no way to tell if the searches were done by Brexit voters. Another issue is the significance of the searches in comparison to other factors. A 250 percent spike doesn’t mean much if not many people were searching "what happens if we leave the EU?" prior to the report. The number of searches before the vote is hard to determine "The problem with Google Trends is that it's essentially a black box," said Pete Meyers, a marketing scientist at Moz which sells marketing analytics software subscriptions. "There's a lot we don't know about what goes into the number, and everything is relative." For instance, when you look at "What is the EU," on Google Trends, you see a spike. But when you add the term "Brexit" to the same graph the spike seems far less severe, he said. Although the raw totals of searches are not shown, the Trends data shows searches for "Brexit" were much higher than "What is the EU?" on June 24, the day after the vote. Google Trends looks at a random sample of all searches, so you don’t see the total number of specific searches. The numbers on the chart represent a probability of how highly searched a query is, ranked from 1 to 100. This allows Google to compare two terms against one another. The volume of searches can be a self-fulfilling prophecy, Meyers said. "If Google reports that a lot of people are searching for ‘What is the EU?’ and then the press picks it up, curiosity leads people to run similar searches to see what the fuss is about," Meyers said. He said he can’t prove that’s what happened here, but it has happened in the past. Another major flaw in using Google Trends to make bold pronouncements like the Daily Mail is that the most common way to search something is usually the term that shows up at the top, said Marti Hearst, a professor for the University of California at Berkeley’s school of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. "Only the most common (and therefore the most ignorant-sounding) search queries will make it to the top," Hearst said. In other words, nuance questions like, "How does Northumberland elected representative to the EU support our interests," would not surface to the top, she said. Experts agreed that the way many news outlets used the Google Trends reports is not grounded in science. "The numbers shown to the public are processed in many ways and are meant to be very general trends only," Hearst said. The claims that publications are making go too far, said Tom Davenport, the President’s Distinguished Professor of Information Technology and Management at Babson College. "I might interpret the findings more positively," Davenport said. "At least a lot of people have curiosity and are trying to learn more about the Brexit topic." Our ruling Like other media accounts, the Daily Mail headline said "Google search spike suggests many people don’t know why they voted for Brexit." This is misleading. It’s impossible to say if UK voters were the ones doing these searches, and the numbers of searches are hard to determine. Relative to searches for "Brexit," searches about "what is the EU" were far less common. We know people searched "What is the EU" and "What will happen if we leave the EU," but we don’t know why or how many. Point being, there’s no evidence to fill those gaps.

pomt-03312	"Every single month since 1985 has been warmer than the historic average. All 12 of the warmest years on record have come in the last 15 years."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jul/28/rush-holt/rush-holt-warns-millions-will-die-climate-change-g/	U.S. Senate candidate Rush Holt set off a political firestorm last week with these three words tucked into a campaign ad about the dangers of climate change: "Millions will die." Holt, a Democratic congressman, defended that claim in the face of criticism from Republican U.S. Senate candidate Steve Lonegan, who dismissed Holt’s climate change assertions as "silly hysteria." In the Aug. 13 Democratic primary, Holt is running against Newark Mayor Cory Booker, U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone (D-6th Dist.) and Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver (D-Essex) to fill the U.S. Senate seat previously held by the late Frank Lautenberg. PolitiFact New Jersey cannot fact-check the "millions will die" claim -- since it’s a prediction -- but another statement made by Holt earlier in the July 22 campaign ad caught our attention. "Every single month since 1985 has been warmer than the historic average," Holt (D-12th Dist.) said. "All 12 of the warmest years on record have come in the last 15 years." Those statements are accurate, according to data released by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. First, let’s address the first part about monthly temperatures. Referring to global temperatures -- meaning land and ocean surfaces combined -- Jessica Blunden, a climate scientist with the NOAA, confirmed in a series of e-mails that "since February 1985, every month has been warmer than the average of that month." The NOAA compares each month’s global temperature against the average for that respective month for the period between 1901 and 2000, Blunden said. Since February 1985, the global temperature for every month has been above its 20th Century average, she said. For instance, the NOAA found that the global temperature in June was 1.15 degrees Fahrenheit higher than the average of all the months of June between 1901 and 2000. That measurement marked "the 37th consecutive June and 340th consecutive month—that’s a total of more than 28 years—with a global temperature above the 20th-century average," according to a summary of the NOAA’s latest climate report. On the second point, it turns out that Holt's figure of the 12 warmest years on record occurring in the last 15 years was actually a conservative estimate. Based on NOAA data, the last 15 years -- from 1998 to 2012 -- have included the 14 hottest years on record since 1880 for global temperatures. The NOAA estimates that the hottest year was 2010. Using a different methodology, NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies estimates that the last 15 years have included the 13 hottest years since 1880 for global temperatures. In a statistical tie, either 2010 or 2005 may be considered the warmest year on record, according to Reto Ruedy, a climate scientist with the institute. The institute has said 2012 was the ninth warmest year on record, while the NOAA estimates that 2012 was the tenth hottest year. "The record dates back to 1880 because that is when there were enough meteorological stations around the world to provide global temperature data," according to a news release on the institute’s website. Our ruling In a campaign ad where he claimed "millions will die" from climate change, Holt cited two statistics about monthly and annual global temperatures. "Every single month since 1985 has been warmer than the historic average," Holt said. "All 12 of the warmest years on record have come in the last 15 years."

pomt-11334	EPA administrator Scott Pruitt's short-term rental "was about market rate."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/10/donald-trump/did-epas-pruitt-pay-below-market-rent/	When Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt was getting settled in Washington in 2017, he paid the wife of a gas and oil lobbyist $50 a night for her condominium on Capitol Hill. Pruitt used the space for about six months and only paid when he needed a room. The terms of the lease carried the whiff of a sweetheart deal with an industry that had dealings with the EPA. President Donald Trump on Twitter defended this and other controversial aspects of Pruitt’s decision-making in an April 7 tweet: "While Security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor, Scott Pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at EPA. Record clean Air & Water while saving USA Billions of Dollars. Rent was about market rate, travel expenses OK. Scott is doing a great job!" For this fact-check, we will examine whether the price tag for Pruitt’s short-term living arrangement was "about market rate." White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump relied on an initial assessment from the EPA. "He was referencing a report done by the EPA, which we are continuing to review," Sanders said April 9. "But in that, it cites the apartment was at market value." That EPA report came from the agency’s general counsel Kevin Minoli, written after media reports forced the issue into the open. "Market value for rental apartments is commonly thought of in terms of rental cost per month," Minoli wrote March 31. "Under the terms of the lease, if the space was utilized for one 30-day month, then the rental cost would be $1500, which is a reasonable market value." Based on that and other details, Minoli said the lease was not a gift. Market rent Washington’s Capitol Hill neighborhood offers a wide range of apartment options. Browsing on the rental website Zillow, we found that some of them go for about $1,500 a month, or $50 a day for a 30-day month. But those have only one bedroom, and we know that the condominium Pruitt rented had two. His daughter used the other bedroom when she spent time in the city. Even for one-bedroom units, the prices can easily go well over $1,500. Rents of $1,800 to $2,000 are common. For two-bedroom units, we found one for $1,850, but after that, the prices went up to $2,200 and higher. Pruitt described his lease as similar to an Airbnb rental, where he only paid for a bedroom when he was in town. But unlike that sort of Airbnb arrangement, he had access to the other amenities in the apartment, extending to the second bedroom used by his daughter. Pruitt got an Airbnb deal without the typical Airbnb drawbacks. Tim Burr with Yarmouth Management, a company that focuses on Capitol Hill rentals, said paying only when Pruitt needed the place made the terms notably convenient for Pruitt. "With Airbnb, you’re not guaranteed it will be available when you want it," Burr said. "That’s very unusual." We looked at the current Airbnb rates. The lowest price we found for immediate use was $40 a night, however, that is not the norm. To be fair, we can’t see the rates Pruitt might have seen in the winter of 2017. (Changing the dates, we did find one shared space in a one-bedroom for $23, which seems an unlikely option for Pruitt. Comedian John Oliver also browsed Airbnb and suggested Pruitt could have done worse — crashing on a couch named Black Beauty.) Pruitt said he might not always have free run of the apartment, but the use of the bedroom was not in question. It’s important to note that ultimately, he only paid about $1,000 a month for the place. The EPA steps back As the press reported more details of Pruitt’s arrangement, the EPA’s Minoli followed up his first report with a statement handed to reporters. "Some have raised questions whether the actual use of the space was consistent with the terms of the lease," Minoli said April 5. "Evaluating those questions would have required factual information that was not before us and the review does not address those questions." So, two days before Trump’s tweet, the EPA had backtracked on at least part of its ethics review. One day before Trump’s tweet, the Office of Government Ethics, the watchdog body for the executive branch, raised doubts about Pruitt’s lease. In a letter to the EPA on April 6, the ethics office wrote "additional information has now come to light that calls into question whether the earlier determination that the Administrator paid market value for the use he made of the apartment would still be valid." Our ruling Trump said that Pruitt paid approximately market rate for the living space he rented from the wife of an energy lobbyist. Trump based that on a review from the EPA, but the agency later said it lacked all the facts to fully assess the situation. A real estate professional familiar with rents in the neighborhood said the terms of the lease were unusually convenient for Pruitt. Our scan of current rents showed that the prices of two-bedroom apartments were higher than what he would have paid if he had stayed there every night for the entire six months. Pruitt was there only about two-thirds of the time, paying closer to $1,000 a month. No one-or-two-bedroom units were available under any terms for that price. The one caveat is we haven’t seen the exact terms of Pruitt’s lease or exactly how he and his family used the condominium. With that in mind, we rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-09654	Less than 10 percent of Obama's Cabinet appointees "have any experience in the private sector."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/02/glenn-beck/beck-says-less-10-percent-obama-cabinet-members-ha/	Fox News talk show host Glenn Beck has seized on a claim circulating on the Internet to argue that the Obama administration has little understanding of American business and is too focused on expanding government. "History has proven over and over again — and so has the post office, for that matter — that government is not the answer," Beck said on his Nov. 30, 2009, show. "You need to unleash the people. The entrepreneurs. And if you are wondering how it is that the government can't see that — how they can be pondering even bigger stimulus packages as they stare the failure of the first one right in the face — I'll show you. Here are the past presidents and the number of appointees in their Cabinets with private sector experience — folks that have done more than write on the chalkboard; they've been out there, in the real world. Let's compare President Nixon — he's over 50 percent — with President Obama: Under 10 percent of his appointees have any experience in the private sector." We did a little digging and found that the claim is based on a study by Michael Cembalest, the chief investment officer for J.P. Morgan Private Bank. In a Nov. 24, 2009, column titled "Obama's Business Blind Spot" and published on Forbes.com, Cembalest wrote, "In a quest to see what frame of reference the administration might have on this issue, I looked back at the history of the presidential Cabinet. Starting with the creation of the secretary of commerce back in 1900, I compiled the prior private-sector experience of all 432 Cabinet members, focusing on those positions one would expect to participate in this discussion: secretaries of State; Commerce; Treasury; Agriculture; Interior; Labor; Transportation; Energy; and Housing & Urban Development." He continued, "Many of these individuals started a company or ran one, with first-hand experience in hiring and firing, domestic and international competition, red tape, recessions, wars and technological change. Their industries included agribusiness, chemicals, finance, construction, communications, energy, insurance, mining, publishing, pharmaceuticals, railroads and steel; a cross-section of the American experience. (I even gave [one-third] credit to attorneys focused on private-sector issues, although one could argue this is a completely different kettle of fish.) One thing is clear: The current administration, compared with past Democratic and Republican ones, marks a departure from the traditional reliance on a balance of public- and private-sector experiences." In an accompanying chart, Cembalest reported that in the Obama administration, fewer than 10 percent of the Cabinet appointees counted under those rules had private sector experience. According to the chart, all other administrations going back to Theodore Roosevelt's had rates in at least the high 20s, with the Eisenhower and Reagan administrations approaching 60 percent. (He wrote in a footnote that the data came from a number of sources, including capsule biographies of Cabinet members posted on the Web site of the University of Virginia's Miller Center for Public Affairs.) The chart — typically reprinted by itself, without Cembalest's accompanying narrative — circulated in the conservative blogosphere for a couple of days before eventually being picked up by Beck. We wondered if the claim was right, so we did some math of our own. In Obama's Cabinet, at least three of the nine posts that Cembalest and Beck cite — a full one-third — are occupied by appointees who, by our reading of their bios, had significant corporate or business experience. Shaun Donovan, Obama's secretary of Housing and Urban Development, served as managing director of Prudential Mortgage Capital Co., where he oversaw its investments in affordable housing loans. Energy Secretary Steven Chu headed the electronics research lab at one of America's storied corporate research-and-development facilities, AT&T Bell Laboratories, where his work won a Nobel Prize for physics. And Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, in addition to serving as Colorado attorney general and a U.S. senator, has been a partner in his family's farm for decades and, with his wife, owned and operated a Dairy Queen and radio stations in his home state of Colorado. Three other Obama appointees had legal experience in the private sector. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Commerce Secretary Gary Locke spent part of their careers working as lawyers in private practice. Clinton and Vilsack worked as private-sector lawyers at the beginning of their careers, while Locke joined an international law firm, Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, after serving as governor of Washington state. At the firm, Locke "co-chaired the firm's China practice" and "helped U.S. companies break into international markets," according to his official biography. That sounds like real private sector experience to us. Finally, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner worked for Kissinger Associates, a consulting firm that advises international corporations on political and economic conditions overseas. The occupants of the two remaining Cabinet posts cited in the chart do not appear to have had significant private-sector experience: Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood. Obama's Cabinet has even more private-sector experience if you go beyond the nine. Two of the Obama appointees could be considered entrepreneurs — the very people Beck would "unleash." Vice President Joe Biden, officially a Cabinet member, founded his own law firm, Biden and Walsh, early in his career, and it still exists in a later incarnation, Monzack Mersky McLaughlin and Browder, P.A. (The future vice president also supplemented his income by managing properties, including a neighborhood swimming pool.) And Office of Management and Budget director Peter Orszag founded an economic consulting firm called Sebago Associates that was later bought out by a larger firm. It's also worth noting that if you examine a larger group of senior Obama administration appointees, you'll find that more than one in four have experience as business executives, according to a June study by National Journal . That compared with the 38 percent the magazine found eight years earlier at the start of George W. Bush's administration. That's at least three times higher than the level claimed by Beck. We tracked down Cembalest to ask about his methodology. He said any effort to address the topic is heavily subjective, and he expressed regret that his work had been used for political ends, saying that it was not his intention to provide fodder for bloggers and talk show hosts. Cembalest said that he did discount the corporate experience of the three lawyers we identified — Clinton, Vilsack and Locke — and added that he awarded nothing for Donovan, Chu or Salazar, even though we found they had a fair amount private sector experience. Cembalest acknowledged fault in missing Salazar's business background, saying he would have given him a full point if he had it to do over again. But he added that the kind of private-sector experiences Chu and Donovan had (managing scientific research and handling community development lending, respectively) did not represent the kind of private-sector business experience he was looking for when doing his study. "What I was really trying to get at was some kind of completely, 100 percent subjective assessment of whether or not a person had had enough control of payroll, dealing with shareholders, hiring, firing and risk-taking that they'd be in a position to have had a meaningful seat at the table when the issue being discussed is job creation," Cembalest said. Cembalest said he has "written 250,000 words in research over the last decade, and every single thing I've ever done — except this one chart — was empirically based on data from the Federal Reserve" or another official source. "This is the one time I stepped out into making judgment calls, and I assure you I won't do it again. ... The frightening thing about the Internet is that people copy one chart from what you write and then it goes viral. So I've learned a lesson here that these kinds of issues are best left addressed by the people who practice them day in and day out." Which brings us back to how Beck used Cembalest's data. We'll acknowledge that rating someone's degree of private-sector experience is an inexact science, and it's true that Beck accurately relayed the information contained in Cembalest's chart. But at PolitiFact we hold people accountable for their own words. So we rate Beck's claim False.	None	Glenn Beck	None	None	None	2009-12-02T18:34:05	2009-11-30	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-14351	"Ukraine voluntarily gave up its nuclear weapons because the United States of America" said it would "ensure (its) territorial integrity from Russia."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/23/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-wrongly-says-ukraine-gave-nukes-due-ameri/	CNN took its cue from the NCAA basketball championships to air an election special called "The Final Five," or five interviews with the remaining presidential candidates. During his conversation with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, CNN host Wolf Blitzer raised the issue of NATO. Blitzer asked Cruz what he thought about Donald Trump’s demand that the European members pay more for their common defense. Blitzer mentioned Trump’s point about Ukraine, saying Germany has more of an interest there than the United States. "Well, Donald, in all likelihood, has no awareness of this, but with regard to Ukraine, the United States has deep involvement," Cruz replied during the March 21, 2016, interview. "Ukraine used to be the third-largest nuclear country on the face of the Earth. Ukraine voluntarily gave up its nuclear weapons because the United States of America came in and said if you hand over those nuclear weapons, we will ensure your territorial integrity from Russia. We made a commitment, and then the Obama administration has broken its word." There are a couple of elements in Cruz’s statement. While he described the weapons as belonging to Ukraine, when the Soviet Union dissolved, the Russians still controlled them and Ukraine’s generals were unable to launch them. It would be more accurate to say that the warheads were on Ukrainian soil. The subject of this fact-check though is the claim that American promises of territorial integrity led Ukraine to hand over those nukes. Former presidential hopeful Ben Carson made the same argument in the very first Republican debate. We rated it False then, and Cruz’s claim is no different. Ukraine, nuclear weapons and the end of the Soviet Union The 1991 breakup of the Soviet Union generated enormous concern over the fate of the nuclear arsenal it had spread across three states that were newly independent -- Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine -- as well as in Russia itself. During the first six months of 1992, Moscow was quick to retrieve all of its tactical, or short-range, nukes. Corralling the strategic weapons, such as intercontinental missiles and bomber-based warheads, was trickier. Belarus and Kazakhstan agreed to dismantle or return what they had. But Ukraine looked at the roughly 1,900 warheads on its soil and began seeking something in exchange before it gave them up. Brian Finlay, a specialist in nonproliferation at the Stimson Center, a military-focused think tank in Washington, D.C., told us in August there was actually never any question that Ukraine would eventually relinquish those weapons. "They had announced that they would become a non-nuclear weapon state even before their declaration of independence," Finlay said. "Essentially, it was something that they traded off in order to encourage international recognition." According to a report by Steven Pifer, the U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine between 1998 and 2000, Ukraine wanted Russia to promise to respect its sovereignty and its borders, a promise that has since been ignored by Russia. But just as important, Ukraine wanted money. The highly-enriched uranium in the warheads was valuable, plus Ukraine wanted somebody else to cover the costs of dismantling the silos and other infrastructure. And Ukraine knew that going non-nuclear would open the door to better ties with the West. The deal that de-nuked Ukraine It took a series of agreements to finally clear the way for Ukraine to get rid of the weapons it held. Early in 1994, the United States agreed to provide money through the Nunn-Lugar program to dismantle Ukraine’s nuclear infrastructure. Russia agreed to write down the debts Ukraine owed. In December 1994, the United States, Russia, the United Kingdom and Ukraine signed the Budapest Memorandum of Security Assurances. Pifer described in his report how Washington wanted security assurances that avoided creating broad guarantees. "State Department lawyers thus took careful interest in the actual language, in order to keep the commitments of a political nature," Pifer wrote. "U.S. officials also continually used the term ‘assurances’ instead of ‘guarantees,’ as the latter implied a deeper, even legally-binding commitment of the kind that the United States extended to its NATO allies." The agreement stated that "the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the United States of America reaffirm their commitment": To respect the independence and sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine. To refrain from the threat or use of force against the territorial integrity or political independence of Ukraine To seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine, as a non-nuclear-weapon state party to the Treaty on the Nonproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, if Ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used. Pifer writes that American diplomats went so far as to make sure that the Russians and Ukrainians understood specifically that the English meaning of "assurance" was not the same as a "guarantee." In short, the United States never promised to protect Ukraine. All it did was promise not to attack it. We reached out to the Cruz campaign and did not hear back. Our ruling Cruz said that Ukraine agreed to give up the nuclear weapons on its territory because the United States promised to "ensure its territorial integrity." A diplomat with detailed knowledge of the American position noted that the United States went to pains to avoid making a strong guarantee to protect Ukraine’s borders. The formal memorandum of security assurances lacks a promise to ensure that Ukraine’s borders remain unchanged. The United States only promised to respect those borders itself, and to go to the United Nations should another power threaten Ukraine with a nuclear attack. Russia violated that memorandum, but that is separate from what the United States said it would do. We rate Cruz’s statement False.

pomt-14735	"One of the most troubling aspects of the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight bill was that it gave President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees, including Syrian refugees, without mandating any background checks whatsoever."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/18/ted-cruz/cruz-muddles-accusation-against-rubios-immigration/	Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio largely battled each other during the Republican debate in Las Vegas, including when Cruz accused Rubio of supporting a bill to let refugees into the country without first being vetted. Cruz singled out what he saw as a major flaw of a 2013 bipartisan immigration bill by the so-called Gang of Eight, which included Rubio and Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y. "Border security is national security, and you know, one of the most troubling aspects of the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight bill was that it gave President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees, including Syrian refugees, without mandating any background checks whatsoever," Cruz said. Did Rubio really back an immigration bill that would have allowed refugees from countries in turmoil to come in sans screening? It appears Cruz should work on his own vetting process. Presidential power The Cruz campaign did not get back to us when we asked how S. 744 — which passed the Senate (with Cruz voting no) in 2013 but wasn’t taken up in the House — would have granted the president this power. But when our friends at FactCheck.org looked at a similar claim earlier in December, Cruz’s office directed them to a column by Daniel Horowitz on ConservativeReview.com, a site that named Cruz "America’s Top Pick" among GOP candidates. Horowitz highlighted three sections of the bill to justify how the legislation would have opened up the country to substantial refugee risk. "Had the bill passed in 2013, it would have given the Obama administration power to define who is considered stateless," he wrote. "Most of those likely to be designated as stateless are from Islamic hell holes and would include the Syrians, Somalis, Palestinians, and the Muslim Rohingya in Burma." Horowitz told us the bill would have granted Obama sweeping power to bestow refugee status on groups as he saw fit. He also said it did nothing to establish standards for background checks on so-called "stateless" refugees, who already can’t be checked because there are no databases or information to consult, an argument Rubio has used to argue for prohibiting entry for Syrian refugees. PolitiFact has found that while there may be data gaps, there is a process to vet Syrian refugees. We spoke to several experts, including two resettlement agency officials interviewed by FactCheck.org. We found that their analyses of the bill don’t support Cruz’s claim about new "blanket authority" for Obama to admit refugees without any checks. We’ll start with the big picture. Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors reduced immigration, told us the bill did propose sweeping changes, including allowing the government to identify persecuted groups. That could be almost any group in the Middle East, he said. "The bottom line is that the bill gave the president huge new power that could have changed the refugee system," he said. But in the way Cruz alleged? Other experts said no. For one, the president has long had broad authority over refugee admission limits. "S. 744 didn’t give the president ‘blanket authority to admit refugees,’ " David Bier, the director of immigration policy at the libertarian Niskanen Center, said in an email. "The president has had the power since the Refugee Act of 1980 to establish limits on refugees in consultation with Congress. S. 744 didn’t affect this authority." From 1980-2008, the United States has accepted around 83,000 refugees a year. The Obama administration has said it will accept around 70,000 refugees from around the world in fiscal year 2015. Partly in response to the Syrian refugee crisis, that total will increase to 85,000 refugees in fiscal year 2016 and 100,000 in fiscal year 2017. In 2016, the administration plans to increase the number of admitted Syrian refugees almost six-fold to at least 10,000. What’s more, the Gang of Eight proposal specifically stated that all refugees would still be subject to background checks, Bier added. The average screening time for refugees from across the globe is between a year to a year and a half, involving background checks, interviews and confirmation from several federal agencies. For Syrian refugees, it takes two years on average. Cruz’s claim already misses these important points, but there are some specifics that experts say show his statement is inaccurate. ‘Stateless’ status One point is whether the bill would have allowed Obama to let in any group of refugees, Syrian or otherwise, and give them legal status. Section 3405 would have allowed the attorney general or the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to provide lawful status to a refugee considered "stateless" — meaning, they had no country to which the United States could otherwise send them. "A classic case is a person who entered the United States and applied for asylum whose country dissolved while they were awaiting their hearing and decision in the case," said Joanne Kelsey, the assistant director for advocacy at the Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, which helps resettle refugees. "If they were denied asylum and ordered deported, there is no country left to accept them as their national." Kelsey cited as an example people who were in the United States when the Soviet Union collapsed and new countries were formed from their home regions. But the "stateless" classification wouldn’t have been for refugees aiming to get into the United States, only people who are already in the country or would face this situation in the future. Mark Hetfield, president of HIAS, another refugee resettlement group, said this would not have changed the number of immigrants allowed into the country. The provision only applied to domestic law, he said, and people would have to prove this status, not just declare it. Persecution problem Another part of the bill about specially designating certain groups of refugees, Section 3403, is an attempt to codify something called the Lautenberg Amendment, an immigration provision that has been in effect since 1989 and must be renewed each year. The amendment has traditionally been aimed at certain religious minorities. By law, refugees seeking asylum in the United States must prove they have a "well founded fear of persecution." Our expert sources said section 3403 would have allowed the president to designate a group of interest to the United States as being persecuted as a whole. Think Christians in Syria or Yazidis in Iraq targeted by the Islamic State. Basically, it allows potential refugees to get in line faster. But instead of making the individual prove they are in danger, the threat would already be associated with their group, moving the rest of the screening process along. Its aim was to streamline the vetting process for refugees, not get rid of it. "It doesn’t create refugees or allow more refugees to come to the United States," Bier said. "They would still be subject to the normal refugee limit. It would create no additional numbers, but would increase, perhaps, the eligible pool of applicants." Deadline dilemma One final piece concerns the current one-year deadline in place for refugees to file for asylum once they arrive in the United States. Section 3401 would have repealed the deadline, and given people who had applications rejected for missing the window another two years to apply again. There are any number of reasons people miss the deadline — they don’t know they can apply, they’re afraid of government officials or even that they were hoping things in their home countries would get better so they could leave the United States and return. But again, it would only apply to refugees already in the United States, not people seeking to come in the future. Our experts said any worries that this would increase fraudulent immigration are unfounded. "This provision does not alter any standards or safeguards in the asylum system. All asylum seekers would continue to undergo rigorous security background checks and show that they are admissible to the United States," Kelsey said. Our ruling Cruz said, "One of the most troubling aspects of the Rubio-Schumer Gang of Eight bill was that it gave President Obama blanket authority to admit refugees, including Syrian refugees, without mandating any background checks whatsoever." The failed 2013 bill did not change the number of refugees, the overall framework of the screening process or give the president authority to admit any group at will. It would have allowed the president to designate certain groups outside the United States as particularly at risk, and other officials to label certain refugees in the United States as having nowhere to go. It further would have repealed the deadline for refugees already here to apply for asylum. Experts said none of the provisions Cruz has previously cited work the way he is warning they would. We rate his statement False.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2015-12-18T12:38:39	2015-12-15	['Syria', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-07714	Says neither President Barack Obama nor Mexico President Felipe Calderon "have been on the border to see what's happening to the citizens of Mexico, and for that matter the citizens of Texas."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/mar/04/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-neither-mexico-president-felipe-ca/	UPDATE, 11:15 a.m., March 7, 2011: After this article was published, readers alerted us to President Obama's Aug. 31, 2010, trip to Fort Bliss in El Paso. According to a transcript of his remarks, Obama thanked the soldiers and talked about his upcoming address to the nation on Iraq and Afghanistan; he made no mention of the border situation or Mexico during his two-hour visit. Gov. Rick Perry told an interviewer Wednesday that he’d dearly love to be part of Thursday’s White House meeting between President Barack Obama and Mexico President Felipe Calderon. Perry then told Greta Van Susteren of Fox News: "You know, neither one of them have been on the border to see what's happening to the citizens of Mexico, and for that matter the citizens of Texas." For real? We asked Perry’s office for back-up information, simultaneously trying to reach Calderon’s press contact and the White House on whether and why each president has ventured to the border. An online search yielded news articles showing that both Calderon, sworn in as president in 2006, and Obama, president since early 2009, have been to the U.S.-Mexico border, though it appears Obama has traveled there just once, while he was seeking the Democratic nomination for president. As president, he went to Mexico City in 2009. At least three times in 2010, Calderon visited Ciudad Juarez, the city adjoining El Paso, in the wake of January 2010 slayings that drew international attention. The Mexican city had experienced more than 2,500 killings in 2009, according to a CNN dispatch, which also quoted Calderon saying there: "I come mostly to listen... we're looking for solutions from Juarez because you are the ones living it." Also in 2010, Calderon visited Matamoros, across the border from Brownsville, and Piedras Negras, opposite Eagle Pass, in the wake of a hurricane. He also helped open an international bridge in Reynosa, near McAllen, at a cross-border event where Obama’s emissary was U.S. Trade Representative Ron Kirk, the former Dallas mayor. And Obama? In February 2008, according to a CBS News report, then-candidate Obama courted Brownsville voters. The report says he and state Rep. Eddie Lucio III briefly stood near the U.S. bank of the Rio Grande, looking across the border. According to the report, Obama joked: "This is the first time that I've been this close here, in Texas. I've been in Mexico when I was in college and was going to school in Southern California. I can't entirely talk about it." Obama went to Mexico City in April 2009 as part of a swing through Latin America. An April 16, 2009 news article in the New York Times says Obama was the first American president since Bill Clinton to visit Mexico’s capital, where he hoped to shore up Calderon’s "efforts to combat the rising tide of cross-border drug violence." This February, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano invited Republican and Democratic U.S. House leaders to join her at the Mexican border this spring, according to a Feb. 10 Politico news article. Republicans have urged Obama to visit the border. In March 2010, Texas U.S. Sens. Kay Bailey Hutchison and John Cornyn sent Obama a letter including an invitation to join them on a visit to the border region. "Such a visit would draw national attention to a national priority," the letter says, "and allow you to thank the federal and local officials who are doing heroic work to protect our communities." In September 2010, U.S. Sen. John McCain told a Fox News interviewer that he wanted Obama to visit the border. "I’d love for the president to come and visit the border. Unfortunately, he hasn’t had time to do so," the Wall Street Journal quoted McCain saying. Next, we asked CBS News’ White House correspondent Mark Knoller to check his well-respected log of presidential trips. Knoller said by e-mail that as president, Obama has not made any U.S.-Mexico border stops. He said Obama’s predecessor, George W. Bush, delivered a speech on border security in El Paso in March 2002, also watching a demonstration of technology that detects contraband in border-crossing vehicles. Knoller said Bush also came to Tucson and El Paso in November 2005 and in May 2006 made a trip to Yuma to observe National Guard troops on the border. Finally, we asked political scientist David Shirk, director of the non-partisan Trans-Border Institute at San Diego University, how he’d appraise Perry’s claim. Shirk said Perry’s wrong about Calderon, but correct per Obama who, Shirk said, "has not visited the border region since the start of his presidency to examine the circumstances that we’re facing here in communities like San Diego and El Paso, places where we are very close to the violence and there’s been a lot of discussion about the possible spillover effects." As for whether Obama is "right for not visiting the border," that’s a separate question, Shirk said, adding that the answer depends on whether the "situation and the (status) of border residents today (is) more important" than other issues on the nation’s agenda. To our inquiry about Obama’s border travels, White House spokesman Adam Abrams declined comment. We didn’t hear back from Perry and failed to connect with Calderon’s office. Perry’s statement appears to be accurate per Obama, but it’s unmoored regarding Calderon. We rate it Half True.

pomt-07498	On the way the federal government should spend Florida's rejected high-speed rail money.	full flop	/florida/statements/2011/apr/11/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-takes-credit-helping-avert-federal-/	Here's one you probably didn't catch on CNN -- Florida Gov. Rick Scott helped avoid the federal government shutdown. According to Scott, anyway. Scott's office penned a press release on April 11, 2011, titled "Governor Rick Scott Helps Avoid Government Shutdown and Save Federal Taxpayers $1.5 billion." The release linked to a Huffington Post article, which reported that as part of a budget agreement, $1.5 billion will be cut from high-speed rail projects. Here is the release in full: This weekend as Washington, D.C., insiders struggled to find billions to prevent a government shutdown, they found $1.5 billion worth of taxpayer money exactly where Governor Rick Scott left it: in the boondoggle high speed rail proposal. "I am proud to have brought this waste to the attention of those in Washington," Governor Rick Scott stated in response to the news. "These funds should either be returned to taxpayers as tax cuts or applied to reducing the burden that our national debt is passing to future generations." According to media reports, the final continuing resolution from Congress will include a $1.5 billion reduction in funds for high speed rail. Governor Scott rejected $2.4 billion for the project in Florida. The idea that Scott wants Florida's high-speed rail money to be used for tax cuts or to reduce the national debt stuck out to us because we remembered him saying something different when he initially announced he was rejecting the federal money. So we wanted to check Scott's statements using our Flip-O-Meter. Back on Feb. 16, Scott wrote to U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood to announce his decision to reject approximately $2.4 billion in federal money for a high-speed line between Tampa and Orlando. But back then, Scott said he didn't want the money to leave the state entirely. "As you know, my focus has been to ensure that transportation investments in our State reflect the diversity of needs we face -- from port facilities and highways and rail connections that drive domestic commerce and international trade, to investments in aviation and transit," Scott wrote LaHood. "I believe that the dollars being made available for proposed high-speed rail are better invested in higher yield projects, like those we have discussed in the past few weeks." Scott then included a list of projects, including dredging improvements at the ports in Miami and Jacksonville, the widening of Interstate 4 in Orange County, the widening of I-95 in Martin, St. Lucie, Brevard and Volusia counties, and the widening of Interstate 275 in Hillsborough County. "The long-term job creation opportunities from these projects are greater, the private investment stronger and the economic yield more permanent," Scott concluded. "Given the limited dollars available, federal investments, rather than generating temporal job creation, must be directed toward those projects offering real long-term growth potential and a broader return on investment for our economy and our citizens." Pretty different tone, huh? The St. Petersburg Times also noted that the money being trimmed from the budget also is not part of the $2.4 billion that Scott rejected earlier this year. The cut is to additional budgeted appropriations. Furthermore, the Department of Transportation is planning to award the $2.4 billion Florida rejected to other states. On April 6, the department announced that it has received more than 90 applications for the money from 24 states, the District of Columbia and Amtrak. Scott said when he rejected the money for high-speed rail that the funds should go to port and highway projects in Florida. Now, as part of trying to take credit for averting a government shutdown, he says the money should pay off the debt or go back to taxpayers. There is nothing consistent about those two positions, so we rate it a Full Flop.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2011-04-11T18:47:45	2011-04-11	['None']

pomt-05751	President Obama pushed through the stimulus "based on the promise of keeping unemployment under 8 percent."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2012/mar/02/eric-cantor/cantor-says-obama-promised-stimulus-would-keep-une/	Like many Republicans, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor was not in a celebratory mood on the the third anniversary of President Barack Obama’s signing of the stimulus bill. Cantor, R-7th, fired out a four-paragraph statement saying the stimulus -- a package of government spending, tax cuts and aid to cash-strapped states that was designed to jolt the economy -- is a failure. "Three years ago, President Obama’s first action in office was to push through a massive $825 billion stimulus package based on the promise of keeping unemployment under 8 percent," Cantor said in the Feb. 16 statement. The claim that Obama promised the stimulus would keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent has been a favorite talking point among Republicans, including presidential candidate Mitt Romney, U.S. Senate hopeful George Allen of Virginia and House Speaker John Boehner. Cantor made a similar claim back in 2009. PolitiFact has examined the statement repeatedly, each time rating it Mostly False. Since the claim is making the rounds again, we took a new look. Megan Whittemore, a Cantor spokeswoman, backed her boss’s statement by referring to a widely cited report from Jan. 9, 2009. It was authored by Christina Romer, the incoming chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, chief economic adviser for incoming Vice President Joe Biden. The report contains a chart on page 4 predicting unemployment rates in subsequent years. The chart shows that without a recovery plan totaling about $775 billion, the U.S. unemployment rate was expected to peak at 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, it shows unemployment was projected to top out at just under 8 percent towards the end of 2009. We now know that the unemployment rate cleared 8 percent in February 2009 and stayed above that level ever since. It peaked at 10 percent in October 2009 and was down to 8.3 percent in January 2012, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. But contrary to Cantor’s claim, the Romer-Bernstein report did not make promises about the unemployment rate. It made qualified projections. Page 2 of the report states, "It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error. There is the obvious uncertainty that comes from modeling a hypothetical package rather than the final legislation passed by the Congress. But, there is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. "Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." Obama, in a radio address 10 days before his inauguration, said, "The report confirms that our plan (that the stimulus) will likely save or create 3 million to 4 million jobs." Whittemore said in an email to Politifact Virginia, "If, as a Virginian or American citizen, I listened to the president’s address and referred to the report on Jan. 10 (the day of his address), I would have found the infamous chart showing that unemployment would stay below 8 percent if the stimulus were to pass. My main take away would naturally be that with passage of the stimulus, unemployment would never go above 8 percent. Why would I believe that? Because President Obama told me so." Obama, in his speech, never mentioned the 8 percent figure. He did not use the word "promise," nor refer to the graph on page 4. He said the report contained "projections of how many jobs (the stimulus) will create. And we suspect people who were interested enough to read the report would have seen the disclaimer on Page 2 and other qualifying language in the document. No doubt, the 8 percent unemployment projection was rosy. The Congressional Budget Office, one month after the Romer-Bernstein report was released, estimated unemployment would level off at 8.5 percent with the stimulus and 9 percent without it. Those numbers, too, turned out to be overly optimistic. The Obama administration has acknowledged the Romer-Bernstein report underestimated the severity of the recession. "The truth is, we and everyone else misread the economy," Vice-President Joe Biden told ABC in July 2009. The report’s projection that the stimulus would save between 3 million and 4 million jobs also appears now to be optimistic. The president’s Council of Economic Advisers, in an analysis released in December, estimated that between 2.2 million and 4.2 million jobs were created or saved by the stimulus through the second quarter of 2011. The council’s report cited independent studies by the Congressional Budget Office and three private economic analysis companies. Here’s what the groups found: • CBO: Between 500,000 and 2.9 million jobs saved or created. • IHS/Global Insight: 2.4 million jobs saved or created. • Macroeconomic Advisers: 2.6 million jobs saved or created. • Moody’s Economy.com: 2.1 million jobs saved or created. Our ruling Cantor said Obama’s stimulus was passed with the "promise" of keeping the unemployment rate below 8 percent. The majority leader says the vow was made in a January 2009 report issued by the incoming administration. But the study did not guarantee specific results from the stimulus, it offered economic projections that contained disclaimers saying the estimates had "significant margins of error" and a high degree of uncertainty due to a recession that was "unusual both in its fundamental causes and severity." Clearly, the Obama administration can be faulted for estimating the stimulus would hold unemployment just below 8 percent. But contrary to Cantor’s claim, Obama never promised that outcome, nor did his administration. Again, we rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-13671	"We have a fire marshal that said, 'Oh we can't allow more people’ ... And the reason they won't let them in is because they don't know what the hell they're doing."	pants on fire!	/colorado/statements/2016/aug/03/donald-trump/trump-falsely-accuses-colorado-fire-marshal-incomp/	Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has blasted fire marshals across the country over crowd-size restrictions at venues, including accusing marshals in Colorado and Ohio of incompetence or political skulduggery within three days. The latest fireworks began July 29, at Trump’s rally at the University of Colorado in Colorado Springs. The billionaire real estate developer entered the Gallogly Events Center to a cheering crowd. But he quickly launched into an attack on Colorado Springs Fire Marshal Brett Lacey. "This is why our country doesn't work," Trump said. "We have thousands of people in (an overflow) room next door. We have plenty of space here. We have thousands of people outside trying to get in. And we have a fire marshal that said, 'Oh we can't allow more people.' ... And the reason they won't let them in is because they don't know what the hell they're doing." Trump continued to blame the fire marshal for the "disgraceful situation" during his one-hour address. He decried Lacey’s "incompetence," saying "he's probably a Democrat" and "maybe they're a Hillary person." Our research shows Trump is wrong on several counts. Public records show Lacey is a registered Republican, and fire officials were following standard guidelines for crowd limits. Standing room Trump’s account of what went wrong at the rally and who was to blame is questionable. There were 1,100 people -- not "thousands" as he said -- in the overflow room who watched his speech on a TV screen. There was a line of people left outside, but it’s unclear if included "thousands of people," as he said. What about Trump’s claim that "We have plenty of space here," to let more people into the events center? Colorado Springs Fire Department spokesman Steve Wilch told PolitiFact the Trump campaign was aware a day before the rally that Lacey, the fire marshal, had limited the events center to 1,500 spectators and the overflow room to 1,000 spectators. UCCS Chancellor Pam Shockley-Zalabak told the Colorado Springs Gazette, "The campaign handled all the ticketing and more tickets were issued than the space available." PolitiFact requested comment from the Trump campaign but received no reply. In an interview after the rally, Lacey told PolitiFact partner Denver7 that he based his crowd restrictions on a Thursday walk through of the event center and the overflow room, where he double-checked the exits, the size of the space and potential obstructions like crowd-control barriers, the stage and platforms for news cameras. Lacey also reviewed the original construction design plans for the building, which had passed international fire and building codes. These plans include a "life-safety sheet," detailing the building’s intended use, square footage, capacity and exits. The fire code, which most fire agencies rely on, is "based on the premise that every space can hold a certain number of people based on the square footage, and then based on the number of people we're going to provide the proper number of exits," Boulder Chief Fire Marshal Dave Lowrey told PolitiFact. What the building is used for is key to determining space requirements known as the "occupant load factor." Restaurants are required to provide 15 square feet per person, because they have tables and chairs that people need to get around while fleeing an emergency, Lowrey said. At a political rally, where people are sitting on folding chairs, the code requires 7 square feet per person. If it’s standing-room-only, the requirement is 5 square feet per person. Emergency exits are a key ‘life-safety factor’ But the most important "life-safety factor" is the number of exits. "If you can't get out of building in an emergency, well, you're in a whole a lot of trouble," Lowrey said. "Every large, tragic indoor fire has probably been contributed to somehow by overcrowding, and blocked exits or locked doors." Lacey said he worked closely with the Secret Service, police and UCCS officials as he made his decision about the right "occupant loads" for the venues. These officials weren’t the only ones who agreed to the fire marshal’s decisions on crowd restrictions. Three days before the rally, Trump campaign treasurer, Timothy Jost, and UCCS officials signed a "Facility Usage License Agreement." The contract stated that the campaign "shall comply with...all other rules and regulations prescribed by the Fire and Police Departments and other governmental authorities, as may be in force and effect during the terms of this Agreement." So the Trump campaign had agreed to comply with the fire department’s safety requirements days before the candidate blew up at the fire marshal. Earlier Friday afternoon, Lacey received a call from the police command center that there was a request to allow more people into the rally. After conferring with security officials and an on-site fire battalion chief, Lacey said he was comfortable with a 10 percent increase in the events center crowd (to 1,650) and the overflow room (to 1,100). Denver7 asked Lacey about Trump’s assertions that he was a disgrace and "probably a Democrat." "Absolutely not," the fire marshal replied. "Anytime that any of the members of the Colorado Springs Fire Department are working, the politics or policies like that are not on our agenda. We're here for public safety and making certain our community is safe from harm." "If the event planners wanted to have more people inside, we have a number of venues here in the Colorado Springs area that they could have secured," Lacey added. "But this is the event (venue) that they chose." While fire marshals wrestle with these life-or-death decisions, they’ve also had Trump publicly berating them in at least four states. In Ohio on Monday, Trump pulled aside reporters before a rally at the Greater Columbus Convention Center to rail against another fire marshal’s crowd restrictions. "For political reasons, purely for political reasons, they said in this massive building, you're not allowed to have any more than 1,000 people, and that's nonsense. We could've had 4, 5, 6,000 people -- they've all be turned away… It's a disgrace," Trump said in a video that New York Times reporter Nick Corasaniti posted in Twitter. "The fire marshal said he's not allowed to allow any more, even though the building handles many thousands of people. I just want to tell you that's politics at its lowest. You ought to check it out, but it’s really politics at its lowest." PolitiFact did check it out and obtained documents from the Greater Columbus Convention Center that contradicted Trump's claims that his campaign was blindsided by the crowd restrictions. The center’s "event acknowledgement" document, containing the name and contact information for Trump campaign official John Hiller, stated the maximum event capacity was "800+ media (not to exceed 1,000 per Fire marshal and contract)." The document states "This event is by invitation" and it was "Fire marshal approved." The venue license contract was signed July 29 -- three full days before the event -- by Jost, the campaign treasurer, and the convention center general manager. Columbus Fire Department spokesman Steve Martin told the New York Times that Trump's accusations of politics were "completely false." Trump’s ‘battle with America’s firefighters’ What Politico calls the GOP nominee’s "battle with America’s firefighters" has been going on for more than a year. At a February rally at Madison City Stadium in Alabama, Trump twice complained that a fire marshal had shut the gates when the candidate claimed 32,000 were trying to hear him speak, according to AL.com. "Let them come in, Mr. Fire Marshal," Trump urged from the stage. The news website said estimates placed the rally at more than 10,000 people. Then in Phoenix last summer, Trump did an about-face, saying city officials "broke the fire code" by allowing too many people into the convention center room where he was speaking. "Convention Center officials in Phoenix don't want to admit that they broke the fire code by allowing 12-15,000 people in 4,000 code room," Trump tweeted in July 2015. But the Phoenix Fire Department told ABC15 its officials limited the room to 4,200 people and closed the doors once that capacity was reached. "No rules or codes were broken," Deputy Chief Shelly Jamison said. Back in Colorado, other fire marshals are praising Lacey for handling the Trump rally dispute with dispassionate professionalism. "That's what Brett, the fire marshal in Colorado Springs, was trying to ensure -- the safety of the people in there. I don't want to over-crowd. If something does happen, I want to make sure people can get out," said Lowery, the Boulder fire marshal. Our ruling Trump claimed, "We have a fire marshal that said, 'Oh we can't allow more people’....And the reason they won't let them in is because they don't know what the hell they're doing." The Colorado Springs fire marshal laid out a clear explanation of how he set the crowd capacity based on fire codes and the professional calculus of how many people can swiftly and safely be evacuated if an emergency occurs. A Trump campaign official signed a contract agreeing to comply with the fire department’s rules and the campaign was notified of the crowd limits a day before the event. In at least four states, the Republican nominee has accused fire marshals of incompetence or political favoritism during crowd-capacity disputes. But documents often show high-ranking campaign officials agreed to the restrictions in writing ahead of time.

pomt-04403	Sherrod Brown "failed to pay his own taxes three separate times."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/oct/17/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-ad-claims-sherrod-brown-failed-pay-his/	Claims and charges keep flying in the U.S. Senate race between Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown and Republican Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel. Mandel opened the final month of the campaign with a TV ad focused on Brown's tax lapses. "Sherrod Brown caught not paying his taxes" are the announcer's first words, and the same words are displayed onscreen. In a news release accompanying the ad, Mandel calls Brown "a serial delinquent when it comes to not paying his property taxes" because he "failed to pay his own taxes three separate times." Mandel's campaign cited articles by The Plain Dealer and Associated Press as support for the claim. PolitiFact Ohio looked at those stories and others. We also reviewed records from the District of Columbia's Office of Tax and Revenue. The stories, in February 2012, reported that Brown had paid a penalty fee and interest a week earlier, after being four months late paying property tax on his Washington, D.C., apartment. Brown owed $922.04 in property taxes for the last half of 2011. The taxes were due by Sept. 26, according to the District property tax office. His delinquency added another $76.96 as a late penalty and $46.18 for interest. Brown also was delinquent in 2006 and 2007 and paid penalties and interest, according to tax records from the District. Before he paid the bill in 2007, his apartment was placed on a District of Columbia auction list for properties with taxes in arrears. The delinquencies in 2006 and 2007 resulted in Brown paying a total of $735.07 in late charges and interest. Each of those original tax bills, excluding interest and fines, was for less than $900. Brown was asked about the delinquency during a conference call with reporters last February. He said, "I was late. I misplaced the bill and I paid it as soon as I found out. I paid a penalty for being late, and it won't happen again." He said he also had misplaced the earlier missed bills. "This is a small apartment," he said. "I'm not in D.C. nearly every week, I'm here when the Senate's in session, I'm here three or four nights a week. I paid the penalty. And in no way, obviously, was I avoiding taxes." Brown, who won his Senate seat in 2006 after serving seven terms in the House of Representatives, bought the one-bedroom apartment in 1993. He appeared to have paid the property taxes on time for a dozen years after that. His primary residence is in Avon. Mandel was accurate in saying that Brown failed to pay his taxes three separate times. Brown was late to pay. He did pay the taxes and penalty. There is no indication he was trying to evade the tax, but that wasn’t part of Mandel’s claim, either. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim in the Mandel campaign ad rates True.

pomt-00084	"Protections on pre-existing conditions have been there since the 1970s."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/01/kevin-cramer/no-protections-pre-existing-conditions-have-not-ex/	Democratic incumbent Heidi Heitkamp hounded her Republican challenger, Kevin Cramer, on his health care votes in the final North Dakota Senate debate on Oct. 26. Heitkamp pressed Cramer to explain why he had voted multiple times to repeal the Affordable Care Act in the House of Representatives. Cramer said the Republican alternatives he voted for "do guarantee, emphatically, without any ambiguity whatsoever, people with pre-existing conditions." While protections for pre-existing conditions were baked into the multiple ACA replacements, we’ve found the language is not as air tight as under Obamacare. The limits of what insurance companies could charge would have also been watered down, sending premiums to the point that coverage for many would be unattainable. Heitkamp, however, zeroed in on the proposals that were not backed by any alternatives. "But, admit, that when you voted to repeal it without a replacement, what happened? You took away the protections on pre-existing conditions," Heitkamp said. "No, because protections on pre-existing conditions have been there since the 1970s, and North Dakota, under Gov. Ed Schafer, had a plan to cover people in North Dakota," Cramer said. "I trust the governors of North Dakota and our legislature way more than I trust (the federal government)." Have pre-existing conditions been protected in North Dakota for decades? No. "To suggest there was a complete protection of pre-existing conditions under state or federal law is just not accurate," said Kevin Lucia, project director at Georgetown University's Health Policy Institute. Cramer’s campaign referred us to the Employee Retirement and Income Security Act of 1974. That regulated various aspects of most employer-provided group health plans. It wasn't until the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act was passed in 1996, however, that federal law limited the ability of such plans to exclude coverage for pre-existing conditions, according to Amy Monahan, a law professor at the University of Minnesota. Cramer did clarify, in the debate and through his campaign, that federal law protected people on group plans, which the majority of people in North Dakota have. "That takes us down to a very small number," Cramer said. But coverage for people in group plans isn’t at stake here; it’s coverage for individuals outside of group plans. That’s about 8 percent of the population in North Dakota. It’s a small number, as Cramer said, but not insignificant. Prior to the ACA, private insurers in the individual market in North Dakota could turn people down because of a pre-existing condition, or exclude coverage for their pre-existing condition. HIPAA provided some protection for people who recently lost job-based coverage to transition into individual coverage, and each state had to figure out how to implement it. North Dakota did that through the Comprehensive Health Association of North Dakota, which went into effect in 1982, effectively predating the law. "Even though technically these plans provided a safety net for people with pre-existing conditions, it was a weak safety net," said Allison Hoffman, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. "For most people, it did not work well because coverage was expensive and limited." Earl Pomeroy, former Insurance Commissioner for North Dakota from 1985 to 1992, said he was unaware of any other state programs that beefed up coverage for pre-existing conditions. The high-risk pool is still in place today, but its protections are limited in comparison to the ACA. Most other states eliminated their own pools after the ACA became law. First, people who are not HIPAA-eligible have to wait six months before coverage begins for their pre-existing conditions, or nine months if they are pregnant. For a cancer patient, that can be six months too many. HIPAA eligibility is conferred by 18 months of qualifying previous coverage and less than a 63-day gap in coverage. Second, the policies cap out at $1 million. "An individual with a serious pre-existing condition could hit that cap pretty quickly and then have no source of coverage after that," said Wendy Netter Epstein, a law professor at DePaul University. Third, premiums can be up to 35 percent more expensive than standard rates. In the individual market in the ACA, there are no lifetime caps and the standard rate is the rate, according to Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation. While rates have been on the rise, the ACA offers sliding scale subsidies for people earning up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level. 87 percent of marketplace enrollees received subsidies in North Dakota this year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Our ruling Cramer said, "Protections on pre-existing conditions have been there since the 1970s." Coverage of pre-existing conditions in group plans has been mandated by law since 1994, not the 1970s. But private insurers in North Dakota could turn down people in the individual market because of a pre-existing condition prior to the ACA. A 1982 state law provided an alternative, but it was not nearly as strong a guarantee of protection for pre-existing conditions as those provided by the ACA. We rate this statement False.

pomt-08688	The Richardson-Denish administration "gave" 50,000 driver's licenses to illegal immigrants in New Mexico.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/09/susana-martinez/richardson-denish-administration-gave-50000-driver/	Perhaps it was only a matter of time before New Mexico joined the list of states embroiled in heated debates over immigration policy. In her latest ad, Republican gubernatorial candidate Susana Martinez says that while she gave illegal criminals prison time, the Richardson-Denish administration gave out 50,000 licenses to illegal immigrants. New Mexico is one of only three states in which illegal immigrants may apply for and receive drivers licenses --Utah and Washington are the other two. But we wanted to see whether Martinez's ad tells the full story. First, some background. On March 14, 2003, Gov. Bill Richardson signed a bill that allows individuals without a Social Security number to apply for a New Mexico driver's license. During the registration process, the applicant is asked to provide an alternative means of identification, such as a personal taxpayer identification number, a valid passport issued by the country of citizenship, a Matricula Consular card issued after 2005 by the Mexican consulate or a foreign birth certificate with a notarized English translation. If all checks out, the Motor Vehicles Department will issue a driver's license, regardless of the applicant's immigration status. In 2003, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Diane Denish was Richardson's lieutenant governor, so it is fair to say that she carries at least some responsibility for the policy, which in effect allowed illegal immigrants to apply for and receive a New Mexico driver's license. Proponents of the law said that it was a question of public safety. With a driver's license comes a driving record, which means that the police can keep track of dangerous drivers. It also meant that all drivers could buy insurance. Still, we find that the ad is misleading on major points. First, the number 50,000. According to Martinez's ad, that's how many illegal immigrants received a driver's license since the policy took effect. But S.U. Mahesh, a spokesman for the New Mexico's MVD, wrote us in an e-mail that the state does not track how many licenses it issues to those who are in the country illegally. Since 2003, it has issued around 80,000 licenses to foreign nationals, but there are no official statistics on how many of those were illegal immigrants. When we asked Martinez's campaign staff where the number came from, we were referred to two articles. In June 2010, The Albuquerque Journal reported that "more than 50,000 immigrants have obtained driver's licenses since 2003." Since the actual number is around 80,000, the newspaper's statement is technically accurate. But unlike Martinez, the article says "immigrants," not "illegal immigrants." The other account used the 80,000 figure. Second, Martinez claims that Denish "gave" driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, but that is an over-simplification. Before Gov. Richardson signed the legislation, it had to receive stamp of approval from the New Mexico legislature. Moreover, the MVD does not automatically hand out drivers licenses. While it does not check the individual's immigration status, the MVD works with the Mexican and other governments to verify an applicant's identity. And as of July 2010, individuals without a Social Security number must schedule an appointment at the MVD in advance. The measure is aimed at making it easier for MVD clerks to review application documents in more detail, said MVD Director Michael Sandoval. The ad also fails to point out that Denish has publicly said that she no longer supports the law because it has not worked as intended. "Diane Denish does not support giving driver’s licenses to illegal immigrants and would seek to change that law," Chris Cervini, Denish's deputy campaign director, wrote in an e-mail to PolitiFact. The New Mexico Independent reported in July, 2010 that "Denish has said she’d consider stopping the issuance of licenses going forward." Her opponent, Martinez, has said she would go even further, revoking licenses already issued. Neither candidate has directly answered how she would deal with the consequences of ending the policy, including an uptick in the state's uninsured rate, according to the Independent. So let's go back over what we've found. Martinez says that Diane Denish "gave" 50,000 licenses to illegal immigrants. First, the MVD doesn't just hand out drivers licenses: It takes steps to verify an individual's identity, and the rules are getting tougher. Second, while it's reasonable to believe that some of the immigrants who received licenses under the policy are in the country illegally, the numbers don't support the claim. The state doesn't keep track of how many licenses are issued to illegal immigrants, so all we can be sure of is that since 2003, 80,000 foreign nationals have received drivers licenses. Third, while Denish supported the measure when it was enacted, the ad conveniently ignores Denish's public statements that she no longer supports the policy. Finally, the ad equates being a non-citizen with being an illegal immigrant. For us, it adds up to Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Susana Martinez	None	None	None	2010-09-09T17:49:45	2010-08-31	['None']
pomt-09657	A new Republican litmus test "would have resulted in (the GOP) kicking out Ronald Reagan."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/01/keith-olbermann/olbermann-says-proposed-gop-litmus-test-would-free/	To enforce ideological purity, a proposal before the Republican National Committee would deny party funding to any GOP candidate who bucks the party's stance on at least three items from a 10-point checklist of issues. The idea has sparked controversy within the Republican Party, and Democrats have seized on it as ammunition for their claim that the GOP has become too rigidly doctrinaire to appeal to many American voters. Keith Olbermann, the liberal host of Countdown on MSNBC, welcomed the proposal on his Nov. 23, 2009, show as evidence that Republicans are out of the mainstream. Olbermann told viewers that the resolution -- which invoked the name of former President Ronald Reagan six times in its preamble -- would have effectively blackballed Reagan himself had it been in place during his political career. By Olbermann's count, the late conservative icon would have scored a measly four out of 10 -- just half of the eight he would have needed to secure financial backing from the party. As we looked at the Republican proposal, we were struck by how specific its 10 items are to today's political environment. Reagan didn't have to consider wars in Iraq and Afghanistan or the prospect of gay marriage, for example. As a result, just a few of the checklist items can be directly compared to the issues Reagan faced, first during two terms as California governor and then as a two-term president. Because of this uncertainty, we won't rate Reagan -- or Olbermann -- in detail on each of the 10 issues. But if three problematic issues for Reagan exist, we think it's fair to say that he'd lose funds under the terms of today's proposal. We'll start by pointing out the one issue of the 10 that presents a clear case of Reagan overstepping today's Republican orthodoxy: • "We support legal immigration and assimilation into American society by opposing amnesty for illegal immigrants." In 1986, Reagan signed the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which provided a path to amnesty for illegal immigrants who could prove that they had been in the United States for a certain period of time. Case closed. In the meantime, we settled upon six issues that we don't think can be used as fair comparisons, even though Olbermann did cite a few of them as examples of Reagan's unorthodox behavior on related issues. They are: • "We support market-based health care reform and oppose Obama-style government-run health care." • "We support market-based energy reforms by opposing cap and trade legislation." • "We support workers’ right to secret ballot by opposing card check." • "We support victory in Iraq and Afghanistan by supporting military-recommended troop surges." • "We support containment of Iran and North Korea, particularly effective action to eliminate their nuclear weapons threat." • "We support retention of the Defense of Marriage Act." While health care, energy policy, labor rights, military strategy, foreign affairs and gay rights were issues in Reagan's day just as they are today, we concluded that the battles in Reagan's time, and in ours, had enough unique factors that it's impossible to be sure what his actions then would have meant about the policy debates of today. That leaves three issues to determine whether Olbermann is right that Reagan would have been denied GOP funding. One is: • "We support protecting the lives of vulnerable persons by opposing health care rationing and denial of health care and government funding of abortion." Six months into his governorship in 1967, Reagan signed the Therapeutic Abortion Act, which has been widely described as the most liberal abortion law in the nation before the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Roe vs. Wade . Among other things, it permitted California's government-run Medicaid program to pay for abortions. "Reagan later admitted that abortion had been 'a subject I’d never given much thought to,'" wrote Paul Kengor and Patricia Clark Doerner, co-authors of "The Judge: William P. Clark, Ronald Reagan’s Top Hand" in the National Review , a conservative magazine. "Moreover, his aides were divided on the question. ... Years later, Reagan remarked that he did 'more studying and soul searching' on the issue than any other as governor." Ultimately, Kengor and Doerner wrote, Reagan signed the bill, fearing that the Legislature would be able to override his veto and pass an even more sweeping measure. But that was far from the end of the story. Reagan biographer Lou Cannon told PolitiFact that "one of the reasons that Reagan became an opponent of abortion is that so many abortions were performed under the Therapeautic Abortion Act of 1967" -- more, even, than the bill's sponsors had envisioned. So, during the remainder of his political career, Reagan used his bully pulpit aggressively to oppose abortion. His presidential administration made some tangible antiabortion moves, such as instituting the "Mexico City policy," which denied foreign aid funding to groups that "perform or actively promote" abortion. The second is: • "We support the right to keep and bear arms by opposing government restrictions on gun ownership." As governor in 1967, Reagan signed the Mulford Act, which forbade the carrying of weapons in public. Later, in a 1991 speech, the former president spoke in favor of the Brady Bill -- a measure aggressively opposed by gun-rights groups that would establish a waiting period for gun purchases, so that law enforcement officials could conduct a background check on the purchaser. The law was named for Reagan's former press secretary, James Brady, who was seriously injured in John Hinckley's 1981 attempt on Reagan's life. (The bill was first introduced in Congress in 1987 and never made it to Reagan's desk during his presidency; Bill Clinton eventually signed it in 1993.) Despite these two actions, Reagan, as president, was generally a supporter of gun rights. Upon his death in 2004, the National Rifle Association eulogized him as a "hunter, rancher and outdoorsman," as a life member of the group, and as the first sitting president to address the NRA at an annual meeting. In addition, he signed the Firearm Owners Protection Act of 1986, which included some provisions that tightened rules on gun ownership but which also eased many existing rules on firearms. It is generally considered a victory for the NRA rather than for gun-control forces. On both guns and abortion, then, Reagan unquestionably broke with today's Republican orthodoxy on one or more occasions -- but he also did things that were fully consistent with that orthodoxy. Finally, we'll look at the item dealing with fiscal policy. It's a bit complicated because it contains four parts: • "We support smaller government, smaller national debt, lower deficits and lower taxes by opposing bills like Obama’s 'stimulus' bill" Reagan gets unalloyed credit for sticking to the Republican principle of lowering taxes. When he entered office, the top marginal income tax rate was 70 percent. By the time he left office, it was 28 percent. Measured another way , the effective individual income tax rates dropped for Americans in many tax brackets, not just the richest. Judging whether Reagan promoted "smaller government" is trickier. For starters, "smaller government" could be defined to include such intangible factors as decreased regulation rather than just federal outlays. But even looking at federal spending, the trendlines are somewhat contradictory. Overall federal outlays increased by 57 percent over eight years, or about 7 percent a year. However, much of that increase was driven by defense spending. Looking at nondefense discretionary spending, the rise was much more modest -- 16 percent over eight years, or about 2 percent a year. Because that was less than the average rate of inflation during his presidency, some economists would consider that a cut. That said, it's pretty clear that Reagan didn't stick to the other two elements of this item -- deficits and debt. The average annual deficit during Reagan's presidency was $167 billion, with shortfalls ranging from $79 billion to $221 billion. By contrast, his two immediate predecessors, Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford never ran a deficit larger than $74 billion, and the president before them, Richard Nixon, never produced a deficit bigger than $23 billion. (Nixon even recorded a modest surplus in 1969.) As for the national debt, it rose from about $953 billion when Reagan took office to roughly $2.7 trillion when he left -- a bit less than three times its initial size. So on this item, too, both sides can pick and choose their evidence to show that Reagan did, or didn't, adhere to Republican fiscal orthodoxy. It's possible to draw at least two conclusions based on Reagan's example. One is that Reagan -- perhaps unhappily for ideologues on both the right and the left -- did not have immutable principles throughout his entire political life. He was a politician -- one who had to respond to his constituents, as well as to the specific demands and constraints of his office, whether it was governor or president. The other conclusion to draw is that parties themselves do not necessarily have immutable principles. Reagan's biographer Cannon points out that at the time the California Legislature passed the abortion bill, "more Republicans supported it than Democrats. That's because the issue was then seen almost entirely in religious terms, and there were more Roman Catholics among the Democratic legislators than the Republicans. In 1967, most Republicans agreed with the mantra of keeping the government out of the bedroom and the boardroom. ... So Reagan went along with the prevailing doctrine of his party at the time." Similarly, when the Legislature passed the Mulford Act, it won the support not just of liberal gun-control advocates but also of conservatives, who saw it as a way to weaken the growing power of the radical Black Panther movement, according to Guns in American Society: An Encyclopedia of History, Politics, Culture, and the Law, Volume 1 . When Reagan signed both the gun bill and the abortion bill, then, one can easily argue that he was actually adhering to the conservatism of the time, even as he bucked the conservatism of today. This contrast underscores the challenges facing Olbermann and others who seek to discredit the RNC proposal. Indeed, the lead sponsor of the RNC resolution, James Bopp Jr., acknowledged as much after liberal attacks like Olbermann's began to emerge. According to the New York Times ' Caucus blog, Bopp "noted that the principles would change over time. ... Many of these were not issues in the 1980s, like cap and trade, card check, stimulus bill, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and Obamacare. So these were not measures that Reagan took a stand on, but I have no doubt that he would be right on each one. If we were proposing this resolution in 1981 for the 1982 election cycle, we would list, strategic missile defense, Reagan’s tax cuts, etc. He was right on those issues." But our mission here is not to critique the usefulness of Bopp's 10-point checklist; it's to judge whether Olbermann is right to say that Reagan would have fallen short on three or more items. On one item (amnesty for illegal immigrants) Reagan definitely broke with today's conservative orthodoxy. But on three others (abortion, gun control and fiscal policy) evidence exists in either direction. So, deciding whether Reagan qualifies under the rules of the resolution ends up being a tough call with evidence for both sides. We rate Olbermann's assertion Half True.

pomt-15048	"There’s no money" for Planned Parenthood in the bill that would keep the government open.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/29/tom-cole/there-planned-parenthood-funding-bill-stops-govern/	Congress needs to pass a spending bill by Sept. 30, 2015, or there’ll be a government shutdown. Some members of Congress want to leverage this deadline to defund Planned Parenthood. But the bill Congress will likely pass -- a short-term spending bill that funds the government through Dec. 11 -- doesn’t include funding for Planned Parenthood to begin with, said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla., on Fox News Sunday Sept. 27. So Congress shouldn’t shut down the government over funding the women’s health organization. "Well, first of all, look, on Planned Parenthood -- there's no money in the short-term (spending bill) for Planned Parenthood," Cole said. "Ninety percent of their money comes from Medicaid, not from anything we're going to do. And the remainder is awarded on what are called grants. They're all done in about April. There's none left to do this year, literally none. So, the idea that we're fighting over money for Planned Parenthood is -- it's a canard. It's just not true." Is it true that this spending bill -- which could shut down the government if it’s not passed -- doesn’t include any money for Planned Parenthood? We decided to find out. Federal budget and Planned Parenthood funding To understand what Cole’s talking about, we need to consider a key distinction in the federal budget. For the most part, federal spending is either mandatory or discretionary. The mandatory category includes what are commonly referred to as entitlement programs, such as Medicaid, Medicare and Social Security. Annual spending for these programs is based on the number of people eligible for the program. Mandatory spending effectively runs on autopilot unless Congress changes this formula. Discretionary spending goes toward pretty much everything else. Congress determines the amount of discretionary spending -- program by program -- through the annual appropriations process. When we talk about getting a budget or else the government will shut down, we’re talking about discretionary spending, because that’s what funds most agencies and government salaries. Keep that distinction in mind as we break down where Planned Parenthood’s federal funding comes from. Planned Parenthood receives about $450 million each year in federal funds. Government funding (including state funding, too) accounts for about 41 percent of Planned Parenthood’s yearly revenue, according to the group’s annual report. Of the $450 million in annual federal funds, about $390 million comes from Medicaid. Less than $1 million comes from other entitlement programs: Medicare and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. Medicaid provides subsidized health care for poor Americans, and Planned Parenthood provides a significant number of poor women with reproductive health care. So nearly 90 percent of Planned Parenthood’s federal funding comes from entitlement programs, a.k.a. mandatory spending. Meaning it’s not part of the appropriations process. The remaining 10 percent does come from discretionary spending, meaning it’s normally up for debate in the appropriations process. The $60 million comes from grants under the National Family Planning Program -- known commonly as Title X because it operates under Title X of the Public Health Service Act. However, this remainder is also not at issue at the moment. Right now, Congress is trying to pass a short-term bill that would fund the government through Dec. 11, while it comes up with a more comprehensive budget bill. Next year’s Title X grants will not be awarded until late spring, and all of this year’s grants have already been given out. So Title X grants are not included in this short-term funding bill. But just because this bill doesn’t include appropriations for Planned Parenthood doesn’t mean that members of Congress can’t use it as a vehicle for defunding the organization in future legislation. Bill language Those who want to defund Planned Parenthood by leveraging funding for the rest of the government have advocated for including language in the short-term spending bill that zeros out all funding -- even if the funding isn’t accounted for in that particular bill. The language likely would look something like the proposed Defund Planned Parenthood Act: "Passage of the bill that would bar, for one year, federal funding for Planned Parenthood and its affiliates unless they certify that, during that period, they will not perform abortions or provide funds to other entities that perform abortions. The prohibition would apply to all federal funds, including Medicaid." If that language were to become law, the effect would be immediate, said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute. However, Congress normally doesn’t change mandatory spending through the appropriations process because "it doesn’t make political sense," he said. Reforming entitlement programs is an uphill battle, and attaching it to an appropriations bill doesn’t change that. "It basically dooms the bill and guarantees a shutdown because those programs are so politically contentious," he said. Additionally, the Appropriations Committee would be stepping on other committees’ toes, Huder added. Legislating on appropriations bills is technically against the rules, though the House can waive that rule. In any case, it appears that a "clean" short-term spending bill (which doesn’t zero out Planned Parenthood funding) will pass Sept. 29 or 30, pushing this fight off to December. Our ruling Cole said, "There’s no money" for Planned Parenthood in the bill that would keep the government open. Congress could include language in the bill that would kill Planned Parenthood funding accounted for in other legislation. This would be an unusual move by Congress and would launch a major political fight. But Cole is correct that the short-term funding bill that Congress is slated to pass does not itself fund Planned Parenthood -- largely because this bill addresses discretionary spending, while the vast majority of Planned Parenthood’s federal funding comes from mandatory spending through the Medicaid program. We rate Cole’s claim True.	None	Tom Cole	None	None	None	2015-09-29T15:54:02	2015-09-27	['None']

The Democratic candidate for governor uses the line in TV ads, in interviews and her stump speech, all aimed at countering Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s message that "Wisconsin is back on" after the Great Recession. Burke’s allies repeat the claim. One example, from a Burke campaign television spot that first aired in July 2014: "It’s Walker’s agency that gave millions in tax breaks to companies that relocated jobs overseas. Another reason Wisconsin’s dead last in Midwest job growth." As this is spoken, the TV spot rolls through a list of nine states before settling on Wisconsin at the bottom: North Dakota, Michigan, Indiana, Minnesota, Nebraska, Ohio, South Dakota, Iowa and Illinois. With a new Walker TV ad bragging that we’re third in the Midwest in job growth, we thought it was time to look at both claims. In both cases, and like so many claims in a campaign that any numbers nerd would love, evaluation depends on two things: the timeframe and the measuring stick. In the Burke ad, the narrator in the spot doesn’t say what time frame was analyzed. But the fine print in the ad cites data collected for the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. And the footnote says the ad compares quarter four of 2010 -- the last before Walker took office -- to quarter four of 2013. That is still the latest available quarterly data. That data, reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, is considered the most exhaustive and credible for employment trends. It is based on a census of 96 percent of all American non-farm employers. Our examination of the data for the three-year period cited by Burke shows Wisconsin 10th out of the 10 states -- "dead last" -- just below Illinois when it comes to growth in private-sector jobs. "The low growth in jobs in Wisconsin has been matched by very low income growth and poor levels of consumer spending," University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee labor economist John Heywood told us. "The state has been slower than its peers in recovering from the recession." Nationally, Wisconsin ranked 35th. Here’s the regional picture: State and midwest ranking on percentage growth in jobs Dec. 2010-Dec. 2013 Percentage change in employment National rank on percentage change 1. North Dakota 21.90% 1st 2. Michigan 8.71% 6th 3. Indiana 6.88% 15th 4. Minnesota 6.29% 20th 5. Nebraska 5.71% 24th 6. Ohio 5.65% 25th 7. South Dakota 5.28% 27th 8. Iowa 5.20% 28th 9. Illinois 4.21% 33th 10. Wisconsin 4.04% 35th Burke ranks the states by the percentage of growth. That is preferred by economists for state-by-state comparisons because it shows performance regardless of the state’s population. By another measure -- raw number of jobs created -- Wisconsin ranked sixth-best of the 10 states, we found. Limitations to the data There are two statistical points to consider. The most important is the definition of "Midwest." Both Burke and Walker use the 10 states we mentioned. There’s a good case to be made for that: The Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Midwest regional office covers those 10 states. We found other instances in which the agency adds Missouri and Kansas into the Midwestern mix, for a total of 12 states. In that larger group, Wisconsin finishes 11th of 12, ahead of Missouri. Previously we rated Half True a Burke claim in January 2014 that Wisconsin was last in the Midwest. The numbers worked out, but we faulted Burke mainly for a too-narrow comparison. She said Midwest, but looked only at the four states adjoining Wisconsin. We noted that at that time, before the 2013 numbers were complete, that Ohio and Nebraska (from the group of 10) and Missouri (from the more expansive BLS group of 12) had slower growth rates than Wisconsin. Finally, because it’s so comprehensive, reporting of the quarterly jobs data lags by at least six months, meaning the picture may be a bit outdated by the time it is released. The next quarterly jobs figures, covering the first quarter of 2014, are set for mid-September release. There is more recent jobs data available, from the monthly Current Employment Statistics surveys, but it’s based on a sample of only about 3 percent of employers. Those figures are prone to large margins of error but are also a widely cited source on job trends. Walker has called the quarterly data the "gold standard," and has criticized the monthly data. But he has cited the monthly data, and does so in his new ad. Burke has used both at various times as well. Indeed, she was using the less-reliable monthly data back when we rated her earlier worst-in-Midwest claim Half True. Our rating Mary Burke contends that "Wisconsin’s dead last in Midwest job growth." In the new version of this claim, she uses the most accurate jobs data for the longest Walker-era period that can be analyzed with it. And Wisconsin does bring up the rear. But due to the lag time, it does not reflect the most current trends. We rate the claim True. ...... Deciphering jobs claims Voters will hear many more jobs claims before the Nov. 4 election. Here are five tips for separating fact from fiction -- and hype from hard evidence -- when it comes to candidates and the numbers they use. Check the timeframe: If the statement covers a short period, it can be a red flag for cherry-picking data to find a good result. A longer time frame may be being used to mask more recent changes. Check the data source: The quarterly jobs numbers are more accurate than the monthly figures, but also more out of date. Be more skeptical of recent announcement about the monthly numbers, because they are subject to revisions can be significant. Raw numbers or percentages?: If the claim is that State X added more jobs than State Y, the statement may have limited information value. Look for percentage growth figures that level the playing field among states of varying sizes. Check the map: When the claim is "best in the region," trust but verify. Are all relevant states included? Scrutinize the sector: Most claims focus on just the private sector, but sometimes partisans will add in public employees if it suits their purpose.

pomt-04940	Says U.S. is giving seven Alaskan islands to Russia.	false	/texas/statements/2012/jul/27/wes-riddle/wes-riddle-says-us-giving-seven-alaskan-islands-ru/	Liberal magazine Mother Jones ran a news analysis July 24, 2012, picked up by HuffingtonPost.com, that linked a Texas congressional candidate’s claim to one that was earlier found false by a fact-checking outfit. The article says Wes Riddle, who faces Roger Williams in a July 31 runoff for the Republican nomination in the state's 25th Congressional District, posted on Facebook in May 2012 that "the State Department is giving away seven strategic, resource-laden Alaskan islands to Russia." The story says his post resembled a question FactCheck.org had tackled two months earlier. Riddle’s Facebook page did not have that post when we peeked, but we found Google’s cached version. The May 16 post said that once elected, Riddle vows to start impeachment proceedings against President Barack Obama and that the reasoning behind such action begins with the Alaskan island giveaway, as quoted by Mother Jones. Six weeks earlier, in a March 27, 2012 item, FactCheck had addressed an "e-rumor" containing a similar statement. "It is simply false to claim that Obama is ‘giving away’ islands to which no U.S. president has asserted a claim for more than 85 years, if ever," wrote FactCheck, which is a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania. The text version of the rumor that FactCheck examined gives several specifics that also appear in Riddle’s post. Among them: The seven islands and their many miles of "rich oil seabeds" were "given away," the text says, in secret negotiations from which Alaska was excluded. But Obama or Secretary of State Hillary Clinton could stop the process with a pen stroke, it says. FactCheck’s findings: Although after a U.S. Navy survey in 1881, the U.S. Geological Survey listed five of the islands as being in the "District of Alaska," the United States has never claimed them or disputed the Soviet or Russian claim to them. "All lie on the Russian side of the U.S.-Russia maritime boundary set by a treaty that the U.S. Senate ratified overwhelmingly more than two decades ago, after being signed by President George H.W. Bush, and with the support of both of Alaska’s senators," FactCheck wrote, going on to explain that the treaty was made with the Soviet Union before its 1991 collapse and never ratified by Russia, but that Russia informed the U.S. it intended to abide by the terms. Though this is an old issue, FactCheck said, it resurfaced in a Feb. 26, 2012, opinion piece by Joe Miller, a former Alaskan candidate for U.S. Senate. Miller’s piece on the conservative site World Net Daily is similar in wording and content to the "viral" text FactCheck examined and to Riddle’s item. Like Riddle’s claim that the U.S. "is giving away" the islands, many versions of the rumor that we found online state or imply that Obama’s administration has an active role. White House spokesman Brandon Lepow told us by email that current U.S. policy in the Arctic is described in a 2009 State Department fact sheet, which says the U.S. and Russia are not discussing boundary changes. Lepow said there has been no change to the policy. The 1990 treaty sets the modern maritime boundary at the line drawn when the U.S. bought Alaska from Russia -- or more specifically, the "Emperor of all the Russias" -- in 1867. By telephone, Riddle told us that he stands by his statement, but said, "I wouldn’t be surprised if we didn’t get some bad information that we ran with. That’s possible. It’s a cautionary note for anybody." Riddle said he did not know of the FactCheck.org item until we called him. "It’s hard these days to judge the veracity of information," he said. "Obviously, it’s important to do so, and before anyone develops specific policy, not only to develop positions but to check everything." He also pointed out that, as FactCheck noted, Russia has not ratified the 1990 treaty, and says he would favor renegotiating it. Our ruling Though Riddle took the item off his Facebook page, he stands by it, so we’ll ratify our colleagues’ findings and rate his statement False.

pomt-05450	"I have always said that I would be for drilling."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2012/apr/25/connie-mack/connie-mack-says-i-have-always-said-i-would-be-dri/	U.S. Rep. Connie Mack, running in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate, held an event at a Miami gas station to urge the public to sign his petition calling for the Keystone XL Pipeline. "I have always said that I would be for drilling," Mack said on April 5, 2012, according to the Miami Herald’s Naked Politics blog. "But I think that’s an issue the state should have a say in – in determining how far it’s going to be off the coast of Florida. We ought to allow the state to have a say in that decision." The report pointed out several past quotes from Mack bashing proposals for drilling close to Florida. We decided to put the issue to our Truth-O-Meter: Was Mack mischaracterizing his own past statements when he said he "always" was for drilling? When he wasn't for drilling As we investigated, we found that when then-state Rep. Mack ran for Congress in 2004, he pledged to maintain the ban on drilling off Florida’s coast. And if there was a high point to him sticking to that pledge, it was 2005. That year, Mack issued multiple statements criticizing a proposal to allow drilling closer to Florida, saying that it would hurt Florida’s "pristine" or "fragile" coastline and describing it as "risky" and "reckless." In a statement on Sept. 28, 2005, Mack called himself a "longtime opponent of drilling off Florida’s coast." Yes, Congress needed to take action to lower gas prices, he said. "But allowing drilling off Florida’s pristine coastline won’t reduce America’s pain at the pump. Instead of taking steps that will expose Florida’s fragile environment and our economy to severe and irreparable harm, we would be better served by expanding America’s refining capabilities, investing in new energy technologies, furthering commercial and consumer adoption of more energy efficient products, and increasing conservation." We found similar statements from Mack in 2005 on Sept. 29, Oct. 3, Oct. 24, Oct. 26, Nov. 3 and Nov. 10. Cracks in the opposition Mack continued his opposition in 2006, saying in May, "I applaud my colleagues for saying (no to) reckless plans that could have allowed drilling as close as three miles off Florida’s shores." But 2006 was the year that the Florida delegation started to split on drilling. Before then, the delegation had nearly unanimous bipartisan opposition to drilling, said Mark Ferrulo, executive director of Progress Florida, who has tracked drilling legislation since the 1990s. (The exception: U.S. Rep. John Mica, R-Winter Park. "His brother is a lobbyist for the oil industry, and (he) doesn’t have a coastline that was threatened," Ferrulo said.) In June 2006, a vote was held on the the Deep Oceans Energy Resources Act, to create a smaller, 50-mile buffer on Florida’s coast. Fourteen of Florida’s 25-member House delegation voted in favor of the smaller zone, but Mack voted against it. He said in a press release that he voted against it because an amendment wasn’t included in the bill that would have given Florida control over drilling decisions. In December, the House overwhelmingly voted for a bill that was considered a compromise: It opened up 8.3 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico to drilling while protecting Florida’s 125-mile buffer. Mack explained his support: "I’m pleased the House has adopted important legislation that will codify new and stronger protections against offshore drilling for Florida’s Gulf Coast. Without enacting these protections, Florida faced a precarious future on the question of drilling off our fragile shore. "While I would have preferred a solution that empowered states like Florida to determine their own destiny on this important issue, today’s legislation provides a sound solution that will protect our precious environment and our economy." A switch in position Flash forward to the summer of 2008. Consumers were angry about $4-a-gallon gas, and the phrase "drill, baby, drill" was a Republican mantra. Presidential candidate John McCain called for lifting the federal moratorium along the Outer Continental Shelf and giving states incentives to lift the ban. Some Republicans, including then-Gov. Charlie Crist, who was a contender to be McCain’s vice president, and U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez, R-Fla., ditched their previous opposition. And so did Mack. Mack told Fox News on June 16 that the United States needed to expand domestic production, including drilling off the coast of Florida. He explained his change of mind in a June 17 press release: "For years I have said states should have the right to decide whether or not they want to allow drilling off their shores. But circumstances have changed, I have changed, and I believe the people of Florida have changed. We’re facing a serious energy emergency, and we need to take real steps to bolster our energy independence and security. The people of Florida deserve the right to decide whether to drill off our coast." The political winds had shifted. "Prior to now, this was not an issue that elected officials really wanted to engage in," said Justin Sayfie, a former spokesman for former Gov. Jeb Bush, at the time. "I just think it speaks volumes about the pain at the pump that motorists are feeling." Then came the Deepwater Horizon explosion and spill in 2010. Mack took a cautious approach, saying before a decision is made on banning offshore drilling, the country must understand what went wrong. But generally, he still supported offshore drilling, saying in a speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference that domestic drilling needed to continue "across the United States and in our waters." Mack campaign spokesman David James sent us a statement acknowledging that Mack’s views have "evolved" on drilling. "Connie has been a steadfast proponent of a strong national security and has always supported increasing our domestic energy supply by drilling in ANWR (the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge), and he has been a champion of building the Keystone XL Pipeline," James said. "At the same time there's no dispute that Connie has always wanted to make certain that we protect Florida's shores. That hasn't changed. But four years ago, in the summer of 2008, Connie announced that his position with respect to drilling off Florida's coast evolved as our national energy security needs changed too. That's been well documented. And those needs have only grown all the more important." We are focusing our evaluation of Mack on drilling near Florida -- not Alaska -- since he is a congressman running for Senate in Florida. But we will briefly note his position on ANWR. For the years that drilling in ANWR appears on the scorecards of the League of Conservation Voters, it shows that Mack consistently voted as the League calls it "anti-environment" -- including in 2005 and 2006 and 2011. Mack was absent for that vote in 2008, but in an article that year he denounced a plan to impose restrictions on drilling in ANWR. In 2012, Florida’s congressional delegation remains split on more drilling off the coast of Florida. "We have never gotten back to a unified front of opposition against expanding drilling," Ferrulo said. Our ruling Mack said, "I have always said that I would be for drilling. But I think that’s an issue the state should have a say in – in determining how far it’s going to be off the coast of Florida. We ought to allow the state to have a say in that decision." But Mack didn’t always say he was in favor of drilling. In 2005, he repeatedly said he was against allowing drilling closer to Florida’s shores. He has since changed his stance, as did many other Republicans in 2008 amid high gas prices and a presidential campaign. "Always" means at all times -- not sometimes, or the past few years, or in Alaska. At one time, Mack very much opposed drilling off Florida's coast. His comment that he's "always" been for drilling misrepresents his actual record on a very high-profile issue in the state of Florida. We rate his statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-07035	Gov. Chris Christie owes the state money "for amenities like extra Gorgonzola cheese for his staff on these trips."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/03/new-jersey-democratic-state-committee/new-jersey-democrats-say-gov-chris-christie-owes-s/	If New Jersey voters thought Gov. Chris Christie’s helicopter rides to his son’s baseball games were inappropriate, Democrats have another example of personal spending on the public dime -- Gorgonzola cheese. Two days after Christie took a helicopter for the second time to one of his son’s baseball games, the New Jersey Democratic State Committee issued a press release calling on the Republican governor to disclose information about previous taxpayer-funded travel for Christie and his staff. "Previous public records requests have yielded a significant number of blacked out pages with redactions," according to the June 2 press release. "However, these documents do show that the Governor continues to owe thousands of dollars to the state for his travel, as well as for amenities like extra Gorgonzola cheese for his staff on these trips." The press release concluded with a link to dozens of documents provided to the Democrats by the governor’s office, showing travel expenses between February and October 2010. PolitiFact New Jersey started scanning those documents for the suspect cheese and found copies of receipts for it. For two trips in July 2010, Daniel Robles, an aide to the governor, sought reimbursements for a total of two roast beef sandwiches with Gorgonzola cheese. What did each topping of Gorgonzola cheese cost New Jersey taxpayers? Ninety-nine cents. Jason Springer, communications director for the New Jersey Democratic State Committee and the author of the press release, acknowledged that Democrats erred in claiming Christie should reimburse the state for Gorgonzola cheese. That reference was meant to illustrate the type of information being disclosed, compared to the redactions, he said. "I’m apologizing as well. It was my responsibility for the inaccuracy," Springer told us. State regulations show that Robles could be reimbursed for the roast beef sandwiches. For the two days when Robles bought the sandwiches, he sought reimbursements for $28.54 and $7.57 in meal expenses, respectively. Robles could have sought reimbursement for up to $71 per day for meals and incidental expenses on those trips, according to data on the U.S. General Services Administration’s website. Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said staff members traveling with the governor are subject to the same per-diem limits as other state employees, and expenses are scrutinized. "Are you under the impression that staff traveling with the governor can go to swank restaurants and charge drinks and fine dining to the state?" Drewniak wrote in an email. "They cannot and they do not." Now, let’s take a quick look at the Democrats’ overall claim that Christie "continues to owe thousands of dollars to the state for his travel." According to Springer, that claim is based on research done by Courier Post columnist Jeremy Rosen. In an April 28 column, Rosen wrote that public records show Christie's administration still owed the state about $2,488 for personal expenses on trips last fall. But here’s the problem: the Democrats’ press release didn’t mention Rosen, leaving readers with the impression that the Democrats’ own public records show Christie owes money. Springer said those records were provided in the press release to illustrate the redactions made by the governor’s office. In a Nov. 23 letter to the Democratic State Committee -- included in the documents linked to in the press release -- Raymond Brandes, assistant counsel to the governor, wrote, "certain records have been withheld or redacted on the basis of the executive privilege and the security risk exception to (the Open Public Records Act)." Most of the expenses outlined in the documents included in the Democrats’ press release show business-related items. According to those documents, the governor and first lady submitted two checks to the state totaling about $1,800. About $125 still had to be repaid to the state, according to those documents. Let’s review: The New Jersey Democratic State Committee said in a press release that Christie owed the state money for "extra Gorgonzola cheese for his staff on these trips." A Democratic spokesman told us that statement was inaccurate, and state regulations support reimbursement for those meals. The Democrats’ claim that Christie owes money is based on a newspaper column, but that’s not cited in the press release. The Democrats’ own records prove that information has been withheld by the governor’s office, but don’t show that Christie owes much money. PolitiFact New Jersey enjoys a roast beef sandwich just as much as the next person, but to claim that the governor should fork over dough for Gorgonzola cheese is just wrong.

pomt-09752	During the Reagan era, while productivity increased, "wages for working people remained frozen."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/07/michael-moore/michael-moore-claims-capitalism-during-reagan-year/	In his new film, Capitalism: A Love Story , Michael Moore contends the economic policies of President Ronald Reagan were the turning point toward widening the gap between the rich and everyone else. Once Reagan was elected, Moore said, the government was run like a business, and the president's tough stance on unions and his theory of "trickle-down" economics ended up hurting working Americans. In this item, we will look at Moore's claim in the movie that as productivity rose during the Reagan years, "wages for working people remained frozen." We'll get right to the numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. People generally look at "output per hour" for workers in the nonfarm business sector to track these kinds of trends. Essentially, it's the amount of value of product produced per hour of work by an employee. Generally, productivity has steadily increased for as long as those kind of statistics have been kept as people and businesses learn to work more efficiently. But by the late 1970s, productivity had begun to slow. During Reagan's time in office (1981 to 1989), however, the numbers grew from 81.7 to 92.8. So it's certainly fair to say productivity increased during the Reagan administration. Now on to wages. There are several ways to look at this. First is the hourly wages paid in current dollars (what workers were actually paid). By that count, average hourly wages increased from $7.44 to $9.80. But these were high inflation years, and so when you look at the hourly wages adjusted for inflation ("real hourly compensation"), wages remained fairly flat. In fact, based on 1982 dollars, real wages dipped slightly from $7.89 in 1981 to $7.75 in 1989. End of story? Not quite. We think a few qualifiers are in order. For one, wages aren't the only way workers are compensated. There's also health benefits and other compensation. When you look at the "real compensation per hour" paid by companies to nonsupervisory employees, the cost went from 90.2 in 1981 to 95.1 in 1989. So compensation to employees, even when adjusted for inflation, grew during the Reagan era. We also think it's worth noting that stagnation of average hourly earnings, adjusted for inflation, predated Reagan. Historical tables show that hourly wages climbed steadily through the 1960s and into 1970s, and then peaked in 1973. From that point on, "real" hourly wages declined for a few years and then pretty much froze until the late 1990s. But it wasn't until Reagan's presidency that productivity began to quickly outpace wages. Why? Economists have a host of theories. For one, new technology certainly allowed workers to build widgets much better and faster, said Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the Cato Institute. But the reasons for the widening gap between productivity and wages are more complex and varied. Globalization of the economy, eroding of unions, regressive taxes, the declining value of minimum wage, a rise in the number of immigrants and deregulation of industry all contributed, said Heidi Shierholz of the Economic Policy Institute. Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research believes the weakening of unions played a huge role. "I think the bargaining power of workers took a big hit during the Reagan years," Baker said. The most notable example was when the Reagan administration broke the air traffic controllers union. "That changed labor-management relations," Baker said. Moore cited an article by Baker called "The Productivity to Paycheck Gap: What the Data Show" on a part of his film Web site that provides backup for a number of claims in the film. And Baker said a fact-checker employed by Moore called him before the release of the movie to make sure he got it right. "I think his (Moore's) comment was pretty much on the mark," Baker said. One other caveat to Moore's comment. He's talking here about wages for nonsupervisory production workers, which comprise about 80 percent of the work force. But not all. And that's why it's also true, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, that the mean average of real income rose by 15.2 percent from 1980 to 1989, from $33,409 to $38,493, in 1990 dollars. So it all depends on how you define "working people." Still, adjusted for inflation, and when looking at nonsupervisory production workers, it's true that during the Reagan years, productivity rose while wages remained frozen (or even dipped slightly). We dock Moore some points, though, because the decline/stagnation of wages pre- and postdated the Reagan era; and total compensation (including payments for benefits) rose. Moore left out some important qualifiers. Still, while you may not agree with Moore's conclusions, he can back up his claim with legitimate numbers. And so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-00445	Says Kelli Ward "called for restraint in fighting terrorism."	mostly false	/arizona/statements/2018/aug/21/defend-arizona/did-kelli-ward-call-restraint-fighting-terrorism/	A political ad in Arizona portrays Republican U.S. Senate candidate Kelli Ward as soft in the fight against terrorism. "ISIS killed thousands. Plotted attacks on U.S. soil. They're a real threat. But Kelli Ward called for restraint in fighting terrorism. Restraint against those who want to kill our citizens?" said the narrator in an Aug. 11 ad launched by Defend Arizona, a political action committee that supports conservatives and "leaders who have fought for our country — not just career politicians." Ward is a former Arizona state senator competing for the U.S. Senate seat opening up as Republican Sen. Jeff Flake retires at the end of his term in January 2019. Other Republicans in the race include former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and Rep. Martha McSally, who served in the U.S. Air Force. Defend Arizona supports McSally. The primary election is Aug. 28. We found that Defend Arizona’s ad cherry-picked comments Ward made in a 2016 radio interview discussing terrorism. Ward said that the traditional conservative foreign policy of restraint and realism needed to be "brought back into the process," but also said the U.S. should be willing to "decimate," not just curb or control the terrorist group ISIS. Defend Arizona’s ad leaves out key information Defend Arizona’s ad opens with the image of a man wearing a black mask and raising a knife as the narrator says, "ISIS killed thousands." "Plotted attacks on U.S. soil. They're a real threat," the ad continues, including a photo of the perpetrator of the 2016 Orlando nightclub shooting, who claimed to be a soldier of the terrorist group ISIS. "But Kelli Ward called for restraint in fighting terrorism," the narrator said, over an image and video of Ward along with text that read, "Kelli Ward on fighting ISIS ‘...restraint and realism.’ That scene cites as its source the Seth Leibsohn Show, June 28, 2016. Ward in 2016 ran an unsuccessful bid for U.S. Senate against Sen. John McCain. McCain won the Republican primary and went on to be re-elected in the general election. In a June 2016 radio interview, host Leibsohn said that while the economy is often the factor driving an election, in 2016, national security was the focus. Leibsohn asked Ward how to combat global terrorism and, "What would you say should be our policy towards ISIS?" Ward: "It’s a huge, huge problem. I think that No. 1, we do have to have a president in the oval office, a commander in chief who has a strategy to win. "We can’t continue with this strategy of go in and do nation building, try to spread democracy, and unfortunately we had that policy under George W. Bush as well. It isn’t what traditional conservative foreign policy has been, which is restraint and realism. Those things need to be brought back into the process in the foreign policy arena. I think that we also, we have to be willing to decimate ISIS – not control them, not to curb their activities." Leibsohn: "Not live with them, right?" Ward: "Not live with them, not to empower them, certainly not to empower them, and I think it is going to take that strong commander-in-chief and then conservative reinforcements in both the House and Senate to make it happen." Ward referenced "restraint and realism" as needed for overall foreign policy, but she spoke differently of combating terrorism. Defend Arizona did not respond to PolitiFact’s query by deadline. It’s not the first time Ward’s "restraint" comment is used against her. A pro-McCain ad in July 2016 also highlighted her "restraint and realism" response, with the narrator adding, "When Americans are under attack, restraint won’t destroy ISIS." Ward’s 2016 campaign spokesman Stephen Sebastian told the Arizona Republic in 2016 that Ward "believes in Reagan’s 'Peace Through Strength' as well as 'realism and restraint’." "As a military wife whose husband has served in Iraq, Dr. Ward said she will support military engagement 'only as a last resort when national security is clearly at stake, only when Constitutionally approved by Congress, and only when there is a real strategy for victory, not expensive occupations and endless nation-building," Sebastian then told the newspaper. Our ruling A Defend Arizona ad said Ward, "called for restraint in fighting terrorism."

pomt-09379	"Since that famous day in February where the governor campaigned with Barack Obama on behalf of the stimulus program, 211,000 Floridians have lost their jobs."	true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/28/marco-rubio/rubio-says-florida-has-lost-211000-jobs-crist-camp/	You knew it wouldn't take long for "the hug" to get some love during Sunday's debate between Republicans Marco Rubio and Charlie Crist. Minutes into the 40-minute "Florida Senate Showdown," Rubio made a case that he'll stand up to President Barack Obama's agenda and Crist won't. "Everyone knows that you won't stand up to the Obama agenda because just a year ago you were campaigning for it," the former House speaker said, referring to Feb. 10, 2009, when Crist embraced the president at a Fort Myers campaign event for the federal stimulus package. We've fact-checked several claims about Crist's support for the stimulus. Indeed, he earned a Pants on Fire rating for saying he didn't endorse it. So it was a Rubio comment later in the program that drew our attention. FOX News Sunday host Chris Wallace asked Rubio, "Why is $8 billion and 87,000 jobs bad for a state that has 12 percent unemployment?" "Well ... if it's bad for America, it can't possibly be good for your state," Rubio said. "Let me tell you why the stimulus has failed. The stimulus has failed because since that famous day in February where the governor campaigned with Barack Obama on behalf of the stimulus program, 211,000 Floridians have lost their jobs." 211,000 is a big number, so we wanted to check Rubio's facts. Conveniently, the state's Agency for Workforce Innovation released a report on state employment figures just two days before the debate. In it, Florida's record 12.2 percent unemployment rate is announced, along with many statistics on the state's jobs picture, including year-over-year numbers from February 2009, the month Crist campaigned with Obama. The report shows Florida had 8,356,000 jobs in February 2009 and 8,125,000 in February 2010, the difference being 231,000. These are the seasonally adjusted numbers for the civilian population. However, if you look at seasonally adjusted nonagricultural employment --- a less-inclusive number --- you see the basis for Rubio's claim. There the job loss in a year's time is 211,500. It's the latter number that the Rubio campaign points to. Spokesman Alberto Martinez also shared a report from House Way and Means Republicans that seeks to highlight the stimulus as a job-killer, rather than a job creator, where Florida is said to have lost 240,400 jobs since the stimulus passed. Like any statistics, these are easily sliced and diced to make the key point. But Rubio is very close to the precise number, and in fact, he underestimates it slightly when his point is that Florida has lost a lot of jobs. So we rule this one True.

pomt-11116	"The bulk of the problem with the opioid epidemic is the fentanyl and all the synthetic drugs coming across the southern border."	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/jun/07/ron-desantis/ron-desantis-overplays-link-between-opioid-crisis-/	Republican candidate for Florida governor Ron DeSantis has a plan to solve the opioid epidemic, and it starts with securing the southern border of the United States. That’s where lethal drugs pour into the country, he said during the Westside Republican Club Reagan Day Barbecue in Callahan, Fla., on June 2. "This drug crisis is driven by a lot of the drugs that are pouring across the southern border," DeSantis said. "Yeah, there are problems with prescription medication and things like that, and Florida's done some stuff to rein that in. The bulk of the problem with the opioid epidemic is the fentanyl and all the synthetic drugs coming across the southern border. When you have a weak border like under (former President Barack) Obama — that's a wet kiss to the drug cartels. They love that, because they can move so much product into our country." Here, we’ll fact-check his link between synthetic drugs smuggled across the U.S.-Mexico border and the American opioid crisis. What did a "weak border" have to do with it? DeSantis has a point about the rise of synthetic opioids. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids surged from 2013 to 2016. Among the more than 64,000 drug overdose deaths estimated in 2016, the sharpest increase occurred among deaths related to fentanyl and synthetic opioids with almost 20,000 overdose deaths. The problem with DeSantis’ claim is linking the supply of fentanyl and synthetic drugs from the southern border to the opioid epidemic killing tens of thousands of Americans each year. These drugs can and do enter from across the southern border, but these drugs also tend to come in through other points of entry. Prescription vs. synthetic opioids The National Institute on Drug Abuse describes opioids as a class of drugs that includes heroin, fentanyl and prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone (including OxyContin), hydrocodone (including Vicodin), codeine, morphine and many others. Fentanyl, which DeSantis mentioned, is a powerful pain reliever that is similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent. Fentanyl can be prescribed to treat advanced cancer pain, but can be made and sold on the illegal drug market, often mixed with or sold as heroin. Other synthetic opioids include tramadol and fentanyl analogs, which are drugs designed to mimic the pharmacological effects of the original drug. More than 42,000 people died as a result of opioid-related overdoses in 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 16,800 deaths involved a prescription opioid, and more than 19,000 were related to synthetic opioids (the latter category is what DeSantis is talking about). While synthetic drugs accounted for more deaths than prescription opioids, there’s no way to know how exactly how many of those drugs crossed the southern border before they were taken. A southern border link? International gangs based in Mexico "remain the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States," and their most common method of smuggling drugs is vehicles legally coming into the U.S., according to a 2017 Drug Enforcement Administration report. But that’s for all drugs, not just synthetic drugs like DeSantis said. They type of drugs that DeSantis singled out tend to enter the country through other points of entry — including, but not limited to, the southern border. According to a 2017 DEA report, China is a main supplier of fentanyl and fentanyl-related compounds. Some of the fentanyl comes straight to the United States from China through the mail. Other shipments come in from China to Mexico or China to Canada before making its way into the United States. In addition, fentanyl and fentanyl-related compounds are also sold and distributed through illicit drug markets on the dark web, the report said. Between 2013 and 2017, Border Patrol seized 286 pounds of fentanyl, 3218 pounds of heroin, and 23 pounds of morphine, according to the Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee from May 2018. We don’t have an exact breakdown of how much fentanyl reaches final users through Chinese labs and how much comes from across the border. That’s because China-sourced fentanyl concealed in mail parcels can be difficult for law enforcement officials to trace back to the original sender. Traffickers forward the package multiple times to different people, according to the DEA report. President Donald Trump’s opioid commission seemed more concerned with shipments from China than couriers from Mexico. "We are miserably losing this fight to prevent fentanyl from entering our country and killing our citizens," the commission reported. "We are losing this fight (predominantly) through China." Trump’s opioid commission says many users order the pill form of fentanyl online and have it shipped discreetly. The commission’s report references a Carnegie Mellon University study that found revenues from online illicit drug sales increased from between $15 million and 17 million in 2012 to $150 million and $180 million in 2015. The fentanyl found at the southern border tends to be less potent than the fentanyl shipped through the mail. "Large volumes of fentanyl are seized at the (southern border), although these seizures are typically low in purity — on average approximately 7 percent," the 2017 DEA report says. "Conversely, the smaller volumes seized after arriving in the mail directly from China can have purities over 90 percent and be worth much more than the fentanyl seized at the (southwest border)." To emphasize this point, DeSantis' spokesperson Brad Herold pointed to previous PolitiFact-checks that show that heroin is mainly smuggled through Mexico. That is accurate, though heroin is not a synthetic drug. "As most experts admit, fentanyl is mixed with heroin and other drugs in Mexico and sent across the border," Herold said. Experts are skeptical that enhancing southern border security (like a wall) can do much to improve the opioid crisis. That’s because traffickers have a history of circumnavigating patrol measures, using catapults, drones, boats and tunnels. In other words, securing the border patrol might change where drugs are trafficked but it might not change the amount. David Herzberg, a professor who studies the history of American prescription drug abuse at the University at Buffalo, took issue with DeSantis’ characterization of what's driving the opioid epidemic. The crisis began with a dramatic uptick in new cases of addiction associated with a rise in the volume of prescribed opioids, and then illicit synthetic ones. The "bulk of the problem," as experts see it now, has to do with the lack of resources for those already struggling with addiction, such as methadone and Naltrexone. "In other words, ‘the problem’ now is not the smuggled opioid supply, it is our failure to deliver an adequate public health response to existing cases of opioid dependence and addiction," Herzberg said. Our ruling DeSantis said, "The bulk of the problem with the opioid epidemic is the fentanyl and all the synthetic drugs coming across the southern border." This claim downplays the fact that synthetic drugs are smuggled into the country from locations outside of the southern border, especially from China. However, exact numbers to sort out how much comes from where were unavailable. Trump’s own commission seemed more concerned with China than Mexico when it comes to synthetic drugs.

pomt-03755	"No one knows who bought the [38 Studios] bonds. And there was some language put in the bond offer that they must remain anonymous."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/apr/08/jim-taricani/jim-taricani-says-38-studios-bond-offer-promised-a/	One of the questions swirling around the collapse of 38 Studios is whether the state should be on the hook for the millions of dollars in bond money that it raised on behalf of the now-bankrupt video game developer, headed by former Red Sox star Curt Schilling. During the March 24, 2013, edition of "10 News Conference," co-host Jim Taricani posed that question to two members of the General Assembly, and then, as an aside, said: "No one knows who bought the bonds. And there was some language put in the bond offer that they must remain anonymous." Taricani said Rhode Islanders might feel differently about paying back the moral obligation bonds if the identities of the purchasers were known. The bonds The bonds were sold in November 2010 under the auspices of the Rhode Island Loan Guaranty Fund, after being approved earlier that year by the General Assembly and then-Gov. Donald Carcieri. The bonds were underwritten by Wells Fargo Securities and Barclays Capital, according to information provided at the time by Robert I. Stolzman, lawyer for the Economic Development Corporation. The bonds, according to the EDC, were sold in three blocks totaling $75 million and paid interest ranging from 6 percent to 7.75 percent annually. At the time, the EDC said about a dozen investors privately purchased the bonds. The purchasers included insurers, asset managers and a community bank. No names were given. The bondholders The first part of Taricani’s comment was a bit of hyperbole. Clearly some people know who bought the bonds -- those who sold them and those who purchased them. However, it is true that the identities of the bondholders were never made public. The Journal has been trying for some time to identify them. On May 30, 2012, the paper requested a list of bondholders from the Economic Development Corporation. A month and a half later, Allison Lane, a lawyer for the EDC, responded that the commission "does not have any documents that contain the names and other identifying information of any bondholders or any other information as to who bonds have been sold and or transferred." But when PolitiFact reviewed the bond offer, which runs a whopping 233 pages, it discovered this requirement on Page 40 of the file: "Each purchaser of the 2010 Bonds will be required to execute and deliver an Investor Letter substantially in the form attached hereto as Appendix E upon delivery and acceptance of the 2010 Bonds." The letters were designed to ensure the investors were experienced, knew what they were getting into and were "able to withstand without material injury a complete loss" of their investment. The statement is signed by Keith Stokes, who was economic development director until he was replaced after 38 Studios defaulted. Appendix E indicates that the letters should go to no fewer than 10 entities, including two securities firms, five law firms, 38 Studios and the state (with no department specified). Most importantly, one copy of each letter -- which would indicate who purchased the bonds -- was supposed to go to the EDC. Yet EDC lawyer Allison Lane, in her letter, had said the EDC had no such documents. PolitiFact Rhode Island spent more than a week contacting some of the law firms and the EDC trying to find out about the investor letters. Phone calls and e-mails were not returned by Moses and Afonso Ltd., the company that served as a bond counsel to the EDC; First Southwest Company, which was the financial adviser to the EDC; and Pannone Lopes Devereaux & West, the law firm involved in placement of the bonds. More than a week after seeking information from the EDC's current lawyer, Thomas E. Carlotto, the EDC e-mailed us a one-paragraph statement from him saying it had not received the investor letters "as anticipated." He blamed "the former executive management and former counsel to the RIEDC [which] should have taken measures in November 2010 to ensure receipt of such investor letters" to show that the placement agents, Wells Fargo Securities and Barclays Capital, had followed the requirements. Repeated attempts to subsequently interview Carlotto were unsuccessful. Christine Hunsinger, spokeswoman for Gov. Lincoln Chafee, who became chairman of the EDC when he took office two months after the bonds were sold, said EDC lawyers are now exploring whether those letters can be found. "It's yet another mess in the 38 Studios matter that, unfortunately, this governor has been left to clean up," Hunsinger said. So when Taricani stated, "No one knows who bought the bonds," aside from the sellers and buyers, he was right. Anonymity guaranteed? And what about Taricani's statement that anonymity was guaranteed in the bond offering? We searched that document for references to anonymity, requirements for disclosure or promises to protect a buyer's identity. We came up blank. We contacted Taricani in hopes that he could direct us to the restriction he was talking about. "My info came from two different people who have, in my opinion, knowledge of that bond issue," he told us in an e-mail. "If there is no specific language in that document about anonymity, I then misspoke and sincerely apologize for the misstatement." Our ruling Jim Taricani said, "No one knows who bought the [38 Studios] bonds. And there was some language put in the bond offer that they must remain anonymous." The first half of his statement appears to be correct. Although SOMEONE must have a record of who bought the bonds, the EDC, following inquiries by The Journal about the investment letters, now says it did not receive the documents required under the sale, and it is trying to get them. Regarding the other half of Taricani's statement, we could find no language guaranteeing the purchasers that their names would be kept secret. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-07033	Says the 2011-13 state budget eliminates the structural deficit "for the first time in decades."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/03/alberta-darling/state-sen-darling-says-2011-13-state-budget-elimin/	Republicans who control the state Legislature are touting their just-completed work on the 2011-2013 state budget. State Sen. Alberta Darling, a co-chairwoman of the legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, has been especially vocal about the virtues of the $66 billion spending plan. As one of nine senators facing recall elections over their actions on the separate collective bargaining bill, she’s also been the target of criticism for her votes. "I think this budget really does put us in the right direction -- phenomenally," Darling said in a June 20, 2011, meeting with Journal Sentinel editors and reporters. "It’s phenomenal what’s been accomplished in terms of debt and deficit reform and restructuring." Darling added: "We’re in the black for the first time in decades." To be clear, the budget has to be "in the black" every year when it is passed. The state constitution says it must be balanced. Darling was talking about the "structural deficit," which is a relatively new way of measuring the state’s future fiscal health. The structural deficit measures the future imbalance between spending and tax revenue as laid out in state law. So you can have a balanced budget, but one built upon assumptions that are projected to result in a deficit later on. We’ve been hearing about that problem for years. Darling, Walker and others argue their predecessors made the state budgets balance by using one-time maneuvers -- such including the state’s share of federal tobacco settlement money, and diversions of funds for transportation and medical malpractice insurance. "All these approaches only delayed the day of fiscal reckoning to make the budget balance, leading to the structural deficit," said Walker, in the message accompanying his budget introduction. So, is Darling right? Did Walker and the Legislature resolve -- for the first time in decades -- the underlying problems, as well as balance spending for the two-year period that begins July 1? The size of the structural deficit is determined by the non-partisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, considered by both parties to be a neutral scorekeeper on budget matters. The agency started doing the projections with the 1997-99 budget. The agency takes a look at the budget as proposed, amended and passed, said agency director Robert Lang. He begins his estimates with a baseline -- the second year of the current budget, which is adjusted based on previously approved law changes or legal commitments. The new budget is then factored in. "It takes out speculation," Lang said of the structural deficit estimates. "It puts out a marker based on current revenues and projections." Agency reports show for the past 14 years show the highest structural deficit was $2.8 billion for the 2003-05 budget, and the lowest was $1.49 billion for the 2007-09 budget. A report issued June 13, 2011, said the 2011-13 budget as approved by the Joint Finance Committee would result in a $306 million surplus. The Legislature changed very little of the committee’s work. Lang’s office will evaluate the budget again now that Walker’s vetoes are completed and the budget signed. Here was Lang’s assessment based on the earlier action: "We’ve had structural deficits since I started doing this, and now there’s a structural surplus." So Darling’s right on that account: the budget has a structural surplus and not a deficit. The budget does include the changes in pension and insurance payments state workers -- a law enacted before the budget was considered that did not take effect until after it passed -- that helped reduce the budget gap. Those changes are viewed as permanent, not one-time fixes, Lang said. Lang’s office has only 14 years of records covering a total of nine budgets, including the most recent one. No budget in this time frame showed a surplus, until the current one. In making her statement, Darling said the structural deficit was fixed for the "first time in decades." When we talked to her, she said she misspoke when she said "decades." As aide Bob Delaporte said: "The point was that it’s in the black for the first time in a long time." Fair enough. Since the structural deficit was not measured before 1997-99, we can’t say just when the structural deficits began. What’s the bottom line? In talking about the structural deficit, Darling claimed lawmakers delivered a budget "in the black for the first time in decades." The budget lawmakers sent to Walker is projected to have a $306 million surplus. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau report on structural deficits says there’s not been a budget with a structural surplus dating back to when it started recording such things 14 years ago. Darling may have overstated how far back the problem goes, but no one knows for certain and that does not change the underlying point of her statement. We rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-09878	In the health care bill, "The 'Health Choices Commissioner' will decide health benefits for you. You will have no choice. None."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/30/chain-email/health-choices-commissioner-does-not-decide-your-h/	It may be the longest chain e-mail we've ever received. A page-by-page analysis of the House health care bill argues that reform will end the health care system as we know it: "Page 29: Admission: your health care will be rationed! ... Page 42: The 'Health Choices Commissioner' will decide health benefits for you. You will have no choice. None. ... Page 50: All non-US citizens, illegal or not, will be provided with free health care services." Most of the e-mail's claims are wrong, and you can read our extended analysis to find out why. One of the claims that is just plain wrong says this: "Page 42: The 'Health Choices Commissioner' will decide health benefits for you. You will have no choice. None." To explain this one, we will start with an explanation of the overall bill, which was unveiled July 14, 2009. The bill envisions that everyone will be required to have health insurance. People who get health insurance through work satisfy this requirement right off the bat. People who don't get insurance through work or another group will go to the health care exchange; it's designed to help people who have to go off on their own to buy health insurance, and for small businesses with few employees. The reason for the exchange is that the government wants to regulate insurers to make sure that health plans clearly explain what they offer, can't refuse people for pre-existing conditions, and must offer basic levels of service. "This is designed to protect consumers from plans that have outrageous cost-sharing or really limited benefits," said Jennifer Tolbert, an independent health care analyst at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan foundation that studies health care reform. Tolbert has read and analyzed all the major health proposals, including those of the Republicans, and the foundation provides point-by-point analyses of the plans on its Web site. The exchange is meant to ensure that people are "actually getting coverage and not a junk policy," Tolbert added. A key point here is that employer-provided insurance is already subject to this kind of regulation. Employer-provided insurance has to meet certain requirements to win its tax-exempt status. That's why, if you get insurance through work, you're not asked about pre-existing conditions, and you pay the same rate as all of your co-workers. The bill says that a Health Choices commissioner will run the exchange, and that he or she will make sure that insurers are offering basic benefits and adhering to the regulations. Individuals then choose their own plan from offerings on the exchange. The health commissioner does not "decide health benefits for you." To the extent that insurance plans have to meet basic requirements, those instructions are ultimately coming from Congress. The commissioner executes the rules. The chain e-mail mentions page 42, which is part of Section 142. That section outlines the duties of the Health Choices commissioner and explains that the commissioner should seek insurers to offer different types of insurance, including basic, enhanced and premium. Again, individuals will be able to choose among competing insurers that are regulated via the exchange. The e-mail is adamant that the Health Choices commissioner "will decide health benefits for you. You will have no choice. None." That is not what the bill says. The bill envisions an exchange with several different plans, and people choosing their own plan. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-15118	"Florida led the nation in job creation" while Bush was governor.	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/sep/10/jeb-bush/bush-says-florida-created-more-jobs-any-other-stat/	GOP presidential hopeful Jeb Bush implied in a new campaign ad that the jobs boom Florida enjoyed while he was governor can be a reality for the entire country if he’s elected to the Oval Office. "As governor, I cut taxes, cut spending, balanced budgets, and Florida led the nation in job creation," he said in a Sept. 8, 2015, commercial. We wanted to see if Bush’s claim about job creation really put Florida in front of all 50 states. Tallahassee tally The time frame Bush is using here is key, because he is relying on a distinct slice of jobs data. His campaign said they are measuring total job growth for the period between January 2000 and January 2007, or Bush’s last seven years as governor. Let’s look at the way Bush’s people have sampled it: Using Bureau of Labor Statistics data for seasonally adjusted, nonfarm jobs, Florida indeed led the nation in total job creation from 2000-07, with 1.1 million new jobs. Second in that time span was California, with 1 million. Bush took office on Jan. 5, 1999, however, so why leave off 1999? Because then the top two spots switch places. California created 1.48 million new jobs, while Florida made 1.33 million. Just looking at 2000 to 2007 leaves out context, though. First, the economy began to falter a month before Bush left office, and the state started losing positions a couple of months after that. By the end of 2007 Florida had shed 106,000 jobs, many of which were from the construction and real estate industries that had expanded during the housing bubble. The state eventually lost about 1 million, or almost the entire total of job expansion from Bush’s time as governor. And as economists have told PolitiFact Florida time and time and time (and time) again, governors have limited impact on jobs numbers in the first place. Officials often enjoy or suffer from economies beyond their direct control, and Bush was no different, said David Cooper, an analyst for the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. And in this case, the end result isn’t something Bush should be too happy about. "Florida’s job losses in the recession were far worse than the national average and far worse than all of its neighbors," Cooper said. "I’m not sure how much credit we should give to the governor for the state’s job growth during that time, and even if we could credit him, I’m not sure he should want it." Also, the jobs during Bush’s time weren’t the greatest in the first place. Even the source Bush cites, a South Florida Sun-Sentinel wrap-up of Bush’s two terms the Post reprinted, said as much: "But while Florida led the nation in job creation, much of that was in low-paid service industry jobs that left many Floridians without health insurance and scrambling for affordable housing amid a real estate boom that helped fuel business-friendly tax breaks." Former Sun-Sentinel reporter Linda Kleindienst, who now is editor of Tallahassee business magazine 850, told us she had used state numbers from the Office of Economic and Demographic Research. Her point was that while there were more jobs, many of them offered poor pay and often no benefits. And finally, using total job numbers to paint a picture of success isn’t the best method to measure success. Florida is one of the largest states, so of course it would create a lot of jobs. "Comparing totals completely lacks context — it doesn’t really tell you anything unless you’re comparing totals among states of roughly equally sized economies and labor markets," Cooper said. A better way would be to measure Florida’s rate of job growth, as a percentage of total jobs. When we measure that, whether we start in January 1999 or 2000, Florida comes in fifth: State Jan. 1999 - Jan. 2007 Jan. 2000 - Jan. 2007 Nevada 34.6 percent 24.8 percent Arizona 25.9 percent 20.7 percent Wyoming 23.7 percent 20 percent Idaho 22.6 percent 17.9 percent Florida 19.8 percent 15.8 percent Our ruling Bush said "Florida led the nation in job creation" while he was governor. This is true if you parse the numbers the way his campaign did, looking only at total job growth over the last seven years of his eight-year tenure. But there are plenty of caveats to the talking point, including the prevalence of low-paying jobs that Bush policies didn’t necessarily create. Many of those jobs evaporated after the housing bubble burst. A more level way to measure jobs would have been to look at the growth rate, which put Florida fifth in the country while Bush was in office.

pomt-02705	"(Jack Kingston) had more earmarks at one time than every member of the Georgia delegation put together."	false	/georgia/statements/2013/dec/30/paul-broun/brouns-attack-kingston-earmarks-too-broad/	For years, pork was the preferred meat of Congress. Lawmakers pulled money from the federal budget for various projects in their congressional districts without having to compete in the open bidding system of the federal departments. Critics derisively called the process pork. The official term was "earmarks." Congress voted to abstain from pork in 2010, but one candidate is attempting to make it an issue in one of Georgia’s most interesting political races. "(Jack Kingston) had more earmarks at one time than every member of the Georgia delegation put together," U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, an Athens Republican, said of his GOP colleague, who is from Savannah, in an interview. Broun and Kingston are part of a crowded field of Republicans vying for the GOP U.S. Senate nomination, with the primary scheduled for May 2014. The incumbent, Saxby Chambliss, has announced his plans to retire. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Political Insider column reported about Broun’s comments and mused, "If you listen closely, you can hear Politifact hounds baying in the distance." We’re baying. Broun has been a vocal critic of earmarks and, apparently, is hoping to live high on the hog by criticizing Kingston on the issue. Kingston said criticism of the practice prodded him to trim back his own requests, the AJC reported in July 2008. The AJC article reported Kingston’s concerns that other states would get more money for various projects if Georgia lawmakers demurred from seeking earmarks. Broun spokeswoman Christine Hardman said the congressman based his claim by examining several databases created by Taxpayers for Common Sense, a budget watchdog group. The nonprofit has staffers who’ve worked for Democrats and Republicans. Broun, though, made a mistake in his interview with the Tea Party News Network. "What Congressman Broun should have clarified was that at one point, Congressman Kingston had more earmarks than the entire Republican Georgia delegation combined," Hardman told us via email. PolitiFact Georgia was still curious about where Kingston stood in comparison to his GOP colleagues when it comes to earmarks. The Taxpayers for Common Sense website has databases for the federal fiscal years 2008 through 2010 that allow users to conduct searches to see how much money each member of Congress pulled in through earmarks. The federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. Our review of the databases shows Kingston had more solo earmarks than his Georgia Republican colleagues in fiscal years 2008 and 2010. In 2008, Kingston had 21 earmarks that totaled about $17 million. His GOP colleagues from Georgia had 19 earmarks that totaled approximately $13 million. In fiscal year 2010, we found 18 solo earmarks for Kingston that totaled $24.3 million. The Republicans from Georgia had 15 earmarks that totaled $7.6 million. In fiscal year 2008, the Democrats from the Georgia congressional delegation recorded 48 individual earmarks that totaled about $26.5 million. In 2010, Democratic lawmakers from Georgia collected 65 earmarks worth a total of $33.5 million. The totals from the Democrats alone were higher than Kingston’s total. PolitiFact Georgia also reviewed the earmarks database of the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit organization that follows the money in Washington. The center is funded by foundation grants and individual donations and does not accept money from corporations, labor unions, or trade associations. The center’s totals were slightly different than what we found on the Taxpayers for Common Sense website. One commonality was that Kingston’s solo earmarks total did not exceed the entire Georgia delegation in 2008 or 2010. One difference we found was that Georgia’s GOP delegation had more solo earmarks and brought home more money in fiscal year 2008 than Kingston did. In 2010, we found Kingston had more earmarks and more money from those earmarks than the Republican delegation. So where does this all lead us? Broun meant to say Kingston had more earmarks at one point than the entire Georgia Republican delegation. Broun might have received a True if he had said that in the interview. It appears that Kingston had scored more earmarks than the entire Georgia GOP delegation to Congress in 2010 from our examination of two separate databases. Broun, however, misspoke in the interview, giving anyone who viewed it the wrong impression of Kingston’s record on earmarks. We rate his statement False.

pomt-11251	Says George Soros has "unloaded a whopping $1 million to install his liberal puppets in positions of power" in Texas this fall.	half-true	/texas/statements/2018/may/02/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-george-soros-new-york-pouring-mo/	In 2017, we found no evidence of George Soros, the internationally prominent pro-Democratic financier, investing in races for state office in Texas. More recently, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott warned afresh about Soros in a fundraising letter, opening: "Every weapon in the national Democrat machine’s arsenal is aimed straight at Texas today." Abbott’s April 2, 2018, letter states next: "Left-wing BILLIONAIRE George Soros has already unloaded a whopping $1 million to install his liberal puppets in positions of power this fall." The letter warns that Democrats are preparing an all-out assault and could seize control of the state at the ballot box. "I know," the letter further says, that "left-wing special interests and BILLIONAIRE liberals like George Soros are pouring outrageous sums of money into driving up Democrat turnout." After we didn’t hear back from Abbott about his basis for the "puppets" claim, we decided to check state, local and federal records for indications of Soros unpacking lucre to help Texas Democrats win election in 2018. Soros helped a Bexar County Democrat From the top, we knew that Soros invested significantly in a group that backed a successful challenger to the Bexar County district attorney. Attorney Joe Gonzales bested first-term incumbent Nicholas "Nico" LaHood in Bexar County’s Democratic primary after Soros contributions propelled a pro-Gonzales political committee. Of note: Soros boosted the pro-Gonzales committee a couple of years after Soros put more than $1.4 million into electing Democrat Kim Ogg as the district attorney of Harris County. An October 2016 Houston Chronicle news story pointed out that Soros had similarly put his money into district attorney races in Florida, Illinois, Mississippi and New Mexico, each time through state-specific PACs with variations on the name "Safety and Justice." The story also said Soros had supported criminal justice reforms including reduced racial disparities in sentencing and relaxed marijuana restrictions. In San Antonio, LaHood chalked up his loss to Soros’s spending, the San Antonio Express-News reported. "In my opinion, the voters were unfairly influenced by $1 million worth of lies," LaHood said. "There's no other way to say it." Gonzales has yet to win the DA post; he’s set to face Republican Tylden Shaeffer on this November's ballot. For his part, Gonzales said after his primary win that Soros’ contributions came without strings attached. "There was a clear understanding from the beginning that we would accept their contributions, but we were not going to be told how to run this office," Gonzales said. An Express-News spreadsheet tallies contributions by Soros to Texas Justice & Public Safety, the political committee supportive of Gonzales. According to the sheet, which was based on Gonzales’ campaign finance reports filed with the county elections department on Jan. 17, Feb. 5 and Feb. 26, 2018, the committee made $964,377 worth of in-kind contributions to Gonzales’ campaign from Dec. 18, 2017, through Feb. 23, 2018, mostly in TV ads and voter mailings but also in polling, research and palm cards. Gonzales’ campaign directly fielded no Soros contributions, the filings indicate. Multiple Democratic beneficiaries? Abbott’s fundraising letter warns of Soros spending money to install "puppets." To gauge whether Soros chose multiple Texas Democrats to help, we conducted online searches of candidate and political committee finance reports filed with the Texas Ethics Commission and Federal Election Commission. Previously, our 2017 search of campaign finance reports filed with the ethics commission from 2000 into 2017 indicated Soros hadn’t personally donated to candidates for state office--not once. Similarly, our fresh search of state records yielded no indication of Soros spending on races besides the Bexar County battle for the Democratic nomination for district attorney. In pre-primary reports, we found, the pro-Gonzales Texas Justice & Public Safety committee reported fielding $1.04 million in Soros contributions. According to our separate search of campaign reports filed with the FEC, Soros made 49 contributions nationally from February 2017 into March 2018, totaling $4,587,000. But, our search suggests, very little went to Texas Democrats. We identified a single Soros contribution to a Texas candidate. Soros gave $2,700 on Dec. 1, 2017 to Democratic U.S. Senate hopeful Beto O’Rourke, the El Paso congressman. Our ruling Abbott warned in his letter that Soros has spent $1 million to "install his liberal puppets in positions of power" in Texas this fall. We confirmed Soros spending in Texas, but he's yet to put a penny toward Democrats seeking state office. The New Yorker gave a little more than $1 million to a committee that helped a challenger win the Democratic nod for Bexar County district attorney. He gave $2,700 to O’Rourke, who went on to win the Democratic Senate nomination. All told, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-14296	Says his free public university tuition program "is paid for … by a tax on Wall Street's speculation."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/04/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-wall-street-tax-would-pay-his-/	One proposal boosting Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders’ support among college-aged voters is his promise of free tuition at public colleges and universities. In an interview with Sanders, CNN’s Erin Burnett asked about some of the issues Sanders’ critics bring up about the proposal, like the large cost of such a program and persuading states to get on board. But Sanders said he has a way to pay for it: Wall Street. "I think the idea is sound," Sanders said in the March 30 interview. "It is paid for, Erin, by a tax on Wall Street's speculation. When Wall Street's illegal behavior destroyed our economy, the middle class bailed them out. It is now time for them to help the middle class." Sanders’ assertion that the Wall Street speculation tax pays for his college tuition plan is only part of the story. Two-thirds, to be exact. Sanders estimates that his plan to make undergraduate tuition at public colleges and universities free would cost about $75 billion annually. Based on his proposed College for All Act, the federal government would fund two-thirds of that cost using a tax on Wall Street trading, but participating states would have to kick in the remaining costs. Sanders’ Wall Street tax proposal primarily taxes the rich in order to provide services to the non-wealthy. It would put a small tax on speculative financial trades, like stocks, bonds and derivatives. The revenue potential for such a tax is huge because the volume of Wall Street trading is so large. One estimate — which Sanders points to — put the yearly revenue from a financial transaction tax at more than $300 billion. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center analyzed Sanders' plan and put the yearly revenue at around $50 billion to $60 billion, much more modest but still enough to cover the approximately $50 billion a year in federal dollars Sanders wants to put in his tuition program. (The difference in revenue estimates largely has to do with how the analysts measured the various taxable trades and the impact of the policy.) Setting aside a disagreement over how much a Wall Street tax would raise, in any case, Sanders’ own proposal is straightforward about the fact that the tax revenue will not fund the free public school tuition 100 percent. And as CNN’s Burnett noted, there is some concern among skeptics of Sanders’ proposal about this piece in particular: What if state governments don’t want to play ball and refuse to kick in the remaining one-third of program costs? For example, many states have resisted federal dollars for expanding Medicaid, the low-income health insurance program, under the Affordable Care Act, even though the federal government would provide at minimum 90 percent of the funds to expand the program. In order to receive federal funding for Sanders' education proposal, states would have to meet other requirements designed to maintain high educational standards, like reducing the number of low-paid adjunct faculty and maintaining state funding for need-based financial aid. This, combined with the fact that state funding for higher education is tight across the country, raises the question of how states — particularly those whose governments are spending-averse — will respond to such a proposal and how that will affect students living in those states. In the CNN interview, Sanders said if a state chooses not to participate, it can expect its students to flock to a state that does. But Sanders is offering a generous deal that might be too good to pass up, said Barmak Nassirian, director of federal relations and policy analysis at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. He said the amount of federal money Sanders is putting on the table exceeds what states take in with undergraduate tuition, so they shouldn’t have to worry about a shortfall as a result of Sanders’ program. "But it is theoretically possible that some state does not take federal money," Nassirian said, noting that Sanders’ proposal is massive and won’t necessarily be politically feasible to implement. Our ruling Sanders said his free public university tuition program "is paid for… by a tax on Wall Street's speculation." Sanders’ $75 billion proposal is a federal matching program, meaning the Wall Street speculation tax would cover two-thirds of the costs. States would be required to pick up the tab for the remaining one-third. There is some question if some states would participate in the program. Recently, states have refused to be part of Medicaid expansion under a more generous style of cost-sharing. Sanders has a point that his proposed Wall Street tax would cover part of the plan, but he left out the significant state contribution. And it’s not a sure thing that every state would join in.

pomt-00063	On whether he supports tolls on I-77	full flop	/north-carolina/statements/2018/nov/02/jeff-tarte/sen-tartes-full-flop-tolls/	"Based on information from NCDOT, I am still in favor of tolling I-77 since this option solves the problem sooner rather than much later and will generate additional dollars for local road projects," Tarte wrote in the article. "Simply doing nothing is not an option." - Sen. Jeff Tarte to the Charlotte Observer on July 1, 2014 "I totally support no tolling" -Sen. Jeff Tarte to WSOC-TV on June 14, 2014 Drivers in Charlotte spend an average of 23 hours a week stuck in traffic, according to Inrix, a company that analyzes transportation and traffic data. It’s no wonder there are plans to help alleviate some of this congestion by adding lanes on I-77, an interstate that wraps around the western part of Charlotte. The North Carolina Department of Transportation began in 2007 to seriously look into expanding the stretch of the interstate that runs from Mooresville to Charlotte. These lanes will use tolls to pay for the expansion, which will open near the end of this year. Only two of these lanes will have tolls. Many drivers aren’t happy with the decision to charge tolls, and some don’t think it will help with the congestion. And with election season coming to a close soon, the I-77 tolls have been a popular topic of discussion between state Sen. Jeff Tarte and Democratic challenger Natasha Marcus. They are running to represent North Carolina’s Senate District 41. Tarte wrote an op-ed in the Charlotte Observer in 2014 saying he is "in favor of tolling on I-77 since this option solves the problem sooner rather than later." However, in a recent Charlotte Observer article highlighting the Marcus-Tarte race, Tarte, a Republican from Cornelius, said in an interview with the Observer, "At no point have I been in favor of this specific project." The project Tarte is referencing is the state’s contract with Cintra, a Spanish firm responsible for building the lanes. Tarte told the Observer the governor should cancel the contract. Cintra would also maintain the toll lanes for 50 years. Tarte also said he "totally supports no tolling" to WSOC-TV on June 14, 2018. The North Carolina Democratic Party disagrees, and has a webpage dedicated to saying Tarte gave the project the "green-light before being against them." What’s Tarte said about the tolls? The decision to use tolls to pay for the expansion of I-77 came in 2010 according to NCDOT’s timeline of the project. Tarte was the mayor of Cornelius, a town north of Charlotte, at the time of the decision. He was elected to the state Senate in 2013. April 29, 2009 There are minutes from a meeting in 2009 — when Tarte was mayor of Cornelius — of the Mecklenburg-Union Metropolitan Planning Organization that shows Tarte expressed some support for managed lanes, which means lanes that are operated using some types of restrictions or with tolls. "Mr. Foxx asked Mayor Tarte about constructing I-77 lanes as managed lanes. He replied that he had no concerns with that," according to the minutes. The Mr. Foxx here is Anthony Foxx. He represented Charlotte on the planning organization for Mecklenburg and Union county, and went on to serve as the U.S. secretary of transportation under President Barack Obama. May 24, 2013 During Tarte’s first year as senator, he called the tolls "the least onerous of the alternatives" for expanding I-77, according to the Winston-Salem Journal. Tarte said in a phone interview with PolitiFact in 2018 that he supported tolls prior to 2014 because the state said there were no other ways to finance the project. June 14, 2014 In an email exchange between Tarte and Anthony Tata, the former state transportation secretary, Tata said Tarte supported the project. The email, from Tarte on June 24, 2014, reads: "I am requesting that our State Auditor, and elected officials of the NCGA, selected by President Pro Tem as well as the Speaker, to be allowed to perform a review of the contract between NCDOT and Cintra prior to authorizing the signature of this contract." Tarte got a response from Tata, the same day which tells a different tale: "At the conclusion of the meeting you indicated that you were comfortable that the I-77 project was a ‘good deal for the state.’ As you know NCDOT Director of Technical Services Rodger Rochelle and the team of professionals, some of whom were in the meeting yesterday, have performed detailed due diligence on this project." These emails were noted in an audit released from the office of the state auditor, Beth Wood, in June 2018. July 1, 2014 In the Charlotte Observer, Tarte wrote an op-ed asking for Gov. Pat McCrory to properly vet the contract with Cintra — a consistent message from Tarte. "Based on information from NCDOT, I am still in favor of tolling I-77 since this option solves the problem sooner rather than much later and will generate additional dollars for local road projects," Tarte wrote in the article. "Simply doing nothing is not an option." Tarte says in the article that he takes issue with the contract with Cintra, but not with tolling. July 18, 2014 Tarte supported the idea of high occupancy toll lanes, according to WFAE, an NPR affiliate. This article again says Tarte had questions about the specific contract that would be signed with Cintra. High occupancy tolls means that cars with a high number of passengers would be able to drive on the interstate for free. In the managed lanes being built on I-77, the price of tolls is free to fluctuate based on the number of cars. Any vehicle with three or more passengers won’t have to pay the toll. June 29, 2015 Tarte told the Carolina Journal he had plans to introduce a bill to stop the project because most people are opposed to it, and there are new ways to finance the expansion of I-77 without using tolls. Nov. 13, 2015 Tarte was one of four legislators who wrote a letter to McCrory asking for the project to be stopped, according to the Charlotte Observer. They say the tolls would hurt business in the area and the lanes were being built below standard. Dec. 11, 2015 Tarte was described by the Courier-Tribune as someone who "once supported tolls." At this time, Tarte was asking for NCDOT to look at the entire interstate again to see if there were other ways to fund the construction. June 21, 2016 An effort to stop the project failed in the General Assembly. Tarte expressed his disappointment to the Charlotte Observer. The article says Tarte had plans to introduce a bill in the following session to try to stop the project again. June 24, 2018 During session early this year, state senators passed a bill giving Gov. Roy Cooper until October to either change the contract with Cintra or cancel it entirely. Tarte was the sponsor of this bill. "I totally support no tolling," Tarte said in a phone interview with WSOC-TV. Our ruling: Tarte says he originally supported using tolls to pay for the widening of I-77 because they were not presented with other options. Based on his public statements, he has consistently been against the contract with Cintra and asked for the contract to be vetted. However, that doesn’t change the fact that he went from supporting the tolls to completely opposing them. We rate this a Full Flop.

pomt-05423	"Student loan rates set to double because a Democratic-controlled Congress voted to double them."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/may/01/john-boehner/john-boehner-tweets-dems-voted-double-student-loan/	The U.S. House of Representatives voted April 27, 2012, on a measure to stop interest rates on student loans from doubling this summer. Speaker John Boehner announced the surprise vote at a hastily called news conference on Wednesday, hours after President Obama named the Ohio Republican as a chief obstacle to the Democrats’ plan to keep the loan benefit from expiring. "This week the president is campaigning and trying to invent a fight where there is none and never has been on this issue of student loans," Boehner said. "We can, and will, fix the problem — without a bunch of campaign-style theatrics." But the speaker himself had weighed in earlier on the issue, with a posting on Twitter that caught the attention of PolitiFact Ohio. "Student loan rates set to double because a Democratic-controlled Congress voted to double them," he tweeted on @speakerboehner, his official account, in Twitter's 140-character shorthand. It ended with a link to the speaker's blog, on his website, which added this: "In 2007, the Democratic majority in Congress enacted legislation to double interest rates on new federal student loans from 3.4 percent to 6.8 percent in 2012." Voting to double student loan rates would hit a lot of wallets. We asked Boehner's office how he backed up the charge. They referred us to an Associated Press story linked on his blog. "While Obama blames Republicans for voting against new ways to make college more affordable for middle-class families," the story said, "it was House Democrats who cut interest rates on the school loans in 2007 and included an expiration provision that placed the looming increase in the middle of an election year." That does not describe a vote to double rates, and it did not clarify the issue to our satisfaction. We looked further. The 2007 vote in question was on the College Cost Reduction and Access Act, H.R. 2669. It gradually reduced the interest rate on federally subsidized loans to undergraduate student borrowers from 6.8 percent in July 2006 to 3.4 percent in July 2011. Advanced by a newly Democratic-majority Congress, the law had bipartisan support. Democrats were joined by 77 House Republicans and 35 Senate Republicans. The bill was signed by President George W. Bush. The law was temporary. It expires this July. If no action is taken, the interest rate will return to 6.8 percent. The increase would affect more than 7 million borrowers, and add $1,000 a year to the repayment cost of the average loan, according to Education Secretary Arne Duncan. Obama's budget proposal for fiscal 2013 included money to extend the rate cut, but only for one year. The Republican budget -- advanced by Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, supported by GOP leadership and passed by the House -- returns the interest rate to 6.8 percent. Extending the program for one year would cost $6 billion. Democrats have offered proposals to pay for extending the lower interest rate. One would end a payroll tax exemption given some business owners. Another would end tax subsidies for oil and gas companies. Neither of those proposals was considered likely to draw any Republican support. The GOP measure advanced by Boehner had its own poison pill that made it unlikely to get past, or to, Obama's desk: Boehner said the bill would pay the cost of the loan program with money for preventive health care programs from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Boehner labeled the money a "slush fund," a characterization Republicans have long used for the program. PolitiFact rated the term as a Pants on Fire falsehood when Boehner applied it to the health care act a year ago. But the statement we're reviewing now is this: "Student loan rates [are] set to double because a Democratic-controlled Congress voted to double them." It is accurate in saying that Democrats were in the majority when Congress passed the College Cost Reduction and Access Act in 2007. It is accurate in saying that the loan rate reductions in the measure are scheduled to expire in July, and that the result would double the current rate. But to describe that initial vote five years ago as one in which the Democratic majority "voted to double" rates this year is misleading at best. On the Truth-O-Meter, Boehner's statement rates as Mostly False.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2012-05-01T06:00:00	2012-04-24	['United_States_Congress', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-07410	President Barack Obama "took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commission’s ideas. Not one."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/28/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-obama-took-exactly-none-his-own-/	During an interview with ABC News’ Jonathan Karl, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, had a blunt message for President Barack Obama on the deficit: "Grow up." Referring to the deficit commission chaired by former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming and former Democratic White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles, Boehner said, "While I didn’t agree with everything they did, there was a lot in their proposal that was worthy of consideration. And what did the president do? He took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commission’s ideas. Not one. Come on! It’s time to grow up and get serious about the problems that face our country." A reader asked us to check whether the White House has indeed ignored the recommendations of the very blue-ribbon panel it had established. So we looked at the commission’s final report, which was released in December 2010; the president’s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal, which was released in February 2011; and a fact sheet released by the White House following Obama’s budget speech at George Washington University in April 2011. We should begin by noting that the commission’s report offered no shortage of recommendations for the White House to choose from -- more than 70, in fact. Based on our analysis of these three documents, as well as our discussions with independent budget experts, we found many policies now advocated by Obama that had been included in the bipartisan commission’s final report. However, in many cases the White House proposal either differed in some of the details or lacked details entirely. When we contacted Boehner’s office, a spokesman said that the fairest way to compare the proposals is to look at the president’s proposed budget, since that document includes greater detail than the fact sheet that accompanied the George Washington University speech, which is informally known as the "framework." Still, we think the framework has value, so we’ll evaluate them separately. First are two recommendations by the commission that were included in the president’s budget proposal: • Allow the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation to increase premiums. The PBGC is the federal agency that protects traditional defined-benefit pension payments for workers whose companies have failed. Both the commission and the White House agreed that PBGC premiums are lower than those charged by private-sector financial institutions and are too low to allow the agency to remain financially stable. Both proposals would allow the agency to raise premiums in order to shore up its financial position. • Increase government authority and funding to reduce Medicare fraud. The president’s budget does this. So these two items by themselves show Boehner is wrong to say that none of the commission’s recommendations were included. Next, we’ll list six of the commission’s recommendations that were included in the president’s budget with slight differences. • Eliminate "in-school subsidies" for the federal student loan program. Both the commission and the president’s budget agree that this policy should be eliminated, though the president would do it only for graduate and professional student loans. • End the reliance on deficit spending to fund the transportation trust fund. The main difference here is that Obama does not specifically advocate a 15-cent-per-gallon increase in the gas tax -- a key provision of the commission’s recommendation. • Freeze pay for federal workers and Defense Department civilians. The commission recommended a three-year freeze; the president’s budget would do two years. • Overhaul the medical malpractice system. The commission advocated an "aggressive" set of changes to the medical malpractice system, such as imposing a statute of limitations for suits, creating specialized "health courts," and allowing "safe haven" rules for providers who follow best practices of care. Obama’s budget is much less specific, saying only that the president "encourages Republicans to work constructively with him on medical malpractice as part of an overall effort to restrain health costs." • Reform the corporate tax system. The president’s budget calls for simplification but does not go so far as to endorse the commission’s specific recommendation of a single corporate tax rate between 23 percent and 29 percent and changing how foreign income is taxed. • Increase government efficiency. Both the commission and the president’s budget endorse the idea of reorganizing government to make it more efficient, but neither provides much detail. Finally, the White House "framework" on deficit reduction refers very generally to seven of the commission’s recommendations. In several of these examples, the White House proposal offers less detail than the commission’s. • Cut both security and non-security spending. The commission urged cutting both types of spending by equal percentages. In his fact sheet for the framework, Obama advocates cutting non-security spending to levels consistent with that of the commission, but his cuts to security-related spending are not as large as those proposed by the commission. • Implement structural tax reform. The commission and Obama both agree with the principle of cutting marginal tax rates while eliminating loopholes. But while the commission recommended "a small number of simpler, more targeted provisions that promote work, home ownership, health care, charity and savings," Obama was less specific. • Reform Medicare’s Sustainable Growth Rate mechanism. Both the commission and Obama agreed that the Sustainable Growth Rate needs to be overhauled, in a way that is fully offset in the budget, but their approaches are somewhat different. • Establish a long-term global budget for federal health care spending. The commission urged a "target of holding growth (of all federal health care spending) to GDP plus 1 percent and requiring action by the president and Congress if growth exceeds the targets." In his framework, Obama proposed a more aggressive standard -- GDP plus 0.5 percent per beneficiary -- but for the more limited target of just Medicare. • Eliminate state "gaming" of Medicaid. The commission recommends preventing states from taxing providers in order to increase their payments, and therefore increase the federal match. The Obama framework backs a limited version. • Reduce agricultural subsidies. The Obama framework supports cuts, but it does not mention the specific programs recommended by the commission. • Create a mechanism to enforce adherence to debt stabilization. Both the commission and the president’s framework agree on this in principle, but they use different mechanisms. The commission recommended that if balanced-budget targets are not met, Congress would need to implement a fast-track legislative procedure to enforce changes in spending and/or taxes. The president would do something similar, but he would specifically carve out Social Security, low-income programs and Medicare, "consistent with prior fiscal enforcement triggers put in place by Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Clinton." We do think it’s fair to say that Obama has stopped short of adopting many of the commission’s recommendations, and he’s been clear that he will not accept the package in its entirety. But even if you look only at his fiscal year 2012 budget plan rather than the less detailed framework, Obama made two proposals -- pension guarantees and Medicare fraud -- that are substantially similar to those offered by the commission, and his budget proposal includes six additional provisions that share significant common ground with recommendations made by the commission. Alice Rivlin, the former director of the Office of Management and Budget for Clinton and a member of the commission, told PolitiFact that the most important idea Obama took from the group wasn’t a policy proposal at all but was instead "the concept of shared sacrifice," which was a centerpiece of the commission’s preamble. If Boehner had offered a more measured assessment, he would have had a fair point about the differences between Obama’s fiscal approach and that outlined by the commission. The president certainly could have gone further in embracing the recommendations of the panel he had commissioned. But he did embrace a wide variety of them, so to say bluntly, as Boehner did, that Obama "took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commission’s ideas" is simply not correct. To one degree or another, the commission’s recommendations are sprinkled throughout Obama’s budget proposals, in recognizable -- if not always in identical -- form. So we rate Boehner’s statement False.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2011-04-28T11:40:07	2011-04-25	['None']
pomt-06006	PolitiFact Oregon gave Rob Cornilles a Pants on Fire for a claim about taxes and fees.	pants on fire!	/oregon/statements/2012/jan/18/suzanne-bonamici/suzanne-bonamici-says-we-gave-rob-cornilles-pants-/	This week Suzanne Bonamici’s campaign unleashed a memorandum of complaints regarding opponent Rob Cornilles’ latest television ad. The National Republican Congressional Committee is chipping in for part of the cost of Cornilles’ ad buy. The memo is addressed to members of the Oregon media and lists three "False attacks" within the Cornilles’ ad that the Bonamici folks say have been discredited by independent news analysts. Yours truly, PolitiFact Oregon, is on the list: False Attack #2: AD: "She voted for higher taxes and fees on the middle class and small business." On January 2, 2012, The Oregonian’s PolitiFact found this attack to be so FALSE that it was rated "Pants on Fire." "We can’t accept their explanation that punishing unemployment benefit cheats or allowing the state to go after people who haven’t paid taxes is a new tax or fee." http://www.politifact.com/oregon/statements/2012/jan/10/rob-cornilles/rob-cornilles-claims-suzanne-bonamici-has-voted-60/ We’re astonished with the Bonamici campaign’s interpretation. The quote about punishing unemployment benefit cheats contained in the media release is certainly ours, and the ruling is accurate, but that is not the statement on which we ruled. We ruled on his statement that Bonamici "voted for 60 tax increases." Let’s make this clear: It is 100 percent true that Bonamici has voted for higher taxes and fees while in the Legislature. What Bonamici hadn’t done while in the Oregon Legislature was vote for 60 tax increases. This statement was the subject of an earlier ad by the Cornilles’ campaign, the one we ruled Pants on Fire. We found Bonamici had voted for 14, maybe 16 tax increases, at least 32 fee increases and 14 bills that should in no way have been included as a tax or fee increase, such as legislation to punish unemployment benefit cheats. All of that combined prompted our ruling of Pants on Fire. Carol Butler, Bonamici’s campaign manager, said she found it incredible that we would fact check a press release when there are so many outrageous statements coming from the Cornilles’ campaign. She said she saw no difference between the Cornilles’ campaign’s two statements on tax voting, as they both intend to mislead voters. We see a big difference. Here’s what the Bonamici people didn’t include from our original PolitiFact: "It’s fair to say that Bonamici can’t recall ever voting against a tax increase or fee hike. It’s fair to say that she has one of the most liberal voting records in the Legislature. It’s fair to say that she has voted for big-ticket tax increases that have infuriated conservatives in Oregon. Cornilles could have stuck with that script and his statements would have been True." We note that on Wednesday, the Bonamici campaign launched a new ad that correctly states that we gave Cornilles a Pants on Fire for "more false attacks on Bonamici and taxes.": The Cornilles’ campaign claim that "she voted for higher taxes and fees" is spot on. The Bonamici campaign is twisting a PolitiFact for its own campaign purposes. We rule that a Pants on Fire. Go back to OregonLive to comment.

(Click here for the full text of the e-mail.) The allegation began after the Clintons purchased a home in Chappaqua, N.Y. during the end of Bill's presidency. About two weeks before they left office, a short item headlined "Another freebie for the Clintons" on the New York Press Web site said the Secret Service was paying rent and that "by an amazing coincidence . . . matches the monthly mortgage payment for the entire property." There were no other details. That allegation was then repeated in a chain e-mail, with the additional detail that the Secret Service was paying $10,000 per month. The e-mail says "an extra residency had to be built within the acreage in order to house the Secret Service agents ... The Clinton's now charge the Secret Service $10,000 monthly rent for the use of said Secret Service residence and that rent is just about equal to their mortgage payment." We checked with the Secret Service, which declined to comment and referred us to Clinton's Senate office. Philippe Reines, Clinton's press spokesman, said in an e-mail message, "They have not and do not receive money" from the Secret Service. That matches a statement from White House spokeswoman Nanda Chitre, who told the New York Post in January 2001 that "They are entitled to charge rent, but they have decided not to do it." So we find the charge to be False.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2007-10-20T00:00:00	2007-09-17	['Bill_Clinton', 'United_States_Secret_Service']

pomt-03666	"Narragansett Bay waters are getting warmer -- 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in the winter since the 1960s."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/apr/28/sheldon-whitehouse/us-sen-sheldon-whitehouse-says-narragansett-bay-ri/	Want evidence of man-made climate change? U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse says you can feel it in the waters of Narragansett Bay, which covers about 120.5 square miles, from Newport to Providence, in his home state of Rhode Island. "Narragansett Bay waters are getting warmer -- 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in the winter since the 1960s," he said April 9 during one of his regular climate speeches on the floor of the Senate. He blamed the warmer temperatures for a drop in the flounder catch from more than 2,500 metric tons in the 1980s to about 150 metric tons in 2009. The reason: Warmer temperatures attract winter flounder predators earlier in the season. We can save the winter flounder factoid for another day. We were interested in whether Bay water has, in fact, gotten 4 degrees warmer since the 1960s, especially when water temperatures can fluctuate naturally from year to year. Whitehouse's office directed us to a 2008 article written by researchers at the University of Rhode Island’s Graduate School of Oceanography and published in the journal Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science. It says that the surface water of the Bay from December through February "has warmed on average by about 2.2 degrees Celsius since 1960." That would be 4 degrees Fahrenheit. An accompanying chart showing the trend ends at 2006. We wondered whether the increase continued beyond that. Next we contacted Jeremy Collie, a URI oceanographer. "There's clearly a warming signal," he said as he looked at the trend line for data from 1959 through 2010. "If you look at the winter months and take a regression, you get a warming rate of about 0.5 degrees F. per decade." That would be about 2.5 degrees F. since 1960. "So 4 degrees is a little on the high end," he said. He cautioned that there can be a lot of normal variation in the readings from winter to winter. The data, collected off Fox Island, located between North Kingstown and the Jamestown Bridge, can be downloaded from URI's website (search for "fox island 1959-2010"). We double-checked the trend, using Microsoft Excel's ability to create a chart, and found an increase, of 2.4 degrees for December-February from 1959-2010. (It rose to 2.7 degrees if you didn't include the winter of 1959-60, which might not be considered to be in the 1960s.) We also checked the data for another temperature measuring site: Whale Rock, south of the bridge on the same side of the Bay. Using data from December 1960 through February 2010, we again found an increase of 2.7 degrees F. In both locations, temperatures deeper in the water rose a bit more -- about 3 degrees -- but still not by the amount the senator said. It's unclear why the older study reported a surface temperature 1.5 degrees higher than our newer look at the data. The 2008 article appears to be using the same data we did. The additional winters we looked at had some colder-than-normal temperatures but that doesn't seem to be enough to account for the difference. Our ruling When Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said "Narragansett Bay waters are getting warmer -- 4 degrees Fahrenheit warmer in the winter since the 1960s," he was citing a URI study that offered the observation after authors examined temperatures through 2006. The latest data for December, January and February -- the months used in the URI study -- extending through 2010 reveal that the increase since the '60s is less extreme. The closest we saw was a 3-degree rise in the deeper waters off Fox Island. The trend is certainly correct, but Whitehouse is too far off for the Truth-O-Meter to register True. It is, to pardon the pun, a matter of degree. Because the temperature rise is a little more than half of what he said, we rate his statement Half True.

pomt-12288	"28.2 million Americans are still waiting under Obamacare and remain uninsured!"	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/28/sean-spicer/sean-spicer-tweets-misleading-obamacare-statistic/	After the delay of a vote on the Senate’s controversial health bill, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer took to Twitter to assuage concerns regarding the increase in the uninsured population projected by a Congressional Budget Office report. Spicer tweeted an image that said, "28.2 million Americans are still waiting under Obamacare and remain uninsured!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We checked the National Center for Health Statistics and found that 28.2 million people were indeed uninsured as of 2016. We also found, however, that the tweet neglects to show the full picture. The same bullet point Spicer seems to quote points out that we have 20.4 million fewer uninsured people since 2010, the year the Affordable Care Act went into effect. The current 8.8 percent rate of uninsured persons is the lowest since 1972. "Nor did he mention that the Senate bill would result in approximately zero of the 28.2 million currently uninsured becoming insured. Quite the opposite," said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. About 22 million people would be added to the ranks of the uninsured in 2026 under the Senate bill, according to the CBO, while the House-passed American Health Care Act would add 23 million people. The Senate bill would bring the non-elderly uninsured population to 49 million, and the House bill to 51 million by 2026; both numbers are quite higher than the 28.2 million currently uninsured. While there was never the expectation that the ACA would bring the number of uninsured Americans down to zero, there is a viable argument that the ACA did not do enough to expand coverage. But neither bill proposed in Congress now would reverse this trend. "While there are proposals that could reduce the number of uninsured — including expanding Medicaid in more states and providing more generous financial assistance to people buying coverage on the individual market — those are generally policies that the administration and its congressional allies have opposed," said Matt Fiedler, a fellow with the Center for Health Policy in Brookings' Economic Studies Program. Breaking down the uninsured The states that elected not to expand Medicaid coverage account for about 2.6 million of the uninsured population, according to Kaiser Family Foundation Executive Vice President Diane Rowland. That number may increase because the Senate bill cuts federal assistance to Medicaid. States that have opted into the expansion program might begin scaling back coverage. According to the CBO, "despite being eligible for premium tax credits, few low-income people would purchase any plan." The 3 million people who are uninsured because they make too much money for subsidies will not be covered, either, as the poverty level that qualifies people for subsidies is increasing. "It would lower the subsidy levels and it would make them much more costly for older people who are pre-Medicare, so you would expect fewer of them to try to take up coverage and many who have coverage to drop it," Rowland said. The 5.4 million people uninsured because they are undocumented will remain uninsured, too, as the Senate bill doesn’t cover undocumented people. About 4.5 million people now who could get insurance through work go without it. The bill removes the employer penalty, so coverage provided through work would decrease further. "It’s basically prohibiting anyone who has an offer of employer coverage from being able to get a tax credit, so it wouldn’t help any of the people who can’t afford their employer coverage," Rowland said. Finally, the remaining 12 million people who are eligible for coverage but haven’t participated is expected to grow, as the Senate bill eliminates the individual mandate that was designed to lure those people in. Our rating Spicer said that 28.2 million Americans remain uninsured under Obamacare, an accurate claim based on the most recent numbers. However, the talking point is out of context, as it ignores that this is in fact a historic low in the United States. He suggests that repealing the ACA would decrease this figure, but the CBO and health care experts agree that the opposite would happen under the proposed House and Senate versions of the health care bill.

pomt-03645	"Ohioans want an end to pay-to-play politics."	false	/ohio/statements/2013/may/02/ed-fitzgerald/ed-fitzgerald-accuses-gov-john-kasich-pay-play-pol/	The 2014 race for governor is off to a punchy start. PolitiFact Ohio told you Wednesday about the early attacks that Republican allies of incumbent John Kasich hope will stick against his likely Democratic challenger, Ed FitzGerald. Essentially, the GOP has seized on FitzGerald’s bystander status in the federal investigation of Cuyahoga County government and wrongly branded the first-term county executive as corrupt. It’s an attack that cuts directly at FitzGerald’s efforts to project a law-and-order image. But FitzGerald is using similar rhetoric in his attempt to draw contrasts with Kasich. "We need a governor who will stand up for middle-class families, for women’s rights and for good paying jobs," FitzGerald wrote last month when inviting supporters to his campaign kickoffs in Cleveland, Columbus and Cincinnati. "Ohioans want an end to pay-to-play politics, rampant cronyism and wasteful spending of our tax dollars on corporate donors and political perks." Jon Thompson, a spokesman for the Republican Governors Association, pointed to that statement this week as PolitiFact Ohio was evaluating his group’s claim that FitzGerald, the former mayor of Lakewood, represented a "brand of pay-to-play and corruption politics." The he-started-it defense is not acceptable when dealing with dishonesty. The RGA statement earned a Pants On Fire rating on our Truth-O-Meter. But what’s good for the goose is good for the gander, so PolitiFact Ohio today is taking a closer look at FitzGerald’s "pay-to-play" claim. We asked Meredith Tucker, spokeswoman for FitzGerald’s campaign, to clarify what, specifically, FitzGerald meant by talking of pay-to-play politics involving Kasich. She responded with a 12-page memo with a table of contents that offered six examples. None, though, is a case in which the governor himself is accused of seeking or providing a favor in exchange for another. Most of the examples involve Kasich administration officials or political allies. And while a few raise obvious ethics questions, they do not fit the pay-to-play description in the classic sense. One example FitzGerald’s campaign cites is merely a rehash of the controversy surrounding Kasich’s JobsOhio program, which is not subject to any substantiated corruption claims. FitzGerald’s team fills three pages with quotes from newspapers that reported on how three members of Kasich’s inner circle emerged as top Statehouse lobbyists after Kasich took office. The FitzGerald document says the lobbyists "cashed in on their relationship with the governor." This cannot fairly be held as an example of pay-to-play. This the culture of Capitol Square. Lobbyists closely aligned with a particular party do better when that party is in power. The Plain Dealer’s Mark Naymik noted this in April 2007, when he reported that demand had surged for Democratic lobbyists after Democrat Ted Strickland’s election as governor. Naymik reported in 2011 that the GOP sweep the previous fall had ushered in a new wave of Republican lobbyists. Another of FitzGerald’s examples focuses on Jim Leftwich, a former Kasich administration official who lost his development job with the state after it was learned he had a consulting contract with Wright State University. The Dayton Daily News covered the story extensively. Last November the newspaper reported it had obtained public records that showed Leftwich was on the state payroll when he and a WSU official devised a plan to give Leftwich’s firm "a 25 percent ownership stake in start-up companies established based on the WSU-originated research." Leftwich "apparently … did not disclose" this arrangement to his supervisors in state government -- something that state ethics rules would have required him to do, the Daily News reported. After Leftwich signed his WSU contract, Kasich, according to the newspaper, "appointed him to the board for the Third Frontier program," a state program that invests in technology companies. Three weeks later, Leftwich suggested that "WSU could use Third Frontier money to help launch two potential start-up businesses the university was working to create," the Daily News reported. The Kasich administration eventually learned about Leftwich’s dual roles, terminated him last fall and referred the case to the Ohio Ethics Commission. Paul Nick, the agency’s executive director, told PolitiFact Ohio this week that he "cannot comment on an ongoing investigation." While ethically murky, this is a stretch as a pay-to-play example. FitzGerald’s campaign also singles out former Ohio Schools Superintendent Stan Heffner. The state inspector general last year found Heffner acted improperly by testifying in favor of a bill that benefited a private education company he planned to work for, The Plain Dealer reported. The FitzGerald memo blasts Kasich for opposing Heffner’s firing. The governor’s spokesman told The Plain Dealer at the time that Heffner exercised bad judgment but that Kasich believed dismissal "seems too far." Heffner resigned two days later, a move Kasich said was appropriate. Prosecutors in Franklin County and Columbus ruled that Heffner’s actions were not criminal. Conflict of interest involving the state schools chief? Yes. Pay-to-play politics involving the governor? No. The final two examples FitzGerald offers relate to the governor’s control over the Ohio GOP. Last year Andrew Manning, the former chairman of the Portage County Republican Party, accused Kasich allies of offering him influence in the governor’s administration if he agreed not to run for a seat on the party’s State Central Committee. Team Kasich at the time wanted to dump Kevin DeWine as state party chairman and needed a majority of votes on the panel. Manning has said he met with FBI and sent the agency a sworn affidavit backing up his claims. But to date nothing has come of his accusations. Kasich’s allies have denied wrongdoing. This year Kasich endorsed Matt Borges, the state party’s executive director, to move up to the chairman’s post. Borges, who won the post last month, was dogged by a past guilty plea to unauthorized use of a public office. The 2004 misdemeanor involved Borges giving preferential treatment to certain brokers who donated to Ohio Treasurer Joe Deters’ re-election campaign. Borges paid a $1,000 fine and later cleared his record when he was granted an expungement. The Borges case is the only one cited in FitzGerald’s memo that is an actual example of a pay-to-play crime. And in this case Kasich has no connection to the crime, which since has been cleared from Borges’ record. FitzGerald resorts here to guilt by association. FitzGerald, in the invitation to his campaign kickoffs, contrasted himself with Kasich by asserting that Ohioans "want an end to pay-to-play politics." By doing so he characterizes the Kasich administration as corrupt. But he has no strong examples to back up this claim. PolitiFact Ohio applies the same threshold we applied when evaluating the Republican Governors Association’s effort to brand FitzGerald as corrupt. Kasich has never been accused of or charged with a crime, and FitzGerald lacks proof that he is even suspected of one. The GOP’s attack on FitzGerald was especially absurd given the fact that a federal prosecutor has publicly cleared the county executive of wrongdoing. FitzGerald walks a finer line by citing specific cases in which members of Kasich’s administration or political circle were accused of ethics violations and other uses of poor judgment -- but nothing that fits the "pay-to-play" label. As for Borges, had his misdemeanor come during Kasich’s term, FitzGerald might have a better argument. Instead, on the Truth-O-Meter, PolitiFact Ohio finds his statement False.

pomt-05704	Says Barack Obama "promised he would cut the deficit in half" but didn’t.	true	/florida/statements/2012/mar/08/lenny-curry/obama-promised-cut-deficit-half-end-his-first-term/	Lenny Curry, the head of the Republican Party of Florida, said President Barack Obama is going to have a hard time winning Florida, citing gas prices and federal spending as just two reasons. "Obama’s going to come here and spend a lot of money, but President Obama's going to have to run on his record. He's going to have to run on what he promised," said Curry in an interview on Bay News 9’s Political Connections on March 4, 2012. "He promised gasoline I believe at $2.50. When he took office it was about $1.68. We know it's well above $2.50 now. He promised he would cut the deficit in half. We know what's happened there," Curry said. Curry went on to praise Florida Gov. Rick Scott for job creation, saying that Scott showed a clear contrast with the Obama administration. Curry, a businessman from Jacksonville, became head of the state party in September 2011. He was the hand-picked successor of party chairman Dave Bitner, who died after a fight with Lou Gehrig's disease. We wondered if Curry was accurate in describing Obama’s promises to voters, so we decided to check it out. Here at PolitiFact, we take a special interest in the campaign promises of elected officials. We collected Obama’s promises for our Obameter and Scott’s promises for the Scott-O-Meter. Here, we’ll look at whether Obama promised to cut the deficit in half. (In a separate report, we’ll look at whether he promised to keep gasoline prices at $2.50 a gallon.) Our research revealed that Obama did in fact promise to cut the deficit in half. He made the promise not on the campaign trail, but soon after taking office, at a meeting organized by the White House and dubbed the "Fiscal Responsiblity Summit." (The Republican Party of Florida pointed us to this event when we asked them for evidence for Curry’s statement.) Here’s what Obama said at the meeting on Feb. 23, 2009: "Today I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office," Obama said. "Now, this will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay, and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control." The next day, Obama repeated the pledge, this time in an address to a joint session of Congress. "Yesterday I held a fiscal summit where I pledged to cut the deficit in half by the end of my first term in office," he said. Is Obama keeping that promise? In a word, no. In 2009, the year Obama took office, the annual deficit was $1.4 trillion. (Generally speaking, the deficit is the amount the government takes in minus what it spends.) The deficit was a little smaller in 2010 and 2011, but only modestly so, at about $1.3 trillion for each year, according to numbers from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. For 2012, the budget is projected to be $1.1 trillion. The White House’s budget projections show a deficit of $901 billion in 2013, also short of Obama’s goal, even if his policies are enacted by Congress, which is by no means certain. Obama was specifically asked about the promise in an interview in February 2012 with Atlanta’s WAGA-TV. (His campaign pointed us to those comments when we asked for response.) He said he wasn’t able to keep the promise because the economic downturn was much more severe than was commonly understood in 2009. "Well, we're not there because this recession turned out to be a lot deeper than any of us realized. Everybody who is out there back in 2009, if you look back at what their estimates were in terms of how many jobs had been lost, how bad the economy had contracted when I took office, everybody underestimated it. People thought that the economy contracted 3 percent. It turns out it contracted close to 9 percent. … "So, the die had been cast, but a lot of us didn't understand at that point how bad it was going to get. That increases the deficit because less tax revenues come in, and it means that more people are getting unemployment insurance, we're helping states more so they don't lay off teachers, etc. The key, though, is we're setting ourselves on a path where we can get our debt under control. "The most important thing we can do, though, to reduce our debt is to make sure that we continue growing this economy. We’ve seen some recent good news about unemployment numbers coming down, more jobs being created. We’ve got to to maintain that momentum even as we make some tough choices in terms of government spending." Our ruling Back in 2009, shortly after he was inaugurated, Obama did promise to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term. He has not been able to keep that promise, however. Obama said recently the reason for that is the economic downturn was much worse than expected, which in turn drove down tax revenues and drove up spending on things like unemployment and aid to the states. Curry, the head of the Republican Party of Florida, said that Obama "promised he would cut the deficit in half. We know what's happened there." He prefaced it with a simple statement that Obama would have to run on his record. The record supports Curry’s statement, so we rate his statement True.

pomt-06418	﻿﻿"Since Mayor Kennedy O’Brien took office Sayreville has issued 22,081 building permits! Now O’Brien is holding secret meetings with big developers."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/26/new-jersey-democratic-state-committee/sayreville-mayor-kennedy-obrien-blasts-democrats-p/	Building permits, secret meetings and big developers – oh my! Sayreville voters should keep those concerns in mind, if a political mailer circulating in town – complete with marquee-style lettering and an exclamation point or two -- is to be believed. "Since Mayor O’Brien took office Sayreville has issued 22,081 Building Permits! Now O’Brien is Holding Secret Meetings with Big Developers" reads a large postcard mailed to residents in this small Middlesex County borough. The postcard shows a man attempting to climb a small mountain of paperwork – presumably applications to build in the borough. A large headshot of O’Brien, a Republican, is in the background. The postcard states that it’s paid for and authorized by the New Jersey Democratic State Committee. O'Brien is seeking re-election to a four-year term. His opponent is Democrat Stanley Drwal. Although the ad doesn’t specifically state it, the inference from the ad is there’s a lot of building going on under O’Brien’s watch. And building can be a dirty verb in New Jersey. For some people, it means more children in schools, more government services needed and less open space – all costing more tax dollars. PolitiFact New Jersey checked the claims in the ad and found that the number of building permits issued during O’Brien’s 11-year tenure as mayor is correct – but only about 5 percent of those were to construct homes. As for secret meetings? That depends on who’s asked. "This is a personal attack," O’Brien said about the ad. "It’s personal and it’s misleading. They must think the people of Sayreville are stupid. We only have about 11,000 homes in Sayreville." Actually, the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Fact Finder survey for 2010 shows Sayreville has 16,393 housing units. The Census Bureau defines a housing unit as "a house, an apartment, a mobile home or trailer, a group of rooms, or a single room occupied as separate living quarters, or if vacant, intended for occupancy as separate living quarters," spokeswoman Stacey Gimbel Vidal said in an email. An ad doesn’t have to make a specific statement for its intent to be clear, according to Dr. Terry Madonna, a political science professor at Franklin and Marshall College in Lancaster, Pa. "When I look at things I try to look at the whole picture," Madonna said. "What meaning are they trying to convey consciously and subconsciously?" The Democratic State Committee sent an Open Public Records Act request to the borough on Sept. 20, seeking the number of building permits issued in Sayreville from Jan. 1, 2000 to Sept. 20, 2011. O'Brien became mayor in 2000. Kirk Miick, the borough’s construction official and director of code enforcement, said he contacted the organization and asked if a breakdown was wanted of what the permits were for, and was told that just a total number of permits issued was needed. Miick told PolitiFact New Jersey the borough issued 22,081 permits during the requested timeframe but noted that of those, about 1,240 were for new homes – single-family residences, condominiums and townhouses. Another 3,026 were for significant additions or modifications to existing houses, while the rest were permits for demolition work, pools, sheds, fences, warehouses, educational facilities and more. Now, about those "secret" meetings. Jason Springer, communications director for the Democratic State Committee, provided us with copies of news stories and a letter from the Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office relating to a February 2010 incident in which O’Brien showed up at a meeting at the Woodbridge Hilton between Deborah Lee and Robert Kaye of the development firm PRC Group. Lee, an alternate on the Planning Board, was at the meeting as president of the Spinnaker Pointe Homeowners Association. When O’Brien showed up -- unexpectedly, according to Lee -- she asked that the discussion not include matters to be brought before the Planning Board. A portion of the meeting recorded on tape was later found to have been deleted. The Middlesex County Prosecutor’s Office investigated and determined that a crime had been committed – tampering with public records and information -- but had no suspects and closed the investigation without filing criminal charges. The prosecutor’s office then made a number of recommendations about better securing future recordings of public meetings. O’Brien, who owns a sales and marketing agency, said the meeting was not held secretly. O’Brien said he travels frequently for work and often conducts borough business where a meeting is convenient – a practice he has done since he’s been mayor. "If I can meet somebody at a restaurant I’ll meet them at a restaurant, I’ll meet them in a lobby of a hotel on a parkway -- wherever I am and wherever they are, I meet with them, at borough hall and all points in between," he said. O’Brien said Councilwoman Lisa Eicher, a Democrat, filed an ethics complaint against him with the state Department of Community Affairs, regarding the meeting. We checked with the state for the status of the complaint. "For reasons of confidentiality, we can neither confirm nor deny the receipt of an ethics complaint," DCA spokeswoman Lisa Ryan said in an email. "Ethics complaints are only subject to public disclosure 30 days after mailing a notice of dismissal or a notice of violation to the individual named in a complaint and the complainant." We also asked Springer about evidence of other alleged secret meetings that O’Brien supposedly had, since the wording of the mailer indicates more than one, and that such meetings are continuing. "If the Mayor told us he was holding additional secret meetings, they wouldn’t be very secret," Springer responded in an email. "However, one has to assume so, otherwise why would someone go through such great lengths to erase evidence of the first meeting." Springer also questioned the appropriateness of doing borough business outside Sayreville. "Meetings with a developer should take place in Borough Hall, not in a hotel in another town," he said. "The very nature of the meeting, with the surprise appearance of the Mayor was highly inappropriate. And again, if there was nothing to the meeting, why would someone go through such great lengths to erase part of the recording?" Our ruling The Democratic State Committee sent a mailer to Sayreville residents stating more than 22,000 building permits had been issued in the borough during the incumbent mayor’s tenure, and accused him of having secret meetings with big developers. We confirmed that 22,081 permits were issued, but just 5 percent -- 1,240 -- of those were for new home construction. O’Brien says a complaint alleging that an out-of-town meeting he attended in February 2010 was unethical was filed with the state DCA, but the agency will neither confirm nor deny that. A spokesman for the Democrats admits assuming Kennedy is having other "secret" meetings, but there’s no proof of that allegation. Therefore, we rate this claim Mostly False.

The ad starts by showing Obama saying, "I don't take money from oil companies." The Clinton ad's narrator chides Obama for boasting about this when corporations are prohibited by law from donating to political candidates. "But Barack Obama accepted $200,000 from executives and employees of oil companies," the narrator ads. Obama would have been correct if he had said he didn't take money from oil company lobbyists or political action committees. (He did make this point in a later ad, which we found to be Mostly True; see it here .) The ad also is correct that Obama accepted $222,309 from executives and employees of oil companies, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. It's worth noting those donations could be from anyone from the CEO to the janitor. People who donate to political candidates are required to list their occupation and employer. It's important to note that this rule is has far from perfect compliance; sometimes people don't fill it in at all. Clinton doesn't mention the fact that she accepted even more money from executives and employees of oil companies — $309,363, according to the center. And she accepted about $442,800 from energy lobbyists, according to the center, though not all of that is from oil and gas alone. Nevertheless, the ad is correct that Obama did accept money from employees of oil companies, and we rate its statement True.

pomt-14999	Texas has "outstripped the national poverty rate" since "at least 1959."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/oct/12/bee-moorhead/bee-moorhead-says-texas-poverty-rate-has-outstripp/	Texas remains home to a greater share of people in poverty than the nation as a whole, Bee Moorhead wrote in a September 2015, oped article in the Austin American-Statesman. Not news? Well, Moorhead, executive director of the Texas Interfaith Center for Public Policy/Texas Impact, also wrote that according to U.S. Census Bureau figures, "Texas once again outstripped the national poverty rate" in 2014, "as we have done since at least 1959." That’s 56 years--a long time to be better at poverty. We wondered. To our inquiry, Moorhead emailed us a spreadsheet, drawing on bureau figures, indicating that in select years, or each decade from 1959 through 2009, more Texans lived below the federal poverty level, by percentage, than Americans as a whole. According to the figures, which we confirmed on the bureau website, the share of Texans in poverty was greatest in 1959 — 31.7 percent, 9 percentage points greater than the 22.1 percent of Americans nationally in poverty. In the selected years, the smallest gap occurred in 1979 when 14.7 percent of Texans lived in poverty compared with 13.1 percent of Americans overall, according to the figures. Moorhead said she separately drew the 2014 Texas poverty rate (16.4 percent) from a chart fetchable from a bureau web page last updated Sept. 16, 2015. Nationally in 2014, the bureau announced, the poverty rate was 14.8 percent, meaning 46.7 million people lived in poverty. Moorhead also pointed out a bureau website enabling comparisons of poverty in a state to the nation each decade from 1960 through 2010, leading us to develop this Texas-U.S. comparison: SOURCE: Web page, "Poverty Rates by County, 1960-2010," U.S. Census Bureau (accessed Oct. 7, 2015) Measuring poverty Through the bureau, the federal government has estimated residents living in poverty for more than 50 years, initially from a U.S. Department of Agriculture estimate of how much income that families under economic stress needed in order to put food on the table. How the government defines poverty has changed a bit over the years, but generally, the bureau says, it "uses a set of money income thresholds that vary by family size and composition to determine who is in poverty. If a family's total income is less than the family's threshold, then that family and every individual in it is considered in poverty." The thresholds don’t vary by location, the bureau says, but are updated for inflation. The poverty definition rolls in income before taxes and does not include capital gains or noncash benefits (such as public housing, Medicaid, and food stamps), the bureau says. Each year’s national poverty estimates derive from the bureau’s Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Survey, which surveys about 100,000 households a year, asking about income from more than 50 sources, according to the bureau. An expert’s look Moorhead did not delve into poverty rates for every year from 1959 on, so we asked Daniel Dillon of the University of Texas Child and Family Research Partnership for a look. Drawing from CPS data, he put together a chart suggesting the Texas poverty rate exceeded the national rate each year from 1959 through 2014. But Dillon and bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein told us that comparative year-by-year figures start only in 1980. Since 1980, Dillon summed up, the Texas poverty rate "has generally bounced between 15 percent and 17 percent with a few exceptions. The fact that is it so consistent means that the rate of growth in the general population is basically on par with the rate of growth in the poor population. Sometimes they don’t change at the same rate though, like after the recession, where the number of poor shot up but population growth was stable. This caused the poverty rate to increase. So the poverty rate is reflecting the interplay between total population change and poor population change, the latter of which is generally more affected by fluctuations in the economy." Big picture: The 4.4 million Texans in poverty in 2014 was double the 2.2 million residents in poverty in 1980, Dillon noted. In the period, the state’s total population increased 87 percent, escalating from 14.3 million to 26.7 million, he noted. Dillon pointed out there were times the gap between poverty in Texas and the nation narrowed, including 2014. Broadly, he wrote, the gap grew through the 1980s until about 1988, at which point it peaked at a difference of 5 percentage points. Then the gap began to narrow, he wrote, expanding and contracting every few years until 2010 when it began to close. "In 2014, Texas had a poverty rate 1.6 percentage points above the national rate," Dillon said. "That’s the closest we have been to the national rate since 1984, when the gap was 1.3 percentage points." Several factors, Dillon said, explain why Texas has consistently had a bigger chunk of residents in poverty than the nation on average. The state is home to a larger foreign-born population than most states and is one of a few minority-majority states in that non-Hispanic whites make up a minority of the residents, he wrote. "In comparison to their numbers, minority groups in Texas tend to be overrepresented among the poor. Education level is also strongly linked to poverty status, and Texas is the near the bottom when it comes to the percentage of the adult population with a high school degree," Dillon said. "Finally, Texas has a higher percentage of children than most states and child poverty has been on the rise. Today, a quarter of Texas children live below the poverty line." Dillon said the narrowing gap between the Texas and national poverty rates might be explained by the state generally growing faster than most states due both to new births and migration from other places. "As long as the mix of people moving to Texas are more likely to be above the poverty line than below it, this will drive the poverty rate down. Similarly, if births to non-poor families outpace those to poor families, this will also drive the rate down," Dillon wrote. Another indicator We also asked Lori Taylor, a Texas A&M University economist, to evaluate Moorhead’s claim. By phone, Taylor said that while it’s likely the Texas poverty rate has consistently outpaced the national rate, on average, it’s worth mention that the rate has always been calculated by assuming the same income levels put residents in poverty regardless of location. She said this has tended to lead to overstatements of people in poverty in lower cost-of-living parts of the country and understatements of residents in poverty in high-cost areas. Taylor and a colleague pointed out in a December 2014 article that in 2013, per the government's poverty threshold, a family of four with two children and a household income of $23,624 was classified as poor regardless of whether the family lived in rural Arkansas, where a typical two-bedroom apartment rents for less than $600, or in New York, where a two-bedroom apartment rents for more than $1,400. In the past few years, the census bureau has been developing its Supplemental Poverty Measure, which reaches its rates by taking into account regional differences in housing costs. And, Taylor noted, the bureau found in its 2013 surveys that Texas and the U.S. had the same 15.9 percent SPM rate. In contrast, the general 2013 poverty rate for the country was 14.8 percent and the Texas rate was 16.9 percent. By phone, Moorhead agreed that "using a standard measure" of poverty "across the country is insufficient to characterize the complexity of regional economies." But the SPM is a new measure too, she said, and rates haven’t been calculated retroactively to cover nearly all the years included in her Texas-U.S. comparison. Our ruling Moorhead said Texas has "outstripped the national poverty rate" since "at least 1959." Available poverty rates for select years through 1979 and for 1980 through 2014 back up this statement. Yet poverty rates don’t appear to be available for many earlier years. Also, a new supplemental poverty measure makes a case for the same share of Texans and Americans lately living in poverty provided regional differences in housing costs are factored in. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-14057	Ohio is "probably top five in the country, sadly, in terms of heroin overdoses. It’s now exceeded car accidents as the No. 1 cause of death in Ohio."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2016/may/23/rob-portman/portman-drug-overdoses-exceeded-car-accidents-no-1/	Here’s something on which liberals and conservatives can agree: Heroin is bad. The epidemic of drug overdoses has captured media attention on a national scale, and Ohio Sen. Rob Portman is using it to his political advantage. The Republican senator, up for re-election in a tight race, has taken to every platform to push his proposed anecdote, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act. The measure, which provides funding for a range of addiction prevention and treatment services, passed in the Senate on March 10. Since then, Portman has spoken about the issue weekly on the Senate floor, on national news networks, and on syndicated radio with pundit Hugh Hewitt. As Hewitt’s guest May 17, Portman said, "We’re probably top five in the country, sadly, in terms of heroin overdoses. It’s now exceeded car accidents as the No. 1 cause of death in Ohio." The epidemic seems like it can’t be overstated. But Portman did just that with the omission of a couple of key words. We checked with the Portman campaign, and they linked us to an Ohio Health Department report, 2014 Ohio Drug Overdose Data: General Findings, which counted 2,531 unintentional drug overdoses in 2014, the highest number on record for Ohio. The report said that opioids (prescribed drugs, heroin and fentanyl) were the driving factor behind unintentional drug overdoses in Ohio. The very first line of the report explores how that stacks up to other injury-related deaths. It reads, "Unintentional drug overdose continued to be the leading cause of injury-related death in Ohio in 2014, ahead of motor vehicle traffic crashes — a trend which began in 2007." According to Melanie Amato, the department’s spokesperson, the categorization of "injury-related" deaths includes incidents such as fatal falls, car accidents, drownings, homicides, and unintentional overdoses. "Injury-related" is an important distinction. There are a lot of ways to die that aren’t classified as injury-related. Portman is missing those two key words. We found data from the Centers for Disease Control that determine actual leading cause of death in Ohio in 2014. We made this chart using the agency’s mortality statistics: (Amato explained that the CDC’s number of drug deaths is higher than the health department’s by 213 deaths because the CDC’s definition of "drug poisoning" doesn’t distinguish between intentional and unintentional overdoses. The Ohio Department of Health counts intentional overdoses separately, as suicides.) Nationally, CDC data shows that Ohio ranks fifth for states with the most heroin overdose deaths, behind West Virginia, New Mexico, New Hampshire and Kentucky. That means Portman was right about the Buckeye State being in the top five. Portman has used the comparison between lethal overdoses and car crashes before. We scoured his press releases and videotaped statements for other references to the statistic, and found it in at least two more places. Portman got it right on April 7, on the Senate floor, when he said, "Since 2007, drug overdoses have killed more people in Ohio than any other cause of accidental death, surpassing car accidents." But another occasion in the Senate, on May 12, he again said, "The No. 1 cause of death now in my home state of Ohio is not car accidents anymore. It is overdoses. It’s overdoses from prescription drugs and heroin." Our ruling Portman said Ohio is "probably top five in the country, sadly, in terms of heroin overdoses. It’s now exceeded car accidents as the No. 1 cause of death in Ohio." He has a point about Ohio having the fifth-most drug overdose deaths in the nation for 2014. But he forgot two key words that make an important distinction about the types of deaths he is counting: "injury related." CDC data shows that when you count long-term health problems such as cancer and heart disease, drug poisoning is eighth on the list of things killing Ohioans. We rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/26d5d9db-60af-4803-8aa0-97e95b4e64ba	None	Rob Portman	None	None	None	2016-05-23T14:05:24	2016-05-17	['Ohio']
pomt-13338	Donald Trump would "engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/05/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-mostly-false-donald-trumps-social-securi/	During the vice presidential debate, Tim Kaine deployed a longstanding Democratic talking point against his Republican rivals -- that Republicans can’t wait to privatize Social Security. Kaine said, "Here's what Hillary (Clinton) and I will not do. And I want to make this very plain. We will never, ever engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security. Donald Trump wrote a book and he said Social Security is a Ponzi scheme and privatization would be good for all of us." Pence’s response was that "all Donald Trump and I have said about Social Security is we're going to meet our obligations to our seniors. That's it." Kaine countered, "Go read the book." Kaine’s wording was careful, but he left a clear impression that Trump would privatize the retirement program while Kaine and Clinton would protect the existing system. As it turns out, Kaine is on target with the reference to a Ponzi scheme in Trump’s book. But it’s a big stretch for Kaine to use a 16-year-old book as evidence that the Trump-Pence ticket would "engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security." A primer on privatization As we’ve noted before, Social Security benefits for today’s recipients come from the proceeds of payroll taxes paid by younger and middle-aged workers. But over the years, some conservatives have pushed for turning Social Security into a system where workers invest at least a portion of their money to provide for retirement. The upside, supporters argue, is retirement nest eggs could be much higher, given that historical rates of return from private investments are higher than those for Social Security. The downside is the possibility of market losses. Even though Social Security funds would likely be invested more conservatively than many private investments, doing so would still carry risk that beneficiaries could lose value or, in a worst-case scenario, see their savings wiped out entirely. Neither outcome is possible under the current Social Security program. The most high-profile proposal along these lines came in 2005, when President George W. Bush floated a plan to allow workers under 55 to invest a portion of their Social Security taxes into "personal retirement accounts." Even though Republicans controlled Congress at the time, the idea never gathered much steam, and it died without even being introduced as legislation. A few years after that, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. -- who would in 2012 become the running mate for GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney and now serves as House speaker -- offered a similar proposal, allowing workers under 55 to begin investing a portion of their Social Security taxes in a series of funds managed by the government. This idea also went nowhere in Congress. These two failures reinforced the longstanding conventional wisdom that changing the way Social Security operates is the "third rail" of politics (that is, touch it and you die). This opposition to change is particularly strong among older voters, who are both reliant on Social Security and who tend to vote at higher-than-average rates. For this reason, Social Security-themed attack ads have been prevalent over the years, often aired by Democrats, though sometimes by Republicans. Attacks against plans such as Bush’s and Ryan’s have often played up the term "privatization" as a scary concept -- so much so that supporters of this type of proposal have taken pains to distance their plans from that terminology. Trump’s book In Trump’s 2000 book, The America We Deserve, he directly compares Social Security to a Ponzi scheme. "The workers of America have been forced to invest a sixth of our wages into a huge Ponzi scheme," Trump writes at one point. "The pyramids are made of papier-mache." He also wrote in the book, according to BuzzFeed, "This is the second year Social Security benefits have been paid. The first recipients of Social Security, even once inflation was factored in, got the equivalent of a 36.5 percent annual interest rate on their initial contributions into the Social Security Trust Fund. For those retiring in 1956, their inflation-adjusted rate of return was still a respectable 12 percent. Julie Kosterlitz, in the National Journal, compares that figure with this: For those who are working now and looking to retire after 2015, their returns will be below 2 percent. And that’s if they ever get paid at all. Does the name Ponzi all of a sudden come to mind?" In his book, Trump proposed allowing "every American to dedicate some portion of their payroll taxes to a personal Social Security account that they could own and invest in stocks and bonds. Federal guidelines could make sure that your money is diversified, that it is invested in sound mutual funds or bond funds, and not in emu ranches." So Kaine has a point that Trump once supported partial privatization of Social Security and called it a Ponzi scheme. But that was 16 years ago, and the Clinton campaign did not provide us with any more recent evidence after the debate concluded. So what about Trump’s position today? Trump's views on Social Security as a candidate As we’ve reported, Trump has been somewhat unusual among major Republicans in flatly rejecting any calls for entitlement reform, including Social Security. He’s also been fairly consistent during the campaign -- a statement we can’t make about other policy issues. In September 2015, he said on CBS’ 60 Minutes, "What I want to do is take money back from other countries that are killing us and I want to save Social Security. And we’re going to save it without increases. We’re not going to raise the age and it will be just fine." He told a crowd in Georgia in February, "We're gonna save your Social Security without making any cuts. Mark my words." He also responded to a June AARP questionnaire on making Social Security solvent in the future by essentially focusing on economic reforms, and didn’t mention any proposals to change the structure of the entitlement program. "If we are able to grow the economy, increase the tax base, bring capital and jobs back to the United States and encourage foreign direct investment, we will shore up our entitlement programs for the time being," he said. Our ruling Kaine said that Trump would "engage in a risky scheme to privatize Social Security." Kaine cited an old stance, but it needs updating. Back in 2000, Trump did support privatization and call Social Security a Ponzi scheme. But now, 16 years later, Trump has offered relatively vague -- but relatively consistent -- statements that support keeping the structure of the program as is, without enacting changes as significant as private accounts. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f5ba48df-5efa-48ca-aa2d-4104c36b02e3	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2016-10-05T00:43:00	2016-10-04	['None']

pomt-12844	"Not a single Democrat opposed Neil Gorsuch's confirmation in 2006."	true	/florida/statements/2017/feb/03/mitch-mcconnell/democrats-didnt-object-neil-gorsuchs-2006-confirma/	Republican leaders say Democrats are being hypocritical to come out swinging against Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch when they supported him in his previous judicial confirmation. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is one of the Republicans who rushed to support Gorsuch after President Donald Trump nominated Gorsuch on Jan. 31. "Not a single Democrat opposed #NeilGorsuch’s confirmation in 2006," McConnell tweeted Feb. 1. "I hope & expect that all senators will again give him fair consideration." McConnell’s general point is correct: the Senate confirmed Gorsuch for a court of appeals seat by unanimous consent in 2006. That means there was no roll call vote, but news articles at the time show no dissent in the Senate. (Our fact-checking friends at Snopes previously looked at similar claims.) Gorsuch in 2006 Gorsuch was nominated by President George W. Bush on May 10, 2006, for a seat on the U.S. Courts of Appeals for the 10th Circuit based in Colorado. His nomination drew scant media attention and few comments from senators. On the day his name was announced, the Democratic senator from Colorado, Ken Salazar, didn’t instantly commit to backing him but offered early praise: "I have recently met with Mr. Gorsuch and believe he has impressive credentials." The Denver Post wrote that Gorsuch glided through a 20-minute Senate Judiciary Committee hearing June 21. Salazar and Colorado’s Republican senator, Wayne Allard, "introduced Gorsuch, both giving glowing reviews," the Post wrote. That committee approved Gorsuch by a voice vote on July 13. When Gorsuch moved on to the full Senate July 20, Salazar had more praise for the "intelligent, thoughtful and appreciative" nominee, saying Gorsuch met a "very high test" to join the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals. U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, opened his remarks in an earlier hearing by saying Gorsuch's record showed he "appears to be a very conservative nominee." But before the Senate July 20, Leahy was on board with the nomination of Gorsuch and three other nominees: "I am pleased that the Republican leadership has scheduled debate and consideration of these nominations and am glad that the Republican leadership is taking notice of the fact that we can cooperate on swift consideration and confirmation of nominations. Working together, we can confirm four judges today. " A transcript of the July 20 Senate meeting shows no senator objected to Gorsuch and he was confirmed in a voice vote. (When the vote happened, one person is heard saying "aye" and no one objected.) McConnell’s spokesman Don Stewart said that any member could have gone on record with an objection but none did. "The Congressional Record lists no objections," he said. "There was unanimous consent to the vote." Republicans have noted that Democrats in the Senate at the time include some major party heavyweights: Chuck Schumer, Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Harry Reid. However, the majority of current senators were not in the Senate in 2006. And the stakes now are higher, says Sarah Binder, George Washington University political science professor. "Senators may view the prospects of confirming a nominee to the court of appeals differently than they view a nominee for the Supreme Court," she said. "The stakes of confirming someone to the Supreme Court are really just so much higher and more salient to the public. Senators should scrutinize any lifetime appointment to the bench -- but especially those to the Supreme Court." Many judicial nominees have sailed through confirmation by unanimous consent or in a unanimous roll call vote. But the process has become more acrimonious in recent years, and roll call votes became more common under the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Binder said that recorded roll call votes on appellate court nominees were very rare before 1997. "Starting in late 1990s, Republicans in the Senate majority started to call for recorded votes as a way to put senators on record for or against Bill Clinton's judicial nominees," she said. "Since then, recorded votes have been more likely (as have cloture votes on those nominees)." Russell Wheeler, a judicial expert at the Brookings Institution, pulled together data on circuit court nominations during the presidencies of Clinton, Bush and Obama using the U.S. Senate website, the Federal Judicial Center’s Biographical Directory of Federal Judges, Congress’s "Presidential Nominations" website, and Congressional Record reports. During Bush’s tenure when Gorsuch was confirmed, Wheeler’s data shows 12 circuit court nominees confirmed through voice votes and 30 through roll call votes that were unanimous. There were three confirmation votes in which there was only one "no" vote and 14 in which there were multiple "no" votes. Decades ago it was common for nominations to sail through without objections from the opposing party, "but things have gotten more contentious," Wheeler said. Our ruling McConnell said, "Not a single Democrat opposed Neil Gorsuch's confirmation in 2006." Gorsuch was approved by unanimous consent by the Senate for a court of appeals seat during Bush’s presidency. That means no roll call vote was required, but senators could have raised objections but none did. The majority of circuit court confirmations under Bush occurred through unanimous consent or by a roll call vote that was unanimous.

pomt-13654	Says he saw videotape "of the people taking the money off the plane" to pay ransom to Iran for hostages.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/05/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-he-didnt-see-video-cash-being-tr/	For two days, Donald Trump told rally audiences a detailed account of seeing video footage of stacks of cash being taken off an airplane, destined to pay Iran for the release of American hostages. Now, even Trump acknowledges that such video footage doesn’t exist. The issue emerged because news reports suggested that a $400 million cash payment from the U.S. government amounted to ransom for hostages held by Iran. Republicans have charged that a quid pro quo ran counter to longstanding U.S. policy not to pay ransom for hostages. The White House has responded that the payments were the conclusion of a decades-old dispute over funds frozen after the fall of the Shah of Iran and were not a ransom. But questions surrounding Trump’s depiction of video footage has distracted from the substantive policy dispute over whether and how such a payment should have been made. Almost from the moment Trump mentioned seeing the video, skeptics wondered whether it actually existed, because none had been publicly released. So what actually happened? What Trump said Trump addressed this topic at two different rallies. The first was an Aug. 3 rally in Daytona Beach, Fla. Here’s what he said: "I got up this morning, and I pick up the papers, and then I turn on the news, and I see $400 million being shipped in cash, they didn’t want dollars, it’s in different currencies, and it's being shipped overnight to Iran -- $400 million. … I look, and I'll never forget the scene this morning. And remember this: Iran -- I don't think you've heard this anywhere, but here -- Iran provided all of that footage, the tape, of taking that money off that airplane, right? $400 million in cash. … And they have a perfect tape done by obviously a government camera and the tape is of the people taking the money off the plane, right? That means that in order to embarrass us further, Iran sent us the tapes, right? It's a military tape. It's a tape that was a perfect angle, nice and steady. Nobody getting nervous because they're going to be shot because they're shooting a picture of money pouring off a plane." The next day, he held a rally in Portland, Maine. He said this: "You saw that with the airplane coming in. Nice plane. And the airplane coming in. And the money coming off, I guess. Right? That was given to us, has to be, by the Iranians. You know why the tape was given to us? Because they want to embarrass our country. They want to embarrass our country. And they want to embarrass our president, because we have a president who's incompetent." Trump certainly makes it sound as if there’s video footage of the cash being hustled off a plane, and that he’s seen that footage. The backtrack But before the second rally was even held, his campaign had already backed off that claim. The Washington Post reported that late on Aug. 3 -- which was after the Daytona Beach event but before the Portland event -- Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks responded to an email "that asked if the footage Trump was referencing was actually widely shown video of a private plane landing in Switzerland in January with three American prisoners who had just been released by Iran, including Washington Post reporter Jason Rezaian." According to the Post, Hicks responded in an email, "Yes. Merely the b-roll footage included in every broadcast." (B-roll is a television industry term for pre-recorded videotape spliced into a live report.) Still, Trump went out and made the remarks again. After the second rally, Trump himself tweeted that he was referring to a different piece of video. "The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran!" In other words, Trump had seen widely reported video footage of the hostages being released, but described it in some detail -- and incorrectly -- as showing stacks of money being unloaded from a plane. Here’s a still from the footage of the hostage transfer that was aired on U.S. television. A final note On Aug. 5, several hours after Trump’s tweet, conservative websites including the Washington Free Beacon posted footage from what it called an Iranian documentary aired earlier this year in Iran. During a discussion of the hostage transfer, the documentary showed a brief image of a stack of pallets. According to the Free Beacon, "The footage is part of a February documentary published by Iran’s Tasnim News Agency, which is affiliated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps. The documentary purported to reveal behind-the-scenes details of the negotiations with the United States to free the American hostages. It maintains the negotiations were tied up in efforts to push the Iran nuclear agreement forward as it moved towards implementation." The pallets in the footage are partially obscured, and it is too blurry to tell for sure whether these pallets hold piles of currency. "Iran experts who spoke to the Washington Free Beacon said that it is impossible to verify if the images show the same pallets of cash transferred by the Obama administration," the Free Beacon reported. We checked with the Trump campaign to learn whether this was actually the video he was referring to, even though it didn’t show money "pouring" off a plane and even though it had not aired on U.S. news channels. We did not hear back. For now, we are going by Trump’s own statement, backed up by Hicks’ statement, that he was referring to a different video -- the widely aired footage that shows the hostages being released, without any money being transferred. Our ruling Trump said he had seen videotape "of the people taking the money off the plane" to pay ransom to Iran for hostages. He and his campaign now acknowledge that they were referring to a different video -- of the hostages themselves being freed -- that did not include any transfer of money from a plane.

pomt-00017	"This election marks the largest Senate gains for a president's party in a first midterm election since at least President Kennedy's in 1962."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-right-history-behind-republicans-sena/	President Donald Trump, taking stock of the election results during a White House press conference, downplayed Democrats’ retaking of the House and highlighted GOP gains in the Senate. Republicans flipped at least three Senate seats last night, with races in Arizona and Florida still too close to call (Republicans are ahead in the votes counted). Republicans lost a seat it held in Nevada. In Mississippi, a Republican and Democrat are headed to a Nov. 27 runoff, where the Republican is favored. So, as we write this, Republicans have 51 seats in the Senate and are likely to add one more in Mississippi. The number can grow to 54 if the races in Arizona and Florida stay the GOP’s way. Trump, who campaigned vigorously for a handful of Republican candidates in tight races, sought to highlight the historical significance of his party’s Senate wins. "This election marks the largest Senate gains for a president's party in a first midterm election since at least President Kennedy's in 1962," Trump said. Trump’s read of historical election tallies depends on the outcome of the outstanding outcomes in Mississippi, Arizona and Florida. Net gains scarce Few presidents’ first midterm elections in modern American political history have yielded Senate gains for the president’s party. Part of the equation in this particular election was that Democrats’ were disadvantaged by the fact that they were defending more seats than Republicans. That included 10 states Trump won handily in the 2016 presidential election. It’s also not unprecedented that the House and Senate end up split between two parties following a midterm. Still, it’s fairly unusual for a president’s party to notch a net gain in the Senate during a president’s first midterm, as the data from 538.com below shows: YEAR PRESIDENT SENATE NET LOSS/GAIN BY PRESIDENT’S PARTY 2018 Donald Trump (R) +0-3 2010 Barack Obama (D) -6 2002 George W. Bush (R) +2 1994 Bill Clinton (D) -8 1990 George H.W. Bush (R) -1 1982 Ronald Reagan (R) +1 1978 Jimmy Carter (D) -3 1974 Gerald Ford (R) -4 1970 Richard Nixon (R) +1 1966 Lyndon Johnson (D) -3 1962 John F. Kennedy (D) +4 1954 Dwight D. Eisenhower (R) -2 1946 Harry S Truman (D) -11 1934 Franklin D. Roosevelt (D) +9 No matter how things turn out, Trump’s party fared much better in the Senate than Democrats did during President Barack Obama’s first midterm election, which he famously conceded was a "shellacking." But the outstanding elections will determine if Trump’s claim is ultimately correct. President George W. Bush saw Republicans net two Senate seats in 2002, while President Richard Nixon and Republicans gained one seat in 1970, according to 538.com. If the results hold and Republicans win in Mississippi, Florida and Arizona, Trump would be correct that Republicans’ Senate gains in the 2018 midterms (+3) represent the largest first midterm Senate pickup since President John F. Kennedy’s Democratic party gained four seats in 1962. Those races are not yet called, though. While Republicans are in a better position in all three states, Trump is counting gains that are not yet certain. We rate statements based on what's known at the time they were made.

pomt-09038	Says state Rep. Jim Keffer, a GOP lieutenant to House Speaker Joe Straus, "did mail pieces for Democrat Mark Strama to help him defeat" a Republican.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/jul/05/david-barton/gops-david-barton-says-republican-legislator-did-a/	In an open letter distributed June 12 to delegates to the Republican Party of Texas convention, former party vice chairman David Barton of Aledo depicts Texas House Speaker Joe Straus, a San Antonio Republican, as part of a Democrat-friendly cabal that needs to be shaped up or shipped out. Barton’s letter excoriates instances of Republican House members pitching in to help Democrats win re-election. An excerpt: “Straus Republican lieutenant Jim Keffer did mail pieces for Democrat Mark Strama to help him defeat his Republican opponent.” Keffer hails from Eastland, some 160 miles northwest of Austin, whose legislative delegation includes Strama. Did a rural Republican really back the re-election of an urban colleague from the other party? When we asked for elaboration, Barton shared copies of what he said were two political leaflets from a Strama re-election campaign. One of the documents includes pro-Strama quotations from former State Comptroller John Sharp, a Democrat; the Democrat-leaning Austin Chronicle; a resident of Strama’s district and Keffer, who’s quoted saying: “Mark Strama serves his district, not any one political party.” In the other document, Sharp and Keffer are also featured. Keffer is quoted saying Strama “worked with Republicans to cut property taxes and keep our public schools open. We don't always agree on every issue, but we agree on the need to put the interests of Texas ahead of partisan politics.” Responding to our query, Keffer confirmed he’d given Strama a hand, saying: “Whether you’ve got an R or a D behind your name doesn’t mean you are most qualified.” Finally, we contacted Strama, who told us by e-mail that Keffer, who had authored school funding legislaton that Strama co-sponsored, “didn’t ‘do’ mail pieces in the sense of paying for them,” but agreed to be quoted in a mailer “funded by my campaign about my bipartisan approach to the school finance bill.” Though Strama paid for the campaign materials, Keffer willingly helped out his Democratic colleague.

pomt-04335	Says 55 percent of council members have come from area where only 10 percent of Austinites live.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/oct/25/gonzalo-barrientos/gonzalo-barrientos-says-55-council-members-come-ar/	As voters began choosing between two approaches to electing the Austin City Council, Gonzalo Barrientos urged them to look at local history. "Since 1971, City Council members have been elected through a system that encourages unequal representation -- 10 percent of the population lives in an area that receives 55 percent of the representation," he wrote in an opinion piece that ran in the Austin American-Statesman on Oct. 22, 2012, the day early voting started for the Nov. 6 election. Barrientos, who long represented Austin in the Texas House and Senate, asked readers to support the plan offered by Austinites for Geographic Representation, which collected more than 20,000 petition signatures to get it on the ballot where it now faces a competing proposal from Mayor Lee Leffingwell and other council members, according to a Sept. 15, 2012, Statesman news story. The group’s "10-1" proposal would switch the council from seven members elected citywide to 10 members elected within smaller districts and the mayor elected citywide, according to an Oct. 4, 2012, Statesman news story. The competing "8-2-1" proposal would set up eight district representatives and two citywide seats plus the mayor, the story said. Barrientos’ statement could be read as implying that leaders who are elected citywide actually represent only the interests of the area where they live, a contention that we don't find factually checkable. So we looked into his declared percentages. He told us by phone that he relied on information from Peck Young, who according to the Sept. 15 Statesman story leads the Geographic Representation group and has advocated for district representation since the 1970s. Young told us in a phone interview that the group was hungry for data on this topic last year as it researched proposals. The information behind Barrientos’ statement, he said, came from a map and research that appeared Aug. 4, 2011, on an investigative reporting website, The Austin Bulldog. Young’s group spot-checked the data against city records, found it reliable and "ran with it," he said. Separately, Austin city demographer Ryan Robinson told us he also found the research, compiled by Bulldog editor Ken Martin, to be reliable: "He really did his due diligence." From 1971 through 2011, Young said, 55 percent of Austin’s elected officials lived in four ZIP codes -- 78701, 78703, 78731 and 78759. The 10 percent population figure, he said, was derived from the 2010 Census totals for Austin and for those four ZIP codes. The Bulldog’s description of its research said, "This map indicates where every person who served on the Austin City Council from 1971 through 2011 lived at the time they were elected." The Bulldog report said its research started with 1971 because that was the year voters started electing the mayor. Previously, mayors were chosen by council votes. That gave a total of 17 mayors and 100 council members, according to the Bulldog analysis, which argued that Austin power has been too concentrated in select areas. "Forty-nine of those seats were won by people who lived in West and Northwest Austin," the Bulldog said. We spot-checked a dozen addresses shown in the Bulldog’s interactive map and found only minor discrepancies. For instance, former Council Member Brigid Shea told us by telephone that she moved from the French Place neighborhood, which has the 78722 ZIP code, to the 78701 address shown for her by the Bulldog about two years into her council term. The Bulldog website asks that readers send notice of any mistakes they spot; we make the same request. For more detail, Young pointed us to Martin, who founded the Bulldog in 2010 after journalism jobs including editor of the Austin Business Journal and past founder-owner of a City Hall news service, InFact Daily. Martin told us in a phone interview that his starting point was a similar project that city demographer Robinson worked on in the 2000s. He supplemented that information with more city records and candidate financial statements, interviews and historical materials including old Austin phonebooks, Martin said. According to his data, which he called up on his computer and crunched for us during the interview, those four ZIP codes accounted for 58 of the 117 city offices filled in Austin elections (City Council including mayor) from 1971 through 2011. That divides out to 49.6 percent, not 55 percent. We asked Young for help clarifying the discrepancy, and he sent us calculations that he said were made by a volunteer during the group’s research. From that spreadsheet, it appears mayors were double-counted by adding the number of mayors to the number of "council members," a category that in Martin’s data already included mayors. If mayors are double-counted, our math shows a result of 54.9 percent; if the mayors are, properly, counted once, we get 49.6 percent. Young said the double-counting explanation seemed likely to him. "You and Ken may have found out my young person, who was a college student, had made a boo-boo," he said. But, he said, "58 is still half of all city elected officials that have come from these four ZIP codes in 40 years. So our basic point is still true even if our math is faulty." We also wondered whether the cited ZIP codes had been home to 10 percent of Austinites throughout those decades. Geographic Representation group spokeswoman Jessica Ellison said their research was limited to 2010 because they didn’t have Census numbers for all 40 years. Barrientos’ statement could be read as applying to the entire period, though, so we decided to check as best we could. A 2010 U.S. Census Bureau breakdown of the nation’s most populous cities gave Austin’s population as 790,390. So a tenth would be 79,390. Beginning in 2000, the Census Bureau has used ZIP Code Tabulation Areas rather than ZIP codes for its calculations, in order to have clearly defined boundaries that didn’t move as postal delivery logistics changed. An individual ZCTA (which the Census Bureau says you should pronounce ZIK-tah) is roughly equivalent, though not identical, to its corresponding ZIP code. The 2010 counts for ZCTAs corresponding to the four ZIP codes are: 78701 population 6,841; 78703 population 19,690; 78731 population 24,614; and 78759 population 38,891. These add up to 90,036 people, or 11.4 percent of Austin’s 2010 population. Robinson and Census librarian Asheleigh Perry told us the city and the Census Bureau Library don’t have 1970-1990 Austin populations by ZIP code. We did find on the Census website the 2000 ZCTA counts that correspond to the 2010 numbers above. Those totals are: 78701 population 3,855; 78703 population 19,585; 78731 population 24,059; and 78759 population 1,530. That adds up to 49,029; divide by Austin’s 2000 population of 656,562 and you get 7.5 percent -- an even smaller slice of the city than in 2010. Population numbers aside, Robinson told us he believed the overall point is valid: Council members "have indeed come from a concentrated part of the city," he said. "The distribution of mayors over time has been even more concentrated." Our ruling Barrientos wrote, "10 percent of the population lives in an area that receives 55 percent of the representation," citing the system in place since 1971. Young later specified that the area is four ZIP codes. Leaving out the implication that officials only advocate for their home neighborhoods, the 55 percent calculation is slightly off due to a double-counting of mayors. All told, it looks like 50 percent of Austin’s council members (including mayors) have come from those ZIPs over the past four decades. In 2010, the ZIPs were home to 11 percent of the city’s population; in 2000, the ZIPs were home to 7 percent of the city’s population, arguably reinforcing Barrientos’ point. We rate Barrientos’ statement Mostly True.	None	Gonzalo Barrientos	None	None	None	2012-10-25T15:36:56	2012-10-22	['None']

pomt-02547	Says President Barack Obama’s health care law is "expected to destroy 2.3 million jobs."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/05/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-obamacare-expected-destroy-23-mi/	Ever since President Barack Obama shepherded the Affordable Care Act to enactment, critics have called the health care law a job killer. Now, many of the critics are saying that a new report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office proves their point. The CBO estimated that by 2017, there would be the equivalent of about 2 million fewer workers than there would be in the absence of the law. CBO said that number would grow to about 2.5 million by 2024. Shortly after the report was released on Feb. 4, 2014, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, joined many Republicans and conservatives in highlighting this finding via social media. Boehner tweeted, "Pres. Obama’s #hcr law expected to destroy 2.3 million jobs http://on.wsj.com/1kM33oN via @WSJ." (Wonk alert: #hcr is shorthand for "health care reform.) In short order, Democrats and liberal commentators took issue with such characterizations, saying Obama’s critics were misreading the report. A full-fledged war of facts and spin ensued. We have addressed previous CBO projections of this sort and found reasons to be skeptical of interpretations like Boehner’s. The key problem here is that claims by Boehner -- and other critics -- overlook the difference between workers and jobs, and Boehner was misleading when he used the word "destroyed." He made it sound as if jobs are going away because businesses don’t create them or because they eliminate existing jobs. The CBO report, though, was referring to workers who decide on their own to leave the workforce. The CBO figured that, when presented with new options for purchasing health insurance outside their job, millions of people would decide they don’t need to work as much. "Workers who now have access to less expensive health insurance through Medicaid or with refundable federal tax credits that help them pay for premiums will not want to work such long hours after the ACA becomes fully implemented," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. The CBO estimated that Obamacare would "reduce the total number of hours worked, on net, by about 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent during the period from 2017 to 2024, almost entirely because workers will choose to supply less labor — given the new taxes and other incentives they will face and the financial benefits some will receive." This would equal a "decline in the number of full-time-equivalent workers of about 2.0 million in 2017, rising to about 2.5 million in 2024," the report continued. These changes, CBO said, would not result in "an increase in unemployment (that is, more workers seeking but not finding jobs) or underemployment (such as part-time workers who would prefer to work more hours per week)." To be clear, the report predicts that total employment will still rise. It just won’t rise as much as it would if the ACA did not exist. Another key point: The CBO did not specify how many of the 2 million figure would include full-time positions, as compared to cases of an employee keeping their job but working fewer hours, or keeping one job while quitting a separate, part-time job. In some ways, a drop in the number of people who feel the need to work actually could be a boon to the unemployed. As we’ve noted, there are about three job seekers for every job vacancy in today’s economy -- a high ratio by historical standards. Some of these people could pick up the slack once vacancies open up -- and they should be able to, since CBO said it didn’t expect a major change in companies’ demand for workers. In essence, you’d be trading workers unhappy to be working for those who are desperate to be working. "Unemployed workers who really need to find jobs to support their families, rather than to obtain health coverage, will find it easier to get jobs," Burtless said. "After all, they will not face as much competition from the workers who were mainly remaining in the labor force to get a job with health coverage." We see a few problems with Boehner’s phrasing -- that the law is "expected to destroy 2.3 million jobs." (We have no quarrel with the 2.3 million figure; it’s the mid-point between 2.0 million and 2.5 million.) The first problem is the word "destroy." It’s inaccurate because it suggests that CBO says employers will be making 2.3 million layoffs. That's not correct -- the reduction will come primarily from voluntary choices by workers, not by by employers, the CBO said. The second problem is the word "jobs." Using that word glosses over the fact that CBO didn’t cite a number of jobs that will be reduced; it referred to full-time-equivalents of jobs. That may sound like a technical distinction, but it’s important. These job equivalents will be made of a lot of bits and pieces of hours per week that people will choose to drop. Many of these people might be working two or three jobs, in excess of 40 hours a week, and will choose to cut back to a more reasonable one or two jobs. All this said, it’s also worth pointing out a few less positive conclusions of the CBO report. As more people choose to work less, the labor force participation rate should decline, putting a larger burden for supporting the social safety net on those who remain working. Any change in labor force participation comes on top of an already major shift toward retirement driven by the aging of the baby boom. Also, some commentators have expressed concern about having people work less because taxpayer-subsidized insurance is available. Ultimately, it boils down to a tradeoff, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. "Admittedly there are some touchy issues with the government potentially paying or subsidizing the health care costs for people who could work but choose not to," Sinclair said. "But overall I think separating health care from employment, at least making it like any other service where employment may provide the money to pay for it but where we work doesn't determine our choices, is a good thing." Sinclair said Boehner has a reasonable point in terms of the larger economic impact of these changes, but adds that he’s largely wrong in how he framed the labor-market question. "In a macroeconomic sense, this still means fewer people working, even if that is their choice," she said. On the other hand, she added, "it also probably means relatively higher wages and better bargaining power for those who are looking for a job. This is very different than the short-run effects of employers cutting positions, where we would see unemployment rates go up, less bargaining power for workers, and potentially relatively lower wages. So, the description of the source of the cut -- whether it’s from supply or demand -- does matter, but not for the count of ‘jobs.’ " When we checked with Boehner’s office, spokesman Brendan Buck reiterated that the CBO report shows that "there will be that many fewer people working – that many fewer people in jobs. Whether a result of a change in supply or demand for labor, that’s still bad for the economy. If there’s an error, it’s for tweeting in English instead of ‘economist.’" Our ruling In his tweet, Boehner said that Obama’s health care law is "expected to destroy 2.3 million jobs." Boehner’s use of the word "destroy" mischaracterizes what is going on, since the reduction will come from voluntary actions by workers, rather than layoffs by employers. The law would not push up unemployment. In fact, some people at the low end of the wage ladder would find it easier to find work as a result of the predicted shifts in the workforce. In addition, it’s misleading to refer to 2.3 million "jobs," since CBO combined all incremental losses of hours worked into full-time-job equivalents. Under this scenario, we would expect many more than 2.3 million people to be affected, but many of them would cut their hours a few at a time, rather than quitting their jobs entirely. It can be easy to miss the distinction between jobs and workers -- and the CBO report is not all rosy for the nation’s economic future. But Boehner’s statement remains flawed. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2014-02-05T15:06:40	2014-02-04	['None']
pomt-09339	Says that under a new program jail "time for non-violent, mentally ill offenders has been reduced by 50 percent."	true	/texas/statements/2010/apr/10/karen-sage/karen-sage-says-jail-time-has-been-cut-50-percent-/	Karen Sage of Austin, facing a Tuesday runoff with Mindy Montford of Austin for the Democratic nod for a judgeship, touts her experience as a prosecutor overseeing a new unit focused on defendants with mental illness. With no Republican opponent in November, the winner of the runoff will likely be a shoo-in for Travis County’s 299th state District Court judgeship. In a mailer sent to voters April 3, Sage celebrates the new program, saying that jail “time for non-violent, mentally ill offenders has been reduced by 50 percent.” We wondered if Sage’s statement—echoed in a TV ad she debuted Wednesday—reflects reality. Sage’s campaign initially referred us to Rosemary Lehmberg, the Travis County district attorney. Lehmberg confirmed that she asked Sage, an assistant district attorney, to helm the felony mental health unit, which was started in January 2009. Claire Dawson-Brown, the DA’s director of strategic prosecutions, said a magistrate started handling a special docket comprised of “mental health” defendants in late April 2009. To be in the program, Dawson-Brown said, defendants must usually be charged with a non-violent crime. They also must be diagnosed with major depression or considered bipolar, schizo-affective or schizophrenic, and seen as unstable in the jail. “It would be someone in a crisis situation,” she said, “or their mental illness is impairing their behavior.” Experts team to address the needs of the mental health inmates, Dawson-Brown said. She said participants get services they need in custody and when they return to the community. Besides Sage, who has a paralegal and a secretary, each defendant has an attorney familiar with mental health issues; she said the magistrate, a jail counselor and officials serving the local mental health and adult probation systems also play roles, with social workers sometimes getting involved. And how has the program affected jail stays? Sage said she reached her 50-percent reduction statement by comparing a baseline estimate that “mental health” inmates facing felony charges were averaging 106 days in jail before the program began to the 42-day average for participants in the program at the time she left the office in mid-December to run for judge. The decrease amounts to 60 percent. Dawson-Brown agreed that as of late 2008 and early 2009, the average Travis County jail stay for all its “mental health” defendants, including violent offenders, was 106 days. We pointed out that the baseline figure sweeps in the longer jail stays of individuals charged with violent crimes who aren’t automatically put in the new program, driving up the pre-program average and potentially skewing before and after comparisons. Dawson-Brown then gave us more detailed jail-stay information enabling an improved review of the change in average jail stays. Based on the new figures, we estimate that defendants who have been through the new program would have averaged 77 days in jail before the program began. The nitty gritty: We multiplied the number of affected defendants categorized by the level of felony they faced--ranging from first-degree felony charges to second- and third-degree felonies to state-jail felony charges--by the days that similarly charged defendants averaged in jail before the program began. Next, we totaled those defendant-days-in-jail and divided the total (19,432) by the number of defendants (253) to reach the pre-program estimate of an average of 77 days in jail. Through February, the magistrate had processed 253 defendants since the program’s start, according to Dawson-Brown, and they averaged 36 days in jail. Best we can tell, the average jail stay for defendants dropped by 41 days, or 53 percent. We rate Sage’s statement as True.	None	Karen Sage	None	None	None	2010-04-10T17:44:49	2010-04-03	['None']

pomt-00985	"Sheriffs Call For Obama’s Lynching While Leader Meets With GOP Senators"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2015/feb/09/urban-intellectuals/blog-sheriffs-group-cried-obama-be-hanged/	A group of conservative sheriffs might despair over President Barack Obama’s immigration policies, but did they actually call for him to be lynched? That was the headline that ran on the Urban Intellectuals website in January, but there’s no evidence to back it up. Urban Intellectuals bills itself as a place on the Web to promote meaningful discussion within the black community. On Jan. 15, 2015, the group ran a story with the headline "Sheriffs Call For Obama’s Lynching While Leader Meets With GOP Senators." A reader spotted it and asked us to take a closer look. This wasn’t the only website to carry that headline. We found a similar version at Addictinginfo.org, a website that boasts over 18,000 Twitter followers. Both websites drew heavily from the same source, the Southern Poverty Law Center, a civil rights organization. What the poverty center reported on Jan. 8 was distinctly different from the story conveyed in the Urban Intellectuals headline. Let’s start with the headlines. The poverty center wrote, "As Extremist ‘Constitutional Sheriffs’ Meet With Senators, Their Supporters Call for Obama’s Lynching." Urban Intellectuals shortened that, writing, "Sheriffs Call For Obama’s Lynching While Leader Meets With GOP Senators." The poverty center article described a December meeting in the Russell Senate Building between sheriffs, including members of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association, and three lawmakers, Sens. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., and David Vitter, R-La., and Rep. Martha Blackburn, R-Tenn. The sheriffs organization claims to speak for hundreds of police, sheriffs and other officials who wish to be part of the "Holy Cause of Liberty." The group urged lawmakers to overturn Obama’s decision to defer deportation action against millions of undocumented immigrants. While the sheriffs' antipathy for Obama’s priorities were clear, the actual call for lynching took place out on the streets. According to the poverty center’s article, "Just down the Capitol Mall that same day, a small group of protesters supporting the sheriffs gathered at the White House and began shouting slogans and demanding the removal of President Obama. Some in the crowd demanded the president be lynched -- ‘Hang the lying Muslim traitor!’ one of them shouted." The article said that an anti-government group called Operation American Freedom organized that protest. A video in advance of the demonstration said, "The sheriffs are going to be here doing their rally, and Operation American Freedom, or O.A.F., are going to be there as well," according to the article. That line strongly suggests that the sheriffs and the protesters were two distinct groups. In fact, the article goes further to attribute the calls for lynching to a single man. One protester in particular—a bearded man toting an American flag—seemed especially intent on seeing Obama hung. "Hang the lying Kenyan traitor terrorist piece of sh-t," he shouted at one point. "He’s a traitor! Hang him!" The same man kept shouting variations of this throughout the protest. While the article describes how the sheriffs group mingled with the protesters after their meeting, it gives no indication that any sheriffs participated in the calls for hanging the president. Other websites more accurately relayed the poverty center article. The liberal site Crooks and Liars wrote, "As Extremist ‘Constitutional Sheriffs’ Meet With Senators, Their Supporters Call for Obama’s Lynching." Our ruling The Urban Intellectuals website said that sheriffs called for Obama’s lynching. The article behind that statement amply describes that there were two separate groups in Washington that day. At no time does the article suggest that any sheriff spoke those words. The headline represents a reckless misreading of a published account. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.	None	Urban Intellectuals	None	None	None	2015-02-09T15:51:04	2015-01-15	['None']
pomt-07796	Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker’s move to limit collective bargaining rights has led to "riots" at the Capitol -- "It's like Cairo has moved to Madison these days."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/18/paul-ryan/us-rep-paul-ryan-compares-madison-cairo-calls-prot/	Crowds have built for a week in Madison as public employees and their supporters rally against Gov. Scott Walker’s plan to strip them of most of their collective bargaining rights. Walker supporters have criticized the protests, especially because they included numerous teachers who called in sick, forcing the closure of school districts -- including the Milwaukee Public Schools. Appearing on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe" program the morning of Feb. 17, 2011, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., defended Walker’s efforts to force public employees to pay more in pension and health care costs to solve the state’s budget deficit. "It's not asking a lot," said Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee and one of the stars of the new GOP House majority. "It's still about half of what private sector pensions do and health care packages do." He added, referring to Walker, "So he's basically saying ‘I want you public workers to pay half of what our private sector counterparts’ and he's getting riots -- it's like Cairo has moved to Madison these days." Now that warrants a news flash: Riots? That conjures images of tear gas, broken windows, cracked heads. Is that really happening? We started with law enforcement. There are numerous agencies handling the protests including the Dane County Sheriff’s Department, Madison police, state Department of Natural Resources and Capitol Police. A handful of arrests have been reported. "For the most part, people have been very respectful and very orderly," said Elise Schaffer, public information officer for the Dane County Sheriff’s Department. "It certainly has been a very peaceful protest." Madison police estimated the Feb. 18, 2011 crowds outside the Capitol at 30,000, while Capitol Police said there were 5,000 inside the building, according to the state Department of Administration. To be sure, emotions are strong and the stakes high. But that does not sound like much of a riot. We also talked to Paul Soglin, the former Madison mayor who led -- and was beaten -- during antiwar protests in the 1960s and ‘70s. Soglin, who has been part of countless other marches and protests, said he was amazed at the crowds. Soglin used terms like "joy and enthusiasm" to describe the energy of the crowds and compared them to the civil rights protests in the 1960. Asked about Ryan’s characterization of the events as riots, Soglin said: "It’s astounding that he would say that. It’s so spectacularly wrong." Soglin pointed to the May 1970 antiwar protests when the National Guard was called out, the first Mifflin Street Block Party in 1969, and the 1967 UW protest against Dow Chemical recruiting on campus. Those events involved the use of tear gas, beatings of students and protesters and property destruction. "Those were out of control riots," Soglin said. Neil Shively, former Madison bureau chief for the Milwaukee Sentinel, covered state government in the early 1970s. He recalled National Guard soldiers with fixed bayonets at Capitol Square. "We had to go through that line every day" to get to work at the Capitol, Shively said. Shively said he had not been to the Capitol this week but had attended a couple of gatherings of retired politicos and journalists in the last couple of days. The protests were Topic A. "Everything I’ve heard is that it’s been very peaceful and orderly," he said. Dick Wheeler, who runs the Wheeler Report news service in the Capitol, recalled covering race and antiwar riots in the 1960s and ‘70s in Ohio for United Press International and the Scripps Howard news service. "A riot has anger and violence, and neither of these has sprung up here," Wheeler said from the Capitol press room, with considerable crowd noise in the background. "It is not a riot." "Folks are being absolutely as civil as possible -- given the circumstances," he said. Wheeler and Soglin heaped praise on law enforcement for their professionalism, and said there was no significant tension between the crowds and cops. Puzzled, we called Ryan’s office and asked what he was referring to in his comments about riots and his comparison of a week of Madison protests with 18 days that led to the resignation of the president of Egypt. Ryan’s response: "It was an inaccurate comparison." To put it mildly. Our response: Pants on Fire.

pomt-06812	Says he "helped bring" Uline company to Kenosha area, "creating 800 local jobs."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/12/bob-wirch/wisconsin-recall-race-dem-state-sen-bob-wirch-clai/	Bob Wirch, one of the two Democratic state senators in Wisconsin facing a recall election Aug. 16, 2011, tells voters they should keep him in office because of his record on creating jobs in his Kenosha-based district. But can the former factory worker and 19-year lawmaker, who is being challenged by Republican Jonathan Steitz, fairly claim part of the credit for coaxing an Illinois company to bring hundreds of jobs over the border? The claim is made in a flier Wirch’s campaign mailed July 25, 2011 to voters. The flier cites Uline, a national distributor of shipping, industrial and packaging materials, and includes this headline: "Bob Wirch helped bring Uline to our area -- creating 800 local jobs." So, did he? Uline describes itself as a family-owned company that employs 2,600 employees across the country. It was founded in 1980 by Dick and Liz Uihlein; Dick Uihlein is the great-grandson of the founder of the Jos. Schlitz Brewing Co., one of Milwaukee’s famed beer makers. The company was headquartered in Waukegan, Ill., just south of the Wisconsin border, when it announced n June 2006 that it would expand in Pleasant Prairie, a Kenosha suburb about 40 miles south of Milwaukee. Both Wirch and Steitz, a lawyer who is making his first run for public office, live in the village. Uline made big news in January 2008, when it announced it would move its headquarters to Pleasant Prairie and build a distribution center there, investing $100 million and employing 1,000 people by 2010. The company also said it would utilize state government incentives that were later calculated to be worth up to $18.6 million over nine years. The Wirch campaign flier led Dick and Liz Uihlein to issue a statement in response on Aug. 3, 2011. "We worked with a variety of state and local officials during the relocation process; however, state Sen. Wirch was not one of them," the couple said in the statement, noting they do not support Wirch’s campaign. That’s a strong rebuttal to Wirch’s claim that he aided in the company’s move. The statement also noted that a bill Wirch sponsored to help Pleasant Prairie with economic development -- which is also mentioned in his campaign flier -- was not introduced until July 2011 -- months after Uline had completed its relocation. The bill was "by no means a determinative factor in our decision to relocate," the company’s statement said. When Wirch’s bill was signed into law in August 2011, Wirch said it would lead to 800 new jobs in Pleasant Prairie being created through a future expansion at Uline and the launching of a new biotechnology business incubator, according to the Kenosha News. But those 800 jobs are only projected, not already created, as the headline in Wirch’s campaign flier stated. Only some of the jobs are expected to come from Uline. And, in any case, they have nothing to do with Wirch’s claim that he helped Uline relocate to Wisconsin. When asked to respond to the statement issued by Uline, Wirch said in an email to the Racine Journal Times that he had toured Uline in 2010 "and discussed with company leadership the importance of a strong workforce and well-trained workforce." But touring Uline after it had relocated hardly equates to helping land the company in the first place. Also responding to Uline’s statement, Wirch campaign spokesman Phil Walzak told the Kenosha News that all references to Uline would be omitted from future campaign materials. "Sen. Wirch is very respectful of Uline’s wishes and he has no intention of misrepresenting them," Walzak was quoted as saying. We asked Gillian Morris, another spokesperson for Wirch’s campaign, for evidence that Wirch helped Uline’s relocation from Illinois. She argued the statement Dick Uihlein issued was "politically motivated" since he had contribute to the anti-tax Club for Growth. That’s not even on point. The statement in question from Wirch is his claim that he "helped bring Uline to our area -- creating 800 local jobs." We found there is no evidence to back the boast. Uline brought roughly that number of jobs to Wirch’s state Senate district by the time it concluded its move from Illinois in 2010. But the company said it didn’t work with Wirch at all on the relocation. And the bill Wirch makes reference to wasn’t signed into law until long after Uline had relocated. Wirch’s claim of helping land a big new employer is not only false but ridiculous -- or, Pants on Fire. Editor’s note: After this item was posted Aug. 12, 2011, Wirch’s campaign provided us additional information -- pointing to a bill other than the one cited in the original flier as evidence Wirch helped bring Uline to the area. That bill, sponsored by Wirch, allowed for business expansion in the area of Pleasant Prairie where Uline moved. However, the bill was introduced Jan. 25, 2008 -- three weeks after Uline had already announced its relocation Uline’s chief financial officer, Frank Unick, would not comment on whether the bill played a role in the relocation. Pleasant Prairie Village Administrator Mike Pollocoff said part of the company’s expansion could not have occurred without the bill, which also affected other companies. But by that point, Uline had already committed to the $100 million relocation. So, we feel it’s a stretch to say the bill "helped bring" the company to Pleasant Prairie.

pomt-05235	When Mitt Romney was governor, "the fact is that the average income for a family in Massachusetts went up by $5,500."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/05/ed-gillespie/gillespie-says-massachusetts-income-grew-5500-unde/	In the duel over economic records between President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney, a Romney surrogate this week took the fight straight to our wallets. When Romney was governor, adviser Ed Gillespie said on Fox News Sunday, "the average income for a family in Massachusetts went up by $5,500." High unemployment and stagnant wages are hurting Americans everywhere, so we decided to check whether Massachusetts families fared that much better during Romney’s 2003-07 gubernatorial term. First, the data The Romney campaign cited U.S. Census data when we asked for backup for Gillespie’s statement. Spokesman Ryan Williams pointed us to Massachusetts’ median household incomes from 2002, the last year before Romney became governor, through 2006, the final full year he was in office. Here are the figures: 2002: $49,855 2003: $50,955 2004: $52,019 2005: $56,017 2006: $55,330 So the hard numbers are accurate. The median income in Massachusetts rose $5,475 from 2002 to 2006. Romney’s influence When rating claims such as these, PolitiFact weighs not only whether the claim is numerically correct but also whether it’s appropriate for the speaker to assign credit or blame. Said Fred Bayles, a former reporter who covered Romney’s administration: "Any set of numbers related to the economy is kind of like reporting on the tides and ascribing an individual responsibility to a force of nature." Barry Bluestone, dean of the school of Public Policy and Urban Affairs at Northeastern University, said that "governors, in general, have little direct impact on employment or income in the short run. They can set the stage for future growth in jobs and income if they invest heavily in education and in infrastructure, but this did not occur during Romney’s term in office." He also noted that the census income figures are not adjusted for inflation, a point echoed by Andrew Bagley, director of research and public affairs for the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. Bagley crunched the numbers for us taking inflation into account. Using data from Moody’s Analytics, the median household income in Massachusetts increased by roughly 2.8 percent annual growth during Romney’s term, Bagley said. The nationwide consumer price index (CPI), which shows how much inflation grew during the same period, was 2.9 percent per year. "So, the answer provided by Gillespie appears accurate. But, if someone said that ‘real’ Massachusetts median household income fell during Gov. Romney’s four years in office from 2002 Q4 to 2006 Q4, that would also be accurate because the average annual growth of 2.8 percent was below the inflation rate of 2.9 percent, so real incomes actually declined," Bagley wrote in an email. When you factor that in with slow job growth -- Massachusetts private-sector employment grew by just 0.79 percent during Romney’s term -- Bluestone said the outcome is not surprising. "There really was nothing that Romney accomplished as governor that would have increased jobs or income," he said. Bluestone has donated $700 to Obama's campaign since 2011. Bayles, who now directs the Boston University Statehouse Program, also added that Massachusetts’ income gains lagged behind the national average, 11 percent compared with 14.2 percent. "Does that mean Romney could be criticized for Massachusetts underperforming the national average? Probably not." He said outside economic forces made the biggest difference. "The Massachusetts economy took a slightly bigger hit when the tech bubble burst and was a bit slower in recovering. There were forces much larger than a four-year term that impacted all these numbers," Bayles said. Jeffrey Berry, a political scientist at Tufts University, summed it up this way: "The macroeconomic changes instituted by the Romney administration were far too modest to be responsible for a change in average income of this magnitude. It's far more likely that most of the change in Massachusetts were a reflection of national policies and trends." Our ruling Gillespie’s statement that median family incomes in Massachusetts grew by $5,500 during Romney’s term is numerically accurate. However, that dollar figure is not adjusted for inflation, and two experts told us that after inflation is taken into account, real incomes in Massachusetts actually declined slightly. What’s more, governors in general have little impact on immediate-term gains in jobs and incomes. Gillespie’s statement leaves out those important details, leaving the inaccurate impression that Massachusetts families were significantly better off under Romney. We rate it Half True.

pomt-12999	"Obama-Led U.N. Has Just Made It Official, U.S. To Immediately Pay Blacks 'Reparations'."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/15/freedom-daily/fake-news-popular-post-claims-obama-led-un-pay-afr/	A fake news story circulating online falsely says President Barack Obama has used the United Nations to somehow force the United States to pay African-Americans reparations for slavery. The headline from the website Freedom Daily is wrong in every way and should be disregarded. "Obama-Led U.N. Has Just Made It Official, U.S. To Immediately Pay Blacks ‘Reparations’," it read on Dec. 9, 2016. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Freedom Daily, which bills itself as "a forum for discussing meaningful conservative American and world news," quotes a story from a similar website called the Conservative Daily Post. These websites ridicule a report from the United Nations' Working Group of Experts on People of African Descent, a Geneva-based panel that had found the United States’ history of slavery had left a lasting impact on American society that justified reparations to African-Americans. They presented their report to the United Nations Human Rights Council in September 2016. The group of global human rights experts concluded from their research that past transgressions had led to current strife in America. "In particular, the legacy of colonial history, enslavement, racial subordination and segregation, racial terrorism and racial inequality in the United States remains a serious challenge, as there has been no real commitment to reparations and to truth and reconciliation for people of African descent," the report read. "Contemporary police killings and the trauma that they create are reminiscent of the past racial terror of lynching." The panel said progress had been made in America over the decades, but the nation was facing a "human rights crisis" brought on by the lingering racial discord. The "reparatory justice" suggested by the panel includes considering benefits similar to those sought by a Caribbean coalition seeking reparations from European countries that colonized them. Those reparations encompass the possibilities of "a formal apology, health initiatives, educational opportunities, an African knowledge programme, psychological rehabilitation, technology transfer and financial support, and debt cancellation." Let’s first acknowledge that Obama doesn’t lead the United Nations, though the United States certainly holds sway over U.N. actions. The United States is a charter member of the group, a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council and a significant financial contributor. But the body is led by South Korean Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, who will be succeeded by Portuguese leader Antonio Guterres on Jan. 1, 2017. Furthermore, Obama has publicly said that he does not support the idea of financial reparations for slavery. He has said he’d prefer to focus on expanding access to jobs, health care, education and other programs to address the disadvantages minorities face. Additionally, the panel’s findings are nonbinding. The United Nations isn’t forcing the United States to do anything. The report was an academic exercise to explore the legacy of slavery on modern America. There’s nothing official about the report beyond its U.N.-sanctioned research. There certainly isn’t any plan for the federal government to pay such reparations, immediately or otherwise. Our ruling The website Freedom Daily said in a headline that the "Obama-Led U.N. has just made it official, U.S. to immediately pay blacks ‘reparations’." The posts track back to a U.N.-affiliated panel that concluded America’s history of slavery has stacked the deck against modern African-Americans. The group found that reparations to those citizens are justifiable. Every part of the eye-grabbing headline is wrong: Obama doesn’t lead the United Nations, the report is non-binding and has no official impact on the federal government, and there are no plans for the U.S. to immediately pay reparations. About the only thing accurate thing in the posts are that such a study even exists, but it’s presented in such a misleading way that it’s beyond just inaccurate.

pomt-09275	"We've got a 1,000 National Guard troop request that's been in front of this president for over a year and no response."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/apr/28/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-obama-administration-hasnt-res/	Saying foreign policy is most certainly a governor's business, Texas Gov. Rick Perry blasted the federal government for not doing enough to protect the border Texas shares with Mexico. "We do not have the resources or the manpower to secure the border the way it needs to be," Perry said during an April 15 interview with the online Texas Tribune and Newsweek magazine. "We've got a 1,000 National Guard troop request that's been in front of this president for over a year and no response, so we are forced by Washington's inaction to take action ourselves." Has President Barack Obama been a non-responsive pen pal? We learned from Perry's office that Perry first wrote Janet Napolitano, secretary of Homeland Security, to request more National Guard troops in February 2009. Napolitano had been in a similar pinch in 2008; as Arizona's governor, she twice called on the Department of Homeland Security to extend the two-year Operation Jump Start mission that stationed more than 6,000 National Guard members on the U.S.-Mexico border of four U.S. states. However, the mission ended as planned in July of that year. Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger told us last week that "so far we've not received official approval or disapproval" of Perry's February 2009 request. Cesinger also e-mailed us Perry's related correspondence with the Obama administration. Perry's Feb. 26, 2009, letter refers to his January 2009 phone conversation with Napolitano about the Texas-Mexico border. His letter states: "As you know, the National Guard can play an important role in securing our border, which benefits not only the border states but the entire nation... as we discussed during our telephone conversation, an additional 1,000 Title 32 National Guard positions are needed..." Title 32 service is primarily state active duty. In an April 2, 2009, letter to Napolitano, Perry asked to discuss his request for 1,000 National Guard troops; the letter also mentions the pair's March 26 phone conversation. On Aug. 21, Perry wrote President Obama, stating: "As violence in northern Mexico continues, it is paramount that our international borders be secured to ensure the safety of our citizens and the security of our homeland. To reiterate my standing request with your administration, I respectfully ask that you authorize the use of 1,000 Title 32 National Guard personnel in support of civilian law enforcement along the Texas-Mexico border." Perry followed up with a Sept. 1 letter to U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates mentioning the "long-standing request." And on March 12, Perry sent a fresh letter to Napolitano — this time asking for a Predator drone, an unarmed reconnaissance aircraft — to be based on the Texas border to support local, state and federal law enforcement. The upshot? The feds wrote back, but made no promises. Cesinger showed us a a June 24, 2009, letter from Napolitano to Perry acknowledging his Feb. 26 and April 2, 2009, letters. "National Guard support is an option that is being seriously considered as part of our overall border strategy," Napolitano's letter states. Matthew Chandler, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, told us "the administration continues to evaluate additional law enforcement options as needed, including the use of the National Guard, along the Southwest border. We continue to work with Congress on comprehensive reform of our immigration system, which would provide lasting and dedicated resources at our borders." Chandler forwarded two more letters from Homeland Security to Perry. A March 1 letter from Juliette Kayyem, assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs, states on the White House's behalf that "the authorization of additional National Guard resources remains an option that we continue to consider seriously as part of our overall strategy." On March 19, Napolitano responded to Perry's drone request, writing that the department was considering expanding drone operations into West Texas. And on April 27, Napolitano told a Senate hearing that Texas would receive a drone, but didn't offer a timeline. Both Napolitano and Obama have also publicly spoken to Perry's request — though not encouragingly. In a March 2009 interview with reporters for regional newspapers including The Dallas Morning News, Obama said plans to deploy troops to the border weren't imminent: "We've got a very big border with Mexico. I'm not interested in militarizing the border." During a subsequent press briefing on U.S.-Mexico border security, a reporter asked Napolitano how Perry could persuade her to deliver the 1,000 National Guard troops. "Why 1,000?" Napolitano answered, according to a transcript of the briefing on the Homeland Security website. "Where did that number come from? Where in Texas? Texas has a huge border with Mexico. What does he anticipate the Guard doing? And those are the kinds of things that I think then I will transmit to the secretary of defense and the president in the ongoing decision about Guard — yes, no, and if so how many and where." Bottom line: The Obama administration has repeatedly acknowledged Perry's request for troops; it just hasn't given him the answer he seeks. We rate Perry's statement as Half True.

pomt-00550	Says Hillary Clinton "has donated every cent she's ever earned from speaking fees to charity."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/jun/16/occupy-democrats/liberal-group-claims-all-hillary-clintons-speaking/	We’ve seen conservatives go too far criticizing Hillary Clinton’s hefty speaking fees, saying Clinton "makes more per hour at a speaking gig than the average CEO does in a year." (Mostly False) Now a liberal group is bending the Truth-O-Meter in Clinton’s defense. The group, Occupy Democrats, posted a recent Facebook meme that seeks to compare Clinton’s paid speeches to those given by former President George W. Bush. The meme has been shared more than 25,000 times. It reads: "Hilary (sic) has donated every cent she's ever earned from speaking fees to charity. Bush keeps all of his speaking fees." We’ll leave Bush out of this for the moment. As for the claim that Clinton "donated every cent she's ever earned from speaking fees to charity," that’s wrong. No one from the Occupy Democrats group responded to our request for comment, but we believe its claim is based on 2014 comments by Clinton. When students at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, asked that Clinton return her $225,000 speaking fee, Clinton noted that "all of the fees have been donated to the Clinton Foundation for it to continue its life-changing and life-saving work." "So it goes from a foundation at a university to another foundation," Clinton told ABC News, with regard to the UNLV speech. The UNLV donation is documented on the Clinton Foundation website. It includes this list of "speeches by President, Secretary, and Chelsea Clinton (that) have helped support the implementation of the Clinton Foundation’s work around the world." The speaking fee from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, for instance, is listed as a donation from the UNLV Foundation. So are other speeches at universities and colleges as well as a few speeches organized by private groups such as Citibank, Chicago House and Goldman Sachs. But that’s not all of the speeches for which Clinton has been paid. In May, the New York Times published Clinton’s 2015 financial disclosure form. Covering a period from January 2014 to March 2015, Clinton lists a total of 51 speech fees that have been added to her personal account from a variety of companies. Not including her husband’s fees which also appear on the same disclosure, Clinton’s speech fees end up totaling more than $11 million. Spokesmen for the Clinton Foundation and Clinton’s presidential campaign declined comment. Our ruling Occupy Democrats claimed Clinton "has donated every cent she's ever earned from speaking fees to charity." That’s a misreading of Clinton’s comments in 2014, when she said speaking fees at colleges and universities were donated to the Clinton Foundation. Clinton’s financial disclosure form includes 51 speeches in which Clinton was compensated directly. This claim rates False.

pomt-13071	Says there are "probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million" criminal immigrants in the country illegally.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/15/donald-trump/trump-misleads-number-criminal-immigrants-illegall/	In his first interview after winning the 2016 election, President-elect Donald Trump had to answer whether he would keep his word on his campaign promises or change in any way. Trump said he wanted to keep a couple provisions of the Affordable Care Act, which he had pledged to repeal, and he said he would be open to a part wall, part fence perimeter along the U.S.-Mexico border instead of a massive concrete structure. "What about the pledge to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrants?," asked CBS' Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes. "What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we're going to incarcerate," Trump responded. "But we're getting them out of our country, they're here illegally." Also, after securing the border "and after everything gets normalized," the fate of "terrific people" who remain in the country illegally will be decided, Trump said. We wondered about Trump’s reference to 2 million to 3 million immigrants with criminal records in the United States illegally. Trump was referring to a Department of Homeland Security report covering fiscal years 2011-13. That report said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement estimated there were 1.9 million "removable criminal aliens" in the United States at the time -- not 3 million. And the report says the 1.9 million total includes immigrants who are here both legally and illegally. ‘Criminal alien’ doesn’t necessarily mean illegal The term "criminal aliens" is generally used by law enforcement to identify "noncitizens who are residing in the United States legally or illegally and are convicted of a crime." It is misleading to say the 1.9 million outlined in the DHS report are all here illegally -- though they may be "removable." An individual living in the United States legally may be subject to deportation under certain circumstances, including the conviction of crimes such as cocaine possession. The report did not specify how many "criminal aliens" are here illegally. An ICE official said the agency was not able to confirm the percentage or number of immigrants in the country illegally with criminal convictions. Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring stricter immigration policies, said her research shows the majority of the criminal immigrants are here illegally and backed up Trump’s statement. Trump cited her research during his campaign. "Based on my review of various sets of data and records from ICE that includes the exact immigration status of sets of ICE removal cases, I am confident in saying that most of this population of criminal aliens is here illegally," Vaughan said of the 1.9 million in the federal report. "Under the law, criminal aliens who at one time had legal status generally would become disqualified for that legal status upon conviction of certain crimes." Adam Cox, an expert on immigration law and professor at New York University, said a criminal conviction itself does not alter the immigration status of a lawful immigrant, such as a green card holder. "These immigrants are not stripped of their status the moment they are convicted," Cox said. If a convicted green card holder is placed in deportation proceedings, he or she would lose the green card only at the end of immigration proceedings if an immigration judge rules that the criminal conviction makes the person deportable, Cox said. Trump’s claim that "it could be even 3 million" criminal immigrants in the country illegally also surpasses calculations from a group estimating it could be less than 1 million. The Migration Policy Institute, a think tank analyzing the movement of people and policies that affect them, in July 2015 estimated that 43 percent, or 820,000, of the 1.9 million noncitizens convicted of crimes were unauthorized immigrants. The institute analyzed estimates of the unauthorized population and the number of noncitizens lawfully in the country and estimated that both groups commit crimes at similar rates. The precise number of unauthorized immigrants convicted of crimes may be higher or lower, with a margin of error in the low tens of thousands, the institute said. Trump’s plan to deport 2 million to 3 million parallels the number of total immigrants deported under President Barack Obama. More than 2 million people have been deported over the course of Obama’s presidency. Our ruling Trump said there are "probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million" criminal immigrants in the country illegally. Trump’s slightly hedged numbers stem from a federal report that said there are about 1.9 million "removable criminal aliens," but that includes people here legally and illegally. Trump’s claim that it could even be 3 million is based on an assumption. He's in the ballpark but misses important details.

pomt-12318	In the Georgia House district that hosted a special election on June 20, "Trump won by 20+ points."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/21/joy-reid/joy-ann-reid-mistakes-size-trump-victory-georgia-d/	After Republican Karen Handel defeated Democrat Jon Ossoff in a closely watched special election for a House seat in suburban Atlanta, commentators in both parties began to spin the results furiously. One of them was Joy Reid, the liberal host of the MSNBC show AM Joy. On election night, not long after it became clear that Handel had won a narrow victory, Reid reassured her followers on Twitter, "It’s GEORGIA. A Republican district in Georgia that Trump won by 20+ points. Let’s hang on to some perspective, folks." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Reid is right that the district is historically Republican; Republicans have held it for decades, most recently by Tom Price, whose elevation to Health and Human Services secretary by President Donald Trump prompted the special election in the first place. However, Trump didn’t win the district by more than 20 points — not by a long shot. (Reid did later tweet back to a follower who suggested that Trump won by a point or two, "Ah ok. I could have that one wrong. Thanks!") According to the forthcoming Almanac of American Politics 2018, Trump defeated Clinton in the district by 160,029 votes to 155,087, or a 48 percent to 47 percent margin. That’s roughly a 1 percentage-point margin. (Full disclosure: The author of this article is also the senior author of that book.) Another source of presidential results by congressional district, Daily Kos Elections, had a similar number, putting the Trump margin of victory at 1.5 percentage points. Like a number of other traditionally Republican suburban congressional districts across the country, Georgia’s 6th District moved toward the Democrats in the 2016 presidential election. Political analysts credited Clinton’s gains in such districts to demographic patterns in each of the candidates’ bases of support. Hillary Clinton tended to do better than Trump did among voters with high educational attainment, who are disproportionately numerous in suburban districts like Georgia’s 6th. In some such districts, Clinton won outright over Trump. These included Texas’ 23rd District, held by GOP Rep. Will Hurd, and no fewer than seven Republican-held House districts in California. Georgia’s 6th District didn’t quite give Clinton the victory, but Trump notched only a narrow win in the district. The 2016 presidential result in the district was far worse for the Republicans than in previous elections. In 2012, according to the Almanac of American Politics, Mitt Romney won the district, 61 percent to 37 percent, a 24 percentage-point margin. That margin is more along the lines of what Reid was talking about. But 2016 was a very different election year from 2012 in the district. Georgia’s 6th District had already moved substantially in the Democrats’ direction by last November. Clinton won some 40,000 more votes in the district than President Barack Obama did in 2012, while Trump won almost 27,000 votes fewer than Mitt Romney did in 2012. Worth noting: Even as Trump was faring poorly in the district, Price won his seat by a margin similar to what Reid tweeted. In 2016, Price, a longtime incumbent first elected in 2004, defeated his little-known Democratic opponent, 62 percent to 38 percent, a 24-point margin. Still, Reid was wrong in her initial tweet. (She did not respond to an inquiry by Twitter.) Our ruling Reid's original tweet said that in Georgia’s 6th district, "Trump won by 20+ points." Romney won by that wide a margin margin in 2012, and Price did, too, as recently as last November. But Trump was nowhere near as popular in the district as Reid’s tweet indicates. He won by a point or two -- far worse than Republican candidates have traditionally fared in the 6th. We rate the statement False. EDITOR'S NOTE, June 21, 12:55 p.m.: Shortly after this article was posted, a reader informed us that Reid had replied to a follower on Twitter that she may have gotten the statistic wrong. We have now included that in the article.	None	Joy Reid	None	None	None	2017-06-21T12:34:12	2017-06-20	['None']

pomt-14555	"In America, we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/11/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-has-correct-diagnosis-us-prescripti/	One theme Sen. Bernie Sanders has repeatedly touched on during his run for the Democratic nomination for president has been the high cost of prescription drugs. His comment during the Feb. 11 Democratic debate at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee was typical as he rattled off a list of problems with the U.S. health care system: "In America, we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs." We asked the Sanders campaign for the source of his claim. We didn't get a response. So we searched on our own. One organization that tracks such things is the International Federation of Health Plans, based in London. Their latest price report, from 2013, lists eight common drugs. Compared with England, the Netherlands, Spain, Switzerland and Canada, U.S. prices were far higher, sometimes dramatically so. Consider Nexium, the medicine widely used to treat acid reflux. A prescription that would cost $60 or less in other countries costs, on average, $215 in the United States. And that's just the average. Prices vary widely in this country: In 5 percent of the cases, the cost was $395. "What Bernie says is true. There's nowhere that pays the same price as America," said Tom Sackville, the federation's CEO. In addition, "there is this huge variation in price across America. Anything above the average is quite unjustified. When you get up to the 95th percentile, you're talking grand robbery." The findings were similar in an April 2013 study published in the journal Health Affairs, which looked at the prices of brand name drugs in the United States, United Kingdom, Switzerland, Germany, France, Canada and Australia. In each of the three years studied -- 2005, 2007 and 2010 -- U.S. prices were consistently higher. The one exception: Switzerland. In addition, researchers found that, between 2005 and 2010, "the gap between the United States and other countries seemed to widen." And it wasn't just new drugs being embraced first in the United States that was driving up costs. They concluded that "prices for older products rose faster in the United States than in other countries." But Joel Farley of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill's Eshelman School of Pharmacy cautioned that the rule doesn't always apply to generic drugs. A 2008 comparison of 19 generic drugs found that some U.S. prices were lower than Canadian prices. "In some cases it has to do with availability," he said. In other cases, a country may set the drug price low and in that fixed-price market "there's no incentive to go lower." The Wall Street Journal published an analysis in December that concluded 98 percent of 40 top branded drugs were more expensive in the United States than in England. In Norway, 93 percent of the 40 top branded drugs cost less than in the United States. And in Ontario, a comparison of 30 drugs showed that U.S. prices were also higher for 93 percent of the products. Why are the brand name prices so much lower in other countries, and why is there so much variation in the United States? Big customers can negotiate big discounts. So the countries with socialized medicine have a lot of leverage at the negotiating table, the experts told us. In the United States, hospitals, wholesalers and insurance companies all do their own negotiations. The Veterans Administration can -- and does -- negotiate dramatically lower prices. Under Medicaid, the drug companies are required to provide their medicines at a price that's as low as it is for any of their regular customers. But Medicare has been prohibited by law from negotiating lower prices since 2006, and that's a huge chunk of the U.S. health care industry. (When Barack Obama was first running for president, he promised to repeal that Bush-era restriction, but then backed off in an attempt to get passage of the Affordable Care Act.) The pharmaceutical industry says it needs the extra income to pay for research to keep new, desperately needed drugs coming. But with everyone getting a bargain, Americans are financing that research for the rest of the world, experts told us. Yet there's another way to look at the issue, said Amitava Dasgupta, a clinical toxicologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston. The tablet that costs a dollar in the United States may only cost 20 cents in India, but that drug is far more expensive to the average person in India because their income is so much lower. "The U.S. subsidizes research for the world," he said. "But I would look at that as philanthropy." Our ruling Sanders said, "In America, we pay, by far, the highest prices in the world for prescription drugs." When it comes to brand-name drugs, which yield the highest profit for the pharmaceutical industry, studies support Sanders' claim -- although not always on a drug-by-drug basis. In addition, the differences in price can be dramatic because the U.S. health care system is so splintered, and Medicare is prohibited by law from using its market share to bargain for lower prices. We found one study comparing the United States and Canada that found exceptions for generic drugs, where the profit margin is much lower and which make up a much smaller share of prescription drug spending. But on balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-02-11T21:56:57	2016-02-11	['United_States']

pomt-11424	"Mark Harris worked to stop Trump from being president."	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/mar/16/robert-pittenger/pittenger-misleads-about-his-opponents-support-tru/	If Rep. Robert Pittenger has his way, the primary election for his seat will become a contest over loyalty to President Donald Trump. Pittenger, a Republican from the Charlotte area, faces an opponent in Rev. Mark Harris, who came within 134 votes of beating him for the District 9 seat in June 2016. The winner of the GOP primary faces the winner of the Democratic primary between Christian Cano and Dan McCready, as well as Libertarian Jeff Scott. Harris has attempted to position himself to the right of Pittenger. So Pittenger recently released an ad that casts Harris as a critic of Trump, who carried the district with 54 percent of the vote in 2016. In the ad, a newspaper headline appears on screen and reads, "Mark Harris worked to stop a Trump presidency." The ad’s narrator says, "Mark Harris worked to stop Trump from being president." In a news release accompanying the ad, Pittenger strategist Paul Shumaker said Harris "led the ‘Stop Trump’ campaign" before the GOP convention. Harris, for his part, told The Charlotte Observer that there’s "no record whatsoever that I was part of a Stop Trump movement." PolitiFact reached out to the Pittenger campaign about the claim. The campaign directed us to a WBT Radio clip from March 10, 2016, in which Harris talks about his support of Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. A radio interview "He’s gonna be the next president of the United States," Harris said of Cruz during the interview. "It does seem that Donald Trump does have somewhat of a ceiling," Harris said. "And in these close primaries, he loses most of the time. So I think that’s an interesting aspect. So I think coalescing behind Ted Cruz is a way to stop Donald Trump and go into the convention, get our nominee and come out and beat Hillary Clinton in the fall. The radio host then asks Harris if he’d support Trump if Trump were to become the Republican nominee. "That’s an interesting question," Harris responds. "I think everyone is weighing that out and considering that." "To be honest, it’s a very concerning decision that will have to be made because we’re looking at one entire generation of Supreme Court justices being nominated that will affect us and I’m truly concerned most of all of Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders having that ability to choose," Harris continued. "I feel somewhat better about Donald Trump making those appointments but I can’t tell you I feel great about that by any stretch of the imagination." Lawrence Shaheen, a spokesman for Pittenger, provided a link to a story in the Independent in April 2016 that reported Harris campaigning for Cruz. He also pointed to Harris’ Facebook and Twitter accounts to argue that Harris was never enthusiastic about Trump. Those accounts show very few pro-Trump tweets until Trump won the presidency. Supporting Cruz at the primary PolitiFact contacted the Harris campaign about the radio clip. Spokesman Andy Yates acknowledged in an email that Harris had concerns about Trump prior to his nomination. But, Yates added, so did "the 60 percent of NC primary voters who voted for someone other than Donald Trump for president in the March primary, including Congressman Pittenger who was still supporting outspoken Trump opponent Marco Rubio." The North Carolina primaries took place on March 15, 2016. That’s when Trump won a plurality of the votes, with 40 percent, and Cruz was the runner-up with 36 percent. Yates provided a link to Pittenger’s Feb. 3 endorsement of Rubio and defended the "stop Trump" comment, pointing out that the radio interview took place four months prior to the Republican National Convention. "Dr. Harris was fully supporting President Trump well before the convention and never engaged in any efforts to try to stop President Trump from receiving the nomination he had won," Yates said. The Baptist Press reported in July that Harris was slated to attend the Republican National Convention as a Cruz delegate, but had to withdraw "to be with a ‘father in the ministry’ who has entered hospice care." When did his support shift? So, about four months before the Republican National Convention in Ohio, Harris said "coalescing behind Ted Cruz" was the best way to "stop Trump" and beat Democratic nominee Clinton. Does that mean Harris "worked" to stop Trump from being president? Certainly, campaigning for another candidate can be considered "working against" another. So how long did it take for Harris to support Trump? Harris "switched his support to Trump when it became clear to him that Trump had secured the delegates necessary to win the Republican nomination," Yates said. "Mark said that if he remembered correctly it was around the time of the California primary." The California primary in 2016 was held on June 7. By June 27 of that year, The Charlotte Observer wrote a story casting Harris as a defender of Trump’s. "There’s more than just a four-year term for a president at stake," Harris said, referring to Trump’s critics. "I think there’s a 40-year generation at stake. Decisions will be made by the next president that will affect us for 40 years." Pittenger, for his part, shifted his support to Trump that May. Shaheen forwarded an email that Pittenger sent to the Charlotte Observer on May 4. Pittenger was then quoted as supporting Trump in the Charlotte Agenda later that month. By the time November rolled around, the Daily Beast wrote a story that referred to Harris as "part of Trump’s North Carolina spiritual advisory group." Yates said Harris ultimately traveled to six states to support Trump and that he endorsed Trump from the pulpit at Charlotte First Baptist, where he was a pastor. He sent a clip of Harris speaking at a Trump rally. The video didn’t give a date for the rally but was published on Jan. 28, 2017. Our ruling Pittenger said, "Mark Harris worked to stop Trump from being president." He has a point that Harris supported Ted Cruz for president until Trump became the nominee. But he left out the important context that Pittenger also supported another candidate. It’s disingenuous to cast Harris as someone who tried to sabotage Trump without providing context that Harris not only supported Trump after he became the nominee, but was reported to be among his spiritual advisors.

pomt-04889	President Obama’s lawsuit claims it is unconstitutional for Ohio to allow servicemen and women extended early voting privileges during the state’s early voting period.	false	/ohio/statements/2012/aug/06/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-lawsuit-filed-president-obamas-ca/	After some Ohio voters faced hours-long lines at polling places during the 2004 presidential election, the state adopted reforms designed to prevent similar problems in the future. Those reforms included allowing voters to cast ballots at county boards of elections for an extended period before elections. In 2008, Barack Obama’s presidential campaign used those new laws to its advantage. The campaign made particular use of voting the Sunday before elections in Ohio and other states as African-American churches organized "Souls to the Polls" events that took congregants to vote after religious services. Republicans who control Ohio’s state government passed a law last year that would have reduced the time frame for early voting from five weeks to three, eliminated most weekend voting hours and dropped a requirement that poll workers redirect voters to the correct precinct if they show up at the wrong one in a location that hosts multiple precincts. Ohio legislators repealed that law when it became clear it would face a referendum this year, though its ban on early voting on the weekend before elections remained in place because it was part of a separate law. Democrats including U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown say Republicans wanted to eliminate that weekend’s early voting to cut turnout among African-Americans who vote after church, a demographic likely to vote for Obama. Brown said that in 2008, up to 19 percent of Ohio voters cast their ballots during the weekend before the election. Last month, President Obama’s re-election campaign filed a lawsuit against Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted to demand that in-person voting be allowed during the three-day weekend before elections. It noted that approximately 93,000 Ohioans voted in the three days before the 2008 presidential election. The lawsuit argues that all Ohio voters should be permitted to cast ballots that weekend, as members of the U.S. military are permitted to do. The complaint alleged that Ohio’s legislature failed to justify the disparate treatment between military and nonmilitary voters, and contended the "unequal burden on the fundamental right to vote violates the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution." That assertion by the Obama campaign riled more than a dozen military groups - including AmVets and the Military Officers Association of America. On Aug. 1, they filed a motion to intervene in the Obama campaign’s lawsuit. It said they want to "defend the fundamental constitutional right to vote of members of the U.S. Armed Forces, which includes the right to receive special accommodations, flexibility and extra time to facilitate their voting, whether absentee or in-person." Their legal filing said the means the Obama campaign was using to request an overall extension of Ohio’s early voting period - "a ruling that it is arbitrary and unconstitutional to grant extra time for early voting solely to military voters and overseas citizens - is both legally inappropriate and squarely contrary to the legal interests and constitutional rights" of members of the U.S. Armed Forces. On the same day as the military groups filed their briefs, attorneys for the state of Ohio filed their own response to the Obama campaign’s complaint. It said that special laws were enacted to help uniformed and overseas citizens cast absentee ballots because they are often not present in the areas where they vote, and that the state of Ohio doesn’t have to treat other voters the way it treats those uniformed and overseas citizens. "From the beginning of our Republic, military voters have had special problems in obtaining ballots and casting them," the state of Ohio’s legal filing says. "Ohio’s laws, allowing UOCAVA (Uniformed and Overseas Citizens Absentee Voter Act) voters the ability to cast an absentee ballot after the time during which non-military and domestic voters may do so has closed, rationally recognizes the unique circumstances that military voters may face." The state of Ohio filed a brief that backed intervention by the military groups. So did the Obama campaign. "Plaintiffs seek to restore for all voters access to early voting through the Monday before Election Day," the Obama campaign’s brief said. "Neither the substance of its Equal Protection claim, nor the relief requested, challenges the legislature’s authority to make appropriate accommodation, including early voting during the period in question, for military voters, their spouses or dependents. The question before the Court is whether, in the circumstances of this case, the State of Ohio may arbitrarily and without justification withdraw from all other Ohio eligible voters the same right they previously had to vote the weekend and Monday before election day." It didn’t take long for these dry legal exchanges to erupt into a political bonfire. Toward the end of last week, websites began to make the misleading claim that the Obama campaign was suing the state of Ohio to restrict military voting, when the lawsuit actually sought to permit all Ohio voters to vote the weekend before elections, as military voters can do. On Saturday, GOP Presidential candidate Mitt Romney issued a statement that accused Obama of trying to undermine the rights of military voters. "President Obama’s lawsuit claiming it is unconstitutional for Ohio to allow servicemen and women extended early voting privileges during the state’s early voting period is an outrage," Romney’s statement said. In an appearance on Fox News Sunday, Obama campaign advisor David Axelrod disputed the way that Romney and others were characterizing the lawsuit. "What that lawsuit calls for is not to deprive the military of the right to vote on the final weekend ," Axelrod told host Chris Wallace. "Of course, they should have that right. That suit is about whether the rest of Ohio should have the same right. And I think it’s shameful that Governor Romney would hide behind our servicemen and women to try and win a lawsuit to deprive other Ohioans. . . of the right to vote." Democrats lined up their own military members to protest how some were describing the lawsuit. Former Democratic congressman John Boccieri of Alliance, a Lt. Col. in the U.S. Air Force Reserves, issued a statement that accused Republicans of distortion. "This is about restoring equal and fair access to early voting and in no way asks for restrictions to voting," Boccieri said. "Anything said otherwise is completely false. Period. And as a member of the American Legion and a lifetime member of the AMVETS, I find these claims outrageous." Indeed, Obama’s lawsuit clearly states that it seeks to permit all Ohioans - not just members of the U.S. military - to vote during the three days before the election, as was the case in 2008. The suit in no way suggests restricting early voting by members of the military. It is simply dishonest for Romney and his backers to claim that Obama’s effort to extend early voting privileges to everyone in Ohio constitutes an attack on military voters’ ability to cast ballots on the weekend before elections.

pomt-00358	"A teacher watched hard-core pornography in his classroom," along with other inappropriate behavior, but Tony Evers didn't revoke the teacher's license and "the teacher is still in the classroom."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/sep/13/scott-walker/scott-walker-misleads-claiming-tony-evers-could-ha/	It hasn’t reached the ubiquity — yet — of advertising on NASCAR race cars. But in the race for governor, advertising about a teacher viewing porn case is all over television. There have been three ads on the case that we’ve checked attacking Tony Evers, the state schools superintendent and Democratic candidate for governor. Each were by the state Republican Party, with one dating back more than a year. There also have been two TV ads on the case that we’ve checked from two groups defending Evers, who will face Republican Gov. Scott Walker in the Nov. 6, 2018, election. Now comes another attack ad, this one from Walker, released Sept. 5, 2018. The narrator goes into lengthy detail, saying: A teacher watched hard-core pornography in his classroom, showed obscene images to female coworkers, commented about the chest sizes of middle-school girls, suggested one struggling student should brush up on her sex skills because it's the only thing she'd ever be good at -- then intimidated the female teacher who complained. Tony Evers should have revoked the teacher's license, but he didn't, and the teacher is still in the classroom with young girls. All our fact checks in the governor’s race. We’ll break down the statement into two parts: "A teacher watched hard-core pornography in his classroom," along with other inappropriate behavior, but Tony Evers didn't revoke the teacher's license and "the teacher is still in the classroom." The case Like the other ads, this one focuses on Andy Harris, a middle-school science teacher in the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District, west of Madison. He was fired in 2010 for viewing images and videos of nudity on his school computer and showing them to co-workers. Harris got his job back after an arbitrator ruled he should have been given a suspension rather than be fired. Two courts, without ruling on whether the firing was illegal, concluded that the arbitrator was within her authority in making her decision. The arbitrator based her decision in part on her determination that Harris’ behavior, given that students were not present when he viewed the images, did not endanger any students, as defined by state law. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Now to what Walker’s ad claims about the teacher’s behavior. What the teacher did We’re relying on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news reports on the case, the arbitrator’s report and the school district’s investigation of the case. ‘Watched hard-core pornography in classroom’: Correct, though "hard-core" might be debatable. Harris looked at pornographic material at school during the workday, via 23 emails sent by Harris' sister, that included pornographic photos, jokes and movies. ‘Showed obscene images to female co-workers’: Correct. Commented about chest sizes, sex skills: Undetermined. In the school district’s investigation, an unidentified employee said Harris made the remarks. But the Department of Public Instruction, which Evers heads, said neither the arbitrator nor the department could determine whether Harris made the remarks. ‘Intimidated the female teacher who complained’: Correct. The teacher who complained said Harris could sometimes be intimidating. The district’s investigation found that emails Harris sent to the teacher "suggests retaliation," but Harris denied they were retaliatory. So, the first part of Walker’s claim is partially accurate. But the second part is more important, given that it contains the attack on Evers. ‘Didn't revoke, teacher still in classroom’ This part of the ad states — particularly in saying Evers should have revoked Harris’ license — that even though the legal system returned the teacher to his job, Evers had the power to stop him from teaching. But when Harris was fired, state law defined immoral conduct, according to the Legislature’s nonpartisan legal advisers, "as conduct or behavior that is contrary to commonly accepted moral or ethical standards and that endangers the health, safety, welfare, or education of any pupil." And is the pivotal word. Evers’ department did have the discretion on whether to go through license revocation proceedings, which Harris could have challenged. The department has said it decided against that course after concluding Harris’ behavior didn’t endanger kids, as defined by the law. Walker, in effect, argues that Evers nevertheless should have tried revocation. But the lack of a legal basis to take away Harris’ license appears to be supported by the fact that in November 2011, nearly a year after Harris’ firing, Walker signed a bill, supported by Evers, that redefined immoral conduct to specify that what Harris did is legal cause for license revocation. So, the second part of Walker’s statement is misleading in claiming that Evers could have revoked Harris’ license and simply didn’t. (Before he was fired, Harris taught seventh-grade science at one of the district’s two middle schools; now he has the same job at the other.) Our rating Walker says: "A teacher watched hard-core pornography in his classroom," along with other inappropriate behavior, but Tony Evers didn't revoke the teacher's license and "the teacher is still in the classroom." The first part of Walker’s statement, about the teacher’s behavior, is correct on two points; but on two other points, the validity of the allegations is unclear. Meanwhile, the more important part of Walker’s statement is misleading in saying Evers could have and didn’t revoke the teacher’s license. There was a lack of legal basis for revocation at the time — made clear by the fact that Walkers and Evers backed a change in state law so that teachers can be fired for viewing pornography at school. For a statement that contains only elements of truth, our rating is Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2018-09-13T06:00:00	2018-09-05	['None']

pomt-07896	Says that in Ohio "right now, you could be 8½ months pregnant and have an abortion for no reason."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/feb/04/lorraine-fende/rep-lorraine-fende-point-abortion-8-12-months-ille/	A new bill to ban late-term abortions is gaining traction in the Ohio House of Representatives, reinvigorating debate over the state’s abortion laws. If passed, the bill would ban abortions when a woman is at least 20 weeks pregnant and tests show the fetus can live outside the womb – a condition known as being viable. The proposed ban contains exceptions for certain medical situations, a legal requirement for late-term abortion bans at the state level. The proposed ban is one of three bills related to abortion the Republican majority in the House introduced this week. The set of abortion bills comes on the heels of similar legislation Democratic Rep. Lorraine Fende of Willowick introduced earlier this year. Fende’s bill aimed to ban abortions when a woman is at least 22 weeks pregnant with a viable fetus. Fende’s bill is likely going nowhere now that Republicans have trumped her proposal with one of their own. But a case she made for her bill – involving the availability of late-term abortions in Ohio – also is central to Republicans’ plan to ban late-term abortions. "I had a conversation with someone quite some time ago that right now, you could be 8½ months’ pregnant and have an abortion for no reason," Fende told The Columbus Dispatch for a story published Jan. 17. Similarly, proponents of Republicans’ plan to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy decried the occurrence of abortions in Ohio up to the ninth month of pregnancy. While advocates and opponents of the proposed ban on late-term abortions prepare to debate this sensitive issue as it moves through the legislature, it is important to keep the facts straight. So we decided to check out Fende’s claim. Fende said she relied on statistics from the Ohio Department of Health. Doctors who perform an abortion in Ohio must submit to the department a Confidential Abortion Report, which does not include the woman’s name or other identifying information. According to the Ohio Department of Health, four abortions were performed in Ohio after 32 weeks (or eight months) of pregnancy in 2009, the most recent year in which statistics are available. Two abortions were performed when the mother was 32 weeks along; one abortion took place at 33 weeks; and one occurred at 35 weeks. Overall, 28,721 abortions were reported in Ohio in 2009. Of those, 613 involved pregnancies at least 20 weeks along and 116 of them were for women at least 24 weeks pregnant. The length of the pregnancy was unknown in 276 cases. The numbers confirm that at least one abortion occurred in Ohio when a mother was at least 8½ months’ pregnant. Fende said she was aware of this one abortion when she made her claim, and she said she did not know the reason behind it. Ohio law does not include an absolute ban on abortions when a woman is 8½, 8¾ or even 9 months’ pregnant. State lawmakers tried to pass a late-term abortion ban in 1995, but the U.S. Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled the ban was unconstitutional because medical exceptions to the ban were not sufficiently specific. Courts, however, have upheld Ohio’s a ban on partial-birth abortions, which are performed after part of the fetus has been removed from the mother’s body. Partial-birth abortion is associated with late-term pregnancy but the two are not mutually exclusive. There are other abortion procedures, permitted under Ohio law, that can terminate a late-term pregnancy. Although certain late-term abortions are legal, pro-choice advocates say they are only done for medical reasons – not for "no reason," as Fende suggested. Kellie Copeland, executive director of NARAL Pro-Choice Ohio, said abortion clinics in the state will not perform an abortion if the woman has been pregnant for at least 24 weeks. She said any abortion performed afterward would take place in a hospital for medical reasons. Jessie Hill, a professor at the Case Western Reserve University School of Law, said abortions when a woman is 8½ months pregnant don’t happen in Ohio for no reason. "It’s just one of those things that’s unheard of," said Hill, who has researched reproductive rights. Hill said she is pro-choice. Michael Gonidakis, executive director for Ohio Right to Life, said that most abortion clinics advertise for abortions at 24 weeks or earlier. But, Gonidakis pointed out, statistics from the Ohio Department of Health show abortions are happening beyond 24 weeks. The statistics do not show whether the abortions are taking place in a hospital or an abortion clinic. But, upon request from the Democrats for Life of Ohio, the Department of Health provided data on the medical condition of women receiving an abortion after they had been pregnant for at least 23 weeks. The data was taken from the abortion reports doctors submitted to the department. The report includes a question about the patient’s medical condition, whether it was "good," "fair," or "other." Of the 116 abortions in 2009 performed when the woman was reported to be 24 weeks pregnant or more, all of them were listed in good medical condition, according to the Department of Health. So where does this leave us? The law does not explicitly outlaw such an abortion, but state health records show there was just one such case in 2009, and Fende said she did not have the background of that case. And a law professor who is an expert in reproductive rights told us that abortions at 8½ months aren't done for just "no reason." Fende’s claim was legally sound. But by itself it does not reflect what the state Department of Health is documenting. That there was just one case out of more than 28,700 abortions in 2009 that fits her statement is an additional piece of information needed to fully understand the claim. On the Truth-O-Meter that rates as Mostly True.	None	Lorraine Fende	None	None	None	2011-02-04T06:00:00	2011-01-17	['Ohio']

Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, repeated a talking point that Democrats -- including President Barack Obama -- have cited frequently as evidence that the nation needs to pass a major health care reform bill. "Today and every day," Harkin said, "an estimated 14,000 Americans will lose their health insurance coverage." In July, PolitiFact rated a virtually identical statement by Obama as Mostly True. But because we based that evaluation on unemployment numbers that were current at the time -- and because Democrats have continued to repeat the statistic, including four lawmakers who made floor speeches on Nov. 7, 2009, the day the House passed its version of the health care bill -- we decided the talking point was due for a checkup. Before we look at the statement's validity today, let's recap how the statistic emerged in the first place. In July, the White House told us the number came from a report published by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. A chart in the report was headlined, “14,000 People Became Uninsured Every Day in December and January.” This claim was, in turn, based on a model developed by Urban Institute health care scholar John Holahan. Holahan was the co-author, with A. Bowen Garrett, of the January 2009 study, “Rising Unemployment, Medicaid and the Uninsured,” published by the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. That study provided the underpinning for the Center for American Progress report by estimating how many people can expect to lose their insurance, and not quickly get new coverage, when the national unemployment rate goes up. Essentially, what Holahan did is set up a model to measure the number of Americans who would lose their insurance when the unemployment rate rises from point A to point B. Holahan and his co-author, using a baseline of 4.6 percent unemployment in 2007, calculated that 2.6 million people would lose coverage if the unemployment rate climbed to 7 percent; 3.7 million if it went to to 8 percent; 4.8 million at 9 percent; and 5.8 million at 10 percent. The estimates took into account people who lost their jobs but then switched to a spouse’s plan or extended their coverage through COBRA, the federal law that guarantees people who lose their job can still get continued health coverage. Applying Holahan's calculations to the actual rise in unemployment from November 2008 to June 2009, we found that the number was right around the 14,000 people per month that Obama cited. We checked with health care experts, and they, too, agreed that the 14,000 number was just about right. But now, five months later, the unemployment situation has changed. We decided to run the numbers for two scenarios, one that started well before the period we had checked in July, and one that started later. • Health insurance lost since the start of the recession . The National Bureau of Economic Research is the official arbiter of when recessions begin and end, and it has declared the start of the current recession as December 2007. So for our first scenario, we looked at figures from December 2007 to November 2009, the last month for which we have unemployment statistics. During that two-year period, unemployment rose from 4.9 percent to 10 percent. In his paper, Holahan had said that a rise from 4.6 percent to 10 percent would leave 5.8 million people without insurance, so the slightly smaller rise in the actual unemployment figures should translate into about 5.5 million people losing insurance over that period. When you divide 5.5 million by 731 days, you get 7,524 people losing insurance per day -- only about half the amount regularly cited by Democrats. • Health insurance lost during the Obama presidency . If you take the period since Obama has been in office (and you count January 2009, even though he was only president for part of that month), the unemployment rate has risen from 7.6 percent to 10 percent. If you estimate the data based on Holahan's model, that would amount to 2.6 million jobs lost over 11 months. Dividing 2.6 million by 334 days, you get 7,784 people losing insurance every day -- a number very close to what we found for the recession as a whole, and, once again, only about half of what Democrats have been saying all these months. Estimates under the model "are very sensitive to the timeframe used," Holahan told PolitiFact. The way the model works, it requires monthly updating to make sure the talking point stays accurate. And we'll even accept a portion of the blame for validating the claim in July without updating it until now. When we made our initial assessment in July, we happened to look at a period of especially rapid job losses. That makes a difference because, under this model, the more the unemployment rate rises in a short period of time, the more Americans lose their insurance on a daily basis. As the rate of job losses has declined since July, the daily rate of Americans losing insurance has declined as well. If the number is now roughly 8,000 -- a number that's still nothing to sneeze at -- then Democrats should be saying it's roughly 8,000. So we rate Harkin's statement False.

pomt-03819	"In the last two years, we have reduced the deficit by $2.5 trillion."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/21/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-deficit-has-been-reduced-25-trilli/	During a recent floor speech, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., touted his chamber’s role in cutting the deficit. "In the last two years," he said, "we have reduced the deficit by $2.5 trillion." This claim struck us as odd, since the annual federal deficit has hovered around $1 trillion for the past three years -- and we knew from all the rhetoric about America’s deficit crisis that we hadn’t suddenly surged into a budget surplus. So we checked into it. First, some background on the deficit. A "deficit" refers to the amount by which spending exceeds revenues. It’s a measure calculated based on one year’s worth of spending and revenues. (The term "debt" refers to the cumulative total of all previous deficits, minus all previous surpluses.) In fiscal year 2011, the deficit was slightly below $1.3 trillion. By the following year, it had shrunk to less than $1.1 trillion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. And by 2013, the CBO projects a deficit of $845 billion. By year’s end, the 2013 figure could end up being higher or lower. The deficit for 2013 could shrink due to across-the-board cuts known as the sequester, which are projected to reduce spending by an additional $85 billion in 2013. And the deficit could shrink further if tax revenues exceed their projected amount (or the deficit could expand if the economy sours and tax revenues don’t meet expectations.) But if we allow for some uncertainty, these figures show that the deficit has declined over the past two years by about $455 billion. That’s less than one-fifth of what Reid claimed. When we contacted Reid’s office, a spokesman pointed us to a memo written in January 2013 by Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., who chairs the Senate Budget Committee. In this memo, Murray uses CBO figures to calculate that the deficit fell by a combined $2.4 trillion due to the two major fiscal deals of the past two years -- the legislation that ended the 2011 debt ceiling standoff and the legislation that avoided the fiscal cliff around New Year’s Day 2013. Murray did not include the sequester cuts in this calculation. (According to Reid’s prepared remarks, he had intended to say $2.4 trillion but actually said $2.5 trillion on the floor.) But there are some asterisks included in Murray’s memo that Reid, in his floor speech, skipped over. The $2.4 trillion in deficit reductions include projected savings over a 10-year period -- 2013 to 2022. In Washington budget wonkery, this is par for the course -- when bills are being debated, their fiscal impact is usually calculated over the bill’s first 10 years of existence. But Reid transformed the memo’s headline number into a claim that "in the last two years, we have reduced the deficit by $2.5 trillion." This is problematic for two reasons. First, by using the past tense "reduced," Reid implies that these deficit reductions have already taken place. Instead, they would take place in the future -- and there’s no guarantee that they will materialize. Second, he said "in the last two years," when in fact the $2.4 trillion in deficit reduction is projected to take place over the next 10 years. "I know this is oversimplifying and it doesn’t work this way, but a 10-year deficit reduction averages out to $240 billion per year, or $480 billion over two years," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. "That’s a big difference. Because it’s so easy to spin the numbers, precision is critically important in budget items." Our ruling Reid said, "In the last two years, we have reduced the deficit by $2.5 trillion." There has been some deficit reduction in recent years, but Reid's makes it sound much larger than it actually is. The $2.4 trillion number represents a projection of what is expected (but not guaranteed) to happen in the future over a 10-year period. It is not deficit reduction that has already been banked over the past two years. We rate the statement False.	None	Harry Reid	None	None	None	2013-03-21T14:46:26	2013-03-19	['None']
pomt-15313	"Texas still owns all of its public lands. If the federal gov't wants to create a park, they must ask permission!"	half-true	/texas/statements/2015/jul/17/glenn-hegar/glenn-hegar-says-texas-owns-its-public-lands-uncle/	Before Independence Day, a Texas leader said the federal government needs permission to plant a park in the state. Glenn Hegar, the state comptroller, said in a June 24, 2015, tweet: "Texas still owns all of its public lands. If the federal gov't wants to create a park, they must ask permission!" Two national parks are in West Texas and the Padre Island National Seashore is on South Padre Island. Also in Texas at the time Hegar tweeted, the U.S. National Park Service listed a national preserve, a national monument, two national historical trails, two national recreation areas, three national historical parks, a national monument, a national memorial, a national preserve and a designated wild and scenic river in the state (all there before another monument, the Waco Mammoth Site, was announced after Hegar exclaimed). We noticed too that a park service web page displays the remarkably brief American Antiquities Act of 1906, signed into law by Theodore Roosevelt. That law authorizes a president to declare national monuments on lands owned or controlled by the federal government. The act states that "when such objects are situated upon a tract covered by a bona fide unperfected claim or held in private ownership, the tract, or so much thereof as may be necessary for the proper care and management of the object, may be relinquished to the Government, and the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized to accept the relinquishment of such tracts in behalf of the Government of the United States." So land can be given up for a park or such, per the act. But there’s nothing about seeking permission from a state. Hegar’s statement also intrigued us because of how little land the federal government owns in Texas. In August 2014, an advocate with the Colorado-based Center for Western Priorities pointed us toward a Nov. 14, 2008, Heritage Foundation map of the U.S., drawing on federal data, showing Uncle Sam owns 2 percent of the land in Texas but far more land in western states that as a condition of joining the union had agreed to give up any stake in otherwise unclaimed lands in their respective boundaries. Hegar’s backup To our inquiry about Hegar's tweet, Liz White of his campaign operation said Hegar reached his conclusion starting from a Random Facts website that included this entry: "Texas still owns all of its public lands. If the federal government wants to create a park or cut a stand of timber, it must first ask the state’s permission." On the site, a footnote attributed the "permission" statement to a 2003 book, "Texas: Facts and Symbols," which we found in the children’s section of a branch of the Austin Public Library. The 24-page book presents various facts (as in: Texas got its name from the Caddo word tejas [TAY-hawss]). But it lacks mention of Texas owning its public lands or the federal government needing the state’s permission to create a park. In her email to us, White suggested Hegar’s statement also was supported by a report by the Texas General Land Office, an agency that's been around since before Texas’s statehood; it lately oversees more than 13 million acres of land generating money for Texas public schools. The cited report, last updated in January 2015, states that before statehood, Texas in 1844: "submitted a treaty of annexation to the United States Congress. Under its terms, Texas would have given 175,000,000 acres of public land to the United States government and the United States would have assumed Texas's debts of $10,000,000. The United States Congress rejected the treaty on grounds that the Texas public domain was not worth $10,000,000. When Texas was annexed to the United States in 1845 by a joint resolution of Congress, Texas retained both its debts and its public land. Texas was the only state, other than the original 13 colonies, to enter the Union with control over its public land… Today, over 22.5 million acres of land remain in the Texas public domain." So Texas kept its public lands at statehood. White also pointed out a federal park service web page on the Big Bend park, which she described as demonstrating the federal government asked permission from the state to acquire land for a park. The cited passage: "In the 1930's many people who loved the Big Bend country saw that it was a land of unique contrast and beauty that was worth preserving for future generations. The State of Texas passed legislation to acquire land in the area which was to become the Texas Canyons State Park. In 1935, the Federal Government passed legislation that would enable the acquisition of the land for a national park. The State of Texas deeded the land that they had acquired to the Federal government, and on June 12, 1944, Big Bend National Park became a reality." That didn’t seem like an explicit mention of permission being sought. In the spirit of that excerpt, we looked briefly into how the pair of other major national parks came to be in Texas. A Texas State Historical Association web page says the Guadalupe Mountains park came about after a family in the 1930s offered to donate 300 acres of scenic McKittrick Canyon to the state of Texas. "By the 1960s, land donations and sales to the National Park Service paved the way for the establishment of a national park" in 1972, the web page says. And U.S. Sen. Ralph Yarborough initiated legislation to create the Padre Island National Seashore in 1957, a park service timeline indicates. Another agency web page says President Kennedy signed the park measure into law in 1962. Land was acquired from 1962 through 1969 and the park opened in 1970, the timeline says. Land commissioners divide Bumfuzzled about the "permission" part of Hegar’s tweet, we asked aides to the current land commissioner, George P. Bush, and a couple of his predecessors for guidance. Agency spokeswoman Brittany Eck said by email that if the federal government wanted to convert state-owned lands to a federal park, any sale would have to be approved by state lawmakers. By phone, two former land commissioners, Republican Jerry Patterson and Democrat Garry Mauro, separately gave contradictory answers. Patterson said that given that the federal government doesn’t already own a lot of Texas land convertible to parks, "they'd have to get it. They’d have to buy the land," he said, "which implies" getting permission. Mauro said the federal government doesn’t need permission from Texas to create a park. "That’s just a fact," Mauro said. "The federal government can condemn what it wants to condemn." Historian for park service We also reached out to Robert Sutton, chief historian of the National Park Service, who said by phone it was news to him that the federal government had to ask permission to open a park in Texas. By email, Sutton subsequently said he checked the March 1845 congressional resolution setting terms for Texas joining the union, which says Texas is to keep its public lands but doesn’t say anything about the federal government needing to ask permission to use Texas-owned land, Sutton noted, for any purpose. "So, and I'm certainly not a constitutional lawyer, but I would say that the claim that the feds need to ask for permission is incorrect," Sutton wrote. We shared Sutton’s take with Lauren Willis, spokeswoman for Hegar’s state office. By email, Willis said it struck her as "one historian’s opinion." Our ruling Hegar tweeted: "Texas still owns all of its public lands. If the federal gov't wants to create a park, they must ask permission!" The first part of Hegar’s statement is obvious: Texas owns its 22.5 million acres of public land, with the federal government owning less than 2 percent of Texas acreage, much of it in the Big Bend National Park. It also stands to reason the federal government wouldn’t open a park in the state without interacting with state officials, perhaps seeking a land deal. However, Hegar didn’t provide, nor did we turn up, evidence that the feds must ask permission to open a park in Texas. Hegar’s statement comes out half-obvious, half-unsupported--and Half True.

pomt-06821	"In the '80s, Democrats promised spending cuts, but delivered only tax hikes."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/10/ron-paul/ron-pau-ad-says-democrats-only-want-tax-increases/	Rep. Ron Paul's first television ad hits a popular Republican theme. It says Democrats aren't serious about balancing the federal budget because they want only tax hikes, not spending cuts. The ad’s narrator says: "In the '80s they did it to Reagan. A debt ceiling compromise. Democrats promising spending cuts, but delivering only tax hikes. The 90s brought more compromises, more broken promises and more new taxes. This August, the next chapter will be written. A defining moment. $14 trillion in debt. Millions unemployed. The dollar in decline. We know where they stand, but will our party's leaders repeat the mistakes of the past? Will they choose compromise or conviction? One candidate has always been true: Ron Paul. Cut spending. Balance the budget. No deals. Standing up to the Washington machine, guided by principle. Restore America now." In this item, we'll explore Paul's claim that during the debt ceiling debate in the 1980s, the Democrats "delivered only tax hikes." After all, former President Ronald Reagan himself used "Trust, but verify," as a signature phrase throughout his presidency. We didn't get a response to multiple calls to Paul's campaign, but the ad cited a source for the claim: a New York Times story on Sept. 28, 1987. The story talks about debates over the 1988 federal budget, during which President Reagan and Congress were working on an agreement to reach a deficit of no more than $144 billion, or face $23 billion in spending cuts. The article refers to Reagan’s "reluctant agreement" on the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Reaffirmation Act of 1987, which amended the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit and Control Act of 1985, commonly referred to as the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act after its three chief sponsors. Contrary to Paul's claim, we found Democrats were involved in that law and other efforts at cutting spending in the 1980s. One of the sponsors of the 1985 act, Sen. Ernest Hollings, a Democrat from South Carolina, was one of the congressional leaders seeking deficit reduction in 1985. Hollings was a member of the Budget Committee in the 99th Congress, when the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act was enacted, a committee on which his co-sponsors Republican Senators Phil Gramm (Tex.) and Warren Rudman (N.H.) would later serve. "The Gramm-Rudman-Hollings process was bipartisan, it was two Republican Senators and a Democratic Senator, and it allowed both spending cuts and tax increases," Stan Collender, widely respected budget analyst and writer for Roll Call’s "Fiscal Fitness" column said, speaking of the 1985 act. "It didn’t distinguish" between the two approaches, Collender said. "The original version only had deficit targets, it didn’t tell you how to get here from there," Collender said. "It could’ve been easily used to raise funds or cut spending." The 1985 Balanced Budget Act aimed to eliminate the deficit by requiring fixed deficit targets, enforced through sequestration -- automatic, across-the-board spending cuts made by the beginning of the fiscal year -- if necessary, to keep the estimated deficit within determined limits. Its aim was reaching a balanced budget by FY 1991. Since the spending cuts would be automatic unless a deficit reduction plan was agreed to, it was considered a severe but effective incentive for Congress and the President to come together on budgetary goals. It passed 271-154 in the Democratic majority House and 61-31 in the Republican majority Senate before President Reagan signed the bill into law December 12, 1985. The process for determining the amount of automatic cuts was later determined unconstitutional in the case of Bowsher v. Synar in 1986. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings Act violated constitutional separation of powers, giving the Comptroller General (whom Congress can remove from office) authority to order the president to carry out the automatic cuts. The Balanced Budget Reaffirmation Act of 1987 amended Gramm-Rudman-Hollings’ sequestration procedure by giving its authority to director of the OMB. In addition, automatic spending cuts would be split, 50-50, between the military budget and other domestic spending areas -- excluding Social Security, federal pensions and many programs targeting the lower income Americans. Senate Budget Committee chairman Lawton Chiles (D-Fla.) and Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.), chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, were major supporters of the 1987 act, which is also referred to as Gramm-Rudman-Hollings. A Chicago Tribune article Aug. 2, 1987 quotes Rostenkowski as saying, "‘I’d like to put it right on Ron`s desk and say, ‘Okay, pal, you sign the . . . bill’ or defense will be slashed." John B. Gilmour’s book, Reconcilable Differences?: Congress, the Budget Process, and the Deficit highlights Democrats' efforts with the 1987 amendment, where "Prominent Democrats were among the (1987) plan's most energetic supporters while Republican leaders hung back and voiced their growing doubts...(Chiles and Rostenkowski) both supported the revival of Gramm-Rudman because they believed that the threat of defense cuts would force the president to accept tax increases." After the 1987 Act underwent amendments to satisfy the House and the Senate, a conference report was agreed to in the Democratic-Majority House by 230 to 176 and agreed to in the Democratic-Majority Senate by 64 to 34, before President Reagan signed the act Sept. 29, 1987. It is not accurate to say the Democrats supported only tax increases with Gramm-Rudman-Hollings and the amended version of the act of 1987, Collender said. "It wasn’t all tax increases (with Gramm-Rudman-Hollings). That’s just campaign speech hyperbole," Collender said. Not only did the 1987 act allow deficit reduction through mechanisms other than tax increases, the act was shaped in part by Republican senators and signed by a Republican president. Reagan was reluctant to sign the amended Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation because of potential harm it could cause through automatic cuts to military spending, if they were triggered. He ended up signing the Reaffirmation Act of 1987, however, because it included a debt ceiling increase. Following the signing of the 1987 Reaffirmation Act, efforts resumed between the president and Congress to reach a budget deficit compromise before the act's Nov. 20 trigger for the automatic cuts. Over time, Reagan softened his stance that he would veto any tax increases. President Reagan signed a final budget deficit reduction plan into law Dec. 23, 1987, a measure that included $9.1 billion in tax increases, spending cuts in a variety of domestic sectors and sales of some government assets. Automatic cuts put into place by Gramm-Rudman-Hollings did take place in FY 1986, FY 1988 and FY 1990. In FY 1987 and FY 1989, deficit reduction plans exceeded the targets by $5 billion and $17 billion, respectively, and automatic cuts were not triggered. Our ruling Paul claims that during the 1980 budget negotiations, Democrats only sought tax increases. But the record indicates that they supported deficit reduction packages that included significant reductions in spending. We find his claim False.

pomt-11914	In the U.S. asylum system, "claims of 'fear to return' have skyrocketed, and the percentage of claims that are genuinely meritorious are down."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/19/jeff-sessions/jeff-sessions-claim-about-asylum-system-fraudulent/	Attorney General Jeff Sessions claimed the U.S. asylum system swelled with false cries for help during the presidency of Barack Obama, suppressing genuine claims and overloading the immigration system. Sessions said the the Obama administration allowed most immigrants who passed an initial credible fear review to be released into the United States pending a full hearing. "These changes — and case law that has expanded the concept of asylum well beyond congressional intent — created even more incentives for illegal aliens to come here and claim a fear of return," Sessions told the Executive Office of Immigration Review on Oct. 12. "The consequences are just what you’d expect. Claims of fear to return have skyrocketed, and the percentage of claims that are genuinely meritorious are down." Sessions and President Donald Trump share a goal of changing the asylum process. In his October list of immigration principles and policies, Trump outlined tighter controls of the asylum process, including elevating the threshold standard of proof in credible fear interviews. On the question of fewer meritorious asylum claims, however, there is no data that plainly speaks to that trend. Sessions pieced together an argument that relies on assumptions and ignores the growth of refugees. "Indeed, there has certainly been an increase in asylum claims — but this corresponds with the increase in refugees around the world," said Lindsay M. Harris, an assistant professor of law and co-director of the immigration and Human Rights Clinic at the University of the District of Columbia, David A. Clarke School of Law. She continued, "One of the humanitarian crises producing refugees happens to be south of our border, and this accounts for the exponential increase in asylum claims and individuals seeking protection in the U.S. through the credible fear system, rather than a sudden increase in fraudulent claims." Thousands of Central Americans have left their countries in recent years due to gang violence and poverty. Asylum claims in the United States Asylum in the United States may be granted to foreign nationals based on persecution or fear of persecution back in their home countries or last country of residence on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. To Sessions, the process in which asylum officers find individuals have a credible fear of persecution "has become an easy ticket to illegal entry into the United States." Laws were "never intended to provide asylum to all those who fear generalized violence, crime, personal vendettas, or a lack of job prospects," Sessions said. The Obama administration in 2009 announced policy changes to automatically consider for parole individuals who had a credible fear of persecution or torture. (Previously, parole had to be requested in writing) The change became effective in January 2010. Harris said there’s been no evidence to suggest that the policy change influenced people to flee their homes and seek protection in the United States. The increase in people seeking asylum was "very much based on the humanitarian crisis in central America," she said. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Credible fear numbers Federal data do show a significant spike in credible fear cases from 2009 to 2016. But it is not a simple comparison. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services in fiscal year 2016 decided on nearly 93,000 credible fear cases, and fear was established in about 78 percent of the cases. The agency in fiscal year 2009 reviewed more than 5,000 cases, but that data does not specify in the number where fear was established. This information, however, would not answer whether the findings of credible fear were genuinely deserving. That is difficult to quantify, experts said. Sessions said that many individuals who are released after a credible fear determination never show up to their immigration hearings or even file an asylum application once they are in the United States — suggesting "they knew their asylum claims lacked merit and that their claim of fear was simply a ruse to enter the country illegally." The assessment that not applying for asylum is an indication of fraud is "absolutely not true," said Harris, the University of the District of Columbia professor. Asylum seekers are released with "very little orientation" of what’s expected next and many even think they have already applied by having articulated their case to asylum officers. Some even think they have already been granted asylum upon released, Harris added. Additionally, Sessions noted that in 2016 there were "700 percent more removal orders issued in absentia for cases that began with a credible fear claim than in 2009." But a failure to appear before a judge doesn’t necessarily mean the asylum claim was baseless, experts said. In-absentia orders and individuals’ failure to go to court may also be attributed to other factors, such as errors in address reporting by the respondent, errors in addresses in the notices from the courts to the respondents in proceedings, lack of education and inability to receive mail, said Geoffrey A. Hoffman, director of the University of Houston Law Center Immigration Clinic and a clinical associate professor. Individuals represented by counsel are also much more likely to attend court, Hoffman said. "The issue of fraud in individual cases should not overshadow the reality which is that grants of asylum are extremely low, especially for applicants who are not represented by counsel," Hoffman added. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Federal agencies have limited capabilities to detect asylum fraud. Applicants may have fled their countries without a passport or birth certificate, may have left countries where "documentary evidence was not available," or may have fled using fraudulent documents in order to hide their identity and escape persecution, said a December 2015 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office. "As such, asylum officers and immigration judges must make decisions, at times, with little or no documentation to support or refute an applicant’s claim," said the GAO report. "Like any administrative system, there has long been fraud in the asylum process. I don’t think anyone knows how widespread it is, but the Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate at USCIS has been in place since 2004 and has been successful in weeding out at least some of the fraud," said Jaya Ramji-Nogales, an immigration law expert and professor at Temple University. Our ruling Sessions said, "Claims of fear to return have skyrocketed, and the percentage of claims that are genuinely meritorious are down." The number of claims by immigrants citing credible fear to return to their home countries has significantly increased from 2009 to 2016. While there has been fraud in the asylum system, it’s uncertain and difficult to determine whether the percentage of "genuinely meritorious" credible fear claims is down, experts said.

pomt-08258	Republican plan to extend Bush tax cuts "would double deficit projections going forward for the next couple of decades."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2010/nov/11/tim-kaine/kaine-says-republican-effort-extend-bush-tax-cuts-/	There’s a heavy cost to extending the Bush-era tax cuts, according to Tim Kaine, chairman of the Democratic National Committee. "What the Republicans want to do is extend these tax cuts, make them permanent to the wealthy, and the CBO (Congressional Budget Office) has estimated that would double the deficit projections going forward for the next couple of decades," Kaine, a former Virginia governor, said during a CNN interview. Double the deficit? We decided to check. First, a word of background. The tax cuts, enacted by Congress in 2001 and 2003, lowered rates on income, capital gains and dividends and: eventually eliminated the estate tax; eased burdens on married couples, parents and the working poor; increased tax credits for retirement savings and education. The cuts are set to expire at the end of the year unless Congress extends them. A spokesman for the Democratic National Committee said Kaine based on his statement on a CBO report released in September. We dug up the study and found Kaine was correct. "A permanent extension of all those tax cuts without future increases in taxes or reductions in federal spending would roughly double the projected budget deficit in 2020," the report said. The CBO projects the 2020 deficit -- based on an assumption that the tax cuts will not be extended -- at $685 billion. Republican congressional leaders want to make the tax cuts permanent. "This is from a Republican Party that’s been griping about deficits," Kaine said on CNN. But by bringing up deficits, Kaine also sawed at the branch President Obama and many other Democrats have perched on during the tax debate. They’ve wanted to eliminate that tax cuts for the "wealthy," defined as families with annual incomes exceeding $250,000 and individuals who make more than $200,000. Democrats have supported extending the reductions to families and individuals beneath those thresholds. Here’s the rub: Eliminating tax cuts for the wealthy and keeping them for everyone else doesn’t save big money. The Democratic tax plan would leave a projected deficit in 2020 that would be "roughly three-quarters to four-fifths" as high as that caused by the GOP plan to eliminate all the levies, according to the same CBO report cited by Kaine. Kaine didn’t mention this on CNN. "What he said is factually correct," said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center in Washington. "What he didn’t say is that the Democratic plan to extend taxes for 98 percent of the population shoots almost as big a hole in the budget as the Republican plan." We agree that the buyer must beware when browsing political statements. Kaine is correct in saying that the CBO estimates the Republican tax plan would double deficit in 2020. But he omits an important fact: The Democratic plan would would increase the deficit by almost as much. As a result, we rate Kaine’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-13766	"America has lost nearly one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/21/donald-trump/trump-gives-half-story-trade-deals-clintons-and-fa/	Donald Trump tapped into a deep well of bitterness over jobs and trade to win the Republican nomination and in his acceptance speech, he placed the blame squarely on the shoulders of his Democratic opponent. "America has lost nearly one third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997, following the enactment of disastrous trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton," Trump told a roaring crowd. Trump offered the same statistic when he laid out his economic policies at a speech in Pennsylvania in June. That speech went into more detail, and best of all for fact-checkers, his campaign footnoted his sources in the transcript. As he did at the convention, in that policy speech, Trump faulted the Clintons. "At the center of this catastrophe are two trade deals pushed by Bill and Hillary Clinton," he said in Pennsylvania. "First, the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA. Second, China's entry into the World Trade Organization." As we looked into Trump’s words, we found that his numbers are fine. The impact of the trade deals on manufacturing, and his singling out of the Clintons, are more problematic. By the way, while Hillary Clinton played no official role in either deal, in the past, she came down in favor of both them, even if she noted their failings. The numbers Bureau of Labor Statistics data show that manufacturing jobs dropped by about 30 percent between 1997 and 2016. About 17.4 million people worked in manufacturing at the start of the period. Today, their ranks have fallen to about 12.3 million. Trump has his numbers right. Impact of the trade deals The North American Free Trade Agreement dates to 1994 and created an open trade zone across Mexico, the United States and Canada. The deal with China wasn’t a trade agreement in the same way. Instead, in 2001, Congress cleared the path for China to become part of the World Trade Organization. That locked in lower tariffs, spurred investment in China and produced a lot more movement of goods. While Trump regularly says that NAFTA sent jobs to Mexico, the net effect on all jobs, including manufacturing, is hard to pin down. In contrast, there’s broad agreement that the change with China did cost America millions of jobs. The Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan think tank of Congress, concluded in 2015 that NAFTA likely had little impact on jobs one way or the other. That’s generally the consensus view, although some economists think NAFTA did hurt American jobs. On China, research by economists Justin Pierce at the Federal Reserve and Peter Schott at Yale University, suggests over 1 million jobs have been lost due to trade with China. Trump has relied heavily on the research of Robert Scott, director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the Economic Policy Institute, to make his point. The institute isn’t the sort of source traditionally used by Republicans. It supports a hefty increase in the minimum wage and higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations. Scott estimates that America lost over 700,000 jobs to Mexico and about 2 million manufacturing jobs due to a rising trade deficit with China. But Scott takes exception to Trump’s use of his work. "The story is complex, and certainly neither the Clinton’s, nor trade deals alone, explain the loss of 5.3 million manufacturing jobs since 1998 when manufacturing employment peaked," Scott told us. "No one has adequately teased apart all of the causes." In an op-ed, Scott listed several other factors that have hurt American workers, including the policies of the Federal Reserve, a stagnant minimum wage and a lack of public investment in infrastructure. Martin Baily, a trade economist at the Brookings Institution, an academic center in Washington, puts even less stock in the impact of the two trade deals. He points to longer term trends. "The share of manufacturing employment in total U.S. employment has been declining for at least 50 years and the rate of decline in that share did not accelerate either because of NAFTA or China," Baily said. He told us that as much as Americans like their flat-screen TV and other goods, our demand for services like health care has grown faster. That has cut into manufacturing employment. And then, there’s the impact of technology in factories. "Productivity growth has meant that it takes fewer people to make the goods," Baily said. So it’s fair to say that NAFTA may or may not have reduced American manufacturing jobs (with the consensus falling on the side that it didn’t), and that the China deal probably did. But in no case do economists put the entire number of jobs lost on either of the trade deals. Blaming the Clintons The third part of Trump’s claim is that the trade deals and their alleged failures are the fault of the Clintons. This is another shaky part of Trump’s claim. Scott at the Economic Policy Institute noted that "most of the votes needed to pass NAFTA in 1993 were provided by members of Trump’s own party." President Bill Clinton was certainly a supporter, but he had plenty of Republican help. Susan Houseman, senior economist at the Upjohn Institute for Employment Research, a labor policy center in Michigan, said that manufacturing jobs grew in the years immediately following passage of NAFTA. It wasn’t until the China deal that they fell rapidly. Houseman told us the details of that were worked out under President George W. Bush. "The sharp drop in manufacturing jobs coincided with China's accession to the WTO in 2001, which in any event was supported by both Democratic and Republican administrations," Houseman said. Our ruling Trump said that America has lost about a third of its manufacturing jobs since 1997 after enactment of two trade deals supported by Bill and Hillary Clinton. Government figures show about a 30 percent decline in manufacturing jobs. Bill Clinton advocated for both deals. And while Hillary Clinton played no official role, she has spoken in favor of trade agreements. But Trump’s statement overlooks that manufacturing employment climbed after passage of NAFTA. The general consensus among economists is that overall, NAFTA has neither helped nor hurt American workers. There’s broad agreement that China’s entry to the WTO has come at the price of many American manufacturing jobs, with estimates ranging from about a million to over 2 million. But that would be less than half of the manufacturing jobs lost that Trump talked about. Trump’s focus on the Clintons also overlooks the key role played by Republicans. In naming the Clintons, he leaves out at least half of the picture. There’s a measure of truth in Trump’s words, but he omits a lot of important information.

pomt-12720	"122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/07/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-blames-barack-obama-former-gu/	For his entire term, former President Barack Obama wanted to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but he was unsuccessful. President Donald Trump promises to keep it open, and he took to Twitter the morning of March 7 to criticize Obama for releasing Guantanamo detainees at all. "122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield. Just another terrible decision!" Trump tweeted — from both his personal account and the official White House account, @POTUS. Guantanamo detainee transfers are likely in the news because a March 2, 2017, U.S. military airstrike killed a former Guantanamo prisoner, Yasir Ali Abdallah al Silmi, who Obama released to Yemen in 2009. Trump’s claim that the Obama administration released 122 prisoners from Guantanamo that "returned to the battlefield" is right on the numbers but wrong on who is to blame. The vast majority of detainees who fall into Trump’s total were actually released during the administration of President George W. Bush. The 122 prisoners About every six months, the Director of National Intelligence releases figures about detainees transferred from Guantanamo and how many are known to have re-engaged in some sort of terrorist activity. The most recent report was published in September 2016 and includes data from 2002, when the prison opened, through July 2016. Here are the key figures: 693 detainees released from Guantanamo (532 while Bush was president, 161 during Obama’s two terms); of those: 122 confirmed of re-engaging in terrorist activity (113 Bush, 9 Obama); 86 suspected of re-engaging in terrorist activity, of those (75 Bush, 11 Obama); See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com So in the 15 years between when Guantanamo opened in 2002 and when the latest data was collected in 2016, 122 detainees were transferred out of the prison who the government believes have returned to some sort of terrorist activity. However, just nine of those transfers happened during the Obama administration. The remaining 113 — or over 92 percent — happened under Bush. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in his March 7 press briefing that Trump meant "in totality the number" of individuals released from Guantanamo who returned to the battlefield. An expert view Talking to PolitiFact for a related article in January, DePaul University counterrorism professor Thomas Mockaitis raised questions about the veracity of the numbers because of difficulties in monitoring the former detainees’ and their activity. "I do have concerns over the use of such figures without explanation or context," he said. "Many of those released are handed over to foreign states who assume responsibility for them. Tracking their activities after they leave Guantanamo can be problematic." In June 2014, the New America Foundation, a centrist think tank, compiled its own numbers of released former detainees, using Pentagon reports, news stories and other public information. At the time there were 620 released prisoners, and the foundation found that 54 of them "are either confirmed to be or suspected of engaging in militant activities against either the U.S. or non-U.S. targets." That was about one-third of the government’s figure of 184 at the time. The foundation has not updated the report since then. Our ruling Trump said, "122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield." The United States government has transferred nearly 700 detainees out of Guantanamo, and and 122 of them are "confirmed of re-engaging" in some sort of terrorist activity. But Trump wrongly rests the blame solely on the Obama administration. Of the 122 prisoners in question 113 were released before Obama took office. We rate Trump’s claim Mostly False. Update: On March 7, after Trump made his claim, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence published updated data about recidivism of former Guantanmo detainees. As of Jan. 15, the DNI reports 121 former detainees confirmed of re-engaging in terrorism, eight of whom were released during the Obama administration. That's one fewer than the earlier data we used in our report. Our rating of Mostly False remains the same.

pomt-14449	"The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago, is 13,000 miles (long)."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/07/donald-trump/donald-trump-right-great-wall-china-2000-years-old/	One of Donald Trump’s signature policy proposals during the 2016 presidential campaign has been to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. In remarks after the Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses, Trump drew an explicit comparison between his proposed wall and the Great Wall of China. "They say you’ll never be able to build a wall," Trump said on March 2, 2016. "Well, it’s 2,000 miles but we really need 1,000 miles. The Great Wall of China, built 2,000 years ago, is 13,000 miles, folks, and they didn’t have Caterpillar tractors, because I only want to use Caterpillar, if you want to know the truth, or John Deere. … We can do that so beautifully. And this is going to be a serious wall. This is going to be a high wall. This is going to be a very serious wall." A number of people asked us to check whether Trump’s description of the Great Wall -- that it was built 2,000 years ago and that it’s 13,000 miles long -- was accurate. After checking with scholars of the period, we found that the numbers Trump are grounded in reality, but that there’s a lot of nuance that’s been lost in the process. The wall was ‘built 2,000 years ago’ As a starting point for the Great Wall’s construction, "2,000 years ago" has some merit. The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) and other groups say that around 220 B.C., efforts began to link together existing earthen walls on modern-day China’s northern frontier. But today, those early walls are barely discernible, if at all. Better constructed portions of the wall only came into existence much later -- and over many centuries, said Lynn A. Struve, an East Asian historian at Indiana University and author of Time, Temporality, And Imperial Transition: East Asia From Ming To Qing.. "Almost every dynasty contributed to building the wall," said Arthur Waldron, an East Asian historian at the University of Pennsylvania and the author of the seminal 1992 volume, The Great Wall of China: From History to Myth. (The bottom portion of the figure below shows the full historical timeline.) Indeed, the most familiar and best-preserved portions of the wall are more recent than Trump indicated -- only 300 to 600 years old. They were built during the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), when the Great Wall became the world's largest military structure, according to UNESCO. "The Great Wall you see today was almost entirely built in the 1500s under the Ming dynasty," said Kenneth M. Swope, a University of Southern Mississippi historian and author of A Dragon's Head and a Serpent's Tail: Ming China and the First Great East Asian War, 1592-1598. The wall’s length ‘is 13,000 miles’ In citing this figure, Trump can point to an official statistic. In 2012, China's State Administration of Cultural Heritage released a five-year-long study that the wall is 13,170 miles long -- much longer than the previous estimate of 5,500 miles, which was limited to the Ming-era structures. But this number should be taken with a grain of salt, experts said. For starters, this includes all of the wall, not just the Ming-era portions. And just a fraction of these 13,000 miles includes intact walls. And contrary to the wall in Trump’s proposal, the wall "is not contiguous," Swope said. (This can be seen in the map portion of the graphic above.) Waldron calls the Chinese government’s estimate the most generous measurement. "China is endlessly puffing up the wall for the benefit of tourism," he said. He said his fairest estimate would be perhaps 1,700 miles, "with a solid line" around Beijing and "elsewhere a dotted line." In the view of the scholars we contacted, the wall also doesn’t serve as a particularly good model for Trump’s point. Historically, trade was generally a far more successful policy than warfare. Indeed, walls didn’t stop the Mongols and the Manchus from crossing the frontier and causing serious trouble, including, ultimately, the fall of the Ming and the establishment of the Manchu, or Qing, dynasty that lasted from 1644 to 1912. "The wall never worked," said Michael Szonyi, a professor of Chinese history at Harvard University and author of Practicing Kinship: Lineage and Descent in Late Imperial China. Waldron, who added that he is sympathetic to the notion of closing off U.S. borders more completely, nonetheless agreed with Szonyi’s assessment of the Great Wall. The Great Wall "didn't do what it was supposed to do, it was enormously costly, and there's no question that it caused great suffering among the people who built it," he told Mother Jones magazine. He added to PolitiFact, "I would say Trump is one of a long train of Western and Chinese people who bought into the mythology of the wall." Our ruling Trump said that the Great Wall of China was "built 2,000 years ago" and "is 13,000 miles" long. He has repeated two figures that are widely cited and, superficially at least, seem credible. But when we ran them by several experts in Chinese history, we found that the reality is more nuanced. Major unifications of early portions of the wall did occur about 2,200 years ago. However, the wall was built over the course of many centuries, and the best preserved, most iconic portions of the wall are a lot younger -- roughly 500 years old. Meanwhile, a Chinese government survey from 2012 reported a total length of 13,000 miles. However, this figure includes many bits and pieces of wall, some of them quite isolated. Trump’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-03-07T11:56:49	2016-03-02	['China']

pomt-07146	Says the state’s new collective bargaining law effectively eliminates police unions' ability to negotiate.	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/15/steve-loomis/union-president-steve-loomis-says-ohios-new-labor-/	Organized labor groups and Democrats started a campaign to repeal Ohio Senate Bill 5 as soon as Republican Gov. John Kasich signed it on March 31. They hope to have the issue on the Nov. 8 ballot. SB 5 is designed to give public employers more control over labor contracts to deal with declining revenue. Sharply reducing collective bargaining for public workers, the new law gives management a strong hand at the bargaining table because it eliminates binding arbitration in favor of a system that is weighted toward local governments. The replacement of binding arbitration has been a cornerstone issue for Republicans. Kasich made it a priority of his administration, arguing that public unions are too powerful at the bargaining table and that taxpayers had no say in costly labor contracts. Cleveland Police Patrolmen's Association President Steve Loomis and other labor leaders rallying for repeal said the new law effectively eliminates the ability of unions to negotiate at all. In fact, SB 5 explicitly gives police and fire unions the right to collectively bargain for wages and safety equipment. PolitiFact Ohio asked Loomis to explain. "He (Kasich) is not taking away our right to sit at the table," he said. "He is taking away the right to collectively bargain. "As it stands right now, both sides negotiate to an end or to a neutrally agreed upon position. If we come to an impasse, we solicit a professional arbitrator, usually American (Arbitration Association)." The neutral, third-party arbitrator is chosen by mutual agreement, Loomis said, and is empowered to impose a contract settlement. Under SB 5, if a union and governmental body cannot agree on a contract, a fact-finder from the State Employment Relations Board must be appointed to make recommendations. If the union and management reject the recommendations, the legislative body that oversees the workers, such as a city council, must vote to choose between the "last, best" offers of the workers and management. If the council does not act, the management offer becomes the new contract. And if council approves the higher-cost offer, there is a procedure by which both offers can be placed on the ballot to let voters choose. "There's no more neutrality," Loomis said. "One party gets to decide the outcome. The city council -- the people that we are negotiating with -- gets to decide whether the fact-finder's report is acceptable or not. If they decide it's acceptable, then we're done. If they decide it's unacceptable, then we go to arbitration. Who are the arbitrators? City council. So there is no collective bargaining here. "When you listen to the governor and he talks about 'I've given them the tools to control their costs,' that's exactly what he's talking about. He means 'I've given them the ability to create their own contracts by unfair arbitration.' " The new process is, in fact, heavily weighted by design for local officials and government bodies -- and for taxpayers, say SB 5 supporters such as Rep. Louis Blessing, a Cincinnati Republican. Under binding arbitration, "an unelected arbitrator can force a spending decision on local officials and the people they represent," he said. "There is no consent of the governed." Safety forces were given binding arbitration as part of Ohio's 1983 collective-bargaining law for public employees. In what was considered a trade-off, that law banned strikes by police and firefighters. In an interview, Senate President Tom Niehaus was asked what leverage or recourse would be left for safety forces without binding arbitration. "They're still going to have civil-service protections," he told The Columbus Dispatch. Sen. Bill Seitz of Cincinnati, one of six Republicans who voted against SB 5, said it imposes a "fundamentally rigged process" giving managers an unfair advantage over safety workers. "There is no collective bargaining process (with Senate Bill 5)," said another of the six, Sen. Tim Grendell of Chesterland. "Senate Bill 5 replaces public worker collective bargaining with public worker collective begging ... Under Senate Bill 5, we lose the ability to bargain." So there is accuracy in Loomis statement. Even some top Republican legislators would agree with him. SB 5 does greatly reduce safety force workers’ collective bargaining abilities and gives management the last word on which offer is chosen. But that last word kicks in if the two sides can’t agree on a contract. Safety forces do still have the ability to try to negotiate terms on wages and safety equipment. That’s a point of clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, Loomis' statement rates as Mostly True.	None	Steve Loomis	None	None	None	2011-06-15T06:00:00	2011-05-09	['None']

pomt-08323	"Mr. Hurt would re-open that darn (Medicare) doughnut hole."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2010/oct/29/tom-perriello/tom-perriello-says-robert-hurt-wants-reopen-medic/	It is legislation that shall remain nameless. But that didn't stop freshmen Democratic Rep. Tom Perriello of Virginia from attacking his opponent for opposing a provision in it, whatever it is. Perriello's ad, called "Seniors Can't Afford a World of Hurt," accuses his opponent, Republican state Sen. Robert Hurt, of wanting to reopen the so-called "doughnut hole" in Medicare prescription drug coverage for seniors. The ad begins in darkness with an elderly woman saying, "Bad people are trying to scare seniors into thinking our Medicare is going to get cut." She's apparently referring to Republican ads that have suggested Democrats cut Medicare when they approved the health care law. "Poppycock!" says the woman, turning on a light. "Tom Perriello has voted to protect my Medicare and to save me 50 percent on my prescriptions. "Mr Hurt would reopen that darn doughnut hole," she says. "And would start bankrupting Medicare in just six years. Shed some light on the facts and you'll see...Seniors can't afford a world of Hurt." First, let's be clear what we're talking about here: the controversial health care bill passed by Democrats earlier this year. You might not get that from the ad, unless you caught the fine print in the ad that sourced H.R. 3590. Of course, you'd also have to know that H.R. 3590 is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, aka the health care reform bill. Talk about soft-pedaling a controversial issue. Now, about that darn doughnut hole. The "hole" is a gap in coverage in the Medicare prescription drug program, which was passed by Congress in 2003. In 2010, seniors in the Medicare Part D program must pay the first $310 for prescriptions before coverage kicks in. For subsequent total drug costs between $310 and $2,830, the government will pay 75 percent and beneficiaries pay 25 percent. Then comes the hole: Starting at $2,830, beneficiaries must pay the entire costs until they hit an out-of-pocket limit of $4,550. After that, "catastrophic coverage" begins, with the government paying 95 percent of costs. The health care bill Democrats passed in March would phase out that gap over the next 10 years. This year, beneficiaries who reach the doughnut hole will receive a $250 rebate. After that, federal subsidies will enable the patient's share of the payment to be gradually reduced from 100 percent to 25 percent by 2020. At 25 percent, the doughnut hole range will have the same co-pay rate as the prior range. Closing the "doughnut hole" in the Medicare prescription drug plan was one of Obama's campaign promises, which PolitiFact tracks on our Obameter. In March, after the bill passed and was signed by Obama, we rated it a Promise Kept. Now, has Hurt said he wants to reopen the hole? He has been crystal clear about his opposition to the health care bill. At a Tea Party debate in March, for example, Hurt warned the bill would "kill jobs," add more regulation and higher taxes and amount to "government-run health care." Hurt has signed the DeFundIt.org pledge to withhold budget funding for the new health care law if he is elected. And he has vowed to fight to repeal the law altogether. OK, so the health care bill would eventually close the Medicare doughnut hole, and Hurt has vowed to defund and ultimately repeal the health care bill. Does that mean, necessarily, that he would reopen the doughnut hole? Republican leaders in Congress offered an alternative health care bill back in November of 2009. We read through the bill and couldn't find any plan to close the doughnut hole. Republicans said the main goal of their alternative plan was to lower the cost of health insurance in general. We also couldn't find anywhere that Hurt has spoken publicly on what he would do, specifically, about the Medicare doughnut hole. Hurt's campaign said he favors health care reform based on market oriented solutions that maintain quality of care and reduce costs. Back in March, the Hurt campaign told the The Daily Progress, in Charlottesville, Va., that Hurt supports "commonsense, market-based health care reforms" such as portability of plans, tort reform and allowing young people to remain on their parents' health insurance coverage for longer. "However, Senator Hurt does not believe that Draconian cuts to Medicare affecting every senior citizen in the 5th District, half-a-trillion in higher taxes, medical decisions made by bean-counters in Washington and not doctors in Charlottesville -- not to mention the largest increase in government power in generations -- is the answer to healthcare reform," Hurt's strategist, Chris LaCivita, wrote in an e-mail to the paper. We followed up with the Hurt campaign to get his position specifically on the doughnut hole. "Working to close the doughnut hole is an area that we all can agree should be addressed," said Amanda Henneberg, a spokeswoman for the Hurt campaign. The ad's claim is based on Hurt's position that he wants to repeal the Democrats' health care bill in general, and it included a provision to phase out the doughnut hole. Hurt has not explicitly said he wants to reopen the hole, so Perriello is connecting some dots to make his case. In fact, Hurt's campaign says that while he wants to repeal the health care bill, Hurt believes working to close the doughnut hole is an area that should be addressed. That doesn't strike us as a full-throated pledge to close the gap the way the Democratic bill did, but it suggests Hurt is willing to consider retaining that aspect of the health care law. So we rate the ad's claim Half True.	None	Tom Perriello	None	None	None	2010-10-29T11:10:49	2010-10-06	['None']
pomt-01088	"If people work and make more money, they lose more in benefits than they would earn in salary."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/14/marco-rubio/new-book-marco-rubio-says-lose-more-benefits-they-/	At the center of Sen. Marco Rubio’s new book, American Dreams, is the conservative idea that government stands in the way of lower- and middle-class Americans getting ahead. Why don’t more Americans start small businesses? Government regulation, Rubio says. Why do Americans pay so much for higher education? Government subsidies for students drive up prices. Why don’t low-income workers try to work more hours or strive for a promotion? Government assistance disincentivizes it. "If (low-income) people work and make more money, they lose more in benefits than they would earn in salary," Rubio wrote in the book, released Jan. 13. This idea is at the heart of Rubio’s plan to tackle poverty, so it’s one we wanted to look at in depth. Welfare vs. work Government benefits for low-income individuals and families come in many forms: housing assistance, health care and money to purchase food, among others. Additionally, some states provide further assistance with local programs. These programs, reserved for poor people, tend to ramp down as income goes up, meaning the more money you make, the fewer benefits you receive. Makes sense. That phasedown, though, creates cliffs that sometime lessen the value of the increase in earnings. A similar effect occurs when people move into a higher tax bracket as their income goes up. Economists look at these changes in benefits and tax rates in terms of their impact on every additional dollar earned. When the impact is high, and a large chunk of the amount of every additional dollar earned goes to taxes or to offset a decrease in benefits, it can affect people’s desire to work more, said the Congressional Budget Office, the chief fiscal scorekeeper for lawmakers. This situation becomes an incentive for people "already in the workforce to put in fewer hours or be less productive," the CBO said. Is it possible that the benefits lost could be so great, that a person would lose more in benefits than they would gain by an increase in wages? Sure. The Cato Institute, a libertarian policy shop, released a study in 2013 that made this exact point. By analyzing the total benefits an individual can receive in each state and from the federal government, they determined that in nine states assistance payouts exceeded $35,000 a year. Welfare paid better than a minimum wage job in 34 states, plus the District of Columbia, they reported. We asked Rubio’s office for more evidence, and we didn’t hear back. Under such a scenario, an individual could lose more by working than staying in their current situation. ‘Typical’ low-income family But what is that situation? To reach its headline-grabbing conclusions, Cato claims it focused on a typical welfare family. But the study focused on what a single mother with two children might qualify for. That’s an important distinction, and one that significantly alters the playing field. Single mothers with multiple children are eligible for considerably more benefits than poor individuals or married couples with no children. The report goes on to assume that the "typical" family receives seven different forms of public assistance, but that assumption is a pretty big leap. Here’s why: There are four main federal programs: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps); Medicaid or Child Health Insurance Program (health care); Section 8 (housing assistance); and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (welfare). According to the Congressional Budget Office in 2012, most families do not receive assistance from more than one of these programs. In fact, just a quarter of single parents with children earning up to 250 percent of the federal poverty line are enrolled in two of those programs. About 11 percent are enrolled in three or four. If we look at all low-income households of every size and makeup, then 17 percent of low-income households are enrolled in multiple federal programs and only 1 percent receive benefits from all four of them. So choosing to look at a single mother receiving benefits from seven programs, as Cato does, is an extreme example. Also, there are two widely used programs, the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, that actually increase benefits for very low-income individuals the more money that they make for their first $10,000 in wages. The benefits then ramp down after someone earns about $17,000 annually. This incentivizes and rewards poor parents who work more, and therefore it actually decreases the marginal tax rate for many low-income workers. In part because of these two tax credits, it is quite uncommon that someone would go from not working to working and lose more in benefits than they would gain in income. ‘Possible but rare’ Let’s go back to looking at this issue in terms of income lost on additional earnings. According to the Congressional Budget Office, there are very few instances when all 100 cents of an additional dollar earned would go to taxes and replacing lost benefits. In fact, among low- and moderate-income taxpayers, less than one percent lose 80 cents or more of every additional dollar earned. Those most affected would likely be individuals who earn near or just above the poverty level (about $20,000 in a three-person household), who are also enrolled in multiple benefit programs that are set to phase out with any additional income. This is not the norm. Most people earning at or near the poverty level lose about 30 percent in taxes and offset benefits on their additional income. Losing 100 percent of every dollar earned to taxes or replacing lost benefits is "possible but rare," said Eugene Steuerle at the Urban Institute. "High 40 to 60 percent rates are more common, and, if one adds in cost of transportation and clothing (not a tax but a loss from working), higher still." It’s difficult to know when or how people factor lost benefits in their employment decisions, the Congressional Budget Office said. Benefits from government assistance programs are complex and determined by a multitude of factors, both financial (like salary, enrollment in other assistance programs) and nonfinancial (marital status, number of children). It would be hard for an individual to decide if working an extra few hours a week or taking that promotion is going to impact their benefits. Our ruling In his book, Rubio wrote, "If people work and make more money, they lose more in benefits than they would earn in salary." There is evidence that when a large chunk of the amount of every additional dollar earned goes to taxes or to offset a decrease in benefits, people work less. Further, there are scenarios where a low-income individual with children receiving assistance from the government through multiple programs could potentially lose more in benefits than he or she would gain by a slight or modest increase in income. But these examples are a small minority. The vast majority of people face some higher taxes and lost benefits when they make more money, but they would still take home more in pay than they would under a lower salary. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would leave a different impression. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-02927	Under President George W. Bush, "we added $4.9 trillion to the debt. Under President Obama … we’ve added $6.5 trillion to the debt."	true	/new-hampshire/statements/2013/nov/01/kelly-ayotte/ayotte-counts-amount-debt-accrued-presidents-bush-/	During a swing through New Hampshire in October 2013, Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., hammered home her concern about the country’s growing national debt. When she met with about 60 people at a town hall forum in Hudson, N.H., Ayotte stood beside a national debt counter projected onto a screen. It ticked away each new dollar added to the country’s debts, which recently topped $17 trillion. Ayotte said both parties bear responsibility, and that the debt can only be addressed through bipartisan cooperation. "It took two parties to get us into debt. It’s going to take two parties to get us out of debt," she said. "Under President (George W. Bush), we added $4.9 trillion to the debt. Under President Obama, since he’s been in office, we’ve added $6.5 trillion to the debt," she said. "I think all of us sort of on a gut basis understand why the $17 trillion debt is bad for the country, because at home, if we didn’t pay our bills, eventually we get to a point where if our bills end up being more than we’re taking in, we go bankrupt." Throughout his first term, Obama was saddled with criticism that deficit spending has ballooned under his watch. PolitiFact has checked a variety of these claims in the past, but with Ayotte again drawing attention to the national debt, we thought it would be useful to take another look. It’s somewhat tricky to calculate how much money Obama is responsible for adding to the national debt. The point at which Obama starts to bear responsibility for debt increases is a matter of dispute. Normally, presidents inherit budget policies from their predecessors, but because Obama took office during an economic free-fall, several big-ticket budgetary items, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program, could plausibly be ascribed to a combination of the two presidents. (See a full discussion here and here.) However, the simplest way to analyze Ayotte’s claim is to look at the size of the debt on the day Obama took office -- January 20, 2009 -- and compare it to the debt level today. This is what Ayotte was getting at when she cited the increase in the national debt "since he’s been in office." Another challenge in assessing Ayotte’s claim is the fact that there are at least two ways to measure the national debt. "Public debt" is one measurement commonly used by the U.S. Department of Treasury. It includes all debt borrowed by the federal government and held by investors through Treasury notes and other securities. Another commonly cited figure is the country’s total debt, or gross federal debt. This number is higher. It includes public debt plus government debts, such as the money borrowed from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds to fund government operations, which are effectively government IOUs to itself. Here, the context in which Ayotte made her claim is helpful in determining whether she was referring to public debt or total debt. Before discussing Obama, Ayotte said that former president Bush added $4.9 trillion to the national debt during his time in office. Bush did in fact increase the national debt by $4.9 trillion if you measure by total debt, or gross federal debt. For this reason, we’ll assume Ayotte was also speaking about total debt when she discussed the $6.5 trillion increase under Obama. Crunching the numbers On Jan. 20, 2009, the date of Obama's inauguration, the debt held by the public stood at roughly $6.307 trillion, according to the Treasury Department’s "Debt to the Penny" calculator. The total debt, or gross federal debt, was about $10.627 trillion. Next, we need to calculate how much the debt increased as of Oct. 24, 2013 -- the date Ayotte made her remark in Hudson. By that date, the debt held by the public was about $12.122 trillion and total debt had climbed to nearly $17.1 trillion. So, since Obama took office, debt held by the public increased by about $5.815 trillion, and total debt increased by about $6.451 trillion. So she was right on the money. Ayotte overstated the increase by about $49 billion, which is a lot of money, but it’s a tiny fraction of the country’s multi-trillion dollar debt. One final note: On claims where a speaker takes credit or assigns blame for a statistic, we usually take a two-part approach to rating the claim’s accuracy. Is the number right? And is the credit or blame correctly assigned? In this case, Obama doesn’t deserve full "blame" for the debt growth on his watch, since about two-thirds of the annual deficit during his term has been from entitlements and interest. Entitlements, such as Social Security and Medicare, are less susceptible to a president’s policy preferences than discretionary spending that Congress must approve on an annual basis. Entitlements are also more heavily driven by demographic factors, such as the aging of the population, which is also out of any president’s control. Meanwhile, a sizable share of the interest being paid today is paying off debts accumulated under previous presidents. That said, we’re not going to dock Ayotte for how she assigned blame, because her claim was carefully evenhanded. Even as she applied "blame" to Obama, she said the same applied to Bush. Her statement that "it took two parties to get us into debt. It’s going to take two parties to get us out of debt" is distinctly bipartisan in tone. Our ruling Ayotte said that the country has added $6.5 trillion to the national debt since Obama took office and $4.9 trillion under Bush. When measuring by total debt, she’s correct on both counts. We rate her claim True.	None	Kelly Ayotte	None	None	None	2013-11-01T15:45:23	2013-10-24	['George_W._Bush', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-04521	Says Ohio's Issue 2 will create a redistricting commission that will "have a blank check to spend our money."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/oct/03/ohio-republican-party/ohio-republican-party-says-issue-2-would-create-re/	A frequent criticism of Issue 2, the redistricting reform proposal before Ohio voters on Nov. 6, is its cost to taxpayers. The Ohio Republican Party played that card when it sent out a campaign flier Sept. 11, 2012, with a warning about the 12-member redistricting commission that Issue 2 would establish. Its claim: "They’ll have a blank check to spend our money." The claim is a common theme used in the campaign against Issue 2. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check it out. Issue 2 is a proposed amendment to the Ohio Constitution that would reform the way the state’s Congressional and legislative boundaries are drawn, a process known as redistricting that happens every 10 years. Elected officials, including the governor and legislative leaders, control the current process. District boundary lines typically are drawn to favor whichever party is in power. Last year, Republicans, who control state government, drew new lines that grouped voters into districts designed to help Republicans win future elections. Issue 2 would remove elected officials from the redistricting process and hand the responsibility over to a new redistricting commission. Should Issue 2 pass, a commission would be appointed next year to draw new maps for the 2014 election. The GOP claim is based on language in Issue 2 that addresses funding for commission members’ salaries, staff, office space, legal counsel and other expenses. The proposal says "the General Assembly shall make appropriations necessary to adequately fund the activities of the commission." But that that’s not the same as having a blank check. "Necessary to adequately fund" the commission’s activities indicates there must be some basis of support for funding. Subsequent to the GOP sending out the mailer, the Ohio Supreme Court took that very position. The group supporting Issue 2, Voters First Ohio, sued to challenge a summary of Issue 2 that would appear on voters’ ballots. The Ohio Ballot Board, as it does with all state ballot issues, approved a summary ballot language. Voters First said in its lawsuit that the summary was misleading -- specifically a portion that said Issue 2 would "mandate the General Assembly to appropriate all funds as determined by the commission." That sounds similar to the Ohio GOP’s claim that the commission would have a blank check. In its Sept. 12 ruling, the Ohio Supreme Court specifically said the proposal would not provide the commission with a "blank check." The court, by a 6-1 vote, agreed with Voters First that the ballot summary was misleading. "The actual text of the proposed constitutional amendment does not state that the redistricting commission would have – as the ballot board’s language indicates – a blank check for all funds as determined by the commission. Rather, the proposed constitutional amendment expressly limits appropriations for the commission to those ‘necessary to adequately fund the activities’ of the commission," the ruling said. A lawyer representing the Republican Party defended using the term blank check at a recent Ohio Elections Commission hearing. The commission held a probable cause hearing Sept. 20 on the GOP’s campaign literature after Voters First filed a complaint saying the mailer was inaccurate. Attorney Terrence O’Donnell told the commission that blank check is a "well understood political figure of speech" and that the average voter would not infer that the commission literally would be allowed to fill in the dollar amount on a blank check. The elections commission’s probable cause panel split along party lines, 2-2, about whether to hold a full hearing to examine whether Republicans’ claim about the blank check was accurate. Without a majority, the matter was dropped. We asked the Ohio GOP if it wanted to offer any other arguments to support its claim. Spokesman Matthew Henderson directed us to Carlo LoParo, spokesman for the anti-Issue 2 group, Protect Your Vote Ohio. LoParo said the claim was not meant to suggest to voters that the commission would have unlimited funds. He said the phrase was meant to convey "an amount that is unknown, yet substantial." Citing a story published June 9, 2012, in The Sacramento Bee, LoParo said a redistricting commission in California, similar to the one proposed in Ohio, spent $10 million drawing political boundaries. The California redistricting commission initially estimated its work would cost about $3 million. LoParo said Issue 2’s vague wording, which does not cap spending at a specific dollar amount, would allow the commission to sue for more money if it decided lawmakers did not give them enough. That may be true, but it would still require a showing that additional money was "necessary to adequately fund the activities." So, where does that leave us? Issue 2 would provide the redistricting commission with funds "necessary to adequately fund the activities" of the commission. The Ohio Supreme Court said this qualification does not entitle the commission to a blank check. But the Ohio Republican Party and Issue 2 opponents argue the court was being too literal, that the term blank check is a figure of speech that conveys a large, unknown amount of money. Even if most voters don’t take the Ohio Republican Party’s statement to mean an actual blank check would be presented to the redistricting commission, the phrase "blank check" does presume an unchecked spending authority. But, as the Ohio Supreme Court ruled, the proposed amendment places a qualification on spending. If the commission were to ask for more money than initially provided, as LoParo hypothesized, it would have to show the spending is necessary. There is no specific cap on spending in the amendment, but that does not mean the commission will be able to spend as much as it wants. The GOP’s statement is not accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates False.	None	Ohio Republican Party	None	None	None	2012-10-03T06:00:00	2012-09-11	['None']
pomt-12783	"Look at what’s happening last night in Sweden. Sweden, who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/19/donald-trump/donald-trump-florida-rally-laments-attack-last-nig/	Defending his immigrant travel ban at a Feb. 18 campaign rally, President Donald Trump referred to several places that have taken in a large number of refugees and have recently been attacked. Trump mentioned well-documented terrorist attacks in Europe alongside an apparently sinister occurrence we had not heard about — in Sweden. "We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening. We've got to keep our country safe. You look at what's happening in Germany. You look at what’s happening last night in Sweden," Trump said at the Melbourne, Fla., event. "Sweden? Who would believe this? Sweden. They took in large numbers. They’re having problems like they never thought possible. "You look at what's happening in Brussels," he continued. "You look at what's happening all over the world. Take a look at Nice. Take a look at Paris." Was there an immigrant-linked incident in Sweden the night before Trump’s rally? Call it the "Bowling Green massacre," part II. Sweden has let in a large number of immigrants and refugees. But we couldn’t find any evidence that indicates Sweden’s immigration policy is causing the types of problems with terrorist incidents that Trump suggested — and we couldn’t find any record of an attack by terrorists or immigrants in Sweden on the night of Feb. 17, or any night recently. So, what really happened in Sweden on Friday? Not much. Swedish officials were quick to share their dismay of Trump’s comments on Twitter. "Sweden? Terror attack? What has he been smoking? Questions abound," Carl Bildt, a former Swedish prime minister and foreign minister, said on Twitter. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com One of the country's official Twitter accounts, @swedense, shared tweets from a verified account controlled by a different person each week. "Nothing happened here in Sweden," one tweet read. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Sweden's Aftonbladet tabloid snarkily summarized the news from the evening of Feb. 17 in English in response to Trump’s claim. Among six news stories highlighted: a man set himself on fire in Stockholm, a popular Swedish singer had technical difficulties during a performance, and harsh weather closed roads in northern Sweden. We scoured international reports from the LexisNexis database and still came up short on attacks or anything particularly newsworthy. In addition to Swedish officials, a spokeswoman for the Swedish Foreign Ministry told the Associated Press on Feb. 19 that the Swedish government was not aware of any "terror-linked major incidents" that occurred on the night of Feb. 17. We wondered what Trump could have been referring to. The White House did not respond to our query. Some reports linked Trump’s comment to a clip that aired on Tucker Carlson’s Fox News show Feb. 17. Carlson interviewed Ami Horowitz, who directed a documentary about Sweden and refugees. "Sweden had its first terrorist Islamic attack not that long ago, so they’re now getting a taste of what we’ve been seeing across Europe already," Horowitz said during the interview. Shortly after this fact-check published, Trump issued a response on Twitter that confirmed he was going off of a Fox report on Swedish immigration. See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com It’s unclear what attack Horowitz was referencing, but there are a few notable Sweden attacks worth mentioning. In October 2016 in the city of Malmo, a Syrian national targeted a mosque and community center with a Molotov cocktail. No one was killed, and this attack was cited by the White House in its list of 78 incidents "under-reported" by the media (even though each was covered). And back in 2010, suicide bomber Taimour Abdulwahab al-Abdaly struck central Stockholm. The perpetrator, an Iraqi-born Swede, died and injured two others. The most recent example of an attack in Sweden happened in early January 2017, though it wasn’t linked to immigrants or refugees. Three neo-Nazis attacked an asylum-seeker center with homemade bombs. The incident left one person injured, according to reports. Sweden’s immigration policy Until recently, Sweden had welcomed immigrants and refugees. The Nordic country has taken in more than 250,000 refugees and immigrants applications since 2014, according to the Swedish Migration Agency. Between 2014 and 2015, asylum applications doubled in Sweden from about 81,000 to 163,000 as more Syrians, Iraqis, Afghans and unaccompanied minors sought entry. In 2016, that number dropped dramatically with Sweden only processed about 29,000 applications. Because of the large number of refugees taken in 2015, the Swedish government announced it would be changing its policies to encourage people to seek refuge in other countries. Henrik Selin, a political scientist and deputy director of the Swedish Institute, told the New York Times he was perplexed by Trump’s insinuation. "I do not have a clue what he was referring to," Selin told the New York Times. "Obviously, this could be connected to the fact that there has been a lot of negative reporting about Sweden, since Sweden has taken in a lot of refugees." He recently completed a study looking at the negative news reports about Sweden’s intake of refugees. It concluded that the news reports were "highly exaggerated and not based in facts," he told the newspaper. Sweden found support via Twitter from their Finnish neighbor. "Dear @realDonaldTrump, Sweden is immigration friendly, international & liberal," said Alexander Stubb, the former prime minister of Finland. "One of the most prosperous, richest, safest places on earth." See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Decrying countries who accept immigrants and refugees, Trump told supporters to "look at what’s happening last night in Sweden." We couldn’t find any reports that support Trump’s narrative. It’s possible Trump was referring to another event, but there hasn’t been a fatal terrorist attack in Sweden since 2010. Even though Sweden has taken in a large number of immigrants, nothing was amiss Feb. 17. We rate Trump’s claim False.

Huckabee's provocative comment concluded a wonkish back-and-forth between him and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie about entitlement reform. Christie defended his plan to raise the retirement age and change benefits for Social Security and Medicare, but Huckabee stressed that Uncle Sam was to blame. "If Congress wants to mess with the retirement program, why don't we let them start by changing their retirement program, and not have one, instead of talking about getting rid of Social Security and Medicare that was robbed $700 billion to pay for Obamacare?" Huckabee said. This claim -- that the Affordable Care Act is funded by plundering the health care program of seniors -- is an old Republican talking point, dating back to the 2010 midterm elections. We’ve checked out many versions of this claim, which contains some truth but is misleading. Obamacare doesn’t literally "rob" Medicare. But the Affordable Care Act does include provisions that reduce future increases in Medicare spending. In other words, the law slows down the rising costs of Medicare. It’s also important to note that the savings come at the expense of insurers and hospitals, not beneficiaries. (The $700 billion figure is also old, from a 2012 report by the Congressional Budget Office. It’s now updated to about $800 billion.) Under President George W. Bush, private insurers began to run a subset of Medicare plans with the idea that more competition produced lower costs. However, those plans grew to cost more than traditional Medicare, so the Affordable Care Act pared down the payments to private insurers. Hospitals would also find their checks docked when they failed to to meet benchmarks for patient care. On the flip side, the Affordable Care Act also funds illness prevention benefits, expands preventive care benefits, and provides $48 billion for prescription coverage. It’s possible that some beneficiaries could experience additional costs, reductions in service, or fewer hospitals that accept Medicare. "While ‘robbed’ is a bit loaded, the idea that Medicare beneficiaries are getting less generous benefits in order that the ACA can offer health benefits to younger people isn’t outrageous," said Andrew Biggs, resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. But that’s a potential impact and a less direct effect of Obamacare than the claim suggests. The prior critiques of the claim "remain relevant," the head of Medicare and Medicaid under George H.W. Bush told PolitiFact in 2014. Our ruling Huckabee said, "$700 billion was robbed (from Medicare) to fund Obamacare." It’s an old claim and an old figure. The law does reduce Medicare spending, but not in the way Huckabee suggests. The Affordable Care Act aims to cut future Medicare costs by reducing payments to private insurers and hospitals, not beneficiaries, though this could indirectly squeeze beneficiaries. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-04559	"Barack Hussein Obama will .. force Christian organizations to pay for abortions."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/26/government-not-god-pac/pac-ad-says-obama-will-force-christian-groups-pay-/	A super PAC called Government is Not God is running an ad in newspapers around the country warning readers of dire consequences if the president wins a second term. "Barack Hussein Obama," the ad says, "will move America to force Christian organizations to pay for abortion." That claim tops a list of numerous charges about abortion, immigration, Islam and even the Declaration of Independence, which we’ll look at in separate-fact checks. For this one, the topic is abortion. HHS rule The claim is based on a rule to implement the new health care law that was announced in January 2012 by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. It addressed women’s preventive health services that must be covered by insurers without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible. At issue is how much organizations with religious ties would be bound by the rule. It was a clarification of the provision in the Affordable Care Act, often known as Obamacare, for co-pay-free preventive care. For individual and small-group plans, the law requires that policies cover "essential health benefits." The idea of co-pay-free preventive care stems from studies that show that even moderate co-pays kept women from getting care, such as mammograms or pap smears, according to HHS. The nongovernmental Institute of Medicine recommended that preventive services include all FDA-approved forms of contraception: physical methods such as condoms, diaphragms, cervical caps and IUDs, as well as hormonal methods such as the pill, implants and hormone shots. It includes emergency contraceptives such as Plan B and Ella, though not so-called "abortion drugs" like RU-486 that end early pregnancy by blocking the activity of progesterone. Most health insurance plans will have to cover them without a co-pay, co-insurance or a deductible. For most new and renewed health plans, that requirement kicked in Aug. 1, 2012. Religious exemptions The HHS rule provides an exemption for "certain non-profit religious employers" that meet a four-part test -- essentially churches and synagogues, but also some primary and secondary religious schools. That left other religious-affiliated organizations, such as universities and hospitals, outside the exemption and in a position where they could be required to cover services to which they have a moral objection. The United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, along with other groups and conservative leaders, rose up to fight the rule. Here’s why: Plan B and Ella -- the "morning-after pill" -- prevent fertilization of an egg, but taken later can prevent the implantation of a fertilized egg. To some, that’s tantamount to inducing an abortion. "In a Catholic moral perspective and in the view of many other pro-life people, this is an early abortifacient effect, not merely contraceptive, because it ends a life that has already come into being. However, federal law would not define this as an abortion, because it only covers the interruption of an implanted pregnancy," Richard Doerflinger, associate director of Pro-Life Activities at the bishops conference, told PolitiFact. In response to the uproar, the administration offered a compromise in February, requiring insurance companies instead of employers to cover contraception if the employer objects. The organizations were also given an extra year to comply with the rule. A White House fact sheet says religious organizations will not have to provide contraceptive coverage or refer their employees to organizations that provide contraception, religious organizations will not be required to subsidize the cost of contraception, and contraceptive coverage will be offered to women by their employers’ insurance companies directly, with no role for religious employers who oppose contraception. To those objecting to the rule, the compromise is little more than a shell game. Said Doerflinger: "The actual money for this coverage will still come from the premiums paid in by the employer and employee. … The Catholic employer, as much as before, is deprived of its freedom to provide a health plan (and its employees are deprived of the freedom to receive a health plan, for themselves and their minor children) that conforms to their moral and religious principles." More than two dozen lawsuits against the Obama administration over the rule are pending around the country. So, is the claim accurate? Doerflinger says yes. "The mandate includes drugs that can cause an abortion; and we haven’t seen a workable scenario in which the money for covering such drugs comes from anywhere but the premiums paid by many Christian employers and their employees," he said. We also asked NARAL Pro-Choice America, an abortion rights group, for its take: "The new contraceptive-coverage policy referenced in the claim … will not force Christian organizations to pay for abortion. The policy requires coverage of all FDA-approved forms of birth control, including emergency contraception (EC). EC is not abortion, rather, it prevents pregnancy. Therefore, no one is required to cover abortion under this policy," said Samantha Gordon, spokeswoman for NARAL. "Also, the administration explicitly exempts religious houses of worship from the contraceptive-coverage requirement. Moreover, the policy allows religiously affiliated employers that presently refuse to offer their employees contraceptive coverage a one-year grace period to come into compliance. These organizations also will be allowed to opt out of the policy permanently if they oppose it." Our conclusion: There is a narrow window in this claim that has some truth. The wording -- "Christian organizations will be forced to pay for abortions" -- is clearly an overreach. Christian organizations won’t be "forced" to hand over money for abortion procedures performed at clinics by doctors. But because employers are now required to provide health insurance for employees under the Affordable Care Act (or otherwise face fines) and because that law dictates that preventive care must be provided at no cost to the insured person, there is some force being applied by the federal government. Preventive care, as defined by HHS, encompasses birth control, emergency contraceptives and sterilization -- health services that some people equate with abortion. Overall, the statement creates a misleading impression. But that one element of truth leads us to rate it Mostly False.

pomt-14445	Says Bernie Sanders "was against the auto bailout" and "voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/07/hillary-clinton/michigan-hillary-clinton-says-bernie-sanders-was-a/	Sen. Bernie Sanders didn’t support the bailout that saved the auto industry, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said of her opponent ahead of the primary in Michigan, a state built on the auto business. "He was against the auto bailout," Clinton said at a March 6 CNN debate in Flint, Mich. "In January of 2009, President-elect Obama asked everybody in the Congress to vote for the bailout. The money was there and had to be released in order to save the American auto industry and 4 million jobs and to begin the restructuring. We had the best year that the auto industry has had in a long time. I voted to save the auto industry. He voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry." Sanders seemed skeptical of this line of critique. "Well, if you are talking about the Wall Street bailout, where some of your friends destroyed this economy," he responded. Immediately a bunch of readers asked us to look into this claim to see if Sanders really did oppose the auto bailout, which many people believe rescued major automakers struggling to stay afloat during the 2008 Great Recession. First we’ll lay out the auto bailout timeline, then we’ll explain Sanders’ votes. Basically, Sanders had two opportunities to show his support for auto bailout funds through Senate votes. He supported the bailout in one instance but not the other. In October 2008, Congress approved the $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). The money was intended to assist financial institutions, but it also ended up bailing out the auto industry. That December, Congress tried to pass a separate $14 billion bailout program specifically for the auto industry, which was in really bad shape. But the measure failed in the Senate, so President George W. Bush instead used his authority to allocate some of the TARP funds to General Motors and Chrysler. Just days before President Barack Obama started his first term in January 2009, some members of Congress tried to block the release of the the second half of the $700 billion TARP funds, a package that included some auto bailout money. The attempt failed, and the TARP funds went out to the banks and motor companies. So Sanders could have shown his support for the auto bailout in December 2008 when Congress tried and failed to pass an auto bailout and again in January 2009 when members considered blocking TARP funds. Sanders (and Clinton, too) voted in favor of the December separate auto bailout. "I think it would be a terrible idea to add millions more to the unemployment rolls," Sanders said, according to Vermont Public Radio, explaining why he supported the measure. However — and this is what Clinton is talking about — Sanders voted to block the release of the second half of the TARP funding, including the auto bailout funds, while Clinton voted for the funds. (Sanders opposed and Clinton supported the initial TARP bill.) Sanders said he opposed bailout funding for financial firms, which is where the majority of TARP dollars were headed. "I have strong reservations about continuing this bailout without strong taxpayer protections written into law," he said in a statement. "I also object to using middle-class taxpayer money to bail out the exact same financial institutions whose greed and recklessness led to the greatest financial crisis since the Great Depression." It’s unclear how much of the second half of TARP funds Obama intended to use for the auto bailout at the time. In a letter to congressional leaders encouraging them to release the funds, Obama economic adviser Larry Summers said only that auto companies would "only receive additional assistance in the context of a comprehensive restructuring designed to achieve long-term viability." Both of Michigan’s then-senators, Democrats Debbie Stabenow and Carl Levin, advocated to continue TARP funding specifically to aid the auto industry, which has a heavy presence in their home state. Auto companies ended up receiving about about $85 billion in TARP funds, according to the New York Times. It’s possible the auto industry would not have received such a robust bailout if Congress had successfully blocked the second half of the TARP funds and withstood an Obama veto. HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER Our ruling Clinton said Sanders "was against the auto bailout" and "voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry." Sanders did vote against a set of funds that financed most of the auto bailout — though the funds’ primary purpose was bailing out Wall Street firms, which Sanders strongly opposed. The claim, though, leaves listeners with the impression that Sanders’ opposed bailing out the auto industry. But he voted in favor of providing auto companies with $14 billion, which was separate from the Wall Street bailout funds he opposed. That standalone measure failed.

pomt-00803	"White men account for 69 percent of those arrested for violent crimes."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/02/sally-kohn/sally-kohn-white-men-69-percent-arrested-violent/	Recent incidents of overt racism and abuse of women at college fraternities led liberal columnist Sally Kohn to comment that the press and the public fail to grasp the threat of violence from white men. "Although the news media and popular culture constantly cast suspicion on young Muslim and African-American men and the supposedly disproportionate and ever-present threats these communities pose, the fact is young white men are just as dangerous," Kohn wrote in a CNN opinion piece. "But because our biases have us so busy looking the other way, we're ignoring the magnitude of this reality." Kohn went on and offered some statistics to bolster her point. Among them was this line: "Although black men are more than six times more likely to be sent to prison than white men, white men account for 69 percent of those arrested for violent crimes." A reader asked us to look into the statistic that white men account for 69 percent of those arrested for violent crimes. Correcting Kohn’s numbers Kohn’s claim about 69 percent of white men runs into trouble on two counts. The figure she cited is not for white men. It’s for all whites. And it’s not for "violent" crimes. It’s for all crimes, from loitering to murder. It’s not simple to replicate the percentage of white men arrested for violent crimes, as we’ll show you in a bit. But we can look at violent crimes, sorted solely by race. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, white men and women were arrested for 60 percent of all violent crimes in 2012. Violent crimes include murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Here’s the arrest data: All races Whites (incl. Hispanics) Blacks (incl. Hispanics) Murder and Nonnegligent Manslaughter 10,351 4,955 5,138 Forcible Rape 15,571 10,038 5,030 Robbery 82,189 38,041 42,460 Aggravated Assault 352,017 223,426 116,984 Total 460,128 276,460 169,612 Percent 100% 60.1% 36.9% Population 240.165 million 192.319 million 30.971 million Source: Bureau of Justice Statistics, Arrest Data Analysis Tool Drilling down on the number of crimes committed by whites who are also male is more challenging. Federal data allows you to sort on race and sex, but not both at the same time. The exception is for homicides. While you won’t find that information on the Justice Department website, it can be culled from federal records, which is what James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, has done for many years. Fox sent us the following homicide arrest numbers: Year Race Sex Reported Percent Rate per 100K 2012 White Male 4,631 41.5% 4.9 2012 Black Male 5,095 45.6% 35.2 2013 White Male 4,486 41.7% 4.7 2013 Black Male 4,863 45.2% 33.0 Source: James Alan Fox (The percentages are based on all homicide arrests, not just the ones you see in the table.) Looking solely at murders, black men are arrested more for murder than white men, and at a much higher rate when you account for population. We can’t draw conclusions beyond that, however, because the arrest data simply doesn’t allow us to draw firm conclusions about the number of arrests for violent crimes by white and black men. We should note that data show that the majority of black murder victims are murdered by blacks, and the same holds true for whites. There are other caveats. The arrest data blends Hispanic offenders into both the white and black groups, which further muddies the discussion of ethnicity and crime. Also, arrests are not the same as criminal acts themselves. Setting homicide aside, many violent crimes go unreported and many offenders are never caught. Also, a single criminal could be counted several times if he is arrested for different offenses. To further complicate the picture, police departments patrol certain neighborhoods more than others, which makes arrests in those places more likely. When we contacted Kohn, she agreed that her number was off. The percentage she used included both white men and women, and applied to all sorts of crimes, from loitering to murder. Kohn corrected that error in her opinion piece. Accounting for population size Setting aside using the wrong number, the larger problem with Kohn’s claim is that her data point tells only half the story. There are two ways to talk about threats. Kohn chose one -- looking at what fraction of arrests for violent crimes are by a certain type of person, in this case, white men. The other way is to assess the likelihood that a certain type of person will be arrested for a violent crime. This second approach typically comes down to stating the number of crimes for every 100,000 people who are white, black, etc. Kohn used this method herself when she talked about incarceration rates for blacks compared to whites. It is true that blacks are imprisoned at about six times the rate as whites, but the source she used compared the incarceration rates for every 100,000 blacks and whites. When Kohn said that 69 percent of arrests for violent crimes were white males, she left out the population factor. "You can't talk about risk without talking about population size," Fox told PunditFact. "There are many more whites than blacks so it makes sense that the number of crimes will be high." Using the homicide count (again, the only crime where we can separate on both race and gender) whites and blacks were arrested in about equal numbers. But cast as a rate, the results shift. For 2013, Fox calculated that black men were about seven times more likely than white men to be arrested for murder. That would be a rate of 33 murders for every 100,000 black men, compared to 4.7 for every 100,000 whites. Drawing on the 2012 figures, whites were arrested for over 275,000 violent crimes. For blacks, the number is about 170,000. So while whites were arrested more, the arrest rate for blacks is nearly four times that for whites. Does that mean that from the point of view of the average citizen that blacks pose a greater threat? Not necessarily. "If one considers the absolute number of offenders and it turns out there are a larger number of offenders from Group A than Group B, then it stands to reason that Group A is the greater threat in terms of likelihood of criminal acts," said Lorie Fridell, a criminologist at the University of South Florida. Robert Brame, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina, echoed Fridell’s assessment. "The statistical fact is that you’re more likely to be a victim of a white perpetrator than a black one just because there are so many more whites in the population," Brame said. But, Brame, continued, it is not enough to speak of either the total number or the population-based rate. "My preference would be for both statistics to be provided to give the full context," Brame said. "Neither statistic is complete without the other." Our ruling Kohn said that white men are at least as dangerous as black men and cited as proof that white men represent 69 percent of people arrested for violent crimes. When presented with the inaccuracies in using that specific figure by PunditFact, Kohn corrected herself. Criminologists we contacted also told us that those absolute figures -- when used correctly -- tell only half the story. When talking about risks to society, it is equally important to provide the population-based rate. When we do that, the threat of violent crimes posed by blacks looks larger than that of whites. For these two reasons, Kohn’s claim that "white men account for 69 percent of those arrested for violent crimes" is inaccurate. We rate it False.

pomt-14265	"It’s clear" that Hillary Clinton "violated national security laws."	false	/colorado/statements/2016/apr/08/Jack_Graham/jack-graham-says-its-clearhillary-clinton-violated/	During a debate among Republicans seeking to be Colorado's U.S. Senate nominee, candidate Jack Graham blasted Hillary Clinton's use of personal email as secretary of state. "It's clear she's lied to us about her emails, that she's violated national security laws in that regard," Graham said in the debate on 9NEWS. We’re focusing on Graham’s claim that "it’s clear...she violated national security laws." Questions about whether Clinton mishandled classified information have dogged her frontrunner pursuit of the Democratic presidential nomination. But what Graham states as a clear-cut fact is very much in dispute. We’ll delve into Clinton’s email problems to explain why. The media learned in the summer of 2014 that Clinton exclusively used a private email account as secretary of state. That’s when State Department officials were responding to a records request from the House Select Committee on Benghazi. Its members were interested in how Clinton’s email choices may have affected the 2012 terrorist attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound in Libya and its aftermath. In July 2015, the inspector generals for the Intelligence Community and the State Department -- both of whom are independent of their respective agencies -- sent what is called a security referral to the Justice Department. A security referral is essentially a notification that classified information might be stored outside of the government’s secure network. In this case, the location was Clinton’s private email server located at her New York home. FBI agents were assigned to look into the security setup for Clinton’s home email server and a thumb drive that contained copies of Clinton’s work emails. But what started as a security review soon became an investigation into whether anyone had committed a crime in handling classified information, the New York Times reported, citing multiple, anonymous law enforcement officials. Clinton has apologized for what happened: "Yes, I should have used two email addresses, one for personal matters and one for my work at the State Department. Not doing so was a mistake. I’m sorry about it, and I take full responsibility." She has maintained that "nothing I ever sent or received was marked classified at the time." The situation with Clinton’s email is downright confusing -- for several reasons. As PolitiFact has reported, federal agencies have the ability to classify information after the fact. So some of the emails weren’t classified when Clinton sent or received them, but they were later classified after a government review. On top of that, government agencies regularly disagree over what should be classified. Independent inspectors general have said Clinton’s emails contain some classified intelligence information, but the Clinton campaign and the State Department dispute those findings -- saying the information was not classified. Meanwhile, the State Department has released more than 50,000 of Clinton’s emails, which the public can search on the agency’s website. Overall, 2,093 of the emails were redacted because they contained some classified details. Most were rated "confidential," the lowest classification level. But the State Department has said that, at the request of intelligence agencies, 22 emails were deemed "top secret," and will not be made public, the Washington Post reported. Some of the released emails show Clinton’s State Department team cautiously avoiding emailing each other classified information. Senior adviser Alec Ross noted in a February 2010 email that he was keeping his comments "within the boundaries of unclassified email… regarding the country we discussed." But Clinton’s defense that she never sent or received email that was "marked classified at the time" doesn’t wash with Ronald J. Sievert, a former federal prosecutor and with experience in national security issues who now teaches at the University of Texas School of Law. In a USA TODAY commentary, Sievert called the defense a "smokescreen," saying the relevant federal law "does not even once mention the word ‘classified.’ " Instead, the law makes it a crime for anyone "entrusted with … any document ... or information relating to the national defense … through gross negligence (to permit) the same to be removed from its proper place of custody," he writes. "The courts have held repeatedly that ‘national defense information’ includes closely held military, foreign policy and intelligence information and that evidence that the information is classified is not necessary for a prosecution." Few details have become public about the ongoing FBI investigation. Last month, the Washington Post reported that the Justice Department has granted immunity to a former State Department staffer in exchange for his cooperation in the investigation. The former employee, Bryan Pagliano, installed the email server in Clinton’s New York home in 2009. He also worked on her 2008 presidential campaign. The Post, citing current and former officials, also reported that FBI agents working to wrap up the investigation in the coming months are likely to want to interview Clinton and her senior aides about the decision to use a private server, how it was set up, and whether any of the participants knew they were sending classified information in emails. An expert in government secrecy says nothing revealed to date supports Senate candidate Jack Graham’s assertion that "it’s clear" Clinton violated national security laws. "It is not at all clear that Clinton violated any national security law, and Mr. Graham did not indicate what law he had in mind," said Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Government Secrecy at the Federation of American Scientists. "The laws that govern classified information are a patchwork of statutes dating back as long as a century ago (before today's classification system even existed), and their application is often unclear," Aftergood said. "But most of those statutes require criminal intent in order to commit a violation. There is no known evidence of criminal intent on Clinton's part. If Mr. Graham has such evidence, he should immediately provide it to law enforcement officials." Graham’s campaign manager Dick Wadhams sent us this message when we asked for evidence: "I am confident you are very familiar with this Clinton controversy and by googling ‘Hillary Clinton Email Scandal’ or similar words you will find a multitude of sources that agree with Jack Graham and his statement." Our ruling Graham said: "It’s clear ... she violated national security laws." Hypothetically, the evidence may someday support Graham’s accusation against Clinton. But at this time, there is no clear evidence that Clinton has broken the law. No one has been charged with a crime in this case -- let alone convicted. Graham goes too far in stating that possibility as fact. We rate his claim False.	None	Jack Graham	None	None	None	2016-04-08T16:44:36	2016-04-05	['None']

Live from the border via video, Kelly Terry-Willis and Kent Terry, relatives of Border Patrol agent Brian Terry, who was killed in a shootout with Mexican bandits near the border in December 2010, bashed President Barack Obama for leaving Border Patrol agents "thinly equipped." "In Arizona, for example, there are only one and a half agents per every 10 square miles," Kelly Terry-Willis said July 18. "This is unacceptable." Kent Terry continued, "Only one candidate is serious about border security, and that’s Donald Trump." Here at PolitiFact Arizona, we wondered, is immigration enforcement really as unmanned as Kelly Terry-Willis claimed? Linear vs. square miles We did not hear back from Terry-Willis, but found the numbers from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Arizona spans a total of 113,998 square miles and 4,795 agents for the two sectors along the Arizona-Mexico border. We did the math using square miles and found that there is actually one Border Patrol agent per every 23.77 square miles in Arizona. That comes out to .4 agents per every 10 square miles. So Terry-Willis’ math is off. But Border Patrol notes that trying to use the state’s total square miles as a statistic is irrelevant since most agents are deployed far to the south, closer to the border. The number of agents per linear mile is much higher. In fiscal year 2015, the Tucson, Ariz., sector had 3,991 Border Patrol agents covering 262 linear miles of border. That’s just over 15 agents per mile. The Yuma, Ariz., sector had 804 Border Patrol agents covering 126 linear miles of border. That’s just over six agents per mile. Both sectors cover the more than 360 total miles along the Arizona-Mexico border, as well as the rest of the state. Border Patrol also notes that agents are deployed to areas based on the threat of criminal activity. In their 2012-16 strategic plan, they even outline a "risk-based approach" to patrolling the border. Michael Lytle, a criminal justice professor and border security expert at the University of Texas at Brownsville, notes that there are some agents in more places along the border than others. Technology, terrain and other barriers could be at play. "Patterns of activity shape a section of the border, and may not necessitate the presence of an officer on that particular milemarker," Lytle said. Our ruling Terry-Willis said, in Arizona,"there are only one and a half (Border Patrol) agents per every 10 square miles." Based on our calculations, she actually overestimates the number of Border Patrol agents compared to square miles. But that’s still misleading -- and leaves out important context. Most Border Patrol agents survey areas closer to the Arizona-Mexico border, not the rest of the state. The number of agents per linear mile is much higher.

pomt-00754	"We are in the sixth year of recovery, and median income is below what it was at the start of the recovery."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/16/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-correct-median-income-has-fallen-us-end-r/	Jeb Bush is making economic opportunity a major theme of his not-yet-official presidential campaign. One of his main gripes with the economy is that income isn’t going up. "If we grew at a far faster rate, the middle would no longer be as squeezed as they are," Bush said. "We are in the sixth year of recovery, and median income is below what it was at the start of the recovery." Bush, the former Republican governor of Florida, made the remarks during a recent visit to Ohio, where he talked with Pittsburgh Tribune-Review political writer Salena Zito before addressing the Ohio Chamber of Commerce's annual meeting. (Zito paraphrased part of Bush’s quote in her article, but she provided us with the full text of Bush’s comment.) We knew that the national employment picture has improved, slowly but surely, since the official end of the recession in mid 2009. But has the typical household income in the United States really fallen since the end of the recession? If true, that would be pretty startling. As it turns out, median income has fallen, once you take inflation into account. Here are the details. In September 2014, the U.S. Census Bureau published its annual roundup of data on income and poverty. Table A-2 in the report provides data on the inflation-adjusted, median household income for the most recent 10 years: Year Inflation-adjusted, median household income 2009 $54,059 2010 $52,646 2011 $51,842 2012 $51,759 2013 $51,939 This shows that, despite a slight uptick between 2012 and 2013, real median household income has fallen since the start of the recovery in 2009 by $2,120. That’s about 4 percent, or roughly 1 percent per year, every year. The only caveat we should mention is that the most recent data stops at the end of 2013, and we don’t know yet whether income gains accelerated enough in 2014 to make up for the losses between 2009 and 2013. Still, we won’t mark down Bush for this, since he was using the most current data available. "It's sad but true that real median income is below what it was in 2009 and 2010," said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. "Real median income kept dropping well after the official end of the recession and has been pretty close to flat since 2011." She added that the losses have not been experienced equally. Incomes, Sinclair noted, "have fallen in the lower parts of the income distribution," whereas the the top 10 percent of the income spectrum, and even more elite segments, have experienced gains. Still, Bush was clearly speaking about the overall national picture, so we find no fault with his claim. Our ruling Bush said that "we are in the sixth year of recovery, and median income is below what it was at the start of the recovery." He’s right, once you take inflation into account and if you use the most recent data available, which goes through 2013. We rate his claim True.

pomt-04591	"Eight million Americans have dropped out of the work force since (Barack) Obama became president. ... The real unemployment rate is 19 percent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/21/restore-our-future/mitt-romney-aligned-group-says-real-unemployment-r/	A campaign ad by the pro-Mitt Romney group Restore Our Future blames President Barack Obama not only for the current high rate of unemployment, but also for leading many Americans to simply stop looking for jobs. "Millions of Americans are disappearing from the work force because they can't find jobs," the ad says. "The overall unemployment rate doesn't even count them any more. Eight million Americans have dropped out of the workforce since Obama became president. Counting people who dropped out or can't find full-time jobs, the real unemployment rate is 19 percent." Everybody knows the jobs bounceback from the most recent recession has been frustratingly modest. But have eight million Americans really "dropped out of the work force since Obama became president"? And has that left the "real" unemployment rate at 19 percent? Restore Our Future, through a spokeswoman, declined to comment on what went into the group’s calculation. But the ad itself did offer its source: a Wall Street Journal column from Sept. 7, 2012, by businessman and editor Mortimer Zuckerman. Zuckerman wrote: "How many people are out of work but not counted as unemployed because they hadn't sought work in the past four weeks? Eight million. ... The key indicator of our employment health, in all the statistics, is what the government calls U-6. This is the number who have applied for work in the past six months and includes people who are involuntary part-time workers — government-speak for those individuals whose jobs have been cut back to two or three days a week. They are working part-time only because they've been unable to find full-time work. This involuntary army of what's called ‘underutilized labor’ has been hovering for months at about 15 percent of the workforce. Include the eight million who have simply given up looking, and the real unemployment rate is closer to 19 percent." Zuckerman didn’t answer our inquiries. But we’ll look at the two pieces of the claim -- the 8 million and the 19 percent -- in order. Eight million labor-force dropouts The eight million figure has been bouncing around the conservative blogosphere in recent weeks, such as a widely shared column from Investor’s Business Daily that said that during the Obama recovery, "the ranks of those who aren't in the labor force at all have swelled by nearly 8 million." We were able to track down a Bureau of Labor Statistics category that jibes with the 8 million claim. Called "not in labor force," this statistic counts people age 16 years and older who are neither employed nor unemployed. (Being unemployed, according to BLS, means being available for work and having looked for work sometime during the previous four weeks.) Between Obama’s inauguration and today, a 44-month period, the number of Americans "not in the labor force" rose by 8.4 million. Using a slightly different time frame -- starting the count at the end of the recession in June 2009 -- produces a rise of almost exactly 8 million. So the figure has a grain of truth. But what does this number really mean? For starters, it’s actually not a measurement of people who "can’t find jobs" -- at least not entirely. In addition to discouraged job-seekers, it includes parents who decided to become a full-time mom or dad. It includes people who have decided to go back to school. And it includes people who have chosen to retire. There’s no question that some of these decisions may have been influenced by a perception of weak job prospects ahead. But people make these career-changing decisions all the time; if you’re going to lay the blame for a shrinking workforce on today’s economy, it’s important to tell how much more common labor-market departures are now compared to what would have been happening in a more "normal" job market. The retirement numbers are particularly important, given the aging of the baby-boomer workforce. Fortunately, there’s a way to get a rough sense of this, by looking at the trendline over a longer period of time. For the 44 months prior to January 2009, people left the labor force at a stable, predictable rate -- in fact, essentially the same rate back to 2002. During that time, 3.8 million people left the labor force. So if you consider this the "normal" amount of departures from the labor force over 44 months, Obama’s presidency has seen departures increase by an "extra" 4.6 million. This 4.6 million number checks out if you look at the trendline for the civilian labor force -- that is, the number of people who are either employed or officially unemployed. After a steady rise through January 2009, this number has flatlined. If you were to extend the same pace of growth after January 2009 as there was before, the labor force would have had almost exactly 4.6 million extra members today. Bottom line: An extra 4.6 million people leaving the labor force (or never joining it in the first place) is still a big number. But it’s not 8 million. A 19 percent "real" unemployment rate The statistic Zuckerman referred to in his column -- the U-6 unemployment rate -- is sometimes offered as a more "complete" picture of joblessness. It doesn’t just include those who BLS officially considers "unemployed" but also those working part time for economic reasons as well as those who are "marginally attached" to the work force (meaning they want to work but have not looked for work recently enough to count as being actively in the labor force). Currently, the U-6 rate of "labor underutilization" -- which is the broadest measure of unemployment and under-employment that BLS calculates -- is 14.7 percent. That’s a whole lot higher than the more familiar 8.1 percent unemployment rate, but it’s also well below the 19 percent claimed in the ad. As we can see from Zuckerman’s column, he has reached 19 percent by taking U-6 as his base and then broadening its definition of under-employment. The ad then ran with his calculation. Labor economists we interviewed said that what Zuckerman did is fine in theory. Even though U-6 is the broadest measurement of under-employment that BLS calculates, it still doesn’t capture everyone affected by a bad job market, such as recent graduates who never entered the labor market in the first place because they feared there would be no jobs for them. The problem is that no reasonable expansion of U-6 gets the figure as high as 19 percent. First, as we noted above, the more accurate figure to use for labor-force dropouts due to economic conditions is 4.6 million, not 8 million. Second, a big chunk of these 4.6 million are already counted in BLS’ basic U-6 calculation -- they’re "marginally attached" workers. In the most recent month, the marginally attached numbered 2.6 million. So to avoid double-counting, you have to subtract 2.6 million. This leaves 2 million labor-force dropouts to add to the existing U-6 calculation. Running the new numbers -- perhaps we can call this new statistic "U-7" -- produces an under-employment rate of 16 percent, not 19 percent. Again, this is just about double the already high "official" unemployment rate of 8.1 percent. But it’s not, as the ad claimed, 19 percent. Our rating Restore Our Future’s ad spotlights a reasonable attempt to quantify some of the hidden victims of today’s weak labor market. But due to errors of concept and calculation, the final numbers cited in the ad are too high. A more accurate measure of workforce dropouts due to the weak job market is 4.6 million, not 8 million, and what the ad would call the "real" unemployment rate is actually about 16 percent, not 19 percent. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly False.	None	Restore Our Future	None	None	None	2012-09-21T14:41:41	2012-09-19	['Barack_Obama', 'United_States']

pomt-06377	China is "trying to develop nuclear capability."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/02/herman-cain/herman-cain-said-china-trying-develop-nuclear-weap/	People are talking about Herman Cain and allegations of sexual harassment from the time he was head of the National Restaurant Association. But what about his China policy? Cain, the former head of Godfather’s Pizza, is seeking the Republican nomination and has been leading the polls in recent weeks. He sat down for an interview with the PBS Newshour that began with questions about two female employees who left the National Restaurant Association in the 1990s. Cain said the charges against him were false. The interview then turned to questions about policy, leading to this exchange: Judy Woodruff: "Do you view China as a potential military threat to the United States?" Cain: "I do view China as a potential military threat to the United States." Woodruff: "And what could you do as president to head that off?" Cain: "My China strategy is quite simply outgrow China. It gets back to economics. China has a $6 trillion economy and they're growing at approximately 10 percent. We have a $14 trillion economy -- much bigger -- but we're growing at an anemic 1.5, 1.6 percent. When we get our economy growing back at the rate of 5 or 6 percent that it has the ability to do, we will outgrow China. "And secondly, we already have superiority in terms of our military capability, and I plan to get away from making cutting our defense a priority and make investing in our military capability a priority, going back to my statement: peace through strength and clarity. So yes, they're a military threat. They've indicated that they're trying to develop nuclear capability, and they want to develop more aircraft carriers like we have. So yes, we have to consider them a military threat." Cain got our attention by saying that China is "trying to develop nuclear capability." We were under the impression that China has been a nuclear power for some time now. So we decided to check his statement. Our first stop was the U.S. State Department website. Its background note on China has the following summary of China’s nuclear capability: "In 1955, Mao Zedong's Chinese Communist Party decided to proceed with a nuclear weapons program; it was developed with Soviet assistance until the Sino-Soviet split ended that assistance. After its first nuclear test in October 1964, Beijing deployed a modest but potent ballistic missile force, including land- and sea-based intermediate-range and intercontinental ballistic missiles." Then there’s this, from the U.S. Defense Department 2010 Nuclear Posture Review Report: "While facing the increasingly urgent threats of nuclear terrorism and nuclear proliferation, the United States must continue to address the more familiar challenge of ensuring strategic stability with existing nuclear powers – most notably Russia and China. … The United States and China are increasingly interdependent and their shared responsibilities for addressing global security threats, such as weapons of mass destruction (WMD) proliferation and terrorism, are growing. At the same time, the United States and China’s Asian neighbors remain concerned about China’s current military modernization efforts, including its qualitative and quantitative modernization of its nuclear arsenal. China’s nuclear arsenal remains much smaller than the arsenals of Russia and the United States. But the lack of transparency surrounding its nuclear programs – their pace and scope, as well as the strategy and doctrine that guides them – raises questions about China’s future strategic intentions." In recent years, the United States has been concerned that China is sharing nuclear technology and weapons with other countries, particularly Pakistan and Iran. In January 2011, the United States and China signed an agreement to create a Center of Excellence in China to promote nuclear security and safeguards. We contacted the Cain campaign for comment on this, but we didn’t hear back. Cain said that China "indicated that they're trying to develop nuclear capability." According to the U.S. State Department, China conducted its first test of a nuclear weapon in 1964. So Cain’s approximately 40 years behind the times. China is a long-standing nuclear power. We rate his statement Pants on Fire. Editor's note: After we published this item, Cain addressed his statement in an interview with the Daily Caller website. "Maybe I mispoke," Cain said. "What I meant was, China does not have the size of nuclear capability that we have. They do have a nuclear capability."	None	Herman Cain	None	None	None	2011-11-02T13:40:47	2011-10-31	['China']
pomt-01054	In President Barack Obama’s 2015 State of the Union address, "the words ‘al-Qaida’ were never used, the first time those words have not been used in a State of the Union address since February 2001."	true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jan/21/bret-baier/fox-host-obama-first-president-2001-not-say-al-qai/	Fox News’ chief political anchor said President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address was remarkable for what it left out. "The words ‘al-Qaida’ were never used," said host Bret Baier, "the first time those words have not been used in a State of the Union address since February 2001." The omission was particularly notable because of the speech’s proximity to the Charlie Hebdo attacks tied to al-Qaida jihadists in the Arabian Peninsula and heightened warnings from British authorities about a possible attack from "core" al-Qaida, Baier said. Instead, as Baier noted, Obama talked about ISIS and asked Congress to officially authorize a military fight against Islamic State terrorists, which broke off from al-Qaida. Still, Baier’s point about al-Qaida not being in the address is right. Every State of the Union address since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks by al-Qaida have included references to this specific jihadist movement. We checked copies of speeches by President George W. Bush and Obama from the American Presidency Project of the University of California Santa Barbara. The Bush speeches As Baier said, the last time we didn’t hear "al-Qaida" in a State of the Union-like setting was Bush’s Feb. 27, 2001, "budget message" to a joint session of Congress. (Obama’s first speech to Congress in 2009 was also not technically a State of the Union, though it was covered and delivered like one.) In Bush’s 2001 speech, delivered nearly seven months before the day that changed everything, Bush did allude to "terrorists who threaten with bombs" as one of the widespread threats of the new 21st century. But he did not mention al-Qaida by name. Bush’s speech in 2002 was heavily centered on the new war on terrorism in Afghanistan, not surprisingly, but only mentioned al-Qaida once in reference to flight attendants who spotted a man trained by the group and wearing explosives and foiled his attack before Christmas. The group’s name resurged in 2003 as Bush described advances in capturing its leaders and made the case to go after Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein for his pursuit of chemical, biological and nuclear weapons and because he "aids and protects terrorists, including members of al-Qaida." Subsequent speeches by Bush mainly mentioned al-Qaida in connection with captured leaders or defending the need for the PATRIOT Act’s surveillance programs. Bush’s last two State of the Unions talked about al-Qaida way more often as the country grew more weary of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. He was reminding Americans why they were there. There were 10 mentions in 2007 and 11 mentions in 2008, including this excerpt: When we met last year, al-Qaida had sanctuaries in many areas of Iraq, and their leaders had just offered American forces safe passage out of the country. Today, it is al-Qaida that is searching for safe passage. They have been driven from many of the strongholds they once held. And over the past year, we've captured or killed thousands of extremists in Iraq, including hundreds of key al-Qaida leaders and operatives. Last month, Osama bin Laden released a tape in which he railed against Iraqi tribal leaders who have turned on al-Qaida and admitted that coalition forces are growing stronger in Iraq. Ladies and gentlemen, some may deny the surge is working, but among the terrorists there is no doubt. Al-Qaida is on the run in Iraq, and this enemy will be defeated. The Obama speeches Obama took office criticizing Bush’s handling of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, so it’s no surprise that his early mentions of al-Qaida come in a different context. "And with our friends and allies, we will forge a new and comprehensive strategy for Afghanistan and Pakistan to defeat al-Qaida and combat extremism," Obama told a joint session to Congress, "because I will not allow terrorists to plot against the American people from safe havens halfway around the world. We will not allow it." This was the same speech -- again, technically not a State of the Union -- in which Obama called for the closure of the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba (which is still open). Three years later, Obama reminded the country about the killing of Osama bin Laden and top al-Qaida fighters in his 2012 State of the Union. We gather tonight knowing that this generation of heroes has made the United States safer and more respected around the world. For the first time in nine years, there are no Americans fighting in Iraq. For the first time in two decades, Osama bin Laden is not a threat to this country. Most of al-Qaida's top lieutenants have been defeated. The Taliban's momentum has been broken, and some troops in Afghanistan have begun to come home. Obama’s 2013 and 2014 remarks discussed the demise of core al-Qaida, calling the group that organized the 9/11 attacks a "shadow of its former self." But "core" was the key distinction, as Obama also highlighted the rise of affiliate extremist groups not long after the attacks on the American consulate in Benghazi, Libya. And as for last night’s speech (see our annotation)? No direct mention of al-Qaida, but Obama did reference terrorists. First, we stand united with people around the world who've been targeted by terrorists, from a school in Pakistan to the streets of Paris. We will continue ... to hunt down terrorists and dismantle their networks, and we reserve the right to act unilaterally, as we have done relentlessly since I took office, to take out terrorists who pose a direct threat to us and our allies. ... And tonight, I call on this Congress to show the world that we are united in this mission bypassing a resolution to authorize the use of force against ISIL. Our ruling Baier said, "The words ‘al-Qaida’ were never used, the first time those words have not been used in a State of the Union address since February 2001." This is accurate, so we rate it True.

pomt-13610	Says Hillary Clinton once "wanted a wall" on the Mexican border.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/aug/15/donald-trump/donald-trump-right-hillary-clinton-once-wanted-wal/	Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has said her party "builds bridges not walls." During a campaign appearance in Green Bay, Republican nominee Donald Trump said Clinton had once been in favor of a wall with Mexico. Building a wall along the 2,000-mile border between the United States and Mexico, of course, has been a central part of Trump’s campaign. He has even vowed to force the Mexican government to pay for it. But did Clinton once back a wall? Here is how Trump phrased it in his Aug. 5, 2016 rally at the KI Convention Center: "We’re gonna have strong borders. We’re gonna have a wall -- a big, powerful wall. You know that Hillary Clinton wanted a wall, a number of years ago. She wanted a wall." Let’s take a closer look. Secure Fence Act To be sure, both Trump and Clinton say they support secure borders. In the 2016 campaign, Trump has said he would secure borders by building a wall. Clinton hasn’t detailed specific plans but has said she will protect U.S. borders through a combination of efforts, one being physical barriers. But this factcheck is not about Clinton’s current platform. Rather, it is about what she may have supported in the past. When asked for backup, Trump’s campaign pointed to a 2006 bill that Clinton voted for while a senator from New York. The bill -- the Secure Fence Act of 2006 -- authorized about 700 miles of fencing to be installed along the country’s southern border, along with other security measures. It was the beginning of an attempt to pass comprehensive immigration reform. The original bill specifically called for double-layer fencing across 700 miles of the border. Clinton, and 25 other Democratic senators, voted in favor of the bill. It passed the Senate 80-19 and was signed into law by President George W. Bush. So, it’s fair to say she once supported a barrier along a large portion of the border. Today, 702 miles of fencing separates the United States from Mexico, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. But just 36 miles are double-layered. That’s because a 2007 amendment in the federal budget bill let the U.S. Department of Homeland Security determine what was necessary. Wall vs. fence Trump campaign adviser Stephen Miller said of Clinton: "Her vote is self-explanatory." Practically speaking, what’s the difference between Trump’s wall and the fence proposed in 2006? Television news anchor Jorge Ramos asked Clinton this question Jan. 11, 2016 at the Iowa Black and Brown Forum, broadcast on the Fusion network, a Hispanic news channel. "What the difference between your idea and Donald Trump’s idea on building a wall with Mexico?," Ramos asked. "So we do need to have secure borders and what that will take is a combination of technology and physical barrier," Clinton said. "You want a wall then," Ramos interjected. "No, we’ve --" she said. "You said that." "Well, I voted for border security and some of it was a fence," Clinton said. "I don’t think we ever called it a wall. Maybe in some places it was a wall." Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst for the libertarian Cato Institute said the semantic differences are irrelevant. "Whether it’s a wall or a fence, it blocks people," Nowrasteh said. "Quibbling between a wall and fence -- it’s just a word game at that point." He noted a 700-mile barrier is substantial. Indeed, it represents about one-third of the length of the border. "Maybe it’s fair to say she doesn’t support a wall along the entirety but she certainly supported a barrier along a large portion of it," Nowrasteh said. Jon Feere, a legal policy analyst at the Center for Immigration Studies, agreed. The center favors reduced immigration. "It's clear that, at one point, Clinton supported a secure border that includes physical barriers," Feere said. Our rating In a Green Bay speech, Trump said "Hillary Clinton wanted a wall."

For our purposes, the differences between a wall and a fence in this claim are not significant -- both block people.

pomt-08463	Says David Wu has presided over "137 months" in which "Oregon's unemployment rate has been above the national average."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2010/oct/14/rob-cornilles/rob-cornilles-attacks-david-wu-over-oregons-high-u/	Oregon's unemployment rate has hovered around 10.6 percent for nearly a year and a half, a full point or so above the national jobless rate. Economists have offered a slew of reasons why the state's jobless rate has remained consistently above most other states’. Those explanations range from a net in-migration of new residents, who increase the number of people looking for jobs, to quality-of-life considerations that tend to keep newly jobless Oregonians from wanting to wander elsewhere. First District congressional challenger Rob Cornilles, the Tualatin Republican taking on veteran Democrat David Wu, has his own views on the matter. "For each and every one of the 137 months that David Wu has been in Congress," Cornilles' statement in The Oregonian’s Voter Guide asserts, "Oregon's unemployment rate has been above the national average. We deserve better!" The basis of Cornilles' claim appears to be that policies and practices endorsed by Wu have led to higher joblessness here than elsewhere for the past 137 months, or 11.5 years. Specifically, Cornilles criticizes Wu for "not providing tax certainty" by failing to extend the Bush-era tax cuts; for supporting the federal stimulus bill; and for failing, after during 12 years in Congress, to gain the kind of influence that would help create jobs across the First Congressional District. He’s right that Wu and the rest of Congress did not extend the tax cuts before the current break. He’s right Wu voted for the stimulus. And on the 137-month claim, Cornilles is also correct. And then some. But is it fair to link Wu to that statistic? PolitiFact Oregon looked back to 1976, when the state began tracking employment rates. According to state and federal data, Oregon has traditionally and consistently been above the national unemployment figure. Only for 66 of the past 418 months, in fact, has Oregon's unemployment rate dipped below the federal rate. Oregon nearly pulled even with the U.S. rate for the first few months in 2008. Both the national and state unemployment figures hovered just above 5 percent before skyrocketing in ensuing months as the worst overall economy since the Great Depression took hold. The most recent time Oregon's unemployment rate was below the national rate was February 1996, according to Tom Potiowsky, state economist. That was nearly three years before Wu took office. "With a few exceptions, we were pretty much below the national average from the mid-1990s until February 1996," Potiowsky said. Oregon's high-tech boom years accounted for much of that boost, he said. State economists cite several reasons for the state generally lagging behind the nation on this measure. In addition to the quality of life and net in-migration factors cited above, they include the lack of a really large metropolitan area in Oregon. If the Portland area's population were on the order of 4 million, for instance, it could support a labor market large enough to let someone who had lost a job more easily find a comparable one, said David Cooke, an Oregon Employment Department economist. Could Wu have done much to reverse any of these factors? Doubtful, Cooke said. "There are so many factors that influence the economy,'' he said. "One congressperson's actions are a very small contributor, especially when you move down to the state level." So while Cornilles' 137-month figure is correct, it's quite a reach to imply that Wu had much to do with it. We find his claim is Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-11229	"Black men arrested In Philadelphia Starbucks settle for $2 million"	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/may/07/blog-posting/radio-shows-headline-falsely-claims-philadelphia-s/	A headline on the website for a nationally syndicated radio show falsely claimed that two black men who were arrested at a Starbucks while waiting for an acquaintance settled for $2 million. "Black men arrested in Philadelphia Starbucks settle for $2 million," said the headline of a May 2 post on The Rickey Smiley Morning Show’s website. The show’s Twitter account on May 2 tweeted a link to the story with a similar caption about a $2 million settlement. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Facebook users flagged the website’s post as being potentially wrong. The original headline was. But the post has since been updated. Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson were arrested April 12 at a Philadelphia Starbucks while waiting for a business meeting. The two men were sitting at a table waiting for a friend, but had not made purchases. When they refused to leave, a store manager called the police and they were eventually escorted out in handcuffs, according to Philly.com. The incident was caught on video, prompting national news and allegations of racism. The two men settled with the city for $1 each. Also, the city agreed to create a $200,000 fund to assist Philadelphia’s young entrepreneurs. A joint statement from Starbucks, Nelson and Robinson said they reached "a confidential financial settlement as well as a commitment to continued listening and dialogue between the parties as a means toward developing specific actions and opportunities." While the headline on the The Rickey Smiley Morning Show incorrectly said the men had settled for $2 million, the story itself accurately represented the outcome. "Instead of a long and drawn-out legal battle, the men at the center of the Philadelphia Starbucks arrest incident have taken an incredibly low settlement from the city with a perk that speaks to their interests," the post said. "Taking $1 dollar settlements each, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson will help spearhead a $200,000 grant program designed to aid young entrepreneurs like themselves." As of early afternoon May 4, the headline said the settlement was for $2 million. It has since been amended to say it was for $2. While The Rickey Smiley Morning Show has updated its headline, the original version claimed the settlement was for $2 million, not $2. We rate the headline False.

pomt-15186	"We have an Army that just cut 40,000 spots."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/aug/20/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-army-just-cut-40000-spots/	U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said at the Iowa State Fair that to face threats from across the globe, ranging from the Middle East to Asia to Russia, the United States needs to keep its military strong. "The most important obligation of the federal government is to keep you safe and me safe and our family safe," Rubio said on Aug. 18, 2015. "And it’s not doing that now, because we are eviscerating our defense spending." One example he cited: "We have an Army that just cut 40,000 spots." We were curious if that number was correct, so we decided to check it out. Army announcement Army officials had been talking about reducing the size of their force for several months when they announced specific plans in July 2015. The Army said it will cut the size of the regular Army from 490,000 to 450,000 by fiscal year 2018 -- that’s 40,000 -- with some of the largest cuts at sites in Georgia and Texas. Those cuts will start in October 2015 and end by October 2018. That means the cuts to the Army haven’t happened yet and will be finished under the next president. The cuts are expected to come through attrition, early retirements and layoffs. That’s in addition to plans to cut 17,000 civilians. The Army has been substantially scaling back its force the past few years. In 2012, the Army had about 570,000 soldiers. In 2013, the Army announced a drawdown of 80,000 to bring the size to the current 490,000. The new cuts will save about $7 billion. Army officials said the cuts are a result of the Budget Control Act of 2011 and the budget sequestration that followed. If sequestration continues, the Army expects to shrink to about 420,000 soldiers sometime in 2019. "We think 450,000 is the minimum force to meet our obligations across the globe," Army spokesman Lt. Cmd. Joe Buccino told PolitiFact. Some lawmakers have questioned the cuts in light of the current situation with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, among other crises. In an op-ed in the Washington Post in May, Rubio was critical of Obama’s actions in Iraq and Syria. He called for the president to "increase the number of U.S. forces in Iraq." Rubio correctly cited the number that the Army plans to cut, but he omitted some caveats, including that the cuts haven’t taken place yet. And it’s difficult to predict if the cuts will be fully implemented as the end date in 2018 will be under a new president and Congress. "The reduction in active Army end-strength is likely but far from certain, given that lots of people in the Congress would like to get the Army more money," said Benjamin Friedman, a military expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. Mackenzie Eaglen, a defense expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said she expects the cuts to occur. "The Army waited as long as possible to even start this latest reduction in force size," she said. While the talking about the reduction in soldiers makes good political fodder, it doesn’t address whether higher troop counts are needed, said Charles Knight, co-founder of Project on Defense Alternatives, a group that advocates for lower levels of armed force and military spending worldwide. "The only circumstance in which the Army needs those soldiers is if the U.S. were to reoccupy Iraq, invade and occupy Syria or Iran, or such," he said. "Current government policy is explicitly against such options." But the next president -- whether it’s Rubio or someone else -- "could easily reverse current policy starting in 2017," Knight said. A few experts took issue with Rubio’s statement that we are "eviscerating" defense spending. "The term eviscerate is, to my mind, entirely unwarranted for a military that continues to spend almost $600 billion a year, well above the Cold War average and nearly 40 percent of the world’s total," said Michael O’Hanlon, a defense expert at the Brookings Institution. Our ruling Rubio said, "We have an Army that just cut 40,000 spots." Rubio was referring to an announcement by the Army in July that it will cut 40,000 spots by fiscal year 2018. Those cuts had been talked about for several months, but the specifics were released in July. The cuts will start this fall but are expected to continue under the next president. Since the end date is under a new president and Congress, it’s difficult to guess if they will all happen, but that’s the plan for now. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-02921	"Providence has more of its pension fund invested in hedge funds and is less transparent" about it than the state.	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/nov/03/gina-raimondo/ri-general-treasurer-gina-raimondo-says-providence/	Rhode Island General Treasurer Gina Raimondo has come under fire because, on her recommendation, the State Investment Commission, in 2012, put more pension money in hedge funds. Critics say the funds, which are designed to retain value or increase in value for large investors when the overall market is performing poorly, are risky and charge exorbitant rates. On Oct. 21, after a report commissioned by the largest state employees union accused Raimondo of selling out Rhode Island's public workers and retirees for an "opportunity to enrich herself and her hedge fund backers," Raimondo sent out a fundraising letter trying to put the investment strategy in perspective. One portion focused on Providence's pension fund, overseen by Mayor Angel Taveras, a declared candidate for governor who is expected to face Raimondo in a Democratic primary. "Providence has more of its pension fund invested in hedge funds and is less transparent – and yet isn’t included in the [union-financed] report because this is about attacking one individual and a comprehensive reform," she said. We wondered whether her points about hedge funds and transparency were accurate. Looking at how much each fund is investing in hedge funds, the most recent monthly numbers show that, as of Sept. 30, Raimondo is correct on a percentage basis. The report, available on the treasurer's website, says 14.2 percent of Rhode Island’s $7.8 billion retirement account is invested in hedge funds. In Providence, hedge funds on Sept. 30 made up 16.6 percent of the $241 million in Providence's retirement account, according to a city report. That's nearly two and a half percentage points higher than the state’s ratio. However, when Providence made part of its annual required pension contribution nine days later, that percentage dropped to about 14.3 percent, virtually identical to the state ratio. (The value of the hedge funds hadn’t declined, only their percentage of the overall fund. When the city made the rest of its annual contribution, the ratio dropped to 13.2 percent, according to city spokesman David Ortiz, who noted that Taveras is trying to move away from hedge funds while Raimondo has embraced them.) So whether Raimondo is correct or not depends on when you look. Raimondo's office said her fundraising letter was based on a May 8, 2013, blog post at WPRI.com, which reported that Providence had just under 20 percent of its pension money invested in hedge funds at a time when the state's ratio was 14.6 percent. "The media report from May 2013 was the only information that we could publicly find regarding Providence’s investment allocation to hedge funds," said Collin Berglund, spokesman for Friends of Gina Raimondo. That has changed. After Raimondo made her comment and PolitiFact called Providence to check it on Oct. 23, the city posted more of its retirement fund data online, including the Sept. 30 numbers and an Oct. 22 tally that included the $33 million infusion of cash from the city that made hedge funds an even smaller slice of the retirement pie. Which brings us to the issue of transparency. Raimondo's office has bragged about its openness because detailed information about the investments is posted on the general treasurer's website. Raimondo has also, for the first time, included information on the hidden fees that some funds charge the state and most states don't report. City spokesman Ortiz responded in an Oct. 24 email: "Reports prepared by our pension investment advisers have always been provided to the media without any redaction, and are now publicly available on the city’s open data portal: https://data.providenceri.gov/." He said that Raimondo has denied public records requests and redacted "key data" regarding fees and performance for some investments. He did not respond when we pressed him for specifics. But earlier this year, Raimondo’s office denied a request by The Providence Journal to see certain details that each hedge fund gives to the state, saying it is bound by contractual confidentiality agreements. An Aug. 4, 2013 Journal story reported that much of that information was redacted from documents Raimondo’s office provided to the newspaper. When we asked Raimondo's office about Ortiz's allegations about disclosure, spokeswoman Joy Fox said in the few instances where information has been withheld, it had to be kept secret to avoid violating contracts. We found some hedge fund report information on the Providence website that seemed to offer more detail than what Raimondo offered, but it's not clear whether the report was available before PolitiFact began inquiring about Raimondo's claim about openness. Our ruling Rhode Island General Treasurer Gina Raimondo said Providence has more of its pension fund invested in hedge funds than the state does and is less transparent about it. Based on the Sept. 30 financial statements, the first part of Raimondo's statement would have been true. The city had 16.6 percent of its pension money in hedge funds, compared with the state’s 14.2 percent. That's no longer true because Providence subsequently made its annual pension payment, increasing the proportion of non-hedge fund investments. But that information was not public at the time Raimondo made her statement. On the issue of disclosure, the city has released pension information when asked, but there’s much more pension information -- particularly historical information -- widely available to the public on the state’s website. Raimondo’s statement was accurate on Sept. 30, but recognizing that a key element had changed by the time she made it on Oct. 21, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-15063	"When (Ronald) Reagan came in, from 1978 to 1982, economic growth averaged less than 1 percent a year. There’s only one other four-year period where that’s true. That’s true from 2008 to 2012."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/25/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-slow-economic-growth-under-jimmy-car/	Newly installed CBS late-night host Stephen Colbert tangled, politely, with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, on his Sept. 21 show regarding the legacy of President Ronald Reagan. Colbert asked Cruz, who’s running for the Republican presidential nomination, whether he could agree with Reagan’s support of "amnesty" for undocumented immigrants and the late president’s willingness to raise some taxes amid budget shortfalls. Cruz said "of course not" before pivoting to Reagan’s most conservative accomplishments, one being that he "signed the largest tax cut in history" and spurred economic growth. "When (Ronald) Reagan came in, from 1978 to 1982, economic growth averaged less than 1 percent a year," Cruz said. "There’s only one other four-year period where that’s true. That’s true from 2008 to 2012." His point was that Reagan rescued the U.S. economy from the ravages it suffered under his Democratic predecessor, President Jimmy Carter, and that the only other equivalent economic distress occurred under Carter’s fellow Democrat, Barack Obama. Colbert responded, "But when conditions changed in the country, he reversed his world’s ‘largest tax cut’ and raised taxes when revenues did not match the expectations. So it’s a matter of compromising." We wondered if Cruz was correct about the periods of low GDP growth. (In a separate fact-check, we explore Colbert’s rejoinder.) Excepting the unusual post-World War II period of 1945 through 1949 -- when the nation was demobilizing from an all-encompassing war -- Cruz has put his finger correctly on the two general periods in which the annual average growth of gross domestic product over four-year periods has sunk below 1 percent. They are the late 1970s era of "stagflation" (that is, stagnant growth combined with rapid inflation) and the aftermath of the Great Recession. The full annual data can be found here. But there were actually three distinct four-year periods during and after the Great Recession that fit Cruz’s criteria, rather than one -- that is, the four-year periods starting with 2006, 2007 and 2008. (With every four-year period beginning after 2009, average annual GDP growth has exceeded 1 percent.) Here’s the rundown of the four post-World War II periods that fit Cruz’s criteria: First year Second year Third year Fourth year Average annual GDP growth 1979 1980 1981 1982 0.2 percent 2006 2007 2008 2009 0.3 percent 2007 2008 2009 2010 0.4 percent 2008 2009 2010 2011 0.4 percent So Cruz overlooked two additional four-year periods. Also, the implication of his comment -- that Democrats bear the primary responsibility for these periods of poor economic growth -- is not so clear. For starters, as we’ve discussed previously, economists say it’s hard to determine how much credit or blame a president deserves for successes or shortcomings in the economy at large on their watch. Factors outside their control, from energy-price shocks to technological changes to pure luck, can have a significant impact on the nation’s economic record. In addition, Cruz’s groupings suggest some contradictory standard-setting. For the 1979-1982 period, Carter was in office for the first two years and Reagan was in office for the third and fourth years. But in the next two periods -- 2006-2009 and 2007-2010 -- George W. Bush, a Republican, was president for at least half of the time. In fact, Bush was in charge for the first three years in 2006-2009, and the first two years in 2007-2010. If Carter, Democrat, is to take blame for the slow growth in the first period, then logically Bush, a Republican, should shoulder the same blame in the next two four-year periods. By the same token, if Reagan, a Republican, escapes blame in the first example, then so too should Obama in the second and third four-year periods. And the 2005-2008 period -- which occurred entirely on Bush’s watch -- barely escapes inclusion on this list, with an average annual growth rate of 1.13 percent. (During the 2008-2011 period, Obama was president for the final three of those years.) Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, said he doesn’t blame either Reagan or Obama for the economic shortcomings early in their tenures that fall under Cruz’s statistical claim. Still, he sees a logical inconsistency in Cruz’s comparison as stated on Colbert’s show. "It seems doubtful whether poor economic performance early in any president's term can be attributed to the impact of his administration's policies," Burtless said. "If you take office when economic output is plunging, it does not seem legitimate to attribute the economic plunge to the person who just took office." He added a footnote: Unlike Obama, who unquestionably inherited a recession already under way, the economy actually grew through the first couple of months of Reagan’s first term. GDP grew in the third and fourth quarters of 1980, right before he was elected, and continued to grow during the first quarter of 1981 after he was in office, before a "double-dip" recession hit. Cruz spokesman Phil Novack told PolitiFact that our analysis misses the point. "The focus on who exactly held office in each of those individual time periods is not as important as the contrast between the two periods in terms of how quickly the economy was growing before and after those identified time periods, which is the point Cruz was making," Novack said. "His point was obviously referring to policy results, and we know the results of the policies that followed those slow-growth years of below 1 percent growth that Sen. Cruz identified. Reagan's policies brought us a boom, and Obama's policies have been a bust." For what it’s worth, we also compared Carter and Reagan on their economic records and found them more similar than one might expect. During Carter’s four years in office, the growth rate averaged 3.23 percent a year. If you take the first four years of Reagan’s presidency, it averaged 3.34 percent. Essentially, each president had two good years and two bad years, which more or less averaged out. Our ruling Cruz said that "when (Ronald) Reagan came in, from 1978 to 1982, economic growth averaged less than 1 percent a year. There’s only one other four-year period where that’s true. That’s true from 2008 to 2012." Cruz missed two other four-year periods that fit the criteria. In addition, his implication -- that Democrats are largely to blame for those conditions -- doesn’t stand up to logical consistency, particularly when he excluded the period beginning in 2006 (which included three years solely under Bush) and 2007 (which included two years solely under Bush). This goes on top of general uncertainty about how much blame to assign presidents for poor economic conditions. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-10440	"For what we spend in just one week in Iraq, 800,000 children could get health insurance for an entire year."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/07/florida-consumer-action-network/that-money-could-insure-twice-as-many-kids/	Moments after Sen. John McCain fleshed out details of his health care plan in Tampa on April 29, 2008, opponents of his proposal were lining up to poke holes in the ideas of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. One criticism: McCain is willing to spend billions on the war in Iraq but not to help cover the 47-million Americans who don't have health insurance. McCain's plan takes a free-market approach to health insurance and avoids the government involvement proposed by his Democratic rivals. Among other things, McCain has suggested offering a $2,500 tax credit to individuals and a $5,000 credit to families to help pay for health insurance independent of their employers and setting up a nonprofit to negotiate health insurance for people denied coverage by private companies. The plan shows McCain's mixed-up priorities, contends Bill Newton, executive director of the Florida Consumer Action Network. "For what we spend in just one week in Iraq, 800,000 children could get health insurance for an entire year," Newton said to highlight McCain's support of the war and his record of voting against expanding federal funding for the State Children's Health Insurance Program. He made the statement April 29 at a news conference co-hosted by FCAN, Moveon.org and health care workers in the same hotel where McCain was attending a fundraiser. Newton's point is accurate, but his numbers are significantly understated. In fact, one week of war spending in Iraq would insure more than twice as many children. To check the claim, we looked at the cost of the war in Iraq versus how much Medicaid spends to insure one child for a year. The Bush administration war chest request for 2008 was $196-billion for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with $159-billion going to Iraq, according to a summary by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. That amounts to $3-billion a week. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, Medicaid payments in 2005 were about $1,617 per child. So $3-billion would actually insure about 1.9-million children a year. Newton said he got his figure from a federal budget trade-off calculator on the National Priorities Project Web site. A spokeswoman for National Priorities said the organization put the annual cost of insuring a child at about $1,800, based on costs in 2000 and forecasting for 2005. The calculator estimates the weekly war funding would insure about 1.1-million children based on spending in 2007. The calculator doesn't offer a figure for total proposed 2008 funding. The most current figures only make Newton's case stronger. When ruling on claims where numbers are overestimated, PolitiFact often gives the benefit of the doubt.

pomt-10904	Says Donald Trump contradicted his own administration when he said the decision to allow blueprints for 3D-printed guns to be distributed "doesn’t seem to make much sense."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/02/blog-posting/how-trump-state-permitted-3-d-printed-gun/	A federal judge issued a temporary restraining order to block the online publication of blueprints outlining how to create untraceable and undetectable 3D-printed firearms. The blueprints were originally scheduled for an Aug. 1 release after a government settlement ended five years of litigation. But word of the release prompted panic as legislators and officials scrambled to block the action. Before the federal judge’s ruling, at least 21 attorneys general filed suit to stop the blueprints from going live. As conversation heated up, President Donald Trump weighed in on Twitter. "I am looking into 3-D Plastic Guns being sold to the public," he said. "Already spoke to NRA, doesn’t seem to make much sense!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Politicians and pundits jumped at the president’s words as proof that he was unfamiliar with a decision from his own administration. "Trump: My own administration’s latest decision ‘doesn’t seem to make much sense!’" said a July 31 headline from Addicting Info, a liberal website. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Trump’s last-minute statement gave us pause, too, so we decided to look at the settlement. Was the Trump administration — or Trump — actually behind it? The White House did not respond to a request for comment (though Trump's press secretary said later that he did not get a chance to weigh in). So we searched elsewhere for our answer. Litigation has roots in Obama years On May 5, 2013, Defense Distributed uploaded blueprints online that could be used to make a working 3D-printed gun called "The Liberator," as well as a 53-second video of founder Cody Wilson firing one. Wilson soon received a letter from the Obama administration’s State Department demanding that he remove the files from the internet. The letter said the "technical data" amounted to an illegal gun export in violation of the Arms Export Control Act and International Traffic in Arms Regulations, because it could be accessed in countries where the United States does not sell weapons. The State Department instructed Wilson to take down the files until he applied for specific approval of the gun’s multiple components. By that point, the blueprints had already been downloaded 100,000 times. In response, Wilson filed a lawsuit against the State Department with the help of Second Amendment Foundation, a guns-rights organization, in which he sought a preliminary injunction to allow continued publication of the gun files online. Under both the Obama and Trump administrations, the government stuck by its assertion that the "technical data" constituted an illegal gun export. Wilson countered that the government’s intervention violated his First Amendment right to free speech. Ultimately, district and appeals courts both rejected Wilson’s injunction request. But as the case turned to the First Amendment claim, the government made an unexpected settlement offer. Settlement offer from Trump’s State Department With the settlement, reached in June and announced July 10, the government waived the relevant export restrictions and allowed Wilson to post the blueprints online as early as Aug. 1. Specifically, the State Department announced that it was "in the interest of the security and foreign policy of the United States" to temporarily modify the U.S. Munitions List to exclude the technical data for the 3-D-printed guns. Defense-related items on the munitions list face tight restrictions, because they offer a critical military or intelligence advantage to the United States. The U.S. Commerce Department manages a separate export list with fewer restrictions. It is not clear what role Trump or the White House played in the settlement decision, though White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said during an Aug. 1 press briefing that the Department of Justice instructed the State Department to settle without White House approval. The State Department has said that its role in this issue relates solely to regulation of exports of certain types of firearms and any related technical data. But the move to shift the 3D-printed guns’ technical data outside of the State Department’s purview was not without precedent. The government’s decision came amid a longstanding but relatively behind-the-scenes administrative project — started under the Obama administration and known as "export control reform" — to restructure the regulations governing exports of weapons and technologies. Why is Obama’s export control reform relevant? Just as the litigation against Wilson can be traced back to the Obama years, so, too, can the export control changes that may have opened the door for the State Department’s settlement. Beginning in 2009, the Obama administration launched an overhaul of export control in order to refine regulations for items that were subject to both the State Department’s International Traffic in Arms Regulations and the Commerce Department’s Export Administration Regulations. The goal of the reform was to streamline export controls by transferring commercially available items — such as consumer guns — off the USML and onto the less restrictive Commerce Control List. The State Department began reviewing the munitions list, sifting through each category and removing items that were not considered military-sensitive. By 2016, it had finished reviewing all but three categories: firearms, ammunition and artillery. However, reform of those final categories stalled before it could become policy. A proposed rule would have handed jurisdiction of commercial firearms export controls to the Commerce Department in 2012, but it was delayed following the Sandy Hook school shooting. That proposed rule did not regain momentum until 2018, under Trump. On May 24, the Departments of State and Commerce simultaneously published proposals in the Federal Register to amend the final three categories of the munitions list. The proposed revisions would keep military-grade weapons under State Department jurisdiction and place commercially available firearms under the purview or the Commerce Department. According to the New York Times, these proposals strongly resemble the Obama administration’s 2012 version. CNN reported that the government is currently reviewing them. This may explain the State Department’s sudden decision to settle its case with Wilson. By recommending that commercial firearm exports move under Commerce Department oversight, the May 24 proposals would likely free Wilson’s blueprints from the International Traffic in Arms Regulations that previously restricted them. "My guess is that it was somehow wrapped up in the movement of items from the (U.S. Munitions List) to the (Commerce Control List)," said Rachel Stohl, managing director at the Stimson Center and an expert in the international arms trade. "If you deregulate the weapons themselves, it would follow that the technical specs could be deregulated as well." Stohl added that the settlement was "unexpected" and "the State and Commerce Departments have been less than forthcoming on these details." For his part, Wilson has agreed to refrain from posting his blueprints for at least another month while the multi-state lawsuit travels through the courts. Our ruling A headline suggested that the government settlement that would have made 3D-printable guns available for download was actually a Trump administration decision, and that Trump said that didn't "make much sense." We could not independently determine the extent of Trump’s involvement, although Sanders said the president was not afforded the opportunity to approve of the settlement decision. But the State Department under Trump did initiate the settlement after previously taking steps to clear a path for it. However, the Obama administration’s export control reform made those steps possible, and it is not far-fetched to consider the Trump administration’s move a continuation of that initiative.

pomt-11376	NASA Has Just Confirmed Earth Has A New Moon	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/30/blog-posting/no-nasa-has-not-confirmed-earth-has-new-moon/	There’s more than one moon orbiting Earth? That’s what smartmindmag.com claimed on an undated post headlined "NASA Has Just Confirmed Earth Has A New Moon." "According to new reports from NASA, there is a quasi-moon orbiting around Earth for almost a century, and we have missed it all along," the website claimed. "The new moon isn’t as big as THE MOON is, but, it still keeps our original moon company while traveling across space." Not quite. The post heavily borrows from a June 2016 NASA report but takes liberties to stretch the truth. NASA in 2016 announced the discovery of a small asteroid which as it orbits the sun, "appears to circle around Earth as well." But NASA did not say that the asteroid, labeled 2016 HO3, was a new moon orbiting Earth. "It is too distant to be considered a true satellite of our planet, but it is the best and most stable example to date of a near-Earth companion, or ‘quasi-satellite’," the NASA report said. A satellite is an object that moves around a larger object, and both the Earth and the moon are considered "natural" satellites, NASA explains. 2016 HO3’s characteristics only elevate it to "quasi-satellite." The smartmindmag.com post included legitimate quotes that appear on NASA’s 2016 post, but jumped to a conclusion that NASA did not establish. Both the NASA report and smartmindmag.com quote Paul Chodas, manager of NASA's Center for Near-Earth Object (NEO) Studies at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., as saying: "Since 2016 HO3 loops around our planet, but never ventures very far away as we both go around the sun, we refer to it as a quasi-satellite of Earth." Other more prominent news outlets ran similar headlines in 2016 about Earth having two moons, based on NASA’s report. Business Insider: SURPRISE: Earth has two moons. But other websites covered the story more accurately. Slate’s headline hinted that details matter: Another Moon for Earth? Well, Not Really, but It Depends on Your Point of View. Gizmodo also explained the nuances in a story headlined: Earth's New 'Quasi' Moon Will Stick Around for Centuries. NASA has not confirmed that Earth has a new moon, as smartmindmag.com claimed.

pomt-13194	"400 bills have my name on them either as a sponsor or a co-sponsor. You don’t get that done unless you work with folks on the other side."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/24/hillary-clinton/clinton-says-400-bills-have-her-name-them-thanks-b/	Hillary Clinton insists that her track record as a U.S. senator is proof that she could bring a spirit of bipartisanship to a presidential administration. Speaking from her campaign jet following a rally in Pittsburgh on Oct. 22, Clinton said her prior political experience shows she’s been willing to work with Republicans. "I think you can go back and look at the record that I compiled by working with practically every Republican I served with," she said. "I think last time we had it counted, 400 bills have my name on them either as a sponsor or a co-sponsor. You don’t get that done unless you work with folks on the other side." We wanted to check whether Clinton sponsored or co-sponsored 400 bills, and whether she was as chummy with her Senate rivals as she claimed. Tallying bills Clinton won election to the U.S. Senate in 2000 to represent New York and was re-elected in 2006. Her tenure was from January 2001 to January 2009, when she resigned to become secretary of state. We first wanted to know to which 400 bills Clinton was referring. She’s used that figure before, such as the Oct. 9 presidential debate, but we couldn’t find a clear definition of which legislation she meant. We contacted Clinton’s campaign, which sent us a list of 400 measures they said had passed Congress and become law. The list included more than bills, which are written by lawmakers and become laws if they pass Congress and are signed by the president. Clinton’s list included resolutions, which often are used to express lawmaker opinions or affect congressional workings, and amendments, which are parts of bills added on while legislation is being considered. Clinton’s 400-bill list also includes House versions of her measures (bills, amendments and resolutions) that passed. Again, Clinton said "bills" as a senator, not "House bills," not "amendments," and not "resolutions." Those things may eventually have the effect of laws, but that doesn’t mean they are bills that "have my name on them." According to the official website for federal legislative information, Congress.gov, Clinton introduced 713 pieces of legislation over her two terms. Of that count, 363 were Senate bills, while the rest were amendments or resolutions. Of the bills Clinton sponsored, only three actually became law. One established a historic site in New York, one renamed a post office and one named a highway. Her Democratic New York counterpart Charles Schumer was the single co-sponsor for all three. (Co-sponsoring is just a way for a lawmaker to show he or she supports a piece of legislation after it has been written.) The laws were uncontroversial and passed by unanimous consent in the Senate and voice vote in the House before being signed by President George W. Bush. Clinton is listed as a co-sponsor on 74 bills that became law. Of those, 27 bills were sponsored by a Republican. Working with Republicans So Clinton is exaggerating a bit when talking about the number of bills she sponsored or co-sponsored. But what about her claim that she worked in a bipartisan fashion? According to our count, of the 363 bills she introduced in the Senate, 93 were co-sponsored by Republicans, or about 26 percent. A single Republican co-sponsored 48, while two or more members of the GOP signed onto 45 of the bills. We also checked GovTrack.us for Republican senators who co-sponsored a Clinton bill. Republicans were listed as a co-sponsor 241 times in the 355 bills she sponsored that were referred to a Senate committee. But that could include the same senator listed multiple times in different bills. Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, for instance, co-sponsored six pieces of Clinton legislation. Four of those measures had 10 or more Republican co-sponsors, so there’s plenty of duplication. Clinton’s campaign noted that almost every Republican senator co-sponsored a Clinton bill at one time or another. They provided a list showing that 57 of the 65 GOP senators who served at the same time as Clinton signed onto her bills. Experts who study Congress have told us that the number of sponsored or co-sponsored bills signed into law isn’t a thorough measure of effectiveness or productivity for a member of the Senate. Adding amendments, writing language for bills, holding hearings and helping constituents are all good indicators of performance. "By any reasonable standard, including the private comments of her colleagues on both sides of the aisle when she was in the Senate, she was very effective," American Enterprise Institute scholar Norman Ornstein told PolitiFact for an earlier fact-check. Our ruling Clinton said "400 bills have my name on them either as a sponsor or a co-sponsor" in the Senate, which is proof I worked "with practically every Republican I served with." Clinton’s list includes a lot of things that don’t meet the strict definition of a bill as we’d know it from middle school civics. Clinton passed three of her own bills, plus an additional 74 she co-sponsored. There is evidence Clinton worked with Republicans while in the Senate. About 26 percent of the bills she sponsored had support from a Republican. Clinton’s claim is partially accurate.

pomt-09875	Forty-five percent of Americans went without needed care because of costs in 2007.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/30/bill-pascrell/pascrell-says-45-percent-americans-went-without-ne/	The debate over reforming the U.S. health care system has inspired a torrent of often-conflicting statistics. We will look at three assertions made by Democratic Rep. Bill Pascrell of New Jersey. In this item, we will test his assertion that 45 percent of Americans went without needed care because of costs. On July 28, 2009, Pascrell took to the House floor to counter assertions by Republicans and others that a Democratic bill under consideration in the chamber would lead to the rationing of health care. Pascrell’s larger point was that rationing already exists today, just a different type — thanks to the financial barriers to coverage faced by millions of Americans. Specifically, Pascrell said: “Forty-five percent of Americans went without needed care because of costs in this country in 2007. That’s rationing. Fifty-three percent of Americans cut back on their health care in the last year because of costs. That’s rationing. … As many as 22,000 Americans die each year because they don’t have health insurance. My brothers and sisters, that’s rationing.” We are not going to weigh in on the question of whether it’s fair to equate Pascrell’s examples of “rationing” with what the bill’s critics charge the bill would do if enacted. Rather, we wanted to gauge whether Pascrell’s numbers were sound. So we looked at these three claims individually. The first claim comes from a biennial survey by the Commonwealth Fund, a widely respected nonprofit that studies health care policy. The survey sampled the views of 3,501 U.S. adults age 19 and older, between June 6 and October 24, 2007. The 2007 version of Commonwealth’s survey did indeed find that 45 percent of adults aged 19 to 64 had one of four “access problems” related to cost — not filling a prescription; not seeing a specialist when needed; skipping a recommended medical test, treatment or followup; or not visiting a doctor or a clinic when they had a medical problem. That rate is notably higher than the 29 percent who reported similar actions in the 2001 survey. Surveys, especially where participants need to recall for survey-takers what they did or didn’t do in the past, are always somewhat less reliable than research methodology that checks verifiable facts. “As a survey it’s reasonable, but surveys are inherently imperfect yardsticks for this kind of policy research,” said Ed Haislmaier, a scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Moreover, the numbers are now two years out of date. (The next Commonwealth survey is scheduled for release later this year.) And it’s obvious, but worth noting, that individually, the rates for each of those four actions was quite a bit lower than 45 percent: 31 percent of respondents didn’t fill a prescription, 31 percent didn’t go to a doctor or clinic for a medical problem, 25 percent skipped a test, treatment or followup, and 20 percent didn’t see a specialist. Still, we do not believe these problems detract in any serious way from the congressman’s claim, but they are worth noting. These are the most recent numbers available from Commonwealth — and it’s hard to imagine that the rates of access problems would have dropped precipitously since the 2007 poll was taken. Back then, the national unemployment rate was averaging 4.7 percent. Today, it’s almost twice that. We rate this claim by Pascrell to be Mostly True.

pomt-03620	"In 29 states in this country you can still get fired for not just being gay, but if your employer thinks you are gay."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/07/martina-navratilova/martina-navratilova-says-you-can-be-fired-being-ga/	One of the biggest news stories of last week came from the world of sports, with NBA player Jason Collins becoming the first active male athlete playing for a major U.S. team sport to come out as gay. Several Sunday public-affairs shows tried to put Collins’ declaration into historical context. CBS’ Face the Nation invited retired tennis great Martina Navratilova, among others, to discuss its significance. Navratilova came out as gay more than three decades ago. "I think when President (Barack) Obama came in favor of … gay marriage, that really changed the tide. But we have to remember that this has been a long time coming," she said. "We still don't have equal rights. I have been getting (questions) on Twitter, ‘Why does this matter? I don't care.’ Which is kind of code for, ‘I really don't want to know.’ But it does matter because in 29 states in this country you can still get fired for not just being gay but if your employer thinks you are gay. ... We don't have equal rights." We wondered whether Navratilova was correct that "in 29 states in this country you can still get fired for not just being gay, but if your employer thinks you are gay." According to the Human Rights Campaign, a gay-rights group, 21 states plus the District of Columbia explicitly prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The remaining 29 do not. (This map shows the legal situation by state.) We should note that the 29 states in question are defined by the absence of a law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation, rather than the presence of a law allowing such discrimination. This means employees in these states who believe they are discriminated against would not have grounds to win a lawsuit alleging discrimination. The group said that it’s possible for an employer to discriminate based on the perception, rather than the fact, that someone is gay. But while Navratilova gets the number right, our discussions with legal experts produced a few exceptions to the rule: • Government employees in those states have protections. Government workers are covered by the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. A public employee can establish a violation if they can show they were subjected to adverse treatment when compared with other similarly situated employees, and that the treatment was motivated by an intention to discriminate on the basis of improper considerations, according to Lambda Legal Defense, a legal organization focused on challenging discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals. Courts have backed the idea that sexual orientation is one of the categories that would permit such a lawsuit. In addition, nine other states -- beyond the 21 that currently ban discrimination based on sexual orientation -- have an executive order, administrative order or personnel regulation that prohibits such discrimination against public employees, according to the Human Rights Campaign. • Localities may have an anti-discrimination law even if their state does not. To give just one example, Pennsylvania has no statewide law, but many of its cities do, from Philadelphia and Pittsburgh all the way down to Jenkintown and Susquehanna Township, according to the Pennsylvania Diversity Network. According to the group, 12 of the 15 most populous cities in the Keystone State have anti-discrimination laws that cover sexual orientation, meaning a sizable percentage of employees in the state are covered even without a state law. • Individual employers may have policies that bar discrimination based on sexual orientation, even if their state or city does not. "Some employers, through union agreements, company handbooks or other contracts, may have explicitly or implicitly promised to refrain from certain kinds of discrimination, and these provisions, depending on the particulars, might protect some employees against irrational discrimination of this kind," said Vik Amar, a law professor at the University of California at Davis. • Title VII of the Civil Rights Act provides protection for employees who are subjected to gender-based stereotyping. This is relevant because Navratilova said you could get fired "if your employer thinks you are gay" -- not just if you are actually gay. While the Civil Rights Act currently protects only sex discrimination and not discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender-based stereotyping can include elements that overlap significantly with an employer "think(ing) you are gay." Hayley Gorenberg, deputy legal director of Lambda Legal, cited the 1989 Supreme Court case Price Waterhouse vs. Hopkins. In that case, a woman sued the accounting firm where she worked because she was not offered a promotion after a senior manager told her she should "walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry." The plaintiff convinced the court that sex stereotyping constitutes sex discrimination, Gorenberg said. This precedent could protect a straight person who appeared to an employer to be "gay" and suffered discrimination as a result. Gorenberg said that despite these exceptions, Navratilova has a point. She said that calls to her group’s national legal help line include a "very high percentage" of workplace discrimination complaints. "Without specific national protection, people are fired based on their sexual orientation far more easily," she said. Our ruling Navratilova said, "In 29 states in this country you can still get fired for not just being gay, but if your employer thinks you are gay." If you frame this statement in the context of blanket protections by states, she’s correct. Still, even in those 29 states, many gay and lesbian employees do have protections, either because they work for the government, because they live in a city that bars such discrimination, or because they work for a company that has pledged not to discriminate based on sexual orientation. On balance, we rate Navratilova’s claim Half True.	None	Martina Navratilova	None	None	None	2013-05-07T10:57:49	2013-05-05	['None']
pomt-15056	No openly gay man has ever been elected to the Georgia Legislature.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/sep/28/georgia-voice/no-openly-gay-man-elected-legislature-true/	Just months after a historic U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized same-sex marriage, an Atlanta newspaper that focuses on LGBT news says Georgia may be poised to make history of its own. If elected, two announced candidates for seats in the Georgia House of Representatives would become the first gay men elected to the state Legislature, according to the Georgia Voice. "Roughly a dozen have tried and failed in the last decade," Patrick Saunders wrote in the piece examining the campaigns of Rafer Johnson and Josh Noblitt. But gay lawmakers, and allies, led the unsuccessful fight against Georgia’s 2004 ban on same-sex marriage and were part of the effort to kill state religious freedom bills for the past two years. So with lawmakers pledging to bring back, for the third, time, the religious freedom bill, PolitiFact Georgia wondered: Did voters never send an openly gay man ever to the 236-member General Assembly? The relatively short history of gay lawmakers Openly gay state lawmakers are a somewhat new phenomenon, and not just in Georgia. The first such official appears to be now-U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin, an open lesbian who was elected to the Wisconsin Assembly in 1992. She was one of just six openly gay political candidates to win a general election that year nationwide. A lesbian was also the first openly gay state lawmaker in Georgia. Democrat Karla Drenner was elected to the state House in 2000 and has since represented the District 85 in the Avondale Estates area. We reached out to Saunders for his source about openly gay men in the Legislature. He cited the paper’s own archives, including a story last year that highlighted three openly gay men running for the state House. All three of those candidates – Republican Christopher Deraney for House District 78 representing parts of Clayton County; Democrat Bob Gibeling for House District 54 in Buckhead; and Democrat Timothy Swiney for Senate District 9 in Gwinnett – lost. In the news The Atlanta Journal-Constitution archives turned up a record year in 2006, when four openly gay candidates ran in the primary election. Drenner won her first opposed election since her first win. The late Allen Thornell, a gay activist running for a district representing Cabbagetown in Atlanta, narrowly lost what was then described as the opportunity to be the first openly gay man elected as a legislator. The other two candidates lost. But what about the other gay lawmakers cited in news articles about the religious liberty bill and other issues since? Two lesbians, both Democrats, have been elected after Drenner. Simone Bell was elected to represent east Atlanta area neighborhoods in House Distict 58, the one that Thornell almost won previously, in 2009. Keisha Waites took office in 2012 representing House District 60, covering southeast Atlanta, Hapeville and parts of Clayton and DeKalb counties. And, one gay man has served. At 27, Rashad Taylor was the youngest member of the General Assembly when he was elected in 2008. But he was not elected as a gay man. He came out as gay in 2011, after an anonymous accuser sent an email to media accusing him of misconduct. Taylor lost re-election in 2012 after being placed in the same district as another Democrat by Republican lawmakers during a legislative redistricting. Saunders cited Taylor in his answer to us – and subsequently updated his story – to note that while Taylor had served, he had not been elected as an openly gay man. Outside groups There is little doubt that an openly gay elected state lawmaker would make the news. But Politifact Georgia also reached out to some advocacy groups that keep varying track of openly gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people elected officials. The Victory Fund, which works to elect those candidates, is likely the best known on the national scene. However, officials from the Washington, D.C. group did not respond to emails and phone calls. A list of openly gay officials on the Victory Fund website was down, making their records unavailable for review. Jeff Graham of Georgia Equality, a nonpartisan LGBT advocacy group, said there wouldn’t have been any openly gay men on those lists anyway. Graham’s group follows elections in Georgia and has long been concerned with what he calls viable openly gay candidates. "They need to be good quality candidates who can run a race and be feasible to win," Graham said. "That takes financial resources, a good ground game to reach the voters and a good grasp of all issues. The last couple election cycles we’ve had openly gay men run but not run what I would consider viable campaigns." That may, in fact, change in 2016. Johnson is a somewhat known community advocate who would represent a Democratic stronghold in House District 62, which includes portions of College Park, Douglasville, East Point and parts of Fulton and Douglas counties. Noblitt is a minister at Saint Mark United Methodist Church and close with state Rep. Margaret Kaiser, who is stepping down to make a run for mayor. The Democratic district includes several Atlanta neighborhoods such as Inman Park, Reynoldstown and Poncey-Highland. "A lot of it has to do with a particular district, and I suspect the Ponce district is more amenable than others would be," said Kerwin Swint, the director of the political science department at Kennesaw State University. "Things like this are going to happen very quickly and it could very quickly have an impact on the discussion at the Capitol," he added. Our ruling A newspaper focused LGBT news recently said that no gay man has ever been elected to the Georgia Legislature. Newspaper archives and a statewide advocacy group that follows the issue back up the claim. Voters have sent three lesbians to serve under the Gold Dome. And one man came out during his stint in office but lost his next election. We rate the claim True.	None	Georgia Voice	None	None	None	2015-09-28T00:00:00	2015-09-17	['None']
pomt-00171	An agreement between the city of Chicago and the ACLU caused "virtually all of the rise in homicides" in 2016.	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2018/oct/23/jeff-sessions/sessions-wrong-again-chicago-murder-spike-cause/	Like President Donald Trump, who has claimed Chicago could solve its violence problem "in a week" by employing tougher tactics, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions frequently criticizes the city for policies he says hamstring its cops. In a speech to a law enforcement audience in Chicago on Friday, Sessions once again blamed the city’s 2016 spike in murders on an agreement between the Emanuel administration and the American Civil Liberties Union that reined in stop-and-frisk policing. "As a result of the agreement ... Chicago saw the biggest single-year increase in murders since we’ve had reliable statistics," Sessions said. "Former federal judge Paul Cassell and Professor Richard Fowles of the University of Utah examined what happened here, considered a number of possible causes, and found that the cause of virtually all of the rise in homicides was the ACLU agreement." We fact-checked Sessions when he made virtually the same claim back in May. It’s still Mostly False. Here’s why. Causation versus correlation Chicago entered an agreement with the ACLU to end its reliance on stop-and-frisk policing after the civil rights group threatened to take legal action. By 2016, the agreement was in full effect. The agreement followed the release of a report by ACLU’s Illinois chapter that found Chicagoans were stopped more than four times as often as New Yorkers were before that city years earlier reined in its stop-and-frisk policing. The Chicago agreement determined that going forward officers here would be trained to stop people for questioning only when there was a "reasonable suspicion of criminal conduct." The city also imposed more thorough documentation requirements for every stop made. Cassell, a former federal judge and current law professor, and Richard Fowles, an economics professor, found that street stops by Chicago police decreased sharply following the agreement — from 40,000 monthly down to less than 10,000 per month. The study attributed the significant uptick in homicides during the same time, from 480 in 2015 to 754 in 2016, to that decline in stops. But experts we spoke with in May pointed to a number of flaws in the study, including its limited time frame and the fact that violent crime has declined or held steady in other cities that have backed away from stop-and-frisk policing. Following the 2016 murder spike in Chicago, murders declined by 15 percent in 2017 — the steepest one-year reduction in nearly 15 years. And that figure is down again for 2018, dropping by a quarter since this time last year, according to data tracked by the Chicago Tribune. Those declines occurred even though the city continues to follow the agreement with the ACLU. Sessions’ argument is also weakened by the results in other cities that have taken similar steps to those in Chicago. During his remarks, Sessions held up New York as a law enforcement success story, pointing to significant progress made in tamping down violent crime there over the last few decades. "Last weekend there were zero murders in New York City for the first time in 25 years," Sessions said. "In fact, there were no shootings at all in New York City last weekend." Sessions is right that today’s New York is much less violent than in years’ past. But the Big Apple makes for a curious pick in defending stop-and-frisk. A federal judge ruled in 2013 that the way NYPD officers were stopping New Yorkers was unconstitutional, requiring them to change tactics. Even prior to the verdict, the department’s reliance on street stops was in decline. By the end of 2013, stops by police had plummeted from a 2011 high of more than 200,000 to 12,500. By Sessions’ logic, curtailing stop-and-frisk should have triggered a murder spike like Chicago’s. Yet murders in New York have declined or held steady in the years since the federal ruling. Newark, Seattle and Philadelphia have also limited police stops in recent years without a corresponding jump in murders. Meanwhile, even when Chicago was still stopping individuals at four times the rate of New York’s peak, gun seizures here dropped, detectives solved fewer murders and a decade-long decline in gun violence came to an end, a 2016 WBEZ investigation found. The Utah research report that underpins Sessions’ conclusions blames the upsurge in murders on the ACLU agreement but dismisses any possibility it could be related to the intense local reaction to the late 2015 release of police dashcam footage that showed officer Jason Van Dyke shooting black teenager Laquan McDonald 16 times. Van Dyke was convicted of second-degree murder earlier this month. In response to the fallout from the video’s release, Mayor Rahm Emanuel fired police chief Garry McCarthy in late 2015. McCarthy, who came to Chicago by way of the Newark and New York police departments, ran the Chicago department during the years when stops in this city outpaced New York’s. Our ruling Sessions said an agreement between the city of Chicago and the ACLU caused "virtually all of the rise in homicides" in 2016. His claim repeats a finding from a University of Utah study that attributed Chicago’s 2016 murder spike to an agreement between the city and the civil rights group meant to rein in the city’s stop-and-frisk tactics. Chicago’s murder toll did skyrocket that year, though it has declined since. The study has been criticized for its methods and for excluding other factors that could have played a role. There is an element of truth in Sessions’ claim, but it also ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Just like last time, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-14587	"Gene Green is the NRA’s favorite Democrat in Congress. ... "It’s no wonder the congressman has a lifetime A rating from the NRA."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/feb/05/adrian-garcia/adrian-garcia-mischaracterizes-nras-support-gene-g/	The Democratic race for Texas’ 29th Congressional district is turning to a hot-button issue: gun control. Gene Green, a Democrat, has represented Texas’ 29th District, which covers the eastern portion of Greater Houston, since 1993. In that time, he has been endorsed by the gun-owner rights group National Rifle Association several times and often received an A rating from the organization -- an issue his challenger, former Harris County Sheriff Adrian Garcia, is bringing to the fore in advance of the March 2016 Democratic primary. "Gene Green is the NRA’s favorite Democrat in Congress," Garcia was quoted saying in his own Jan. 7, 2016, campaign media release. "He’s part of the reason our president has had to use executive action to protect our people. When House Democrats reclaim a majority, the NRA will still have Gene Green in their pocket to block progressive gun safety measures. He is their insurance policy." Garcia continued: "It’s no wonder the congressman has a lifetime A rating from the NRA. He signed on to a letter with Texas Republicans to prevent the restriction of armor-piercing bullets. He voted against the Brady Bill, he's voted against child safety locks, and later voted for the assault weapons ban repeal. He also voted for keeping the gun show loophole." There are a lot of specifics in Garcia’s claim, and we’ll get to those. We also wanted to check if Green has a "lifetime A rating" from the NRA and, although it’s harder to judge, if he could be the organization’s "favorite Democrat." Lifetime rating? Garcia claimed Green had a "lifetime A rating" from the NRA. The NRA doesn’t award lifetime ratings; it says it only evaluates candidates each election cycle. Still, candidates sometimes use the term "lifetime rating" to promote consistently high -- or low -- NRA marks. According to Jennifer Baker, the association’s director of public affairs, the NRA evaluates candidates by looking at voting records, public statements, plus what he or she is doing "behind the scenes" in committee. Baker said that if a hopeful hasn’t held office, the group primarily considers answers to survey questions. According to NRA’s website, its ratings range from A+ -- for a legislator with "not only an excellent voting record on all critical NRA issues, but who has also made a vigorous effort to promote and defend the Second Amendment"-- to F, a "true enemy of gun owners’ rights." Other ratings include AQ, a pro-gun candidate who has no voting record and whose rating is based on answers to survey questions, and "?," meaning a candidate didn’t answer the NRA’s questionnaire, inaction the organization takes as indicative of "indifference, if not outright hostility," to gun owners’ rights. Notably for this fact check, ratings for past election cycles only are available to NRA members. Baker told us by phone that when the NRA endorses a candidate, the group "actively informs our members of our preference in that race." A candidate who has a high rating is not guaranteed to receive an endorsement, she said, and a candidate with a lower rating can sometimes be endorsed if the NRA thinks the opponent would be especially bad on its issues. We used an NRA member password and checked with the organization on ratings prior to 2002, which are not posted online at all, to verify Green’s record over the 24 years he’s run for election and re-election to Congress. He mostly received A-level ratings, but drew one C too: 1992: rated "A" and endorsed 1994: rated "C," not endorsed 1996: rated "A+" and endorsed From 1998-2010: rated "A" and endorsed 2012: rated "A-," not endorsed 2014: rated "A-," not endorsed The NRA has not released ratings for the 2016 election cycle, and does not yet have an expected date for their release. So, what happened in 1994, and after 2012? In 1994, Green voted for the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, the sweeping crime bill signed by President Bill Clinton that included firearms control measures, Green told us by phone. "I voted for the bill as part of a package, and that’s why the NRA for a couple years didn’t appreciate it," he said. Green’s campaign spokesman, Jose Borjon, pointed out that the 1994 legislation included the federal assault weapons ban, which expired in 2004. The bill, we noted, also prohibited juvenile possession of a handgun, prohibited anyone convicted of domestic abuse from buying firearms or ammunition, increased penalties for crimes involving guns and added licensing and registration requirements for firearms dealers. Green suggested that between 2010 and 2012, when his rating slipped to an A- after more than 15 years of A’s, gun legislation became an even more partisan issue, and the NRA allied itself more with the Republican Party. As that happened, Green said, he did not want to be associated with the organization. However, his grade only declined from an A to an A-. A December 2012 Washington Post article that Green mentioned to us referenced his distancing from the NRA, at the time related to the NRA’s effort to get then-Attorney General Eric Holder held in contempt of Congress after the Sandy Hook school shootings in Newtown, Conn. He joined fellow gun-friendly Democrat John Dingell, the longtime Michigan representative who retired in 2014, in criticizing the group. In the same month, Green told reporters at Hearst’s Washington bureau that instead of passing new gun legislation, Congress needed "to find better ways to enforce current law." Voting record In Garcia’s release, the campaign offered background on the specific votes it referred to: -- The "letter with Texas Republicans to prevent the restriction of armor-piercing bullets," Garcia’s campaign said, was Green’s June 3, 2015, "yes" vote for the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. That act included an amendment prohibiting the use of funds to classify ammunition as armor piercing in imports. The letter itself is a March 4, 2015, letter signed by Green, Texas Republicans and others to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives opposing the agency’s proposed restrictions on armor-piercing bullets. -- Green, Garcia’s campaign said, voted in November 1993 against the Brady Bill, or the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, so named for James Brady, who was shot during an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan. We checked, and Green did vote against the Brady Bill. -- Green’s vote "against child safety locks," the Garcia campaign said, was his Sept. 24, 1999, "no" vote on a conference substitute for the Consequences for Juvenile Offenders Act. Green’s "no" vote was in response to a motion to instruct conferees, or a House vote to tell its conference committee members how to resolve an issue while negotiating a version of the bill between the House and the Senate. The issue at hand was a Senate amendment that required that child safety locks be sold with every handgun, among other regulations. Green voted no, to instruct committee members to reject that amendment. --Garcia’s reference to Green’s "vote for the assault weapons ban repeal" was Green’s March 22, 1996, "yes" vote for the Gun Crime Enforcement and Second Amendment Restoration Act. Green did vote for the legislation, which would have repealed the assault weapons ban that he earlier voted to put in place. --Green’s vote for "keeping the gun show loophole" was his June 18, 1999, "no" vote against the Mandatory Gun Show Background Check Act. Green, Garcia’s campaign said, voted against an amendment to regulate firearms transfers at gun shows and require criminal background checks to prevent the sale of guns to minors and felons. In response to these claims, Borjon, Green’s campaign spokesman, pointed out a few votes from Green’s tenure that tended toward gun control, including his 1994 vote in support of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act. Borjon also emphasized Green’s vote for the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Acts, which included the Child Safety Lock Act. Green himself emphasized to us that he supported the bipartisan gun legislation authored by California Democrat Mike Thompson and New York Republican Peter King, the Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights Protection Act. When we asked about Green’s voting record and his current stance on gun legislation, Green’s campaign said he supported President Obama’s 2016 executive action on gun safety. ‘Favorite Democrat in Congress’ Garcia’s campaign release also referred to Green as the "NRA’s favorite Democrat in Congress." While that’s not a determination we can make, we looked at the current Democrats in Congress to see if like Green, any have garnered mostly high ratings and endorsements. Of the 232 Democrats in Congress as of early 2016, six had fielded A ratings from the NRA before their latest election. Four others, besides Green, had A- ratings. One was rated AQ. The "A" Democrats were: Rep. Sanford Bishop of Georgia, Sen. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Reps. Collin Peterson and Tim Walz of Minnesota, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Rep. Ron Kind of Wisconsin. Democrats besides Green with an A-: Rep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois, Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, Rep. Kurt Schrader of Oregon and Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas. Sen. Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota was rated AQ. We reached out to Sean Theriault, a professor at the University of Texas who studies Congress. He said: "It looks like Green is among a group of Democrats who support the Second Amendment." Heading into the 2014 House elections, according to a ProPublica graphic Theriault sent us, 25 Democrats in Congress were rated from A- to A+. So, why did we identify only a dozen with that distinction? Many of the Democrats who drew high NRA marks in 2013 didn’t win re-election the next year. Our ruling Adrian Garcia said that his competitor in the Democratic race for Texas’ 29th district, Rep. Gene Green, has a "lifetime A rating" from the NRA and is the NRA’s "favorite Democrat in Congress." Green has certainly been a strong supporter of gun rights over his 23 years in the House. The gun control measures Green’s campaign pointed out that he supported were part of packages like the 1994 crime bill, in which Green voted with his party. However, the votes Garcia cites seem to have been cherry-picked from Green’s long career in Congress. While Green has voted against child safety locks, as Garcia said, he also later voted for them. In recent years, Green has inched away from NRA interests, supporting bipartisan gun legislation and President Obama’s executive action on gun safety. Garcia’s claim on Green’s "lifetime rating" also misses Green’s 1994 sharp drop in favor with the NRA and his recent slight shift away from the organization. As for the NRA’s "favorite Democrat," Green is not the only Democrat to support gun rights, or to be supported by the NRA. He’s not even the organization’s strongest Democratic supporter, based on its most recent ratings. He is part of a shrinking group of pro-gun Democrats. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-00974	"A married couple that" use the same last name "is rarer and rarer in our country."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/13/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-says-its-rarer-and-rarer-married-cou/	On Feb. 2, 2015, Rush Limbaugh was giving some love to the presidential prospects of Scott Walker, declaring on his nationally syndicated radio show that Wisconsin's Republican governor had "drawn the blueprints for beating the left." Then, changing topics, the conservative commentator made a remark about -- if not love, at least marriage -- that caught our ear. And here we are bumping up against Valentine's Day. Limbaugh mentioned a pair of Washington, D.C. political consultants: Mercedes Viana Schlapp and her husband, Matthew Schlapp. Both served in President George W. Bush's administration. "A married couple that go by the same name, which is rarer and rarer in our country," Limbaugh said parenthetically. Is it? Research overview Limbaugh didn't refer to any time frame. And his spokeswoman did not provide us any information to back his claim. But we did find some limited data on the topic -- though not much of it national. In a nutshell: Very few married women kept their own surnames during the 1970s. The percentage rose in the '80s and in the '90s, but leveled off by the early 2000s. Research in detail Let's start by noting that, as best we know, the vast majority of American-born married women in the United States take their husband's last name. A 2007 U.S. Census Bureau research paper, based on the bureau's American Community Survey in 2004, found that only 6 percent of married women who were born in the U.S. had surnames that were "non-conventional." That includes hyphenated surnames, two surnames and women who kept their own surname at marriage. In other words, some 94 percent took their husband's last name after saying "I do." So, that's a solid, if dated, national snapshot. Unfortunately, the paper did not state whether the 6 percent was higher or lower than in previous years. And the census researcher who co-authored the paper told us she is not aware of any similar research done more recently. As for looking at changes over time, there are two major research efforts -- although, unlike the census paper, neither was national in scope. A 2004 study by a Harvard economics professor was based on New York Times wedding announcements, Harvard alumni records and Massachusetts birth records; it focused on college graduates. The percentage of women keeping their names after marriage was 2 to 4 percent around 1975 and just below 20 percent in 2001. Similar results were found in a 2009 study led by researchers from City University of New York and Ramapo College of New Jersey. That work was based on a sampling of wedding announcements in the New York Times from 1971 through 2005. The percentages of brides keeping their own name rose from 1 percent in the 1970s to 9 percent in the 1980s and to 23 percent in the 1990s. The rate leveled off at 18 percent in the 2000s. So, both major studies -- though limited geographically and in other ways -- found that in the 1980s and 1990s, an increasing percentage of married women kept their surnames. But by the early 2000s, that percentage leveled off. Time to wrap a bow around this one. Our rating Without stating a timeframe, Limbaugh said a "married couple that" use the same last name "is rarer and rarer in our country." There is some evidence to back his claim. Two academic studies, though limited in scope, found that compared to the 1970s, the percentage of married women who kept their own names rose in the 1980s and the '90s. But it leveled off in the early 2000s. But as best we can tell, married couples who share the same last name is not rare at all. The latest U.S. census figures on the topic show that as of 2004, some 94 percent of married, American-born women in the U.S. were using their husband's last name. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-07952	"The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed."	true	/florida/statements/2011/jan/25/dean-cannon/whats-killing-inmates-floridas-death-row/	House Speaker Dean Cannon thinks the Florida court system overstepped its authority last year when it removed three Constitutional amendment questions from the statewide ballot. So, in 2011, he's talking about "comprehensive court reform." Addressing a group of nearly 50 reporters and editors at the annual pre-session meeting organized by the Associated Press, Cannon again made his case that the court system should not have removed constitutional amendments that, if approved by voters, would have granted tax breaks for first-time home buyers and affected state redistricting. A third amendment was drafted in response to the new federal health care law to prohibit Florida from participating in any health insurance exchange that compels people to buy insurance. All three amendments were stripped from the ballot after judges ruled that the attached ballot language was either flawed or misleading. Cannon said he will propose legislative changes to effectively remove or diminish judicial review of ballot questions. But that's not all. "Florida's judicial system has the authority to take away not only a person's liberty, but also a person's life. Understanding the severity and irreversible nature of that penalty, we have a responsibility to ensure that justice is administered not only fairly, but also efficiently," Cannon said. "Criminal cases are complex in nature and in recent years we've seen cases overturned, and there have been errors. The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed. Significant and unreasonable delays plague the current process of conducting state post-conviction review in these cases and it appears that there is little the Supreme Court can do to improve or streamline the process." Cannon said that is where the Legislature can step in. "I believe the Legislature can and should work with the judicial branch to significantly improve the administration of justice in death penalty cases," he said. "I am hopeful that reform could lead to a more equitable judicial system for all Floridians, and as we move forward toward the 2011 legislative session, we will continue to explore this issue to determine when and what the right course of action for Florida may be." Cannon hasn't specified what court reform legislation might look like, though by his comments it sure sounds like he wants the appeals process in death row cases hastened. In that vein, we decided to check his facts about Florida's death row, focusing on this claim: "The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed." Of the 392 people now on Florida's death row, House records indicate that 145 inmates have been there for 20 years or longer and 34 have been there for 30 years or more, according to Cannon spokeswoman Katie Betta. Gary Alvord has been on Florida's death row since April 1974, according to the Florida Department of Corrections. Alvord escaped a Michigan mental hospital and wound up in Tampa, where he killed three women. Alvord, who turned 64 on Jan. 10, 2011, has been on death row for more than 13,400 days. This April, he will have been awaiting execution for 37 years. John Vining, who was sentenced to death in 1990, is the oldest person on death row. On March 13, 2011, he will turn 80. Vining was convicted of shooting and killing a woman who was trying to sell him a $60,000 diamond. Since Florida reinstated the death penalty in 1976 (and began carrying out sentences in 1979), 69 people have been executed -- a rate of a little over two per year. One reason, for starters, is a lengthy and costly appeals process. But politics plays a role as well. The governor must sign a death warrant for an execution to proceed. And sometimes other complicating factors are cited. Alvord, for instance, has a long history of mental illness and has been declared mentally incompetent by several courts. The last person to be executed in Florida was Martin Grossman in February 2010. Grossman was convicted of shooting a Pinellas County wildlife officer who happened upon Grossman shooting a stolen handgun in a wooded area. Gov. Charlie Crist signed the death warrant of David Eugene Johnston in 2010 as well, but Johnston died while awaiting his sentence. He was convicted of stabbing an 84-year-old Orlando woman to death in 1983. That transitions naturally to Cannon's claim. The Florida Department of Corrections provided PolitiFact Florida with a list of 55 inmates who died on death row starting Jan. 1, 2000. Thirty of the 55 somehow died while awaiting their sentence (the state does not describe the nature of a person's death), and 25 were executed. For example, Eddie Lee Sexton Sr. died on Dec. 29, 2010, while living on death row. Sexton was convicted of murder after a jury found that he ordered his mentally impaired son to strangle Sexton's son-in-law at a Florida park. Sexton feared that the son-in-law was going to report family abuses to local authorities, prosecutors said. Sexton was sentenced to death in 1998. Robert Power died on Dec. 3, 2010, while awaiting sentence for the rape and murder of a 12-year-old Orange County girl. Power had been on death row for 20 years. The waiting and appeals process certainly comes with additional cost. The Death Penalty Information Center, a Washington policy group that does not advocate for or against the death penalty, published a 2009 report discussing the cost of enforcing the death penalty. The group cited a 2000 Palm Beach Post analysis, which said that the state spends $51 million a year enforcing the death penalty. That's $51 million a year more than it would cost to punish all first-degree murderers with life in prison instead. The figure has been repeated by several other news publications as well as Rex Dimmig, chief assistant public defender of the 10th Judicial Circuit, in testimony before a state Senate committee discussing the death penalty. Make no mistake, the death penalty is a controversial and complex policy issue. But here, we're focusing on Cannon's call for reforms based on death row inmate data. He said: "The number of inmates since 2000 on death row dying of natural causes has now surpassed the number of inmates executed." He's right. Of the 55 death row inmates to die since Jan. 1, 2000, only 25 actually were executed. We rate this statement True.	None	Dean Cannon	None	None	None	2011-01-25T09:21:14	2011-01-19	['None']

pomt-05391	"We will not ask for a tax increase to run city government."	mostly true	/tennessee/statements/2012/may/06/c-wharton/memphis-mayor-c-wharton-says-tax-increase-not-city/	"It’s all about the schools," Memphis Mayor A C Wharton said the day before his administration made its first budget proposal to the City Council since Memphians, in another Wharton landslide, elected him to what is technically his first full four-year term as the city’s CEO. Wharton said that while Memphians would be paying more in property taxes than they did for the 2011-12 fiscal year, it was because of the court-mandated funding of Memphis City Schools. He was asking for the City Council to set a total tax rate of $3.66 per $100 of assessed value, up from the current $3.19. In practical terms, that means taxes on a $150,000 home would jump to $1,372.09 annually, up $176.25 from the current $1,195.84. And yet, while Wharton freely acknowledges he’s asking for a tax increase, he claims core city government services would be funded with the same amount of property tax revenues in FY 2013 as they were in FY 2012. "It's all about the schools," Wharton said. "We will not ask for a tax increase to run city government. The budget I present will be clear. We'll operate city government on the same amount we used last year." Wharton explains the apparent contradiction -- taxpayers paying more taxes but funding the same amount of government -- by pointing to the $65 million the city is required to give to MCS for one final year. The city’s schools are being transferred to Shelby County after the 2012-13 school year, at which point the city’s court-ordered obligation to help MCS with its nearly $900 million budget will end.* Wharton and his finance director, Roland McElrath, agreed to an interview to defend the mayor’s claims. For the 2012 budget year, when the property tax rate was $3.19 per $100 of assessed value, the city allocated only 18 cents for the schools -- the remaining $3.01 was for the general fund that finances government. The city cobbled together the remainder of the approximately $74.2 million needed for its portion of school funding in other ways. For one example, the city generated $20 million through a refinancing of its debt service. But for the 2013 budget year, Wharton wants a straightforward payment to schools to flow directly out of property taxes -- and since each penny of the tax rate generates $1 million in revenue, the city claims it is simply adding 0.47 to the 0.18 that was allocated for schools last year to get to 0.65. Add that 0.65 to the 3.01 and you get the 3.66 property tax rate Wharton proposes. Another way to think of it: Wharton is saying that the first 301 pennies on the tax rate for FY 2013 will go to fund city government with the remainder going to schools, just like the first 301 pennies on the tax rate for 2012 were allocated to fund city government with the remainder going to schools. It’s important to note that the city draws revenues from many areas, including various other taxes and fees, but property taxes are by far the city’s single-largest source of revenues, representing around half the city’s budget. Jim Strickland, the budget chairman for the City Council, is among those asking Wharton to find ways to cut government services to lessen the impact on taxpayers. Strickland believes the mayor should do more to lower taxes, saying "this is the third tax increase he’s asked for" since winning a special election in 2009 to finish out the final 27 months of Willie Herenton’s fifth term. But he said Wharton’s framing of the issue is technically accurate, even if it essentially allows him to shift blame for the spike in taxes: "In that direct quote, I’m pretty sure he’s right." McElrath and Wharton did acknowledge this -- their budget proposal calls for $22 million more in spending on those core non-schools government services. The budget proposal for FY 2013 calls for $628 million in spending on non-schools government services; current projections for FY 2012 show $606 million in spending on non-schools government services. That reflects increases in spending in public safety, especially in the police division where the administration has every incentive to back police director Toney Armstrong in his second full year as chief. But Wharton said the budget also recommends serious cuts -- for instance, closing some libraries and a golf course and scaling back hours at some community centers and city pools. Wharton had the finance department send documents showing how spending trends in city government are all related to more money for public safety but less for everything else. To Strickland, Wharton is masking his decision to increase spending and avoid some difficult cuts by telling taxpayers that 65 cents of the tax rate is going directly to schools. "The point is, it doesn’t matter what you are asking for, it’s hitting the taxpayer in the same way," Strickland said. (EDITOR'S NOTE: UPDATE: The original version of this story included a claim from Strickland that Wharton’s proposed tax rate would be the "highest we’ve ever had." We removed that quote because the administration’s budget shows that the overall tax rate for FY 1980 for Memphis was, in fact, 3.74 -- higher than Wharton's proposed 3.66 this year.) Our ruling Memphis’s mayor says that a property tax increase is not in fact a tax increase to fund core government services. Rather, it’s a one-time assessment to cover the city’s final year of court-ordered funding obligations for the city’s dissolving school system. Wharton’s finance team was able to create a budget allocating the various revenues so that the amount of the property-tax rate going to fund general government services is the same for 2013 as it was in 2012. But because the budget shows overall government spending increasing by $22 million -- about 3.6 percent -- that bit of needed clarification means the Truth-O-Meter dial points to Mostly True. ------------- *In 2011, MCS and the City Council voted to surrender the system’s charter, and voters concurred in a referendum asking to transfer control of Memphis public schools to Shelby County.

pomt-06201	Our "kids can’t openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school."	false	/texas/statements/2011/dec/09/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-kids-cant-openly-celebrate-christm/	Saying President Barack Obama is waging war on religion, Texas Gov. Rick Perry adds in a TV ad his presidential campaign is airing in Iowa: "I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm a Christian, but you don't need to be in the pew every Sunday to know there's something wrong in this country when gays can serve openly in the military, but our kids can't openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school." It’s widely known that Obama last year signed into law legislation permitting gay people to openly serve in the military. We wondered if kids can’t openly celebrate Christmas or pray in school. Based on checking the schoolhouse scene in Iowa and Texas and consulting an array of national experts, it’s clear that school officials are not permitted to organize prayers or focus on a single religion in connection with Christmas, but kids may pray and also celebrate the holiday on their own. We started with the Hawkeye State, where voters caucus for president on Jan. 3. Iowa schoolchildren may both pray and openly celebrate Christmas, according to Carol Greta, general counsel of the Iowa Department of Education. In an interview, Greta said Iowa school children have never been prohibited from praying at school. "As one wag said, as long as there’s been algebra, there’s been prayer in schools," Greta said. But, she said, school employees may not coerce students into praying in keeping with the First Amendment, which bars Congress from making any law "respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech." In a landmark 1962 decision, the U.S. Supreme Court held that school-initiated prayer in the public schools violated the First Amendment. A year later, the court said students could not be made to read a Bible passage before class because the practice constituted government endorsement of a particular religion. As for openly celebrating Christmas, Greta pointed us to a 2009 checklist of do’s and don’t’s for "holiday celebrations" posted by the education department for Iowa schools. The guidance opens: "Public school officials need to be especially conscious at this time of year that the birth of the Christian savior is not recognized or celebrated by all students and families." Prohibited activities, the checklist says, include displays of religious symbols such as a crèche, an angel, a menorah or a banner with a religious message as well as a display of a Christmas tree bearing only Christian religious symbols, though the checklist says a Christmas tree itself is not prohibited. Also barred are school-wide prayer or Scripture readings, the guidance says, and musical concerts with exclusively religious music. Schools are advised against holding a "Christmas party" in the classroom, the department says, though a "holiday" or "end of semester" or end-of-year party is permitted. The checklist says non-religious aspects of Christmas -- such as pictures of reindeer, bells and other non-religious symbols and sleigh rides -- are permitted. Caroling also is fine though songs that "celebrate the birth of the Christ are more problematic," the checklist says: "In an end-of-the-year music program open to the public, religious songs may be included as selections, as long as they are selected for their musicality and are not limited to Christian-themed songs." The checklist closes: "The holidays are a time for exercising goodwill toward all. It is not a time for Scrooges or Grinches. Go forth and be merry with due consideration for all." And what’s the Texas situation? Texas law provides an opportunity for students pray, if they choose, every school day, we learned from DeEtta Culbertson, spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency. The law states that each school board shall provide a minute of silence at each school during which "each student may, as the student chooses, reflect, pray, meditate or engage in any other silent activity that is not likely to interfere with or distract another student." Also, a 1995 Texas law states: "A public school student has an absolute right to individually, voluntarily, and silently pray or meditate in school in a manner that does not disrupt the instructional or other activities of the school. And a 2007 law requires each district to adopt a policy enabling student speakers at school events to voluntarily express a religious viewpoint with the policy stating that the student's speech "does not reflect the endorsement, sponsorship, position, or expression of the district." The latter law came about after the Supreme Court agreed with lower courts that a Texas school district could not permit student prayers delivered before football games because the speeches were at a school-sponsored event, using school facilities, and would be taken by most observers as a school endorsement of the student prayers that were likely to be delivered. Culbertson told us each Texas district is left to resolve how its individual schools handle Christmas. In a Nov. 30, 2011, online post, Tim Carroll, president of the Texas School Public Relations Association, advised school officials to read a publication by the Freedom Forum, a foundation that says it champions the First Amendment. The publication, "Religious Holidays in the Public Schools," notes that the Supreme Court has ruled that public schools may not sponsor religious practices but may teach about religion. "While it has made no definitive ruling on religious holidays in the schools," the publication says, "the Supreme Court has let stand a lower federal court decision stating that recognition of holidays may be constitutional if the purpose is to provide secular instruction about religious traditions rather than to promote the particular religion involved." The publication says it would be unrealistic to ban seasonal celebrations including references to Christmas. It continues: "The resolution would seem to lie in devising holiday programs that serve an educational purpose for all students — programs that do not make students feel excluded or identified with a religion not their own. In an interview, researcher David Masci of the Pew Research Center’s Forum on Religion and Public Life told us that children may both pray and celebrate Christmas in school if their actions are self-directed -- not guided by teachers or administrators. Masci said that if Perry said school-directed prayer and Christmas celebrations are restricted, he’d be right. Masci said: "It’s one thing to acknowledge religion. Public institutions can do that. It’s another thing to promote religion." Some say, though, that schools often bow too much to constitutional concerns when it comes to Christmas. By e-mail, Hiram Sasser, director of litigation for the conservative Texas-based Liberty Institute, pointed out a sentence in the Freedom Forum publication that he said demonstrates Perry is on target about Christmas in school. The sentence: "Teachers must be alert to the distinction between teaching about religious holidays, which is permissible, and celebrating religious holidays, which is not." News stories illuminate instances of schools balancing Christmas season events against the constitutional limit on promoting a religion. In a Beaumont-area school this month, student singers replaced lyrics of "The First Noel" with "The first snow fall" and "the Lord has come" in "Joy to the World" with "my shopping's done," the Beaumont Enterprise reported Dec. 7, 2011. The story quotes the students’ teacher saying the kids sang the real carols at a local tree-lighting ceremony. According to a Dec. 1, 2011, news story in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram, the Fort Worth school district’s attorney recently sent a memo to staff stating that students should not be allowed to exchange gifts or "distribute personal holiday messages" during class. The story says the memo cites legal concerns associated with the distribution of personal holiday messages. "For example, if students are allowed to exchange cards or small trinkets, the district would be required to allow a student to distribute a religious message with the gift or card," the memo says, according to the newspaper. "In other words, the school district cannot prohibit the distribution of unsolicited religious material directly to students if it allows other personal messages to be distributed during school activities held during the school day." The paper quoted a district spokesman, Clint Bond, saying that students can, however, exchange gifts and cards before and after school and during lunch. Students can say "merry Christmas" to one another during the school day, Bond was quoted saying. The Fort Worth district’s memo also says Santa Claus is not allowed to visit classes, the newspaper reported, though it says the memo also says that "seasonal decorations are appropriate if they are not religious in nature" and classroom parties are allowed if they "serve an appropriate instructional purpose." On Dec. 2,2011, the district responded to news coverage of the memo by saying the district was not banning Santa Claus or Christmas celebrations from the schools--though Santa visits would be barred while teachers were teaching. Also, the district said, children would be permitted to exchange presents and cards before and after class, in the hallway and at lunch. "Fort Worth ISD loves Santa Claus and continues to support his universal message of generosity and kindness," the district said. Sasser also urged us to consider a 2005 book, "The War on Christmas," by John Gibson, a Fox News host. The book explores decisions by officials in a few school districts to curb religious references to Christmas. After one such move, Gibson writes, a district turned to Charles Haynes of the Freedom Forum’s First Amendment Institute to help draft a policy enabling students to learn about religious issues and Christmas without violating the First Amendment. We called Haynes about Perry’s double-barreled ad claim. "He’s using the language of the culture wars," Haynes speculated. "What he’s trying to do, I’m afraid, is to mislead people into thinking kids can’t pray... What he’s hoping is that people will hear that God and Christmas have been kicked out of schools. That isn’t the case." Asked to elaborate on Perry’s statement, his campaign spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, said by email that court decisions in the ‘60’s "banned prayer in schools." She said too there are endless legal cases involving students, schools and prayer or religious expression--and noted a dispute years ago involving the Plano, Texas, district and a child prevented from passing out candy canes with a religious message. She also pointed us to the transcript of a June 8, 2004, Senate subcommittee hearing that touched on the Supreme Court’s ruling restricting prayers before football games Our ruling So, can kids pray and openly celebrate Christmas in school? Absolutely, we conclude, though public school officials are barred from advancing a religion or making children pray or celebrate solely the Christian aspects of Christmas. The Supreme Court has not held that students can’t pray; Perry’s home state even has laws protecting that right. The highest court also hasn’t held that kids can’t openly celebrate Christmas at school. His statement shakes out as False.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2011-12-09T15:19:03	2011-12-07	['None']
pomt-09913	"If the United States moves ahead by itself (on cap-and-trade)... after 30 or 40 years, we're going to reduce CO2 by less than 1 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/02/chuck-grassley/claims-us-will-only-reduce-carbon-emissions-one-pe/	Shortly after the House of Representatives passed a cap-and-trade bill, some Republicans made this claim about the plan: Lowering carbon emissions in the United States will do little to slow climate change unless other countries do the same. The GOP's position is that putting a cap on carbon dioxide emissions will be too costly for businesses and for consumers, and if the United States is going it alone those costs outweigh the environmental benefit. Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, who has been one of the more vocal skeptics, made this argument on June 28, 2009, on This Week with George Stephanopoulos. "If the United States moves ahead by itself (on cap-and-trade) ... after 30 or 40 years, we're going to reduce CO2 by less than 1 percent," he said. He reiterated his opinion during a conference call with reporters on July 1, 2009, saying, "If the United States would go ahead — because we're supposed to so-called set an example for the rest of the world — and if the rest of the world doesn't go along, then we're turning out to be suckers because we're — we're going to just reduce total CO2 by a spit in the ocean by ourselves." We wondered whether our cap-and-trade plan could be as limited as Grassley maintains — or at least whether Grassley's 1 percent prediction is even close. Before digging into his claim, here's a little background on this complicated issue, one we've already explored in terms of how much it might cost consumers. The bill, authored by Democratic Reps. Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, was approved by the House of Representatives on June 26, and would essentially limit the amount of carbon dioxide companies can emit each year. The cap will become tighter and tighter over time, and ultimately, lawmakers say their plan will reduce carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020, and 83 percent by 2050. Of course, those big reductions apply only to carbon emissions produced in the United States. Cap-and-trade opponents say it's foolhardy for the United States to move forward without some indication that other countries will adopt similar restrictions. But the European Union already has agreed to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020. And in July, members of the Group of Eight are expected to hammer out a deal on global emissions reductions. Of greatest concern remains China, a country that has recently become the world's biggest producer of greenhouse gases. According to the Energy Information Administration, a government-run database of energy statistics, the United States contributed about 5,907 million metric tons in 2006 — or about 20 percent of the world's total. In the same year, China surpassed that amount by about 100 million metric tons, becoming the leading contributor to global warming. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman pointed out exactly this problem in a May 14 op-ed about China's economic development. "China cannot continue along its current path because the planet can’t handle the strain," he wrote. "The scientific consensus on prospects for global warming has become much more pessimistic over the last few years. Indeed, the latest projections from reputable climate scientists border on the apocalyptic. Why? Because the rate at which greenhouse gas emissions are rising is matching or exceeding the worst-case scenarios. And the growth of emissions from China — already the world’s largest producer of carbon dioxide — is one main reason for this new pessimism." The Pew Center on Global Climate Change, an organization that produces analysis on climate issues, had this to say: "Climate change is a global problem and will require nations of the world to work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. It is true that the United States has recently been overtaken by China as the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions, but the United States still contributes 20 percent of global emissions, so what we do is critically important. It is also true that if the United States acts alone, we cannot solve climate change." And Harvard economics professor Martin Feldstein offered some numbers to back up a similar opinion: "Since the U.S. share of global CO2 production is now less than 25 percent (and is projected to decline as China and other developing nations grow), a 15 percent fall in U.S. CO2 output would lower global CO2 output by less than 4 percent," he wrote in a June 1 Washington Post op-ed. "Its impact on global warming would be virtually unnoticeable. The U.S. should wait until there is a global agreement on CO2 that includes China and India before committing to costly reductions in the United States." Less than 4 percent is close to what Grassley said, but we wanted to see some real data. So, we turned to a memo produced by two professors at Duke University's Nicholas Institute for Environmental Policy Solutions who concluded that, "the success of (Waxman-Markey) depends on whether other nations also pursue equivalent reductions." To illustrate their point, professors Tim Profeta and Prasad Kasibhatla plotted three possible scenarios using this handy modeling system (yes, you can play along , too). In the first, most developed countries — including the United States and some European nations — adopt something similar to Waxman-Markey, but developing countries do not; in the second, developing nations reduce emissions as well; and in the third, developing nations delay a reduction in their emissions, but eventually participate. Their work shows that, under the first scenario, there would actually be a steady increase in carbon emissions, while under the other two scenarios — where developed countries pitch in — carbon emissions would decline over time. So, Grassley's prediction is right — sort of, said Profeta. "It's true that if the U.S. acts solo, we will see little impact," he said, adding that he's not sure where Grassley got his "1 percent" prediction. "But that's a very unlikely assumption." We're more likely to see something along the lines of scenario three, he said, where China will adopt cap-and-trade at a later date, when its per capita carbon emissions equal those from developed countries. We posed a similar question to Mark Radka with the United Nations Environment Program via e-mail. "With no one else doing anything other than growing — a lot — and the U.S. singlehandedly reducing emissions along a not so aggressive path you might come up with a number like 1 percent," he wrote. "This would be one of those absurd baseline scenarios that really doesn’t represent a baseline in any other than a theoretical sense." And Alden Meyer with the Union of Concerned Scientists said it's a myth that China's doing nothing, pointing out that the country has embraced renewable technologies and set fuel economy standards that are arguably more stringent than those announced by the Obama administration earlier this year. "You could say it's a drop in the bucket, but that could be said for any country," Meyer added. "The risk of not adopting Waxman-Markey is that we give China the excuse to say, 'Why should we do it if the wealthiest country isn't doing it?'" So where does that leave us? The experts we spoke with all agree that our impact on climate change will be relatively small without the involvement of other countries, particularly China. On this point, Grassley is correct. But, those same experts say it's highly unlikely that we would be the only nation limiting our carbon emissions in the coming decades. In fact, Grassley's statement is misleading in this regard because Europe already has adopted stricter goals than the targets we're considering, and China is taking other steps to reduce carbon production. As for Grassley's prediction that our cap-and-trade bill alone would only reduce climate change emissions by 1 percent, things are still murky. His office did not return calls or e-mails to back up that claim, our experts had never heard the statistic before, nor could we find any studies or documents to support it. The only number we've got comes from an opinion article written by a Harvard economist, who says 4 percent, which is in the Grassley ballpark. But given his lack of documentation and some clear flaws in his assumptions about international involvement, we give Grassley's claim a Half True.

pomt-02122	The incandescent light bulb "has no effect whatever on the planet."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/11/george-will/george-will-incandescent-light-bulb-has-no-effect-/	The kidnapping of over 200 Nigerian schoolgirls has led to an outpouring of concern, outrage and frustration. When a Nigerian attorney penned the Twitter hashtag #BringBackOurGirls, over 2 million people followed suit, including First Lady Michelle Obama, who tweeted a picture of herself holding a hand-lettered sign with the slogan. Conservatives dismissed this as a meaningless gesture toward a crime that demanded a more muscular response. Adding his voice to that view, Fox News political commentator George Will made an unlikely comparison. "Power is the ability to achieve intended effects," Will said on Fox News Sunday. "And this is not intended to have any effect on the real world. It’s a little bit like what environmentalism has become. The incandescent light bulb becomes the enemy. It has no effect whatever on the planet, but it makes people feel good about themselves." We wondered about Will’s claim that the incandescent light bulb "has no effect whatever on the plant." We reached out to Will and did not hear back. Neal Elliott, associate director for research at the American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, called Will’s claim "demonstrably untrue." The American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy includes representatives from utilities, manufacturers and academia. Elliott points to the work of the U.S. Energy Department. Following passage of the 2007 Energy Independence and Security Act, the department has encouraged the use of more efficient alternatives such as compact fluorescent bulbs. "Switching to energy-saving bulbs will reduce the growth of U.S. energy demand and avoid carbon emissions," the department writes on one of its many Web pages on this topic. When it examined the lifetime energy use of different bulbs, from manufacture to end use, the department found that incandescent bulbs required three times more energy. All things being equal, the need for more electrical power translates into burning more fossil fuels, such as natural gas and coal, which leads to higher greenhouse gas emissions. That is certainly an effect on the planet. The government estimates that if every household got rid of incandescent bulbs, it would reduce greenhouse gas emissions equal to getting rid of 800,000 cars. The closest we could find to an argument that might support Will was a group of scientists in Canada who said the switch to compact fluorescent bulbs might not always have a positive effect in every location. Factors such as the source of power -- hydroelectric, coal, natural gas, nuclear, etc. -- and the balance between the need for heating and air conditioning, could change the outcome from province to province. For example, in British Columbia, greenhouse gas emissions might go up, while in Saskatchewan, they would plummet. Nevertheless, in total, they still found that emissions dropped using alternative light bulbs. Electric utility companies across America are spending millions of dollars to promote the use of compact fluorescents on the theory that they will be able to avoid expensive investments in new power plants. California is a leading state in this approach with over half a billion dollars slated to be spent over seven years. The energy savings have fallen short of expectations but the program has produced savings nevertheless. Our ruling Will said incandescent light bulbs have no effect whatsoever on the planet. There is broad consensus that incandescent bulbs are less efficient than alternatives such as compact fluorescent bulbs. And because they are less efficient, they require more energy -- and generate more greenhouse gas emissions. Hence, they clearly have an effect on the planet. Alternative bulbs may not be a panacea, but Will went way too far in saying incandescent light bulbs play no role in how we consume energy resources. We rate Will’s claim False.

pomt-04391	"Sherrod Brown supported President Obama's $453 billion tax increase."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/oct/18/crossroads-gps/crossroads-gps-says-sherrod-brown-backed-obamas-45/	Ohioans need only brief exposure to commercial television to get a sense of the oversized amounts of outside spending on campaign advertising in the state. Outside spending -- money spent by third-party groups not directly tied to a candidate or party -- has been a force in the U.S. Senate race between Sherrod Brown, the incumbent Democrat, and Josh Mandel, Ohio's Republican treasurer. Going into October, more outside money was spent against Brown than on anyone else in Congress, more than $19 million for TV and radio ads. One of the big spenders targeting Brown is the group Crossroads Grassroots Policy Strategies, better known as Crossroads GPS. Co-founded by Karl Rove as a spin-off of the super PAC American Crossroads, it is a political advocacy organization that is not required to disclose its donors. After spending more than $6.7 million against Brown through late September, Crossroads reserved another $4.5 million worth of air time against him, spokesmen for the Brown and Mandel campaigns say. That includes the 30-second TV ad "Vision," which says, "Sherrod Brown supported President Obama's $453 billion tax increase" (and) "higher taxes on manufacturers that could cost Ohio jobs." PolitiFact Ohio looked at the second claim when it was included in an earlier Crossroads ad. The earlier ad said that the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, "adds a new tax on Ohio manufacturers." We rated the statement as Half True because it left out important details about the tax, which is an excise tax only on the sale of medical devices, with arguable jobs impact. We asked Crossroads how it backed up the claim about the $453 billion tax increase. It cited the sources shown in the ad. One is Brown's "yes" vote, on Oct. 11, 2011, to open debate in the Senate advancing S. 1660, Obama's American Jobs Act of 2011. The second source is a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office on the budgetary effects of the jobs bill. The report says one provision, a 5.6 percent surtax on incomes above $1 million, would increase revenues by $453 billion over the 10 years ending in 2021. That's the "$453 billion tax increase" in the ad. But context and additional information are needed to fully understand the claim. The $447 billion jobs bill aimed to jump-start employment and included spending on highways and other infrastructure, aid for states to prevent layoffs of teachers and emergency workers and an extension of jobless benefits. The bill also provided $272 billion in tax relief for individuals and businesses, the CBO said, with tax cuts for businesses that hire new employees. Bloomberg Business News described a cut in payroll taxes, intended to increase take-home pay for 160 million, as its "centerpiece." Economists at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Moody’s Analytics Inc. and JPMorgan Chase & Co. predicted it would give the economy a boost of up to 2 percent. It is additionally worth noting that the measure was not enacted. It did not, in fact, ever reach consideration. Yet the Crossroads GPS ad is silent on those points. Brown's "yes" vote came on a procedural measure to open Senate debate, which did not reach the 60-vote, filibuster-proof threshold required. (Brown indicated support for the jobs bill, but at least one senator who voted with him, Democrat Jim Webb of Virginia, said he was voting to take up the bill but opposed the measure itself.) The claim from Crossroads GPS has an element of truth in its statement. The American Jobs Act of 2011, which Brown did indicate support for, did include a surtax that was expected to yield $453 billion over 10 years. But the claim in the ad leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression. The legislation included much more than just the surtax cited in the ad. Describing the bill solely as a "tax increase," is incomplete and misleading. A review of the legislation by the non-partisan CBO identified $272 billion in tax relief for individuals and businesses, with tax cuts for businesses that hire new employees. The vote that the ad cites was not a vote on passage of the legislation, but rather a procedural vote to open debate. The legislation never became law. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Mostly False.	None	Crossroads GPS	None	None	None	2012-10-18T06:00:00	2012-10-09	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-06857	"[T]his breed (of pit bulls) is most often associated with aggressive behavior."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/03/elaine-boyer/are-pit-bulls-more-aggressive-other-dogs/	DeKalb County commissioners are considering a reversal of an ordinance that has tongues wagging in Georgia’s third highest-populated county. County leaders are thinking about removing pit bulls from its list of banned household pets. Commissioner Elaine Boyer, whose district includes a politically conservative area in north DeKalb, raised some concerns about changing the ordinance. "[T]his breed (of pit bulls) is most often associated with aggressive behavior," Boyer said in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution published July 20. There is no date immediately scheduled to discuss the idea. You don’t have to look far to find some tragic story of a child being horrifically mauled by a pit bull, which is known for its vise-like jaws. There are the frequent media accounts of pit bull dogfighting, which most famously involved former Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick, who pleaded guilty and served prison time for and his role in conspiring in a dogfighting ring. But some counter that this breed of dog is not as vicious as its public portrayal. Many pit bull owners say the dogs are loving animals, which are sometimes trained by owners to be violent. Pit bulls are not the problem, they argue, people are. We wanted to see if Boyer is right. The commissioner, who said she has no position on the proposed ordinance change, explained her initial comments to us via e-mail. "I am an animal lover," she wrote. "Our family owns small breed dogs, and we have personally never had an encounter with a pit bull. But friends and constituents have told me they have had bad experiences with pit bulls... I imagine even the sweetest puppy of any breed could snap at you if taunted or not trained properly." In 2008, a team of University of Pennsylvania researchers completed a study of aggressiveness of 30 breeds of dogs. The researchers collected about 15,000 questionnaires for the year-long study. The researchers asked owners a series of questions concerning how their dogs reacted in various situations to other canines and humans they know as well as strangers. The questions included how does the dog react when a stranger arrives. The results found Chihuahuas and Dachshunds were the most aggressive toward both humans and other dogs. Those breeds, however, are smaller and usually inflict less-severe injuries. The findings were a mixed bag for Pit Bull Terriers. The dogs were among the most aggressive toward other dogs, particularly those they didn’t know. Pit bulls, the researchers found, were not significantly more aggressive than other breeds toward strangers and their owners. "(Pit bulls) tended to be on the high side, but there were lots of breeds that were higher," said James Serpell, one of the researchers. Serpell told us they felt confident with their findings. He acknowledged that some owners may have over reported or under reported how aggressive their dog acted in some scenarios. The results were widely reported by many newspapers. One study of aggression done by a specialist in Australia found the pit bull terrier attacked humans at a higher level than any breed. German Shepherds and crosses were a close second. For nearly 35 years, a Missouri-based group has conducted its own research on canine aggressiveness. The American Temperament Test Society conducts a 10-step exam and has checked out nearly 31,000 dogs, according to its website. The test includes seeing how the dog reacts to strangers,reacts to someone the animal doesn’t know but tries to pet it, how it reacts to loud noises and its response to a stranger who approaches in a menacing fashion. The two types of pit bulls (the American Pit Bull Terrier and American Staffordshire Terrier) they’ve studied have aggression scores that are not as bad as boxers, bulldogs, collies, Great Danes, Greyhounds and Shetland sheepdogs. They are in the same range as the German Shepherd and golden retriever. Labrador retrievers scored better than pit bulls. "On an even playing field, a pit bull is no more dangerous than a collie," said Salliann Comstock, the society’s chief tester and director of operations. Comstock contends pit bulls are trained to be aggressive and argues many people, including some animal shelter workers, mistake other animals for pit bulls. "A small boxer is called a pit bull," she said. There is some skepticism about the society’s exam. One blogger said the test is geared toward bold dogs who are better equipped to face danger. Some discount dog aggressiveness studies altogether, saying the breeds are often misidentified even by owners. The Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control & Prevention once conducted a study of 20 years worth of fatal dog bite data. The study found 66 people died through bite-related incidents involving various types of pit bulls, which was more than any other type of dog. Rottweilers were a distant second, with 39. Rottweilers, though, were involved in 30 fatal dog bites for the last six years of the study while pit bulls were involved in 15 fatal dog bites. The study, however, was from 1979 through 1998. The CDC has not updated that study. CDC spokeswoman Gail Hayes stressed via email that their study does not conclude which dogs are most likely to bite or kill. She also noted that the estimated 4.7 million Americans bitten by dog bites annually result in about 16 fatalities, a ratio of well less than 1 percent. The past studies and research we’ve reviewed shows pit bulls are among the most aggressive dogs. Some breeds, however, have been shown to be more aggressive in each report. However, the widely held perception is that they are dangerous, which was Boyer’s over-arching point. An Associated Press poll done in October found of the dog owners who would support breed bans, 85 percent would outlaw pit bulls. Her statement has merit, but could have used additional context about the breed, which would have put it in a slightly different light. We rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-13299	"These are radical Islamic terrorists, and (Hillary Clinton) won't even mention the word."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/09/donald-trump/trump-clinton-wont-use-term-radical-islamist-terro/	In response to a question by a Muslim woman about anti-Muslim bias during the town hall presidential debate, Donald Trump said that the United States has a problem with "radical Islamic terrorists," citing mass shootings in Orlando and San Bernardino. Trump then said that Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama won’t correctly define the problem. "These are radical islamic terrorists and she won't even mention the word, and nor will President Obama. He won't use the term ‘radical Islamic terrorism,’" Trump said during the Oct. 9 debate at Washington University in St. Louis. "Now, to solve a problem, you have to be able to state what the problem is or at least say the name. She won't say the name and President Obama won't say the name. But the name is there. It's radical Islamic terror." In her response, Clinton used the phrase "violent jihadist terrorists" and said that the United States is not at war with Islam. "And it is a mistake, and it plays into the hands of the terrorists to act as though we are," she said. We’ve looked at Obama’s use of the term before; he doesn’t like to use it. For this fact-check, we will look at how Clinton describes radical Islamic terrorism. Clinton’s words The day after the mass shooting in Orlando, Clinton did a series of interviews in which she said she had no problem using the term "radical Islamism" or "radical jihadist terrorism." But she also said that the phrases were not "magic words" that would halt terrorism. "From my perspective, it matters what we do more than what we say. And you know, it mattered we got bin Laden, not what name we called him," she said on CNN on June 13. "Whether you call it radical jihadism or radical Islamism, I'm happy to say either. I think they mean the same thing." Clinton emphasizes a distinction between a "distorted version of Islam" and the religion itself. "What I won't do, because I think it is dangerous for our efforts to defeat this threat, is to demonize and demagogue and, you know, declare war on an entire religion. That plays right into ISIS' hands," she said. "We can call it radical jihadism, we can call it radical Islamism. But we also want to reach out to the vast majority of American Muslims and Muslims around this country, this world, to help us defeat this threat, which is so evil and has got to be denounced by everyone, regardless of religion." Clinton made similar comments in an interview on NBC Today. "It matters what we do, not what we say. It mattered that we got bin Laden, not the name we called him," she said. "But if he is somehow suggesting I don't call this for what it is, he hasn't been listening. I have clearly said that we face terrorist enemies who use Islam to justify slaughtering innocent people. And, to me, radical jihadism, radical Islamism, I think they mean the same thing. I'm happy to say either, but that's not the point." On MSNBC's Morning Joe she said: "I have clearly said many, many times we face terrorist enemies who use Islam to justify slaughtering innocent people. We have to stop them and we will. We have to defeat radical jihadist terrorism or radical Islamism, whatever you call it -- it’s the same. But we cannot demonize, demagogue and declare war on an entire religion." We sent a spokesman for Trump a copy of Clinton’s remarks about "radical Islamism" and he replied "has she said the term ‘radical Islamic terrorism?’ " In a speech in Cleveland June 13, she stuck to the phrase "radical jihadists." Obama has said he doesn’t use the term because it would actually bolster into the narrative of ISIS and al-Qaida that the West is at war with Islam. "If we fall into the trap of painting all Muslims as a broad brush and imply that we are at war with the entire religion, then we are doing the terrorists' work for them," he said. This echoes what Obama has previously said about ISIS and isn’t all that different from former President George W. Bush’s language following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks and at the onset of the war in Afghanistan. "This great nation of many religions understands, our war is not against Islam, or against faith practiced by the Muslim people. Our war is a war against evil," Bush said in January 2002. Our ruling Trump said of Clinton, "These are radical Islamic terrorists and she won't even mention the word." After the Orlando shooting, Clinton said she had no problem saying "radical Islamism" which is similar but not the same as "radical Islamic terrorism."She has also said that leaders should be careful not to demonize the religion of Islam, and that the United States needs specific strategies to fight ISIS.

pomt-07428	"Over the last 10 years, Georgia's public health has declined."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/apr/25/nathan-deal/governer-says-georgia-health-declining/	Put down that Krispy Kreme, fellow Georgian. And quit smoking. You’re ruining our state’s reputation. Georgians eat all the wrong things. We don’t exercise enough. Our children are plump. It’s only getting worse, Gov. Nathan Deal said in a recent speech to the Georgia Public Health Association. "Over the last 10 years, Georgia's public health has declined," Deal said. This statement made the PolitiFact Georgia team curious. Yes, we’re chubbier than we once were. But are we sliding in other areas? Deal made the claim after the passage of House Bill 214, which would create a new Georgia Department of Public Health. The legislation elevates public health to a Cabinet-level position, which supporters think will give the health of Georgians the attention it needs. To back up the claim, Deal’s office sent us an essay from Atlanta Hospital News and Healthcare Report, an industry trade newspaper. "Ten years ago . . . Georgia ranked 34th in health determinants in the United Health Foundation’s annual ranking of American states," it read. "Today we’re 47th." We looked at the rankings ourselves. United Health Foundation’s America’s Health Rankings is a yearly initiative that has scored states’ overall health since 1990. The ranking is based on a wide range of measures such as the infant mortality rate, the prevalence of smoking, violent crime, the percent of children in poverty and cancer deaths. We found that the figures in the trade newspaper article were slightly off target and don’t reflect the broader picture presented by the rankings. But first, a little about measuring the health of large populations. Assessing the health of communities is an art as well as a science, experts told us. Thousands of pieces of health data are available. Those who use them to publish rankings make judgment calls on what measures to use, what sources to consider, and how to weigh their importance. Those measures aren’t always directly about health. They also can include high school graduation, poverty and crime rates. People who have lower incomes can have stress problems and poor access to health care and healthy food, said Dr. Georges Benjamin, executive director of the American Public Health Association. These all hurt their well-being. "There is a correlation between health and wealth," Benjamin said. Now, back to America’s Health Rankings. In 2010, Georgia’s overall ranking was 36. This was a major improvement from 2009, when the state ranked 43. The survey included rankings in subcategories that included the "health determinants" that the trade industry publication cited. They are circumstances and environmental factors that have a major impact on your health. Another subcategory was health outcomes, a measure based on mortality and other markers that show whether the population is healthy. Georgia’s health determinants rank sank two notches from 35 to 37 between 2001 and 2010. But outcomes improved by five places from 40 to 35. (America’s Health Rankings for 2010 came out after the Atlanta Hospital News and Healthcare Report essay was published. The 2009 data showed the health determinants rank declined from 36 in 2000 to 47, which is slightly different from the figures in the article. Outcomes ticked downward from 40 to 41.) Georgia’s 2010 ranking was unusually good. The state peaked in 1996 at 32, then sank to the low 40s by 2001. It stayed there until last year. Overall, however, America’s Health Rankings showed health in Georgia improved in some areas and declined in others. The rankings’ authors consider obesity and smoking to be the two most important health factors because they cause a host of other problems. Obesity rose in the past decade, but smoking declined. Other measures showed mixed outcomes. There were declines in some health factors such as the percentage of children in poverty, people without health insurance, and adults with high cholesterol. They all increased in the past decade. But other measures showed improvement. Cancer deaths, violent crime, infant mortality and rates of infectious disease all declined. We looked for other sources of information to see if they showed different results. We consulted the Annie E. Casey Foundation’s Kids Count report, a well-regarded state-by-state measure of children’s health, and data from the Georgia Division of Public Health. Between 2002 and 2010, Georgia’s Kids Count ranking mostly hovered in the low to mid-40s out of 50 states. That’s well below average, but not a clear decline. The percentage of low birth weight babies, obese children, and children in poverty increased, but other measures such as teen births, infant mortality and child deaths showed improvements. Georgia Division of Public Health figures paint a mixed picture as well. All sources we consulted found that the health of Georgians improved in some important categories and declined in others. Overall, Georgia’s health hasn’t truly "declined" in the past decade as Deal said. It’s consistently low compared with other states, and during the past 10 years, our record has been mixed. We rate Deal’s claim Half True.	None	Nathan Deal	None	None	None	2011-04-25T06:00:00	2011-04-13	['None']
pomt-02633	In Russia "all people are absolutely equal regardless of their religion, sex, ethnicity, or sexual orientation," while "70 countries of the world have criminal liability for homosexuality."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/19/vladimir-putin/putin-70-countries-being-gay-crime/	Russia has become a lightning rod for controversy heading into the upcoming Winter Olympics in Sochi, and it has nothing to do with figure skating judges. The former communist nation faces threats of terrorism and criticism from the United States for harboring fugitive National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden. And then there is Russia’s crackdown on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals, which has become decidedly more aggressive in the last 12 months. But on Jan. 19, 2014, just weeks before the games begin, Russian President Vladimir Putin sought to quell fears that gay athletes, delegates or fans will be discriminated against. "In Russia, as opposed to one third of the world's countries, there is no criminal liability for homosexuality," Putin said during a lengthy interview with several media outlets, parts of which aired on ABC’s This Week. "Seventy countries of the world have criminal liability for homosexuality, and seven countries out of these 70 enforce death penalty for homosexuality." Putin went on to note that the former Soviet Union "had criminal liability for homosexuality, today's Russia doesn't have such criminal liability. In our country, all people are absolutely equal regardless of their religion, sex, ethnicity, or sexual orientation." We decided to check both Putin’s international figures as well as his assessment of Russia’s position toward the LGBT community. How the LGBT community is treated worldwide Putin’s claim that 70 countries have "criminal liability for homosexuality," is backed up by at least one international report. In May 2013, the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (known as the ILGA) released the eighth edition of its study titled, "State-Sponsored Homophobia: A world survey of laws." The report found 76 nation states where homosexuality is criminalized, representing about 40 percent of United Nations members. Nearly half of those countries, 36, are in Africa, where homosexuality is taboo and prosecuted with executions or prison sentences that can last up to 14 years in many countries. Conversely, 114 countries do not criminalize homosexual relationships. In 14 countries and some parts of Mexico and the United States, same-sex couples can marry. The updated figures would probably bump countries where same-sex relationships are illegal to 77. In December, India’s Supreme Court reversed a previous court decision to end an 153-old ban on homosexual intercourse first instituted by British colonial rule. There are also seven countries where homosexual acts can receive a death sentence: Mauritania, Sudan, Asia Iran, Saudi Arabia, Yemen and 12 northern states in Nigeria and the southern parts of Somalia. In 11 countries, mostly former British and French colonies, the report notes homosexuality receives lengthy prison sentences longer than 14 years. How does Russia compare? Russia is not listed as one of the 76 countries where homosexuality is banned. In fact, according to the ILGA’s profile of Russia on its website, male-to-male and female-to-female relations are not legally discriminated against there. Gays and lesbians can also serve in the military in Russia. In 1993, Russia repealed a Soviet-era law persecuting gay couples. However, while homosexuality is not outright criminal in Russia, there are many elements of de facto criminalization. In June 2013, Putin signed a law banning promotion of "non-traditional sexual relations" toward minors, a prohibition on so-called "homosexual propaganda." The Russian law places stiff fines on individuals and companies that promote homosexualtiy in front of children, whether in public or through media or the Internet. Critics say the law essentially bans homosexuals from speaking out in public. The scope of the law is broad, and it's not clear how it will be enforced. With the Sochi Olympics just around the corner, many Western countries took exception to the law, including President Barack Obama, who said he had "no patience for countries that try to treat gays and lesbians and transgendered persons in ways that intimidate them or are harmful to them." In what was seen as an act of defiance, Obama chose two openly gay athletes to represent the United States at the Olympics: tennis legend Billie Jean King and hockey player Caitlin Cahow. Former Olympic gold medal figure skater Brian Boitano, also tapped by Obama to head to Sochi, has since said he is gay. And just because the ILGA does not include Russia with the 76 countries that legally bar homosexuality, it doesn’t mean the organization is complimentary of the country’s recent direction. "While criminalization is the most blatant form of state-sponsored homophobia," the 2013 report says, "countries which decriminalized homosexuality in the recent past, such as Russia … are sadly seeking to re-legitimize discrimination based on sexual orientation both at the national level, by way of laws against LGBTI activism – preposterously defined as ‘homosexual propaganda’ – and at the international level, in the name of ‘tradition.’" Same-sex relationships are not recognized by Russian law. Same-sex couples also cannot adopt and lesbians cannot undergo artificial insemination to have children. Employers are not banned from discriminating based on sexual orientation. Foreigners with HIV can be barred from entering the country and also can be expelled. Gay pride parades are also banned in the country and have been going back to 2005. However, some pride events did take place without collaboration with authorities, and often sparked violence and attacks on those participating. Our ruling Putin said 70 countries criminalize homosexuality and Russia isn’t one of them. His estimate is pretty close to the 76 highlighted by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association and its true the organization did not include Russia in that number. But Putin also was far too rosy in his depiction of how the country treats gays and lesbians when he said "all people are absolutely equal regardless of their religion, sex, ethnicity, or sexual orientation." Recent actions by Putin and the ruling United Russia party have further restricted the rights of gays and lesbians to peacefully demonstrate. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-05042	Says recent studies indicate that nationally, only 8 percent of white voting-age citizens but 25 percent of African-American voting-age citizens lack government-issued photo IDs.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/jul/11/eric-holder/eric-holder-says-recent-studies-show-25-percent-af/	Addressing the NAACP at its annual convention in Houston, Attorney General Eric Holder stressed his commitment to battling states such as Texas seeking to put in place laws requiring citizens to show a government-approved photo ID before voting at the polls. According to the prepared text of his July 10, 2012, speech, Holder recapped the Justice Department’s decision not to approve the Texas law’s implementation after deciding it would be harmful to minority voters. Separately, the State of Texas, led by its attorney general, Greg Abbott, has sued the government toward winning judicial approval of the law, which the Republican-led Legislature approved in 2011. Holder credited the NAACP with "working to raise awareness about the potential impact of this and other similar laws, and the fact that – according to some recent studies – nationally, only 8 percent of white voting-age citizens, while 25 percent of African-American voting-age citizens, lack a government-issued photo ID. In our efforts to protect voting rights and to prevent voting fraud, we will be vigilant and strong. But let me be clear: We will not allow political pretexts to disenfranchise American citizens of their most precious right." We asked the Justice Department how Holder reached his percentages and didn’t immediately hear back. But the references to 8 percent and 25 percent, respectively, were familiar to us. In a January 2012 fact check, we rated Mostly True a claim by Democratic U.S. Reps. Steny Hoyer of Maryland and John Lewis of Georgia that up to "one in four African Americans do not carry the necessary forms of identification to vote" under the conditions of state photo ID laws. At the time, we noted that the figure originated in a 2006 survey by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s School of Law. The center combines research and legal advocacy on public policy issues such as campaign finance reform and racial balance in criminal law, and it has said that state efforts to require photo IDs from voters at the polls could discourage millions from voting, especially minority and low-income Americans. In an October 2011 report, the center said that in five states where photo ID laws were scheduled to take effect in 2012, some 3.2 million Americans, accounting for about 10 percent of the states’ voting-age residents, lacked government-issued photo IDs. Two of those states -- Texas and South Carolina -- must have their laws cleared by the U.S. Department of Justice because of past failures to protect minority voting rights. The department rejected South Carolina’s law in December 2011 (saying that minority registered voters were more likely than whites to lack state IDs) and declined to bless the Texas law in March 2012. The Texas law would require voters to show a valid government-issued photo ID, such as a Texas driver's license, Department of Public Safety identification card, state concealed handgun license, U.S. military ID or U.S. passport. Back to the nationwide data: The center’s 2006 survey reached by telephone 987 U.S. citizens of voting age, asking them questions including, "Do you have a current, unexpired government-issued ID with your picture on it, like a driver’s license or a military ID?" As voter ID debates heated up in 2011, the conservative Heritage Foundation issued a critique of the survey, noting it was still frequently cited and questioning its decision not to focus on registered or actual voters. The Brennan Center’s response said in part, "While it is true that citizens in those groups are more likely to vote in any given election, they are not the only citizens who have the right to vote." Overall, according to the survey, 11 percent of voting-age Americans did not have current government-issued photo ID. Among African Americans, 25 percent did not have such ID, compared to 8 percent of whites. Not enough Hispanics were surveyed to reach reliable conclusions about that subgroup, the center said. In a December 2011 report, the NAACP mentioned the 25-percent figure from the 2006 survey, going on to say that factors in individuals not having IDs may include the cost of getting a photo ID (because minorities are over-represented in the poor population) or a lack of the documents needed to apply for the photo ID, such as birth certificates (not issued to many African Americans born before the Civil Rights Act passed), which also can cost money to obtain. When we looked into the Democrats’ claim, we found no other national surveys by race of which U.S. citizens eligible to vote have government-issued photo IDs. Two national surveys taken in 2008, however, checked on registered voters. Before the 2008 presidential election, researchers from the University of Washington and other schools carried out a national telephone survey of 4,563 registered voters. In the survey, 10 percent of blacks, 11 percent of Hispanics and 5 percent of whites said they did not have a valid driver's license or an ID issued by their home state. Another survey, reaching 10,000 registered voters via phone and Internet after the 2008 election, included questions about driver’s license ownership by race. In an Aug. 30, 2011, blog post, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Charles Stewart III said responses showed that 19 percent of black respondents and 3 percent of whites did not have a driver’s license. In his blog post, Stewart did not break out results for Hispanic respondents. Among half a dozen other studies, ranging in scope from three counties to three states, several struck us as having limited applicability: The NAACP report said a 2008 Pew Center study in Georgia showed 30 percent of African Americans said they voted absentee because they lacked a photo ID. However, this statistic reflects the responses of only 30 voters in three counties, and the Pew report warns against using it to draw conclusions. A 2005 Department of Justice summary of state data said that among registered voters who applied for Georgia driver’s licenses or state ID cards, African Americans had state ID at a "slightly higher" percentage than whites. A 2011 Associated Press analysis of South Carolina data showed the state’s photo ID law would fall harder on black populations in some areas and on whites in other areas. Two other surveys asked questions closest to matching the statement by Holder. A 2007 survey of Indiana’s voting-age citizens found 26.6 percent of blacks and 13.6 percent of whites did not have a "current" government-issued or state university-issued photo ID. A 2008 survey of registered voters in Indiana, Mississippi and Maryland found 3.8 percent of blacks and 0.9 percent of whites did not have government-issued photo IDs. Our ruling Holder’s figures appear to trace to a single national survey taken about six years ago though, far as we can tell, mostly unchallenged since. Other collections of data do not touch on exactly the same points, but most indicate that African Americans are less likely than whites to hold varied kinds of government-issued IDs, with percentages of blacks without such IDs ranging from nearly 4 percent to more than 26 percent and percentages of whites having such an ID ranging from 1 percent to nearly 14 percent. We rate Holder’s claim as Mostly True.	None	Eric Holder	None	None	None	2012-07-11T10:22:54	2012-07-10	['None']
pomt-04723	"When Tim Kaine was governor, spending soared, blowing holes in the budget every year."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2012/aug/31/crossroads-gps/crossroads-says-state-spending-increased-under-tim/	Crossroads GPS, a conservative advocacy group, has been airing a TV ad accusing Democrat U.S. Senate candidate Tim Kaine of being a big spender. "When Tim Kaine was governor, spending soared, blowing holes in the budget every year," the commercial begins. There’s a grainy picture of of the former governor on the screen with the words, "Tim Kaine’s Record: Spending Up $5 Billion." The ad cuts against the image Kaine claims as a taskmaster who slashed spending when he was governor from 2006 to 2010 to balance the state budget during the Great Recession. Kaine has often compared his fiscal record to that of his opponent, Republican George Allen, whom he criticizes for casting votes in the U.S. Senate that expanded the nation’s debt. Fact-checking Crossroads’ statement requires us to make two determinations: 1) Did spending soar under Kaine and, if so; 2) Did increased spending create holes, or revenue shortfalls, in the budget each year of Kaine’s administration? Did spending soar under Kaine? Nate Hudson, a spokesman for Crossroads, said the super PAC got its $5 billion figure from the 2009 Comprehensive Annual Report conducted by the Virginia Department of Accounts. Hudson pointed to a table that shows "general government expenditures" were $25.3 billion when Kaine took office midway through the fiscal year that started July 1, 2005. The chart shows spending rose to $30.4 billion during the budget year that began July 1, 2008. The total increase in spending during those three years comes to $5.1 billion. But the DOA report is not a good source for computing state spending, according to Secretary of Finance Ric Brown. It is an audit of most -- but not all -- government revenues and expenditures. So we turned to the actual budgets under Kaine. When Kaine became governor, the total state budget was $32 billion. It rose to $37.1 billion in during fiscal 2008-09, the last year Crossroads counted. Under this measure, total spending increased by $5.1 billion -- the same figure in the auditing report. This, however, is a conservative tally. Crossroads does not count the final $37.9 billion budget that was approved while Kaine was in office and went into effect on July 1, 2009. When we include it, the total increase in spending comes to $5.9 billion. That’s an 18.4 percent rise in raw- dollar outlays over four years; 9 percent when adjusted for inflation. Total spending during the terms of the six governors before Kaine rose by an average of 32.1 percent in raw dollars; 16.1 percent when adjusted for inflation. As we’ve noted before, judging governors by overall spending may be unfair. That’s because more than half of the state’s outlays over the last three decades have come from the non-general fund, over which governors have little or no control. Roughly two-thirds of the fund consists of earmarked federal grants, tuition payments set and received by state colleges and medical fees set and received by state hospitals. The rest comes from a variety of taxes earmarked for transportation, the sale and rent of state properties, interest on accounts, unemployment compensation taxes paid by employers and payments from a 1998 legal settlement with tobacco companies. A cleaner measure of a governor’s fiscal record comes from examining the general fund, which supports public education, health and public safety. It’s mostly supported by state income and sales taxes over which a governor has strong influence. Kaine, in promoting his record as a budget slicer, refers to cuts he made to the general fund. We recently rated as True his claim that the general fund shrank during his governorship; it stood at $15.1 billion at the start of his administration and dropped to $14.8 billion at the end. That’s a 2 percent decrease. Under the six governors before Kaine, the general fund grew by an average 33.8 percent. Kaine’s success in cutting the general fund, however, relied in part on the growth of the non-general revenues. Towards the end of his administration, the non-general fund was boosted by $2.4 billion in federal stimulus money to help Virginia get through the recession. About $1.5 billion of it was used to support general fund programs. In addition, state general fund support for higher education was $80 million a year less at the end of Kaine’s term than it was at the beginning. State colleges and universities more than made up the difference with tuition and fee hikes totaling $474 million, which accrued to the non-general fund. There are two key points to keep in mind in considering Crossroads’ statement that spending soared under Kaine: 1) All of the increase took place in the non-general fund over which governors have little or no control, and; 2) The increase in total state spending during Kaine’s term was roughly half the average of the six governors who preceded him. Did the spending increase cause budget shortfalls? Kaine, as we’ve noted, became governor in January 2006, midway through a fiscal year. The budget he inherited closed out with a $1.6 billion surplus on June 30, 2006. Trouble began the next year, as Virginia and the nation began to slide into a deep recession that ran from December 2007 to June 2009. Revenues from income and sales taxes began to dip, creating general fund shortfalls in each of the four final budgets during Kaine’s term. Again, all of the shortfalls occurred in the general fund budget -- which the governor and the General Assembly fully control. In fiscal 2007, state revenues began falling off. That year, revenues fell short by $300 million. In fiscal 2008, there was as $641 million shortfall. The next year, Kaine and the General Assembly faced a $1.8 billion revenue gap, followed by a $4.5 billion shortage at the end of Kaine’s term in early 2010. The cumulative total of the shortfalls over the final four budgets was about $7.2 billion. Kaine and the General Assembly -- constitutionally required to keep the state budget balanced -- took many steps to close the gap. They cut funding to education, health and public safety programs. They withdrew about $900 million from the state’s emergency reserve fund, transferred funds through complicated bookkeeping maneuvers and -- as we said before -- used $1.5 billion of federal stimulus money to help support general fund services. Virginia was hardly the only state in distress during the recession and its aftermath. Data from the National Association of State Budget Officers shows 13 states faced shortfalls in 2008, 43 in 2009 and 39 in 2010. But here’s where Crossroads’ ad claim unravels: There’s no connection between the overall rise in the state budget under Kaine and the revenue shortfalls he faced. All of the increase in spending occurred in the non-general fund, over which governors have little or no control. As we mentioned, money in this fund mostly comes from federal grants, college tuition payments, state hospital fees and several Virginia taxes dedicated to transportation. On the flip side, all of the shortfalls occurred in a different portion of the budget supported by a separate set on revenues. The problems were in the general fund, which is largely supported by by state income and sales taxes which pay for schools, public safety and health programs. Our ruling Crossroads said, "When Tim Kaine was governor, spending soared, blowing holes in the budget every year." Let’s sum up our two-part test for fact-checking this claim: 1. Did spending soar under Kaine? The total state budget went up by $5.9 billion during Kaine’s term, representing an 18.4 percent increase increase in raw dollars and 9 percent rise adjusted for inflation. Kaine had little control over the growth, which was largely the result of increases in federal grants, college tuition and fees charged by state hospitals. Overall spending did increase under Kaine; whether it "soared" is a matter of opinion. The total budget under Kaine increased at half the average rate of the six governors who preceded him. 2. Did spending growth cause the shortfalls? The answer is no. All of the budget growth occurred in the non-general fund and were largely the result of actions by the federal government and state universities. All of the shortfalls occurred in the general fund that depends on a separate set of revenues to pay for public education, public safety and health programs. Lower-than-expected receipts from Virginia’s sales and income taxes blew holes in the general fund -- a blight that afflicted all but a few states at the end of the recession. Virginia’s general fund decreased during Kaine’s term. So there is an element of truth in the first part of the statement. But Crossroads fails to establish a critical link between the spending increase and the revenue deficits. As a result, the claim is misleading and we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-04642	"The president promised that if he spent money on a stimulus program that unemployment would go to 5.7 percent or 6 percent. Those were his words."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/13/jon-bramnick/jon-bramnick-claims-barack-obama-promised-stimulus/	While critiquing the president on his leadership of the economy, a state assemblyman reprised a popular -- and misleading -- Republican talking point. Assembly Minority Leader Jon Bramnick said President Barack Obama has failed to deliver on a vow to push down the nation’s jobless rate, fueling discontent among the unemployed. "I think the American public, those who are unemployed, are somewhat angry. The president promised that if he spent money on a stimulus program that unemployment would go to 5.7 percent or 6 percent. Those were his words," Bramnick said in a Sept. 7 interview on NJToday. "We've been stuck at 8 percent unemployment." PolitiFact and its partner sites have checked various iterations of this claim, each time rating it Mostly False. Most recently, PolitiFact Ohio gave Republican U.S. Rep. Bob Latta a Mostly False for saying that Obama promised that with the stimulus plan, "unemployment would never go above 8 percent. He even said it would be 6 percent by now." While such claims have an element of truth -- top economic advisers in the incoming Obama administration released a report projecting that if the stimulus plan passed the unemployment rate would peak around 8 percent before dropping to less than 6 percent by now -- we found no evidence the president or his administration ever made a promise. Bramnick owned up to that part, saying, "I'm guilty of using a word that may not have been his word." But, he said, "I’m very comfortable with my statement. Though you’re right it wasn’t a promise, it was material he used for Congress and others to rely on passing the stimulus program." Bramnick, like other Republicans, cited as support for his statement a Jan. 9, 2009 report from Christina Romer, the incoming chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, who would serve as the vice president's top economic adviser. The report -- released more than a month before the stimulus bill, officially called the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, was signed into law -- estimated the impact of Obama’s plan on job creation. Without the stimulus plan, the unemployment rate was estimated to top off around 9 percent in 2010 before dropping off to roughly 6 percent by now. But with the stimulus plan, the report projected the nation’s jobless rate would peak near 8 percent in 2009 before falling to about 5.5 percent by now. What we know now is that even with the stimulus plan the unemployment rate topped off at 10 percent in October 2009. It has since dropped, hitting 8.1 percent last month. So the estimates in the report were wrong. But they were projections, not a guarantee as Republicans suggest. And the projections were made with plenty of disclaimers. In the beginning of the report, the authors write, "It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error," noting that there is "fundamental uncertainty" with estimating the effects of any program and "the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." Our ruling Bramnick said "the president promised that if he spent money on a stimulus program that unemployment would go to 5.7 percent or 6 percent. Those were his words." We found no evidence the president or his advisers ever made a public pledge that the stimulus would drive the unemployment rate down to the figures Bramnick cites. Two economic advisers estimated in a 2009 report that with the stimulus plan, the unemployment rate would peak near 8 percent before dropping to less than 6 percent by now. But those projections came with heavy disclaimers, with the authors emphasizing the considerable uncertainty of their estimates. Those are critical details Bramnick’s statement ignores. We rate this statement Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Jon Bramnick	None	None	None	2012-09-13T07:30:00	2012-09-07	['None']

pomt-12131	"When Rick Baker heard (racist remarks from another mayoral candidate), he went after Congemi. Rick Kriseman he just looked away. Tolerating bigotry in silence is no virtue; taking it on is."	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/aug/15/seamless-florida/seamless-florida-ad-dramatizes-mayor-rick-kriseman/	A TV ad in St. Petersburg’s contested mayoral election claims Rick Kriseman "looked away" when a fringe mayoral candidate made a racist statement, but the ad misleads about the specifics of the incident and ignores what transpired later. The ad paid for by a political action committee aligned with former Mayor Rick Baker, Seamless Florida, aims to contrast the "virtue" of Baker with that of Kriseman, comparing each man’s response to a racial tirade from longshot candidate Paul Congemi. Congemi told black activists at a July 18 candidate forum to "go back to Africa," spurring widespread condemnation and negative national headlines. "When Rick Baker heard that, he went after Congemi," the narrator in the ad says. "Rick Kriseman, he just looked away. Tolerating bigotry in silence is no virtue; taking it on is." The ad discusses an event that actually happened but distorts reality. We’ll explain why. Here’s what happened at the forum On July 18, six mayoral candidates gathered in the City Council chambers to participate in a mayoral forum moderated by St. Petersburg’s League of Women Voters. The forum had a unique format that didn’t allow for debate. Some questions were addressed to all six candidates, and other questions were only addressed to half of the panel. If a question was only addressed to half of the panel, then a candidate who was not asked could wave a "wildcard" to signal that he or she wanted to answer the question. Candidates were given three wildcards and were told that there would be no opportunities for rebuttals. For the first 30 minutes, the forum went on without a hitch. That changed when Congemi used his wildcard to respond to a question about how to provide recreational activities for youth in the city. The question was only addressed to Theresa "Momma Tee" Lassiter, Kriseman, and Jesse Nevel, national chairman of the Uhuru Solidarity Movement, which helps organizes white support for black-led community social justice. "Mr. Nevel, you and your people, you talk about reparations," Congemi said. "The reparations that you talk about, Mr. Nevel, your people already got your reparations. Your reparations came in the form of a man named Barack Obama." Amid boos from the crowd, Congemi added: "My advice to you, my advice to you, if you don’t like it here in America, planes leave every hour. Go back to Africa, go back to Africa." Kriseman was seated next to Congemi. As Congemi talked about reparations, Kriseman can be seen with sealed lips, looking around. Another angle shows Kriseman glancing at the crowd and then looking at Congemi during parts of his outburst. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com After Congemi’s remarks the crowd continued to bellow in opposition and Nevel called Congemi a "nonfactor", but it settled after candidate Anthony Cates III, who is African-American, used his wildcard. He did not address what Congemi said, talking instead about a charity he worked with that helped students. After Cates spoke, the moderator asked all six candidates how they would approach the homeless population. Kriseman was the first to answer, and he didn’t mention Congemi. Kriseman said his administration had invested money to help family homelessness in the community. The question then went to Lassiter and Nevel, who also didn’t mention what Congemi said (though Nevel did dismiss him as a "nonfactor" in the midst of Congemi’s rant). However, when it was Baker’s turn to talk, he called out Congemi. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com "I know we’re not supposed to respond to other things, but I first have to specifically reject the comments Mr. Congemi just made," Baker said. "I just think in 2017 in St. Petersburg, Florida, I never would have dreamed we would've heard comments like that at a mayoral debate." That night, Twitter erupted with video of Congemi’s remarks, and the Washington Post wrote about the situation early the next day. A little past noon on July 19, Kriseman rejected the racist remarks on Twitter, Facebook, and in a television interview. "It is simply unacceptable to spew this kind of bigoted rhetoric," he said. "Free speech should not compromise the dignity and respect of any person or community" He said he didn’t want to bring more attention to the remarks at the time, adding that he regretted not speaking out then and there. "I was reluctant to engage this candidate last night and draw even more attention to his disturbing message," Kriseman wrote on Facebook. "I regret not doing so, though." See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Congemi’s last runs for mayor only garnered a few hundred votes. In 2009, Congemi referred to homosexuality as an "abomination" and spoke out against the St. Pete Pride festival. Kriseman’s campaign said he has a long record of standing up against discrimination and pointed to his record of denouncing President Donald Trump's decision to ban transgender people from serving in the military as well as his proposal during the campaign to ban Muslims. Our ruling A television ad paid for by Rick Baker’s PAC said he condemned racist comments from another candidate while Kriseman "just looked away." Baker did speak up during the mayoral forum. In doing so, he acknowledged that he was going against the organizers’ rules by not sticking to the question at hand and revisiting earlier comments. Kriseman did not comment on what Congemi said that night. Neither did four other candidates at the forum. Kriseman waited until the next day, and was criticized for it. He said he did not want to bring more attention to the message in the moment but regretted not doing so. The admaker misleads viewers by neglecting to include Kriseman's later condemnation of what Congemi said. This ad is partially accurate but omits substantial information about what happened.

pomt-10651	"If you got rid of the income tax today you'd have about as much revenue as we had 10 years ago."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/03/ron-paul/it-would-be-close-to-the-same-revenue/	Ron Paul said in December 2007 that if the government stopped collecting income tax, we would have about the same level of funding that we did 10 years ago. "And the size of government wasn't all that bad 10 years ago," concluded Paul, who advocates limited government. It made us wonder: Do today's tax collections, minus the income tax, really equal the tax collections of 10 years ago? We asked Paul's campaign what numbers he used to arrive at that conclusion, but we didn't hear back. So we dug into IRS statistics ourselves. The most recent detailed data available on income tax collected in the United States is for 2005. Besides income tax, the IRS collects corporate taxes, employment taxes, estate and gift taxes, and excise taxes. After issuing refunds, the IRS collected $880-billion in individual income tax in 2005. Subtract that from total tax collections for 2005 – which equaled close to $2-trillion – and you get $1.12-trillion. By comparison, total tax collections in 1995 were about $1.27-trillion. Those are two big numbers that sound close. But take out the calculator: The difference between the two numbers comes to about 12 percent, and when you're talking about the federal government, that's a chunk of change – about $150-billion. To put that in perspective, it would pay for almost a year and half of the war in Iraq. Adjust for inflation, and the gap widens to a roughly 30 percent shortfall. We'll concede that it's possible Paul could reduce the budget by that much, based on some of the positions he advocates. Paul has said he'd like to slash the defense budget by pulling back all U.S. troops on foreign soil, zeroing out foreign aid and reducing the size of the active military. He also advocates abolishing other federal functions, like the Department of Education. Whether he makes up that 12 percent difference or not will have to wait for a Paul presidency. Meanwhile, we find his statement that ending the income tax would roll back revenues 10 years to be Mostly True.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2008-01-03T00:00:00	2007-12-23	['None']
pomt-04450	Says Travis County Sheriff Greg Hamilton has accepted $42,000 from strip-club interests and $10,000 from local alcohol distributors.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/oct/11/raymond-frank/raymond-frank-says-greg-hamilton-has-accepted-thou/	Travis County’s sheriff took money from tainted interests, his Republican challenger says. In an advertisement in the Oct. 7, 2012, Austin American-Statesman, Raymond Frank, a former Travis County sheriff himself, says Democratic incumbent Greg Hamilton accepted $42,000 from strip-joint interests from 2005 to 2012 and $10,000 from local alcohol distributors from 2007 to 2012. "It gives me no pleasure to report these events but to right the detriment it causes," Frank says in the ad. In a press release on his campaign website, Frank says that Louis Warren and Glenn Williams are corporate officers of WFKR Inc., which he describes as doing business locally as Perfect 10 Men’s Club and Sugar’s Uptown Cabaret. In an interview, Frank noted that the Sugar’s website promotes both clubs, which he called a confirmation of joint ownership. Frank also pointed out a February 1999 State Office of Administrative Hearings document stating that Warren opened Sugar’s in June 1982 and was WFKR’s president and chairman of the board as of January 1997. From May 6, 2005, to May 21, 2012, Frank says, Warren donated $37,000 to Hamilton’s campaign. Williams, Frank says, contributed $1,250 on May 6, 2005. Frank’s press release says that Ali Davari of Houston, described as owning a Las Vegas strip club with his brother, Hassan Davari, gave $5,000 to Hamilton on April 25, 2012. The release says: "Ali Davari is also the president of several corporations in connection with his sexually oriented ventures in Houston." According to a May 11, 2011, news post by Houston’s KHOU-TV, the Davari brothers own seven strip clubs in the Houston and Las Vegas areas. We did not reach Warren and did not hear back from Williams. In a telephone interview, Casey Wallace, a Houston lawyer for a corporation owned by the Davari brothers, said Davari also has interests in three sports bars in Houston, but has no Travis County clubs or plans to open one there. Wallace said Davari donated to Hamilton’s campaign out of interest in a program for children overseen by the sheriff. "The donations didn’t have anything to do with his businesses," Wallace said. Frank says in another press release that Hamilton has accepted $10,000 toward his re-election from beer and alcohol distributors: Licensed Beverage Distributors Political Action Committee, $2,500; Wholesale Beer Distributors of Texas Political Action Committee, $3,500; and Dan Brown of Austin’s Brown Distributing, $4,000. When we visited him, Frank said: "Alcohol ruins a lot of lives. We’re in the business of fighting crime. You don’t accept money from people like that." Next, we checked Frank’s tally of contributions against Hamilton’s campaign finance filings with the county, finding that Frank’s figures mostly hold up, though the challenger did not note $1,000 donated to Hamilton’s effort by the Wholesale Beer Distributors on Dec. 3, 2009. So, by Frank’s reasoning, beer, wine and liquor interests have ponied up $11,000 to support Hamilton. Alan Gray, executive director of the Licensed Beverage Distributors, the Texas trade association for wine and distilled spirits wholesalers, told us by phone that the group is mindful of Hamilton’s past work enforcing laws as an employee of the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. "We know him to be a good man and good sheriff," Gray said. Finally, we looked over Warren’s nine contributions to Hamilton’s campaign from May 2005 through April 2012. His donations tally to $35,750 which added to the $1,250 contribution by Williams equals $37,000. On the other hand, it doesn’t look like Warren retained a leadership role in the entity that owns Sugar’s through all the years covered by Frank’s claim. The public portion of franchise-tax reports filed by WFKR, which we obtained from the Texas secretary of state’s office, lists Warren as its chairman through 2006. The 2007 filing was not available and the 2008 filing lists Warren as WFKR’s agent only. WFKR’s May 15, 2009 filing and its subsequent filings do not list Warren in any capacity. In contrast, according to the filings, Williams was a director when he made his 2005 donation and was listed as one in all but one year of the available filings through 2012. The absence of Warren from the latter filings suggests that $17,500 to $22,500 of his contributions to the sheriff’s campaign took place after Warren left the ownership of Sugar’s, arguably halving the questionable share of his donations. By the same logic, the total contributions questioned by Frank would total as much as $29,000, or less than 10 percent of all of Hamilton’s contributions of about $350,000 over the cited years. We left a message with WFKR and did not hear back. We also did not hear back from Hamilton. Our ruling Frank says Hamilton has accepted $42,000 from strip-club interests plus $10,000 from local alcohol distributors. His math mostly holds, though it looks like up to $22,500 of the so-called strip-club total occurred after a donor no longer was shown as having an ownership stake in Sugar’s. Removing these possibly post-ownership donations whittles down the amount Hamilton’s campaign has gotten from such interests. Missing from the claim, too, is the fact that candidates are not restricted from accepting donations from such interests. We rate the claim as Mostly True.

pomt-03069	"A strong bipartisan majority" in the House of Representatives "voted to defund Obamacare."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/30/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-strong-bipartisan-majority-house-rep/	Where the showdown over a government shutdown is concerned, the blame game runs both ways. Congress and the White House are at loggerheads over what to do with President Barack Obama’s health care law. Major aspects of the law are set to go live on Oct. 1, the same day as funding for the federal government runs out. But efforts to keep the funding flowing have floundered on the demand of some Republicans to defund or delay the law, while the president has refused to eliminate or pare back his signature legislative achievement. We noticed two similar, but opposite, claims about how the parties broke on key votes in the conflict. Here, we will look at a claim by Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. In a separate fact-check, we will look at a claim by Obama. After passage of a measure on Sept. 20, 2013, to fund the government without funding Obamacare, Cruz -- a leader of the pro-defunding side -- released a statement that said in part, "Today, the House of Representatives did what Washington pundits only a few weeks ago said was impossible: a strong bipartisan majority voted to defund Obamacare. This is a victory for House conservatives, and it is a victory for Speaker (John) Boehner and Republican leadership." Was it accurate for Cruz to say that "a strong bipartisan majority" in the House of Representatives "voted to defund Obamacare"? We didn’t hear back from Cruz’s office, but we looked at the vote tallies ourselves. On the final vote, the measure -- which paired continued funding for the government with a defunding of Obamacare -- passed by a 230-189 margin. But those 230 votes in favor broke down to 228 Republicans and just two Democrats, Reps. Mike McIntyre of North Carolina and Jim Matheson of Utah. (One Republican, Rep. Scott Rigell of Virginia, broke ranks and joined the Democrats.) We have addressed claims of "bipartisanship" in the past and have generally been skeptical of a claim where a tiny fraction of a caucus serves as justification for the "bipartisan" label. Norm Ornstein, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told us in 2011 that his definition would be "healthy numbers, not necessarily majorities, and not necessarily equally drawn, from both parties" -- a threshold hardly met in this case. Several other experts we checked with for this fact-check agreed. "I think a reasonable person would expect the threshold to be higher, particularly if the modifier ‘strong’ is applied," as Cruz included in his statement, said Roy T. Meyers, a political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County. Donald Wolfensberger, director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and a former Republican staff director of the House Rules Committee, felt similarly. "Two Democrats, like two swallows, do not a bipartisan summer make," Wolfensberger said. "It's more like a false spring. Beauty and political truth are in the eye of the beholder. We all tend to see what we want to see." Our ruling Cruz said that "a strong bipartisan majority" in the House of Representatives "voted to defund Obamacare." Even if you consider the overall 230-189 margin to be a "strong" victory for backers of the measure, it doesn’t qualify as "bipartisan" except in the most hyper-technical sense. Two Democrats out of the 190 who voted -- barely more than 1 percent of the party’s caucus -- joined Republicans in voting for the bill. In our book, that doesn’t qualify as much of a bipartisan action. We rate the claim False.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2013-09-30T17:22:41	2013-09-20	['None']

pomt-13188	California’s proposed tobacco tax "diverts 82 percent of the new taxes to line the pockets of wealthy special interests like insurance companies who don't have to help even one more patient."	mostly false	/california/statements/2016/oct/25/no-56-campaign/tobacco-industry-misleads-prop-56-doctor-advertise/	Opponents of Proposition 56, California’s proposed tobacco tax increase, have raised more than $66 million to defeat the November ballot measure. Nearly all of that money has come from the tobacco industry and much of it has been spent on television ads criticizing the initiative. Supporters have raised nearly $30 million for it. Prop 56 would impose a $2 per pack tax increase on cigarettes statewide and fund health programs. A recent No on 56 TV ad features a retired doctor who makes a provocative claim about how the measure’s revenue would be spent: "Prop 56 diverts 82 percent of the new taxes to line the pockets of wealthy special interests like insurance companies who don't have to help even one more patient," says Amador County Dr. Arnold Zeiderman, who appears in the ad wearing a white coat and stethoscope. Would the measure really distribute the bulk of the revenue to "wealthy special interests" with no mandate to serve more patients? We decided to check the facts. Our research The nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office expects Prop 56 could generate up to $1.4 billion in tax revenue in its first year. A chunk of that would go to replacing losses to state tobacco funds that would likely see a dip if cigarette sales decline due to the tax increase. Five percent would be spent to administer the tax. And about $120 million would go to various state programs, from law enforcement to physician training to dental disease prevention. The LAO report says 82 percent of the remaining revenue -- anywhere from $700 million to $1 billion -- would be spent to "increase the level of payment for healthcare, services and treatment provided to Medi-Cal beneficiaries." Medi-Cal provides health care for the state’s poorest residents. Health advocates have long argued the program’s reimbursement rates are too low to retain and attract doctors. Charles Rex Arbogast /AP file photo Expanding patient access? Supporters of Prop 56 say boosting reimbursement rates will lead to more doctors serving more Medi-Cal patients -- which runs against the implication in the ad that the measure won’t help "even one more patient." Scott Graves of the California Budget and Policy Center examined Prop 56 and concluded on the center’s website: "Increasing Medi-Cal reimbursement rates would help to boost providers’ participation in the program and help ensure timely access to care — and possibly improved health outcomes — for the more than 13 million low-income Californians who rely on Medi-Cal to meet their health care needs." The policy center is a nonprofit that advocates for programs aimed at low-income families. A spokeswoman for the No on 56 campaign acknowledged that 82 percent of the measure’s revenue would be set aside for increasing reimbursement rates. But the No campaign also said the measure does nothing to require more Medi-Cal patients are served. Supporters say that point is technically correct but distorts the point of the measure. "We made a determination that it would be better to dedicate money to Medi-Cal broadly rather than setting an arbitrary formula," said Anthony Wright, executive director of Health Access California, the consumer advocacy group that helped draft Prop 56. "The idea that this would help not even one new patient is sort of absurd. ... They're playing a little bit of a word game there." ‘Misleading’ ad Manoj Viswanathan, a UC Hastings law professor who focuses on tax policy and has studied Proposition 56, described the No campaign’s advertisement as "misleading." The professor, who is not affiliated with either side, said the No campaign appears to rest the second portion of the claim by the retired doctor -- the idea that Medi-Cal providers "don't have to help even one more patient" -- on an "unlikely" scenario. "Is there a universe where doctors see the exact same patients that they would have seen anyway, but are just getting paid more? Sure. I think that is a mathematical possibility. It just seems unlikely," Viswanathan said. According to the LAO, the California State Auditor would conduct audits of agencies receiving funds from the new taxes at least every other year. The Sacramento Bee examined claims by No on 56, and found questionable its description of Medi-Cal providers as "wealthy special interests." It notes those providers are "doctors, clinics, hospitals, managed care plans and any other health-related group that get Medi-Cal payments because they provide services to eligible patients." Our ruling A recent No on 56 campaign ad claims: "Prop 56 diverts 82 percent of the new taxes to line the pockets of wealthy special interests like insurance companies who don't have to help even one more patient." The Legislative Analyst’s Office reported that 82 percent of revenue generated by the measure, after some is directed to other funds, would be spent to "increase the level of payment for healthcare, services and treatment provided to Medi-Cal beneficiaries." Experts who have examined Prop 56 say there’s a strong chance that higher reimbursement rates will attract more doctors and expand health care access for patients. There’s the smallest sliver of truth to the No on 56 campaign’s claim that providers "don’t have to help even one more patient" because the measure does not dictate how many new patients will be served. But the claim also asks one to suspend reality by believing no new doctors would be attracted by the higher rates and that current doctors would not add more patients. Even the addition of handful of new doctors would expand healthcare access, shooting down the campaign’s misleading statement. We rated its claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-05266	A government analysis shows under a proposed transportation tax, "metro Atlanta will create or support an additional 200,000 new jobs, including jobs that are maintained year over year."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2012/may/29/citizens-transportation-mobility/pro-transportation-tax-group-says-projects-will-be/	Backers of a tax to overhaul metro Atlanta’s roadways and transit are telling voters it’s a pro-jobs proposal. A study from the Atlanta Regional Commission, the region’s planning body, said so, according to a Georgia Trend magazine advertising supplement sponsored by Citizens for Transportation Mobility: "The Atlanta Regional Commission’s analysis and forecast of the economic impacts of the 2012 Atlanta Regional Transportation Referendum’s passage show that . . . metro Atlanta will create or support an additional 200,000 new jobs, including jobs that are maintained year over year." Atlanta can sure use a couple of hundred thousand jobs. Is this true?

Citizens for Transportation Mobility is a pro-transportation tax advocacy group. However, the ARC is an intergovernmental organization, so it has not taken a stand on the referendum. The ARC study used a widely accepted economic model to predict what would happen if projects funded by the proposed 1 percent sales tax were built. It compares this scenario to one where the region continues with Plan 2040, its existing transportation blueprint. Plan 2040 builds projects slated for construction under the transportation tax proposal, but over a much longer period of time. The ARC’s carefully worded analysis does show that the new 1 percent sales tax and the transportation overhaul it funds would boost jobs, especially once construction is complete. This is how it works, according to the report and an interview with Mike Alexander, the ARC’s research chief: Most of the expected jobs growth would take place years in the future when the new infrastructure is built, Alexander said. Fewer delays would make it easier for members of the workforce, employers, customers and producers to gain access to one another. The ARC’s analysis predicts that the effects of the reduced delays will ripple through metro Atlanta’s economy and "support" 200,000 "job years" over and above those that would exist if voters nixed the plan. But when a project "supports" one "job year," that doesn’t mean that it creates a new job for one worker. A "job year" is a term economists use to describe one job lasting one year. For example, if a construction worker gets hired to pour concrete for six months, this would count as half of a job year. If that same construction worker gets hired to pour concrete for three years, his work would count as three job years. If a project "supports" a job year, it doesn’t mean that it creates one. That three-year job pouring concrete is new only in the year that the worker gets hired. The project "supports" the job in the following two years. These may seem like arcane distinctions, but they’re important. If Citizens for Transportation Mobility said that the transportation tax "would create 200,000 new jobs," that would be misleading. The bulk of those jobs would not be new. Instead, the ad said that the transportation tax would "create or support an additional 200,000 new jobs," and specified that some of these jobs are "maintained year over year." Alexander and others argued that this wording makes clear that the jobs figure includes positions that last for more than one year. PolitiFact Georgia sees their point, but the sentence is a bit opaque. We also found another hitch. These hundreds of thousands of job years would emerge over the course of a generation, according to the analysis. The study measures growth over a 28-year time period from the beginning of 2013 to the end of 2040. The one-year average would be 7,120. Through 2019, it would generate or support less than 2,000 a year, according to the analysis. By 2040, that number approaches 14,000. This long time horizon made us wonder whether the Citizens for Transportation Mobility’s claim gives the impression that jobs would appear sooner than the ARC analysis says. Bert Brantley, a public relations expert involved in the writing of the advertorial, said this is not the case. He noted that the ad’s next three paragraphs specify that economic gains such as savings from reduced travel time and an increase in personal income would develop by 2040. But when it came to jobs, this decades-long time horizon wasn’t clear. In fact, the supplement suggests that the transportation tax would help Georgia’s economic recovery -- a process that’s going on right now: "The region would gain 34,000 new jobs in construction alone, allowing us to recoup more than half of the 57,000 construction jobs lost to the Great Recession," the ad states. Even though Citizens for Transportation Mobility attempts to tread carefully over the subject of jobs, its jobs claim isn’t clear enough. The average reader would walk away from the advertising supplement thinking that the transportation overhaul would create 200,000 jobs in the next few years. But those are job years. In fact, we don’t know how many of what your typical person would consider actual jobs this effort would create. Citizens for Transportation Mobility would have been much better off if it said the overhaul would create or sustain an average of 7,120 jobs each year. The statement contains a kernel of truth, but it is so unclear on important specifics that it is misleading. It meets PolitiFact’s definition of Mostly False.

pomt-04374	Says Tammy Baldwin "voted to gut Medicare for seniors."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/21/tommy-thompson/thompson-says-baldwin-voted-gut-medicare/	As mid-October neared, Republican Tommy Thompson countered charges that he would harm Medicare, and began airing a TV ad alleging that Tammy Baldwin had "voted to cut Medicare" for seniors. Then Thompson’s campaign began trumpeting an amped-up version of that ad, again taking aim at his Democratic rival in the neck-and-neck race for Wisconsin’s open U.S. Senate seat. "Tammy Baldwin is lying about Tommy Thompson," a female narrator says in the tougher ad. "The truth is, Baldwin voted to gut Medicare for seniors." That’s "gut" -- as in removing the essential parts -- not "cut." The ad continues with an older woman on screen, saying, "Tammy Baldwin has no business taking $716 billion out of Medicare." The narrator adds: "Baldwin even voted against providing prescription drug benefits to seniors. That plan's architect? Tommy Thompson." It’s true Baldwin voted against the Medicare Part D drug program in 2003. And, while we haven’t fact-checked the "architect" claim, it’s well-established that Thompson played a key role in winning passage of the drug legislation as Health and Human Services chief for President George W. Bush. But what about Thompson’s new claim that Baldwin voted to "gut" the Medicare program? The vote cited in the ad is Obama’s signature health care law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Baldwin, a congresswoman since 1999, did join with a strong majority of House Democrats in approving the measure, 219-212, with Republicans unanimously in opposition. Under the Affordable Care Act, Medicare spending would be slowed, and money saved would help pay for coverage of the uninsured and other initiatives. Originally, it was estimated that the savings would be more than $500 billion; more recently, that has been revised to $716 billion. PolitiFact has examined multiple claims across the country that Democrats, through their vote for the "Obamacare" law, cut money from Medicare. The "cut Medicare" Thompson ad closely mirrors a statement by Mitt Romney, who said on Aug. 15: "Under the president's plan, he cuts Medicare by $716 billion, takes that money out of the Medicare trust fund and uses it to pay for ‘Obamacare.’ " PolitiFact Florida rated that Half True, because Romney gave the impression "Obamacare" takes money already allocated to Medicare. The savings come from spending reductions over the next 10 years that would slow the rate of growth in Medicare’s budget. But here we are rating Thompson’s other Baldwin ad, which uses a word -- "gut" -- that ramps up the claim considerably. As a frame of reference, in the 2010 Senate race in Wisconsin we reviewed Republican candidate (and now Senator) Ron Johnson’s claim that then-Sen. Russ Feingold, a Democrat, "cut Medicare by $523 billion." (Again, that was the earlier estimate of Obamacare’s spending-reduction plan.) We rated that Mostly False, noting that Medicare spending would still increase, and that Johnson’s additional claim that Feingold was the deciding vote could be made against every incumbent senator who voted for the health care law. Thompson’s claim, by contrast, is "gut." We approached the Thompson campaign to back up the ad’s claim. They pointed us to Congressional Budget Office memos, and a report by Medicare’s actuary, to refute claims by the Obama campaign that his health care law strengthened the delicate financial position of Medicare. The documentation does confirm that if Obamacare was repealed, more money would be available to spend on Medicare. But we also asked two federal budget experts from nonpartisan groups to assess the ad’s use of "gut." Both said it was solidly off the mark. "Medicare will continue to grow in nominal dollars and faster than the overall economy," said Jason Peuquet, research director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The cost savings in the health law, in Peuquet’s view, actually don’t go far enough to tackle Medicare’s long-term fiscal stability. One way to look at it, he said, is that over 10 years, Medicare under Obamacare is projected to grow about 10 percent less than it would have. Even with the slower growth, net Medicare spending is still projected to rise from $504 billion to $877 billion over that period, CBO estimates show. Total projected Medicare spending goes from $598 billion to $1.04 trillion. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, told us that "regardless of whether you think these are good or bad reforms, ‘gutting’ a program would require far deeper cuts than Obamacare/ACA included." We’ve tackled a claim of "gutting" a government program before. Democratic U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin accused Gov. Scott Walker of "gutting" two tax credits for the poor or elderly. In rating that False in May 2012, we said that while the percentage cut was deep in one of the credits, Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature left them largely intact. Even advocates for the credits said "gutting" went too far. Impact on Medicare To be sure, serious health-care experts have raised concerns that health-care access for seniors could be reduced if Obamacare’s cut in the growth of Medicare payments to providers discourages them from accepting Medicare patients. Prediction is difficult, as the Office of the Actuary for Medicare and Medicaid Services said while raising the concern in April 2010. In addition, the law tries to save costs on Medicare Advantage, an optional Medicare program run by private insurers. As federal subsidies to Advantage are reduced, recipients could see higher premiums, or lose of some extras like free eyeglasses and gym memberships, we have noted in the past. So it’s likely that some reduction in services will result from the health care law. On the other hand, the Thompson campaign did not mention that the health care law actually adds new services: It gradually closes the gap in Medicare prescription drug coverage known as the "doughnut hole," funds illness prevention benefits, and seeks to boost access to primary care doctors and other providers. Finally, we should also note an important bit of context left out of the ad. Vice presidential nominee Ryan’s budget plan -- backed by Thompson -- included the same amount of reductions in future Medicare spending that were part of "Obamacare, "PolitiFact National has noted. Ryan said he would keep the savings for future Medicare expenses, not to support the new federal health-care law. Our ruling Thompson’s new ad says the truth is that "Baldwin voted to gut Medicare for seniors" when she backed the health reform law’s cost-containment measures in the Medicare program. This is off base or misleading on several fronts. The health care law slows Medicare’s growth but spending would still rise significantly, and some new services are added. The changes do not promise to hold seniors harmless, but Medicare is not being gutted. We rate the claim False.

pomt-01326	Says Jeanne Shaheen "voted to pave the way for a new national energy tax."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/oct/24/scott-brown/debate-scott-brown-says-jeanne-shaheen-voted-pave-/	In an Oct. 21, 2014, debate in Concord, N.H., Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., and her Republican challenger, former Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown, tangled over energy policy. At one point, Brown said Shaheen "voted to pave the way for a new national energy tax." We thought we’d take a closer look. This claim echoed, but did not precisely match, one made in a June press release by Brown’s campaign manager, Colin Reed -- that "one year ago, Sen. Shaheen voted for a measure that would have amounted to a new national energy tax." This referred to the debate surrounding a "carbon tax" -- another term for taxes on oil, gas and coal usage. The logic behind the tax is that by making natural resources costlier for individuals and businesses to use, a carbon tax would encourage the use of alternative energy sources that have a smaller environmental impact. Most economists agree that a carbon tax would be effective, but the issue hasn’t gained much political traction. Brown campaign staffer Elizabeth Guyton pointed us to Shaheen’s vote on an amendment to a 2013 budget resolution put forth by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who has expressed support for implementing a carbon tax. The amendment stipulated that revenue generated by any future carbon tax must be given back to the public in some form. Shaheen voted in favor of the amendment. However, nothing in that amendment would have actually enacted a carbon tax. Rather, the amendment offered a rough framework for how money generated from such a tax, if one were ever enacted, would be put to use. "I think that ultimately a fee on carbon pollution is inevitable, and the purpose of that amendment was to begin a discussion on that and begin the discussion about when that happens, what the best way to use the proceeds of the fee are," Whitehouse told reporters in 2013. "So from that point of view, I didn’t view it as binding anybody on a carbon fee, but I did view it as an assessment of the best way of using carbon fee proceeds." Although Shaheen was one of 41 "yea" votes (all of them coming from Democrats or Democratic-caucusing Independents), the vote wasn’t directly in support of a carbon tax. It would have been accurate to say Shaheen voted to "pave the way" for a carbon tax if she had cast a vote to -- for instance -- begin Senate debate on an actual carbon tax. But no carbon tax was waiting for a vote. The amendment she voted for wouldn’t have brought a carbon tax any closer to fruition. (And don’t forget that the measure didn’t even pass, so it’s not as if it paved the way for a tax that’s now in place.) A second piece of evidence offered by Brown’s campaign concerns an amendment proposed by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. Blunt has emerged as a persistent carbon tax opponent in the Senate. In 2013, Blunt proposed an amendment that would have increased the threshold for passing a carbon tax framework within a budget resolution to 60 votes. Shaheen voted against this amendment, even as some of her Democratic colleagues from energy producing states voted for it. Still, it’s an exaggeration to say that Shaheen "paved the way" for a carbon tax when no proposal was going anywhere in the Senate. Shripal Shah, a spokesman from Shaheen’s Senate office, told us in June that Shaheen has never supported a carbon tax. Shah said Shaheen supports "market-driven solutions" to address pollution, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. This statement seems to fall in line with the position Shaheen took when she first campaigned for the Senate in 2008. During a roundtable discussion at Seacoast Energy Alternatives in Somersworth, New Hampshire, Shaheen said she would prefer a cap-and-trade program over a carbon tax because it’s "easier to sell to the population" and "puts the onus" on the polluters. When it comes to the legislative record, Shaheen’s efforts to influence energy policy since taking office have been focused largely on boosting energy efficiency. Shaheen partnered with Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, to craft an energy efficiency bill that would launch a federal training program for energy-efficient building design and operation and establish a loan program for energy improvements to homes and small businesses, among other initiatives. The bill has twice died in the Senate. The most recent effort failed on May 12, 2014, when supporters failed to reach the 60 votes necessary to close debate on the bill and proceed to a final vote. Our ruling Brown said Shaheen "voted to pave the way for a new national energy tax." That’s misleading. The two votes she took did mirror those of some lawmakers who favor a carbon tax, but that’s not the same thing as saying she voted to "pave the way for a new national energy tax." These weren’t procedural votes to commence a debate on, or tee up a final vote on, an actual carbon-tax bill. We don't see how either vote would have brought a carbon tax any closer to fruition.

pomt-00329	Says she voted to stop a new "age tax" under which "Arizonans age 50 & over could be charged 5 times more for their health care."	half-true	/arizona/statements/2018/sep/19/kyrsten-sinema/fact-checking-kyrsten-sinemas-claim-about-age-tax-/	Democratic U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema says she’s looking out for older Arizonans, and her voting record backs her up. In her bid for U.S. Senate, Sinema pointed to her vote against a "new age tax." "We need to make it easier for Arizonans to afford their health care. That’s why I voted to stop a new ‘age tax’ on coverage for people age 50 and over," Sinema tweeted Sept. 8. Her tweet included an image with text that said: "Arizonans age 50 & over could be charged 5 times more for their health care under the ‘age tax’." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Sinema is campaigning against Republican U.S. Rep. Martha McSally for the seat held by retiring Republican Sen. Jeff Flake. The election is Nov. 6. Did Sinema vote to stop a new "age tax" that could have charged Arizonans 50 years and older five times more for their health care? Sinema in 2017 voted against a Republican bill that allowed insurance companies to charge certain people 50 and older up to five times more what they would charge younger adults. It wasn't a "tax" levied by the government. The bill would have increased the cap by which people could charge some people over 50. Her claim mimics attacks we’ve seen against Republicans, omitting the same caveats: This provision applied to people buying insurance on the individual and small-group markets. It didn’t apply to seniors on Medicare, or to people 50 and older with coverage sponsored by large employers. Current law allows insurers to charge older adults three times what they charge younger adults. American Health Care Act’s 5-to-1 provision The American Health Care Act was part of an effort to repeal the 2010 health care law signed by President Barack Obama. The bill retained some parts of the Obama-era law, including the prohibition on insurance companies from denying coverage for a pre-existing health problem. The Republican bill passed the House in May 2017 by a vote of 217-213, with Sinema voting against it and McSally for it. The Senate failed to pass its own measure. Before Obamacare, as the Republicans called it, older adults paid about four or five times more for premiums than what younger adults paid, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis. Obamacare changed the rules so that insurance companies could still charge older adults more than younger adults, but only by up to three times. Here’s a sample of the 2018 age rating curve: • A 50-year-old pays 1.786 times the amount that a younger person pays; • A 55-year-old pays 2.230 times the amount that a younger person pays; and • Someone 64 and older pays 3 times the amount that a younger person pays. The 2017 House bill that Sinema voted against sought to increase the ratio to 5-to-1 for certain adults over 50. It allowed states to set a different ratio. However, the proposal didn’t apply to seniors on Medicare, or people older than 50 who had coverage through large employers. Katie Keith, a researcher for the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University, said the policy change would have made overall premiums "significantly more unaffordable." The Trump administration would have to figure out how to set an age rating curve, Keith said, "but all of these numbers would shift up significantly, even if not five times as much, at all ages over 50." The age rating works on a curve that increases with each year of age (for adults), so "it's probably most accurate to say that seniors 50 and over could be charged up to 5 times more," Keith said. It's an open question as to whether Arizona would have set a different ratio under the Republican repeal, Keith said. Under current law, states can request ratios less than the federal standard, but Arizona — like most states — hasn’t done that, Keith said. The 2017 health care bill also could have increased health care costs for older adults, because the legislation would have replaced income-based tax credits with a credit based on age. Under the proposal, adults under 30 would get a $2,000 credit; adults over 60, a $4,000 credit; and individuals who made more than $75,000 annually (or a couple who filed jointly earning $150,000) would have tax credits phased out. According to AARP calculations, under AHCA, 50- to 64-year-olds making $25,000 annually would be eligible for tax credits that are on average 50 to 80 percent less than what they would receive under current law. "Generally, people who are older, lower-income, or live in high-premium areas (like Alaska and Arizona) receive less financial assistance under the AHCA," said a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis. "Additionally, older people would have higher starting premiums under the AHCA and would therefore pay higher premiums." Our ruling Sinema said she voted to stop a new "age tax," under which "Arizonans age 50 & over could be charged 5 times more for their health care." Sinema voted against the Republican effort to repeal Obamacare, which would have allowed companies to charge individuals 50 and over up to five times more than what they charged younger adults. Sinema’s ad glosses over a few important points. The bill’s provision only applied to people who bought insurance through the individual and small-group markets. It wouldn’t have applied to people on Medicare (and are 65 and older) or with coverage through larger employers. The current health care law allows insurers to charge this age group three times as much for insurance as younger adults. Although Sinema's tweet references a "new" age tax, it may be unclear to some that the charges wouldn’t be fives time more than the current situation. Sinema’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

NotAllowedTo.com ran a post on June 22 that said a Canadian tourist and his friend from Chicago had caught a shark responsible for the deaths of 100 people who went missing over the past decade. The catch and deaths are fabricated. The story is a shorter version of a June 20, 2016, post published on World News Daily Report, a satirical news site. "We’ve heard a few times about this story, and there's no fact to it," said Christopher Yaw, a spokesperson for the District Nine Coast Guard. Great white sharks can’t swim in freshwater, as it dilutes their internal salt levels. That dehydrates them and decreases their buoyancy, so that they sink. The story quotes a biology professor at the University of Illinois on the rarity of the find, but a search of his name on the university’s database yielded no results. The post claims there was a 1916 shark attack in Lake Eerie that led to a 14 year swimming ban, but we found no traces of this attack or a ban. The most famous actual 1916 attack occurred on the Jersey Shore, in salt water. We also found no credible reports of disappearances on the lake.

pomt-14056	"When adjusted for inflation, (Texas) per-student spending has remained relatively flat over the past 16 years. Despite that trend, Texas schools in 2017 will receive $381 less per student than they did in 2003."	half-true	/texas/statements/2016/may/23/celia-israel/celia-israel-says-student-education-spending-flat-/	An Austin Democrat critical of the all-Republican Texas Supreme Court for upholding the legality of the Texas school finance system asserted that unless lawmakers act, per-student spending will lag what it totaled more than a dozen years ago. In a press release circulated May 13, 2016, the date of the court’s decision, state Rep. Celia Israel urged Gov. Greg Abbott to call a special legislative session to "fully fund public education." Israel went on: "When adjusted for inflation, per-student spending has remained relatively flat over the past 16 years. Despite that trend, Texas schools in 2017 will receive $381 less per student than they did in 2003." Is all of that so? Israel cites Center for Public Policy Priorities To our inquiry, Israel’s chief of staff, Jennie Kennedy, said by email that Israel relied on an April 2016 report by the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank that advocates lawmakers on issues affecting low-income Texans. We turned to the report, "The Texas School Finance Challenge and What to Do About It," which has a nearly identical spending claim, stating: "When adjusted for inflation, per-student spending has remained relatively flat over the past 16 years. Despite that relatively flat spending trend per student, Texas schools in 2017 will receive $381 less per student than they did in 2003." Over the years, a chart in the report indicates, total per-student spending was relatively flat, ranging from a 2013 inflation-adjusted low of $9,813 per student to a 2009 high of $11,621. From 2002 through 2017, the chart suggests annual average per-student spending of nearly $10,479 -- meaning $273 less than what was spent in 2003 and $108 more than expected spending in 2017. And, as Israel said, the $10,371 in expected spending in 2017 would run $381 less than the shown $10,752 in per-student spending in 2003. Indeed, per the chart, that 2017 spending will run behind per-student spending in 10 of the 14 years from 2003 through 2016--though it’s poised to outpace spending in four of the presented years. We realized too you can reach a smaller long-term spending difference--or even an increase--by focusing on a different timeframe. For instance, according to the chart, the expected 2017 spending will lag per-student spending in 2004 by (just) $97--and the expected spending will outrun school spending in 2005 by $111 per student, also exceeding per-student spending in 2012 through 2014--by margins of $262 per student (2014) to $558 (2013). Finally, the shown 2017 spending will run just $4 per student behind $10,375 in spending in 2015 though it’s pegged to be down $69 per student from spending in 2016. SOURCE: Report, "The Texas School Finance Challenge and What to Do About It," Center for Public Policy Priorities, April 20, 2016 We asked the center to show its work; spokesman Oliver Bernstein emailed us the related spreadsheet, which initially prompted us to notice that the presented figures represent 2015 dollars. State spending up? Also, the spreadsheet shows, the center broke out annual changes in local, state and federal spending, also adjusted for inflation. Seemingly dramatic: Some $4,236 per student in school expenditures by state government in 2017 stands to outpace comparable spending in 2003--by $254. In contrast, local spending will be down nearly $600 a student and federal aid will be about $60 per student less than what it was, according to the sheet. What gives? By email, a center analyst, Eva DeLuna Castro, reminded us the uptick in state spending reflects a legislative decision in 2006 to pay down local school property taxes with state aid; that move fuels a continuing cost to the state of $14 billion every two years. In the report, a note below the chart says the center reached its figures by analyzing data from the Legislative Budget Board, which advises lawmakers on budget issues, and Texas Education Agency. So we asked those agencies about the center’s conclusions. Legislative Budget Board analysis By email, TEA spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson said the agency doesn’t make such spending comparisons. But a board staff spokesman, R.J. DeSilva, told us by email that its own inflation-adjusted analysis indicates that in 2017 dollars, Texas schools will have $10,111 in total per-student aid in 2017--up $33 from $10,078 in per-student spending in 2003. DeSilva emailed a chart showing the figures as well as that 3.9 million students attended Texas schools in 2003 with a little more than 5 million expected in 2017. DeSilva wrote: "The source of the statement you're checking may be using different data points such as measures of inflation or constant dollar year." We knew that was right about the dollar year. And when we asked, DeLuna Castro confirmed by email that the center had employed a federal inflation index, the Implicit Price Deflator for state/local government from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. In the center’s view, DeLuna Castro said, that index better reflects costs to school districts than the general Consumer Price Index applied in the board-provided analysis. "Why it’s different: Governments are more likely to face the rising costs of health care (teacher health insurance premiums, for example) and of road construction that the CPI doesn’t capture," DeLuna Castro wrote. How about it, budget board; wrong inflation index? To the contrary, DeSilva said by email there's no consensus about using the IPD rather than CPI when analyzing education spending. "The CPI is well-known," DeSilva wrote, and the board uniformly employs it to analyze state spending in all areas. Finally, DeLuna Castro emailed us her run at adjusting per-student spending figures by using the CPI to account for inflation. By this approach, public school spending in 2017 stands to outpace per-student spending in 2003 by $148 per student, per the spreadsheet DeLuna Castro shared, though the 2017 spending looks to trail per-student expenditures in 2006-08, 2012, 2015 and 2016. Our ruling Israel said: "When adjusted for inflation, per student spending has remained relatively flat over the past 16 years. Despite that trend, Texas schools in 2017 will receive $381 less per student than they did in 2003." Per-student funding has held relatively flat, data shows. But the "$381 less" conclusion rests on cherry-picking a timeframe and relying on an inflation index not favored by the main agency that advises lawmakers on budget issues. Try a different timeframe and/or the CPI and you can get contrary results--even, in some instances, greater spending in 2017. We rate this statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3de4cb27-2619-4391-b0cd-1cb014124752	None	Celia Israel	None	None	None	2016-05-23T15:41:39	2016-05-13	['Texas']

pomt-13087	"Nearly one in four people in their prime working years are not working."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/07/donald-trump/donald-trump-correct-1-4-working-age-americans-not/	During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump has gotten some things about the labor market very wrong, notably suggesting that the unemployment rate may be 42 percent. (It’s not; that got a Pants on Fire.) But at a Nov. 4 rally in Atkinson, N.H., Trump offered a statistic that was much closer to the mark. "At the core of my contract is my plan to bring back our jobs, about time," he said, later adding that "nearly one in four people in their prime working years are not working. They want to work. They're not working." When we checked with several economists, they said the most commonly used age span for defining the "prime working years" is 25 to 54. So we looked at the "employment-to-population ratio" for ages 25 to 54 -- that is, the percentage of people in that age range who are working, divided by the total number of people in that age range. (We also spot-checked the data for 18 to 64 and for 25 to 64 and did not find significant differences from 25 to 54.) According to the most recent data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics -- covering October 2016 -- 78.2 percent of the population between 25 and 54 was working. Flip that percentage and 21.8 percent of the population between 25 and 54 was not working. So Trump is on solid ground saying "nearly one in four." That said, we’ll try to put this number in some historical context. Here’s a chart for this statistic that goes back to 1948. The chart shows the percentage of people working. First, simply citing this figure ignores that the percentage of people in this age range who are working has risen steadily during President Barack Obama’s presidency. The chart below shows that this ratio has risen by 3.4 percentage points since its most recent low point during the Obama presidency -- 74.8 percent in November 2010. So just citing the number ignores that the figure has been going in the right direction for the past six years. Second, it’s worth noting that the current ratio is not all that far from its all-time high -- 81.9 percent in April 2000. Prime working age happens to be the prime childbearing and child-rearing age, and it makes sense that some people will choose not to work during at least some of those years. So it’s not as if this number has always been pushing 100 percent and now is suddenly down dramatically. On the other hand, economists say that Trump has put his finger on a legitimate concern about the current labor market -- that the employment rate among prime-working-age Americans has not recovered to its level prior to the Great Recession. Despite more than six years of steady job growth, the employment-to-population ratio for those 25 to 54 has not yet returned to its immediate pre-Great Recession peak of 80.3 in January 2007. Today, it’s still 2.1 percentage points below that peak. And every single month but two of President George W. Bush’s two terms in office had a higher percentage than today’s, even though Bush took office during an economic downturn, albeit a milder one. The trend line for men has been particularly problematic. As the following chart shows, the employment ratio for men in this age range was almost always above 90 percent prior to 1980, and in the immediate pre-Great Recession period, it was in the 87 percent range. Under Obama, it has rebounded from a low of 80.6 percent, but it was still only at 85 percent in October 2016 -- lower than its pre-recession level. In other words, we may be looking at a new, lower normal for prime-working-age employment, particularly for men -- and unlike some other employment statistics, this is one that is not shaped by an ongoing surge of baby boomer retirements. Our ruling Trump said that "nearly one in four people in their prime working years are not working." The actual percentage is 21.8 percent, so Trump’s phrasing is reasonable. Putting it this way does ignore that this number has declined steadily under Obama for the past six years, and it also ignores that it’s not that far from the all-time low. Still, economists agree that Trump is raising a legitimate concern, since even after six years of improvement, the percentage today remains worse than it was prior to the Great Recession, suggesting that it might represent a new, more worrisome "normal." We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-11-07T15:00:00	2016-11-04	['None']

pomt-06045	Says Newt Gingrich "co-sponsored a bill with Nancy Pelosi that would have given $60 million a year to a U.N. program supporting China’s brutal one-child policy."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2012/jan/12/restore-our-future/newt-gingrich-nancy-pelosi-china-one-child-policy/	The best offense is a good defense: That seems to be the playbook for the Restore Our Future super PAC. The game started when Newt Gingrich attacked Mitt Romney for laying off workers while Romney worked at Bain Capital. Then Restore our Future, which is run by Romney supporters, attacked Gingrich for some his previous positions. (Super PACs operate outside of official campaigns and don’t have to follow the same rules.) "Newt Gingrich’s attacks are called 'foolish,' 'out of bounds,' and 'disgusting.' Newt attacks because he has more baggage than the airlines," says the ad, which is running in Florida and South Carolina. "Newt was fined $300,000 for ethics violations, took $1.6 million from Freddie Mac, and co-sponsored a bill with Nancy Pelosi that would have given $60 million a year to a U.N. program supporting China’s brutal one-child policy." "Don’t be fooled by Newt’s desperate attacks," the ad concludes. The ad is right that Gingrich was fined $300,000 for ethics violations. Gingrich also concedes that he advised Freddie Mac. (Bloomberg reported he was paid $1.6 million, but that specific amount rests on unnamed sources.) Here, we wanted to fact-check whether Gingrich "co-sponsored a bill with Nancy Pelosi that would have given $60 million a year to a U.N. program supporting China’s brutal one-child policy." For its evidence, the ad points to H.R. 1078, from Feb. 22, 1989. We went to the archives to check on the bill’s details. The bill in question was called the Global Warming Prevention Act of 1989. It set national goals to reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and encouraged international agreements to address global warming. It required the U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency to monitor global warming and create plans for future action. It supported stricter fuel standards for cars and alternative energy. It also sent money to developing countries to encourage practices that reduce carbon emissions. (See our fact-check of how Gingrich's statements on global warming and cap-and-trade policies have changed over the years.) The bill had several hearings, but received unfavorable reviews from the George H.W. Bush administration and never became law. Getting back to the ad’s specific claims, it says that Gingrich co-sponsored the bill with Nancy Pelosi. The bill’s primary sponsor was Rep. Claudine Schneider, R-R.I. It’s true that both Gingrich and Pelosi were co-sponsors. But the bill had 144 co-sponsors, roughly a third of the U.S. House of Representatives. (Gingrich was not speaker at this time; Democrats still held the majority.) Congressional records indicate Pelosi signed onto the bill the day it was introduced, while close to four months passed before Gingrich signed on as a co-sponsor. Next, the ad says the bill "would have given $60 million a year to a UN program supporting China’s brutal one-child policy." China’s one-child policy generally refers to the government’s efforts to limit population growth to one child per couple. Human rights advocates say the policy has resulted in forced sterilizations and abortions. The Restore our Future website says the $60 million went to the United Nations Population Fund and that President Ronald Reagan withheld funds from the program after he determined the program, which supports family planning and contraception, was supporting Chinese actions. We won’t attempt to relitigate here whether the United Nations Population Fund supported Chinese policy, because we soon found evidence that the bill’s authors did not support those policies. In the same section that authorizes funding, there’s this stipulation: "None of the funds authorized by this section may be used to pay for the performance of involuntary sterilization or abortion or to coerce any person to accept family planning." Our ruling The ad says that Gingrich "co-sponsored a bill with Nancy Pelosi that would have given $60 million a year to a U.N. program supporting China’s brutal one-child policy." Actually, the bill attempted to address climate change, and a third of House members were co-sponsors. The bill did propose money for the United Nations Population Fund, but it stated specifically that its funding could not be used for "involuntary sterilization or abortion or to coerce any person to accept family planning." The ad’s claim rests on repeated distortions, so we rate the statement Pants on Fire!	None	Restore Our Future	None	None	None	2012-01-12T18:31:28	2012-01-12	['Nancy_Pelosi', 'United_Nations', 'China']
pomt-00674	"We doubled the size of the company (Hewlett-Packard)."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/10/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-fights-back-against-hp-layoff-claims/	Carly Fiorina is fighting back against critics, including a cyber-squatter, who accuse the Republican presidential candidate of slash-and-burn tactics in her time as CEO of computer company Hewlett-Packard. The cyber-squatter purchased the website carlyfiorina.org to highlight nearly 30,000 layoffs that occured while Fiorina led the computer giant from 1999-2005. Fiorina later was fired by HP’s board. On Meet the Press Sunday, host Chuck Todd asked Fiorina why she was fired. Fiorina used the question to list her accomplishments at HP. "What people fail to comment on is the fact we doubled the size of the company, took the growth rate from 2 percent to 9 percent," she said. "We tripled the rate of innovation to 11 patents a day and went from lagging behind to leading in every product category. We grew jobs here in the U.S. and all over the world. You can't just leave those facts out -- they are as vital to the record as the fact that yes, indeed, I had to make tough calls during tough times. Tough times that many technology companies didn't survive at all." Given Fiorina’s dismissal and other issues at HP, we were interested in that first claim -- that under her leadership, the company doubled in size. Fiorina's claim is not referring to the number of employees (you can read a good primer on that from our archives here). In this case, staff at Carly for America (Fiorina’s political action committee) said she was referring to the revenues created by the company. By this specific measure, HP did double. In 1999, when Fiorina became CEO, HP’s annual revenue was $42.4 billion, according to annual Securities and Exchange Commission filings. With the exception of a slight dip in 2001 (at the end of the dot-com bubble), revenue increased each year -- to $86.7 billion in 2005, the year she left. That’s a little bit more than double. But that doesn’t tell the entire tale. There are a few critical caveats. Where the growth came from Why such growth? Well, Fiorina spearheaded a major $25 billion acquisition of HP’s rival, Compaq, to increase the company’s share of the personal computer market. The merger was publicly controversial, in part because it tipped HP’s focus toward computers (a tough market) and away from its most successful product, printers. The merger went through, and the company grew. In 2001, the year before the merger, revenue was $45.7 billion, and the Compaq revenue was about $40 billion. In 2003, after the two companies merged, revenue was $73 billion. Stephen Morrissette, a business professor at the University of Chicago, noted that the fact that so much of the revenue growth was a result of the merger casts some shade on Fiorina’s claim. "Most executives would likely not use the phrasing ‘doubled the size of the company’ to describe their performance if the increase was all or mostly due to an acquisition," Morrissette said. Doubled revenues, but not necessarily stronger Despite the increased revenue, the HP-Compaq merger led to sluggish stock prices and missed profitability targets. The merger also led to the thousands of firings often cited by Fiorina’s critics. The merger was widely seen as a bust at the time, and it contributed to the HP board’s decision to fire Fiorina. (HP stock value plunged by nearly half during her tenure and rose again after she was fired.) HP had $42.4 billion in revenues and $3.1 billion in net earnings in 1999. When Fiorina was ousted in 2005, yes, the company reported $86.7 billion in sales. But that year HP had only $2.4 billion in earnings. Lastly, the employee head count gets a bit complicated. According to SEC filings, HP had 84,400 employees worldwide in 2001, the year before the merger. In 2001, Compaq had 63,700 full-time employees. That comes to a total of 148,100 workers. In 2005, just after her departure, HP's worldwide workforce reached 150,000. That includes acquiring some other companies, the Los Angeles Times reported. Some analysts have seen the merger more favorably in recent years, noting that it accomplished Fiorina’s goal of increasing HP’s share of the personal computer market even though Fiorina’s execution failed. Fiorina "is taking credit for something she launched and got started," Charles House, co-author of The HP Phenomenon, told the San Jose Mercury News in 2011. "But I think you obviously have to give a hell of a lot of credit to (her successor) for making it successful. I'd be loath to say it would be the same with her there." Our ruling Fiorina said that while she was CEO of HP, the size of the company "doubled." That's correct when discussing one specific aspect, revenues, but you could argue that's a bit of a red herring. The revenue growth was largely thanks to a controversial merger with Compaq and not organic. Moreover, the new revenue did not come with proportional increases to either profits or the number of HP jobs. Fiorina’s figures are accurate, but standing alone, they don’t tell the whole picture.

pomt-00631	There was "a 57-percent decrease in fireworks-related injuries in 2000 [after Connecticut legalized sparklers] compared to the 14 years prior."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2015/may/24/eric-turner/fireworks-lobbyist-says-sparkler-legalization-cut-/	One proposal before the General Assembly would restore the state's ban on all fireworks, a prohibition that was in place until the legislature and Gov. Donald Carcieri lifted it in June 2010. The ban was eased to allow sparklers, spinners and smokers to be purchased in stores. Fireworks that explode or fly through the air remained illegal, although you wouldn't know it during the weeks surrounding that Fourth of July, when the number of neighborhood fireworks displays seems to have, well, skyrocketed since sparklers became legal. During a hearing on the bill, S-431, a comment by Eric Turner sparked our attention. He's director of governmental affairs for American Promotional Events, which sells fireworks under the name TNT Fireworks. Turner argued against the Rhode Island bill, saying the experience in Connecticut, which began allowing sparklers and other "consumer" devices, shows the public is actually safer when such products are legal. "When the public is permitted to use sparkling devices as allowed in Rhode Island, they're less apt to go after illegal products," Turner told members of the Senate Judiciary Committee. "Injuries actually go down because more people use a regulated product." "I'll give you an example," he said. "In 2000, Connecticut, your neighbor, passed a very similar law -- handheld and ground-based sparklers. The Connecticut Department of Public Safety showed a 57-percent decrease in fireworks-related injuries in 2000 compared to the 14 years prior." We made repeated attempts to contact Turner to find the source of his information. He never returned our phone messages or emails. So we tried to get the data ourselves. Turner cited the state's department of public safety. So we went there. After one month, the only data it could provide was well outside the period Turner mentioned in his testimony. And the numbers it did have -- one or two injuries per year reported to the department's Fire and Explosion Investigation Unit -- were ridiculously small. It turns out that there are a lot more, as we discovered when we contacted Connecticut's Department of Public Health and received its data on emergency room visits and hospital discharges classified as stemming from an accident caused by fireworks. Instead of just one injury per year in 2010 to 2014 as logged by the public safety department, the hospital data show an average of 35 people admitted to emergency rooms each year during that period. Their emergency room numbers, available going back to only 1996, show an average of 40.5 fireworks injuries per year through 1999. The number in 2000: 40. Basically there was no change in 2000 versus the average of the previous four years. That's a far cry from a 57-percent drop the year that sparklers were legalized, as Turner insisted, referring to a longer period for which we can’t find -- and he hasn’t provided -- any reliable data. The average since 2000: 43 emergency room injuries per year, which is actually a slight increase from the year when Connecticut legalized sparklers. We tried to add in the much smaller numbers for people whose injuries were serious enough to require hospitalization, using inpatient discharge data going back to 1991, the oldest available. But the state would not give us firm numbers for the years when inpatient discharges were 5 or fewer. But even when we assumed numbers most favorable to Turner, the reduction in 2000 wasn't even close. And if you look at subsequent years, the number of injuries have, on average, increased. Our ruling Fireworks lobbyist Eric Turner, contending that fireworks injuries decreased when sparklers are legalized, said that when Connecticut legalized sparklers and similar pyrotechnics in 2000, there was "a 57-percent decrease . . . . compared to the 14 years prior." While Turner stood up and shot off his mouth on Smith Hill, he wouldn’t respond to our repeated requests for information. And when we contacted the agency he cited in his testimony, we found the current database misses virtually all fireworks injuries. Finally, the most reliable source of information -- hospital records collected by the state health department -- shows no significant change in emergency room visits before and after sparklers and similar devices became legal. This incendiary claim is so wrong it rates a Pants on Fire. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-13566	"...Secret documents reveal that Iran could obtain a nuclear weapon far sooner than we were told. And Tammy Duckworth voted ‘yes’ (on the Iran nuclear deal)."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2016/aug/23/independent-voice-illinois-pac/anti-duckworth-super-pac-ad-goes-nuclear-iran-deal/	In a new television ad supporting U.S. Sen. Mark Kirk, the Independent Voice for Illinois PAC went after his opponent, U.S. Rep. Tammy Duckworth, D-Hoffman Estates. In the 30-second spot, a female narrator attacks Duckworth’s national security track record, slamming her for supporting the Iran nuclear deal. The ad portrays the Iran nuclear deal as a bad one and says recently unearthed information makes the deal even worse. The narrator says, "...Secret documents reveal that Iran could obtain a nuclear weapon far sooner than we were told. And Tammy Duckworth voted ‘yes’ (on the Iran nuclear deal)." The Politico Illinois Playbook said the spot is running in "Rockford and number of downstate markets, namely Peoria, Champaign and Springfield." Tammy Duckworth did vote yes for the Iran nuclear deal, officially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). That’s an established fact. But did secret documents reveal Iranians could have access to nuclear weapons earlier than the 15-year window outlined in the JCPOA? We took a look into the PAC’s claim to find out. Independent Voice for Illinois PAC First off, what is the Independent Voice for Illinois (IVFI) PAC? It’s what’s known as an independent expenditure PAC or a Super PAC. Independent expenditure PACs can raise and spend unlimited amounts of money in support of or in opposition to political candidates, but are prohibited from coordinating their activities with or donating directly to candidate campaigns. This means that Kirk would not have known about the IVFI ad before it appeared. There’s not much information out there on the group. But we did find the PAC’s treasurer Jo Merlau submitted its statement of organization in February 2015, according to the Federal Election Commission. The political research website Open Secrets shows IVFI has raised more than $1.6 million in 2016 with hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations coming from people like Chicago businessman Ken Griffin and New York hedge fund manager Paul Singer. Open Secrets also showed IVFI spent money on vendors supporting failed Republican presidential candidates John Kasich, Marco Rubio and Bobby Jindal. Notably, IVFI filed three independent expenditures in late July and early August with the FEC for media production. The payments went to the Washington, D.C., media firm Strategic Media Services, Inc., and the documents showed a media placement/media production order opposing Duckworth. Strategic Media Services did not return calls to confirm whether they were responsible for the ad. The Iran deal, the IVFI advertisement and the Associated Press Next, let’s look at the Iran nuclear deal. In the original document outlining the deal, the JCPOA never says it would allow Iran to build or obtain a nuclear weapon before the 15-year deal expires. In fact, the JCPOA says, "Iran reaffirms that under no circumstances will Iran ever seek, develop or acquire any nuclear weapons," and reiterates that point throughout the deal. The IVFI PAC video ad says secret documents that were leaked contain information about the Iran deal. An illustration in the video indicates they are referencing information reported in a July 18 article by the Associated Press. The Associated Press reported an unnamed source leaked unpublished information about an add-on agreement to the JCPOA. The source told the Associated Press members of Congress knew about the add-on agreement, but its contents never were made public. However, the Associated Press only references one confidential document in its story. The Associated Press, in fact, says this "confidential document is the only text linked to last year’s deal between Iran and six foreign powers that hasn’t been made public." IVFI’s ad incorrectly says there are multiple secret documents. That implied the federal government was hiding more information than was actually reported in the Associated Press story. Investigating the specific language of the IVFI ad reveals another discrepancy with the Associated Press story. The IVFI ad says "Iran could obtain a nuclear weapon far sooner than we were told," according to "secret documents." However, the Associated Press story never says that. The story says the leaked document revealed that Iran’s nuclear limitations will ease up earlier than what is outlined in the 15-year deal approved in January. It also says the internally negotiated deal would advance "Tehran's ability to build a bomb even before the end of the pact." Even though Iran will have the ability, it would not be allowed to create a fully completed weapon until the deal ends. The Associated Press goes further, saying the contents of the secret document give Iran fewer limits on installing more advanced centrifuges to churn uranium for the core of a nuclear weapon. However, the Associated Press explicitly says Iran’s ability to install these newer centrifuges doesn’t mean it would be allowed to build bombs before the 15-year pact ends. From the Associated Press story: (The centrifuge machines) will give Iran a huge potential boost in enrichment capacity, including bomb making should it choose to do so. But it can be put to use only after the deal expires. The story never reports Iran can obtain a nuclear weapon sooner than outlined in the JCPOA, as claimed in the IVFI advertisement. The secret document and the JCPOA The Associated Press story reveals the contents of a secret document showing an add-on agreement imposing fewer restrictions to the JCPOA. But Daniel Joyner, the director of international programs at the University of Alabama School of Law, says not so fast. "The (Associated Press) story isn’t wrong. It’s just a little misleading," he said. Joyner points out the contents of the leaked secret document aren’t much different from pages 6 and 7 of the JCPOA, which deals with centrifuge and uranium enrichment regulation. "You’ll see there that the commitments with regard to centrifuges last for 10 years, not for 15. So the confidential document, which discusses years 11-13, does not contradict the terms of the JCPOA. So why would anyone interpret this new information as something that conflicts with the JCPOA? "There are people out there who are out to kill (the JCPOA)," Joyner said. "The fact that it was from a confidential source throws up some red flags. There’s nothing contradictory in the leaked documents." Our ruling In their anti-Duckworth campaign ad, the Independent Voice for Illinois PAC says "...Secret documents reveal that Iran could obtain a nuclear weapon far sooner than we were told. And Tammy Duckworth voted ‘yes.’ " Duckworth did vote in favor of the JCPOA, but the Independent Voice for Illinois PAC’s ad is still incorrect on several fronts. The advertisement indicates there are multiple documents. But according to the Associated Press story the ad references, there is only one secret document. The ad also says these "secret documents" would allow Iran to obtain a nuclear weapon sooner than we were told. This, too, is incorrect. The document explains the secret agreement would boost uranium enrichment capacity, but never says Iran would be able to obtain a weapon sooner. Finally, an expert told PolitiFact Illinois that there is actually no contradiction between the main agreement and the secret document, just a bit more detail.

pomt-13802	"There are at least twice as many licensed firearm dealers in California as there are McDonald’s."	true	/california/statements/2016/jul/19/safety-all-initiative/its-no-whopper-licensed-gun-dealers-outnumber-mcdo/	Gun control advocates make a lot of claims about how easy it is to get a firearm in America. "We flood communities with so many guns that it is easier for a teenager to buy a Glock than get his hands on a computer or even a book," President Barack Obama said last week at a memorial service for five officers slain by a sniper in Dallas, Texas. PolitiFact rated the president’s claim Mostly False, noting it was a flawed comparison that relied on anecdotal rather than hard evidence. In California, Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom is among the state’s biggest gun control backers. He led the campaign to place Proposition 63, known as the Safety For All Initiative, on the state’s November ballot. It would require instant background checks for ammunition purchases; strengthen checks for gun purchases and ban the possession of large, detachable military-style magazines; and require the immediate surrender of firearms for people convicted of serious and violent crimes. The Safety For All campaign made a recent statement about the prevalence of gun dealers in California. It’s a colorful claim like Obama’s, but has a bit more hard data to back it up. "There are at least twice as many licensed firearm dealers in California as there are McDonald’s," the campaign’s spokesman said in recent email. PolitiFact Georgia rated a similar claim in 2013 as Mostly True. A civil rights activist said: "There are twice as many gun shops as McDonald’s in the United States." Our California claim deals with licenses in this state only, and not necessarily brick-and-mortar gun shops. With our appetite piqued, we decided to dig into this fast-food-meets-firearms platter. Golden Arches Not surprisingly, there are many places in California to get a Big Mac -- more than a thousand, according to several sources. The American Enterprise Institute and the Foundation for Economic Education reported in April that, at that time, there were 1,165 McDonald’s in California. A Cal State Northridge study cited the same figure. A McDonald’s spokeswoman could not immediately confirm that figure. The company’s website, however, puts its nationwide restaurant total at more than 14,000. Assuming 1,165 is correct for California, there would need to be at least 2,330 licensed gun dealers in the state to make the campaign’s statement correct. Photo by Mike Mozart / Flickr Gun dealers To be licensed in California, gun dealers must obtain both state and federal permits; be 21 or older; pay a $200 application fee; have a valid address; and undergo criminal and credit background checks. They don’t necessarily need a commercial storefront. Pinpointing the number of licensed gun dealers in the state is not simple. The Safety For All campaign referred us to data collected by the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. The ATF keeps a monthly log on its website of how many dealers and pawnbrokers are licensed to sell guns in each state. This month’s tally shows 2,315 dealers and pawnbrokers licensed to sell guns in California. That’s a shade less, 15 in fact, than twice as many McDonald’s. But the Safety For All campaign spokesman asserted there are hundreds more people authorized to sell guns in California, under different federal license categories. Other categories Those extra federal categories include 521 licensed firearms manufacturers and 74 licensed firearms importers in California. Roger Root, who oversees firearm license investigations for the ATF in Northern California, said those nearly 600 licensed manufacturers and importers are, in fact, federally authorized to deal guns, even if they’re not technically called ‘dealers.’ "We don’t require that they get an additional (federal) license," Root said. "You are also allowed, in essence, to deal firearms." That would bump the number of people licensed to sell guns in California closer to 2,900, more than twice as many McDonald’s. There's one wrinkle. About 5 percent or less of federal license holders, in all firearms categories, never go on to obtain an equivalent state firearms license required by the California Department of Justice, Root said. But taking 5 percent away from the 2,900, would still leave far more than twice as many McDonald’s. Our rating Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom’s Safety For All Initiative campaign recently claimed: "There are at least twice as many licensed firearm dealers in California as there are McDonald’s." Firearms license data tracked by the ATF show there are currently 2,315 authorized firearms dealers and pawnbrokers in the state. Two other categories authorized to deal firearms bring the total closer to 2,900, which is far more than double the 1,165 Golden Arches in California. A small fraction of the federal licensees never obtain their equivalent California permit. So, the total could be somewhat less than 2,900, but still enough to validate the statement. We rated the claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there's nothing significant missing.

pomt-05134	"Now, in the House of Representatives, we have 40 different jobs bills that have passed and almost all of them have been bipartisan."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/jun/22/frank-guinta/us-rep-frank-guinta-claims-bipartisan-support-jobs/	There is plenty of blame to go around for the government’s failure to create jobs, according to U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta. But little of it falls on Congress, the New Hampshire Republican said last week as he filed for re-election. "It is frustrating. Now, in the House of Representatives, we have 40 different jobs bills that have passed and almost all of them have been bipartisan," Guinta said June 13, 2012 after he filed his re-election papers with the N.H. Secretary of State. "That’s significant." It’s not hard to believe that Congress passed 40 jobs bills during the 2011-12 session. But, with all the partisan gridlock coming out of Washington, are a majority of them really bipartisan? We decided to check the Congressional voter rolls. First, we went first to Guinta’s office, which identified a list of jobs-related bills that have passed the House as part of the House Republicans’ Plan for American Job Creators. The list, published on House Majority Leader Eric Cantor’s website, includes 42 pieces of legislation proposing to rework the country’s tax code, to repeal business regulations and to increase access to energy, among other actions. We are well aware that the two parties define "jobs bills" differently, due to philosophical differences about what sorts of policies are useful for expanding jobs. (We address this question here.) However, for this item, we will use Cantor’s list while acknowledging that it’s not the final word on what constitutes a jobs bill. Of the total 42 bills, 11 of which were signed into law by President Barack Obama, at least 38 received some level of support from both parties, according to searches of THOMAS, the Library of Congress’ searchable database. Vote totals for two of the bills were unavailable. Some bills, including H.R. 2433, the Veterans Opportunity to Work Act, drew strong support from both sides of the aisle; 235 Republican votes and 183 from Democrats. And, H.R. 3606, the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, earned support from 232 Republicans and 183 Democrats. Both bills have become law. But other proposals drew only a handful of votes from the minority party. H.R. 10, the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act, for instance, passed the House with 237 Republican votes and four Democratic votes. And, H.R. 658, the FAA Transportation Modernization & Safety Improvement Act, passed with 221 Republican votes and only two from Democrats. The transportation act was signed into law, while the regulations act has stalled in the Senate. Further, the Fiscal Year 2012 and 2013 budget proposals, known as the Ryan budget plans, both passed the House without any Democratic support. So, this begs the question, what makes a bill bipartisan? In Guinta’s view, bipartisan legislation means any bill that reflects the interests of members of both parties. "Bipartisanship is being able to stay true to your principles, while finding common ground to work together on issues you can find agreement on," Derek Dufrense, Guinta’s legislative assistant, wrote in an email statement. This definition has been used for decades by politicians looking to tout their bipartisan credentials. But, political scientists, analysts and journalists take a different view. Though there is no formal definition for a bipartisan bill, many political scientists defer to the terms defined by Congressional Quarterly Roll Call, the Washington publication group which has long tracked partisan bills as those that receive support from less than 50 percent of both parties, which would be at least 121 votes from Republicans and 85 votes from Democrats. "If you take the inverse, that gives you a good sense of how partisan things are," said David Hawkings, editor of CQ’s Daily Briefing. "When I first came to town 25 years ago, you wouldn’t refer to something as having a bipartisan tone to it unless it had a few dozen members of both party. Today, you hear ‘bipartisan’ when there’s only five, six members of the minority party," Hawkings said. "That’s the new reality." Under the CQ terms, six of the 42 jobs bills meet the publication’s 50 percent standard, earning votes from half the members of each party. They are: -- H.R. 2433 and H.R. 3606, referenced above. -- H. Res. 72, Review of Federal Regulations: 238 Republican votes, 153 Democrats -- H.R. 674, 3% Withholding Rule Repeal: 295 Republicans, 170 Democrats; passed the Senate, signed into law. -- H.R. 1249, the America Invents Act: 168 Republicans, 136 Democrats; passed the Senate, signed into law. -- H.R. 4105, Applying Countervailing Duty to Nonmarket Economy Countries: 294 Republicans, 176 Democrats; passed the Senate, signed into law. A 50 percent threshold is pretty high in today's polarized environment, but even if you reduce it to at least 25 percent support from both parties, only 10 bills qualified. "There are a number of ways you could talk about it, but having only a handful of members of the opposite party, that seems like a big, big stretch," said James Pigg, director of the Waggonner Center for Bipartisan Politics and Public Policy at Louisiana Tech University. "I’d have a hard time calling that bipartisan." Our ruling: Guinta claims that "in the House of Representatives, we have 40 different jobs bills that have passed and almost all of them have been bipartisan." The House of Representatives has indeed passed more than 40 bills that Republicans consider jobs legislation. But whether they are truly "bipartisan" depends on your definition. Thirty-eight of them had support from at least one Democrat. But, according to political analysts, one vote does not a bipartisan bill make. Political analysts and academics alike commonly refer to Congressional Quarterly’s definition of a bipartisan bill as one that receives majority support from both parties. Only a fraction of the 42 bills referenced by Guinta meet that standard -- six to be exact. And even if you lower the threshold to 25 percent, it's only 10 bills. Guinta makes a sweeping claim that suggests broad support for nearly every bill. But in fact, the levels for bipartisanship are pretty skimpy. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-10350	John McCain has given erratic and inconsistent answers on when troops should return from Iraq.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/11/democratic-national-committee/ad-takes-most-of-mccain-quotes-out-of-context/	A new Web ad from the Democratic National Committee portrays John McCain as giving wildly different opinions on when U.S. troops can leave Iraq. The ad begins, "When Will John McCain Bring Our Troops Home? Depends on When You Ask." It then shows seven edited clips of McCain speaking, saying things like, "Four or five years … five or six years … another year to a year and a half … maybe 100 … that's not too important." ( View the ad here .) A fever line tracks the years on a chart while ominous music plays in the background. We decided to examine the transcripts of McCain's comments and see if he did give the many varied withdrawal dates that the ad claims. We found several problems with the way the ad portrays McCain's statements. In one case, he's not talking about troop withdrawal at all. In the "100 years" remark, he was talking about a permanent peacetime force similar to what the United States now has in Japan and South Korea. And the "not too important" comment is also taken significantly out of context. Let's take the ad's points one by one and examine the context of the McCain interviews to see where the ad gets it right and where it gets it wrong. • From the ABC News show "Nightline," Oct. 1, 2003: Question: "Over a course of how many years?" McCain: "Four or five years." This quote comes from an interview between Ted Koppel and John McCain, but the "four or five years" quote has nothing to do with U.S. troops. Instead, the show, which aired seven months after the initial invasion, focused on the costs of rebuilding Iraq. Koppel's report was skeptical of a claim from a Bush administration official that U.S. taxpayers would only be on the hook for $1.7 billion in reconstruction costs. (He was right to be suspicious; a 2007 GAO estimate put the reconstruction price tag at $40 billion and counting). Koppel interviewed McCain for his views on rebuilding costs, and even then McCain disputed the Bush administration claim. Here's a fuller excerpt from the interview: McCain: "I think there (were) many of us, in fact, most of us that believed that the military part would be the easy part. And reconstruction and rebuilding Iraq would be the hard part. But I have to also tell you, we did not realize the state of total deterioration of the Iraqi infrastructure. We didn't appreciate how much Saddam Hussein had let everything go to hell. I knew it was going to be very tough. I didn't know until I went over there how much it was going to be. And may I say, it's going to be a lot more than $20 billion before we're through." Koppel: "Do you have a sense of how much more?" McCain: "Estimates I hear as much as $50 to $55 billion more." Koppel: "Over a course of how many years?" McCain: "Four or five years." Koppel never addresses the question of troops, deployments or withdrawal in this interview. We looked for other McCain statements at this time, and found that in most cases he was actually urging the Bush administration to send more troops to Iraq to maintain order and security there. A few weeks before his interview with Koppel, a reporter on CNN asked him how long troops would have to be in Iraq to secure a true victory. McCain replied: "I don't know, because I don't know how quickly we're going to act in the form of sending troops. I don't know how quickly we're going to be able to provide them with the security. So, it's sort of up to us." • From MSNBC's "Hardball," Feb. 25, 2004: McCain: "Listen, my friend, we're going to be there for five or six years." This exchange more fairly represents McCain's views, though his remarks aren't strictly about deployments. He seems to be more talking about how long troops will have to actively maintain order to help a newly formed government establish itself. After discussing that prospect, host Chris Matthews asked, "What's the role of the U.S. military once we get a government out there?" McCain: "We'll still be there for security purposes. Listen, my friend, we're going to be there for five or six years. A little straight talk: We're going to have to be there for quite a while." Matthews: "And we have to defend the government?" McCain: "We will try to maintain security. There's just too many bad elements both from outside and from within." • From CBS News' "The Early Show," Feb. 3, 2005: McCain: "If I had to guess, I would think that it's going to be at least another year to a year and a half..." In this interview, Hannah Storm asks John McCain specifically about a withdrawal timetable. This snippet appears to be a fair presentation of McCain's views. Here's the fuller exchange: Storm: "What is a realistic timetable here? When would you like to see our troops leave?" McCain: "Tomorrow. But I think that if I had to guess, I would think that it's going to be at least another year to a year and a half. But hopefully before then we could have our troops out of a lot of the areas where they're vulnerable to casualties. And the Iraqi American-trained law enforcement--their armed forces with U.S. troops embedded in them -- could take over much more of the responsibilities. That will reduce the casualty levels. Let me just remind you, Hannah, we're got troops in Bosnia; we've got them in Kosovo; we've been in South Korea for 50 years. Americans are not upset about that. They're upset when young Americans are wounded and killed." Storm: "So you're saying our troops could potentially be there for decades then, Senator?" McCain: "I don't think decades because I don't think that the Iraqis want American troops staying, but I think we'll be there for a while and the Iraqi government appreciates that as well." • From NBC News' "Meet the Press," June 19, 2005. McCain: "I'd rather say two or three years, and be surprised a year from now." The questioning in this interview was about the training of Iraqi forces, not troop withdrawal. The time frame McCain mentions is when Iraqi troops will be fully trained, thought it's fair to say that the readiness of Iraqi troops is a pre-condition for U.S. withdrawal. Here's the full exchange between McCain and moderator Tim Russert. Russert: "Our only exit strategy is to have enough Iraqis who are willing to defend their country, spill their own blood, so that we can withdraw. How many security forces do you believe the Iraqis have right now that are fully capable of fighting and defending their nation?" McCain: "I don't know the answer. I know the number is increasing. … But I believe that there has been some improvement, and that improvement gives us, at least, some hope. Because, as you say, and everybody knows, the exit strategy from Iraq is not a time or a date. The exit strategy from Iraq is clearly the Iraqis being able to take over the responsibilities and the casualties, for policing and ensuring security in their own country. Look, nobody cares--in fact, I'm kind of glad that American troops are in South Korea. Why? Because there's no Americans in combat. So it's not a matter of time and date of withdrawal. It's a matter of Iraqis being able to assume the responsibilities for the security of their own nation. And, again, I think we should tell people it's not going to be a short--I'd rather say two or three years, and be surprised a year from now, than say, 'Everything's fine,' and then be disappointed a year or two from now." • From a town hall meeting in Concord, N.H., Jan. 3, 2008: Question: President Bush is talking about our staying in Iraq for 50 year..." McCain: "Maybe a hundred." We've looked at this claim previously; McCain's opponents have hammered him before for this statement, but its clear from the context that McCain is not urging a 100-year war. Rather, once combat ends and there are no more U.S. casualties, he expects the United States could have troops in Iraq similar to the presence in South Korea and Japan. That presence could continue for many years, according to McCain. Here's the full exchange McCain had with a voter at a town hall meeting: Question: "President Bush has talked about our staying in Iraq for 50 years — " McCain: "Maybe a hundred." Question: "Is that — " McCain: "We've been in South Korea . . . we've been in Japan for 60 years. We've been in South Korea for 50 years or so. That would be fine with me. As long as Americans are not being injured or harmed or wounded or killed, that's fine with me. I hope that would be fine with you, if we maintain a presence in a very volatile part of the world where al Qaeda is training and equipping and recruiting and motivating people every single day." • From a McCain speech on May 15, 2008: McCain: "By January 2013, America has welcomed home most of the servicemen and women who have sacrificed terribly." This appears to be a fair representation of McCain's views; it comes from a major policy speech he gave on what he hopes to accomplish during a first term. Here's a longer excerpt on the portion of his speech about Iraq: "By January 2013, America has welcomed home most of the servicemen and women who have sacrificed terribly so that America might be secure in her freedom. The Iraq War has been won. Iraq is a functioning democracy, although still suffering from the lingering effects of decades of tyranny and centuries of sectarian tension. Violence still occurs, but it is spasmodic and much reduced. Civil war has been prevented; militias disbanded; the Iraqi Security Force is professional and competent; al Qaeda in Iraq has been defeated; and the Government of Iraq is capable of imposing its authority in every province of Iraq and defending the integrity of its borders. The United States maintains a military presence there, but a much smaller one, and it does not play a direct combat role." • From NBC News' "Today Show," June 11, 2008: Question: "Do you now have a better estimate of when American forces can come home from Iraq?" McCain: "No, but that's not too important." This is edited to seem like McCain doesn't care about when troops come home. But judging from what McCain said next, he meant it wasn't too important if troops were in Iraq as long as the fighting was over and there were few casualties. Here's McCain's complete answer: "No. But that's not too important. What's important is the casualties in Iraq. Americans are in South Korea, Americans are in Japan, American troops are in Germany. That's all fine. American casualties and the ability to withdraw. We will be able to withdraw. General Petraeus is going to tell us in July when he thinks we are. But the key to it is we don't want any more Americans in harm's way. And that way they will be safe and serve our country, and come home with honor and victory, not in defeat, which is what Senator Obama's proposal would have done. And I'm proud of them and they're doing a great job, and we are succeeding. And it's fascinating that Senator Obama still doesn't realize that." So while the DNC ad gets some of its points accurate, it purposefully edits McCain's remarks to distort them in at least three instances (the Nightline interview, the "100 years" remark and the "not too important remark"). Two of the instances (the "Hardball" interview and the "Meet the Press" interview) are borderline; his comments address issues that affect withdrawal but aren't precisely on point. Two instances ("The Early Show" interview and McCain's speech) are fair and accurate representations of his views. While the ad is right on two items, and partially right on two items, three of the quotes are out of context and distort McCain's original meaning. This weakens the DNC's case against McCain significantly. We rate the DNC's argument that McCain has given inconsistent and erratic answers on when troops should return from Iraq Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01603	Says Rick Scott has "teamed up with a felon convicted of running a Ponzi scheme to smear Charlie Crist."	false	/florida/statements/2014/sep/02/charlie-crist/crist-says-rick-scott-teamed-ponzi-schemer-scott-r/	The Republican Party of Florida attacked former Gov. Charlie Crist in a TV ad alleging that he let Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein pick judicial appointments in exchange for campaign donations. Crist’s campaign fired back with its own ad Aug. 18 that included a slew of attacks on Scott, including this one: "Now he’s teamed up with a felon convicted of running a Ponzi scheme to smear Charlie Crist with false attacks." The text on the screen states "Rothstein gets 50 years in $1.2 billion Ponzi scheme." Crist’s ad shows a photo of a grinning Rothstein wearing luxury watches and attributes that to an ABC News story from June 2010 when Rothstein was convicted. The Republicans’ ad about Rothstein used the same image. While the photo of Rothstein remains on the screen, the text of the ad says: "Scott Rothstein bought expensive things" and then the text on the screen says "FALSE ATTACKS." (The small print refers to a Sun-Sentinel article about an auction of Rothstein's possessions.) That’s a whole lot of Rothstein mash-up going on for viewers. For nearly five years, media reports have outlined how Rothstein donated generously to a long list of politicians including Crist. But this was the first we had heard of an allegation about Scott teaming up with Rothstein, so we decided to check it out. In fact, there is no evidence that Scott and Rothstein have literally "teamed up" -- what Crist is referring to is the Republican Party using the Rothstein scandal to attack Crist. The evidence that Crist cited in his ad backup was simply a news report about Rothstein’s conviction. "Ponzi schemer's words + Rick Scott's money = teaming up," Brendan Gilfillan told PolitiFact Florida in an email. Here’s the backstory on Rothstein’s connection to Crist: Rothstein was a big campaign donor to Crist and the Republican Party back when Crist was still a Republican. And Crist did put Rothstein on a panel that recommended some appeals court judges. Rothstein testified that he gave money and in exchange directed Crist’s judicial picks to the appeals bench in West Palm Beach and the Broward bench. However, we found no hard evidence that proved Rothstein dictated Crist’s picks, so we rated that claim Half True. Rothstein exited Florida politics, and then Scott entered As soon as the news surfaced about the investigation into Rothstein, the long line of politicians and political entities opening their arms to receive his donations screeched to a halt. In fact, many of them gave the money back. Scott had the good fortune to avoid Rothstein due to his timing: He entered his first race for governor in April 2010. By that date, Rothstein was behind bars and no longer a mega-campaign donor. Federal authorities revealed they were investigating Rothstein’s scheme in November 2009 and arrested him Dec. 1, 2009. He was sentenced to 50 years in prison in June 2010. Rothstein and his firm had given generously to candidates and politicians in both parties: as much as $3 million to local, state, federal candidates and political entities between 2005 and 2009. That included donations to Crist, the Republican Party of Florida and the Florida Democratic Party. So where was Scott during Rothstein’s scheme? Scott was a Republican millionaire businessman in Naples who built his career around the health care industry. Scott was forced out of the company he formed, Columbia/HCA, in 1997 amid lawsuits over Medicare billing practices that ultimately led to a $1.7 billion federal fine. In 2001, Scott cofounded Solantic Corp., a chain of walk-in urgent care centers he would later sell after he became governor. In 2009, Scott used $5 million of his own money to form Conservatives for Patients Rights to fight Obama’s health care reform. In 2010, he ran for governor. We asked Scott's campaign if Scott had ever crossed paths with Rothstein and did not get a response, but we could find no evidence that they had ever met. Our ruling Crist’s TV ad says Rick Scott has "teamed up with a felon convicted of running a Ponzi scheme to smear Charlie Crist with false attacks." This ad is vague and confusing. Scott hasn’t teamed up with Ponzi schemer Rothstein -- he was arrested in December 2009 and Scott entered his first race for governor in April 2010. The only kind of teaming up that happened is that the Republican Party of Florida made a TV ad attacking Crist for his connections to Rothstein in an ad that PolitiFact Florida rated Half True. Teaming up implies that Scott and Rothstein are in cahoots, and we’re not aware of any evidence that they crossed paths. When Scott announced his first campaign in April 2010, Rothstein had already been arrested and was awaiting sentencing. We rate this claim False.

pomt-07641	Federal spending is "all discretionary, other than interest on the national debt. Social Security is discretionary. We have the discretion to change the law. Same is true with Medicare and Medicaid."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/15/george-will/george-will-says-all-federal-spending-ultimately-d/	Members of Congress are actively working to cut the federal budget and bring down spending. But they’re steering clear of the politically difficult, big-ticket items such as Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, interest on the debt and national defense. "It's not being debated because they say we're only going to debate discretionary spending. We should ban that word," said conservative commentator George F. Will on This Week with Christiane Amanpour. "It's all discretionary, other than interest on the national debt. Social Security is discretionary. We have the discretion to change the law. Same is true with Medicare and Medicaid," Will said. We thought Will’s statement was a provocative and interesting way to frame the debate. But was it true? We decided to check it out. We’ll begin with a brief lesson on the terms Congress uses to describe the federal budget. Discretionary spending means government spending that Congress sets every year through a process known as appropriations. It includes spending for most federal agencies, such as transportation and health. It includes foreign aid and defense spending. And it includes most grant programs administered by the federal government. Non-discretionary spending, on the other hand, is spending that is controlled by legislation that sets eligibility criteria or spending formulas. It includes entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security in which you are legally entitled to benefits as long as you meet certain criteria. It also typically includes programs for which individuals automatically qualify, such as farm subsidies or military benefits. Sometimes non-discretionary spending is called mandatory spending or direct spending. We ran Will’s comments by four experts on the federal budget. They all said that Will was essentially correct, that non-discretionary spending can be changed at any time by passing new legislation that changes the particular program. A recent example of this is the health care law supported by President Obama and Democrats in Congress. The law made many changes to Medicare, to reduce its spending, in order to offer subsidies for health care insurance to the uninsured. "There is no constitutional roadblock to Congress changing any spending at any time. In that sense, all spending is discretionary," said Marc Goldwein, policy director for the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The reasons members of Congress are now so focused on discretionary spending is because it’s more politically difficult to change programs that affect benefits for so many voters. "But you can’t stabilize the debt by focusing on only 12 percent of the budget," Goldwein added. "Trying to do so is going to make the cuts far more painful than what would be necessary if we were to look more broadly." Both Medicare and Social Security were on the table in previous years when the budget needed adjustment, said the experts we consulted on both sides of the political aisle. Jim Horney of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities noted that "every major deficit reduction plan in the last 20 years has made significant changes to Medicare." Brian Riedl of the conservative Heritage Foundation pointed out that Social Security was changed significantly in 1983 in a deal between Democrats in Congress and President Ronald Reagan. Interest on the federal debt is a required payment unless the government is willing to default, a highly unlikely scenario. There are a few other contractually obligated payments the government has to make, typically for insurance programs such as mortgage insurance, flood insurance, and federal deposit insurance. But those payments are relatively small. "I would add that even interest on the debt is in some way discretionary, because levels of debt can be changed by decisions to tax and spend and not run budget deficits," said Josh Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan group that wants to eliminate deficits. Will said that federal spending is "all discretionary, other than interest on the national debt. Social Security is discretionary. We have the discretion to change the law. Same is true with Medicare and Medicaid." Will is making a broad statement here and leaves out a few details. But he’s largely correct, and we rate his statement True.

pomt-09052	He "stood up to Barack Obama by passing legislation that prevents you from being forced to join government health plans or buy health insurance against your will."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/01/judson-hill/state-senator-said-hes-fighting-obama-health-care/	State Sen. Judson Hill told voters he entered the ring against President Barack Obama and won. The Marietta Republican is running for re-election in a contest that is already knee-deep in mud. Hill fired back with a mailer that reminded his constituents about early voting and announced that "Senator Judson Hill Is Standing Up To Barack Obama's Socialist Healthcare." "Judson Hill is leading the charge," the mailer said. "This year Judson stood up to Barack Obama by passing legislation that prevents you from being forced to join government health plans or buy health insurance against your will." Hill's mailer referred to his work on Senate Bill 411, which was signed into law June 2. The bill bans any law that requires individuals to purchase health insurance. Such a mandate was a crucial element of federal health care legislation passed this spring. But did Hill really score an Obama K.O.? Does the state law really prevent you from "being forced to join government health plans"? Republicans spent months in Congress unsuccessfully arguing that Democrats' health efforts would infringe upon individual liberties and hurt the quality of care. Now the battleground has moved to the states. Governors and legislators across the nation are working to pass measures that prevent the health care overhaul from taking effect inside their borders. Some filed a suit against the federal government in March that Georgia joined in May. Hill labored for much of this year's legislative session on the Georgia effort. First, he sponsored Senate Resolution 794, which would have amended the state constitution to let Georgians opt out of federally mandated health care. When that effort failed, Hill tried to amend state law by sponsoring SB 317, which stated that "no law or rule or regulation shall compel any person, employer, or health care provider to participate in any health care system." This bill passed in the Senate but withered in the House. Hill's effort succeeded after language from SB 317 was added to SB 411, the Healthy Georgians Act of 2010, which was originally proposed to change the regulation of wellness plans. It was signed into law June 2. SB 411 would -- in theory -- block a provision of the federal health care overhaul that requires most U.S. citizens and legal residents to have health care coverage by 2014 or be subject to a tax. This is often called an "individual mandate" for health insurance. But it's not clear whether the new law has any teeth. Its fate rests on constitutional issues that go well beyond this state. The Hill campaign acknowledged as much. The mandate doesn't go into effect for about four years, and a lot of things can change before then. "A lot of it is sort of a waiting game," said Jeremy Brand, a spokesman for the campaign. Other proponents agree. The American Legislative Exchange Council, which advocates for free markets and limited government, is coordinating the nationwide effort for states to enact legislation and constitutional amendments blocking the mandate. It assisted with drafting and researching the Georgia bill, said Christie Herrera, director of ALEC's Health and Human Services Task Force. Hill is a task force member. The bill is designed to position Georgia to fight the individual mandate by giving it standing in an ongoing lawsuit filed in March by multiple states' attorneys general against the federal health care legislation, Herrera said. If that challenge is unsuccessful, the bill would open the door for Georgia to file its own suit arguing the law violates the 10th Amendment, which defines states' rights. And if all else fails, the bill makes it possible for the state attorney general to sue after the mandate goes into effect in 2014 on behalf of Georgians he or she thinks were harmed by the individual mandate. "I would say that there is never a guarantee of success when a state challenges the federal government. However, to the extent that the state Legislature can stop the federal individual mandate, then SB 411 is the best possible defense," Herrera said in an e-mail to PolitiFact Georgia. Backers of Georgia's efforts think a constitutional challenge may succeed, but this opinion is far from unanimous. A February article in The New England Journal of Medicine written by a legal scholar calls the success of a constitutional challenge "very unlikely" because the court would have to reject "decades of precedents." Larry Palmer, a specialist in health law and policy with the College of William & Mary in Williamsburg, Va., said in a March article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that state action will likely have little impact because the federal government has "extremely broad" power to provide incentives and disincentives through the tax code. State Attorney General Thurbert Baker declined to join the multistate suit because he thought the lawsuit would fail and waste taxpayers' money. Georgia only joined the suit after Gov. Sonny Perdue found a team of attorneys willing to fight the federal legislation at no cost to the state. While it's true that SB 411 did stand up to the Obama-backed health care overhaul, it's far from clear that the law can actually be enforced. There is a chance that the bill, in the future, will allow Georgians to opt out of federal health care requirements. But for now, that pronouncement is premature. We rate Hill's claim Half True.

pomt-15000	"When we had a conservative Republican president we were losing 750,000 jobs a month."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/11/debbie-wasserman-schultz/wasserman-schultz-under-conservative-republican-pr/	It’s been nearly eight years since George W. Bush was president, but Democrats still plan to run against him. Certainly, that’s what Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz promised on the eve of the first Democratic presidential debate. "There are so many people who are focused on making sure we can look at the fact that, when we had a conservative Republican president, we were losing 750,000 jobs a month," Wasserman Schultz said on CNN’s State of the Union Oct. 11, 2015. "We’ve come through that -- 67 straight months of job growth in the private sector. People are no longer losing their homes. That’s the contrast we’ll talk about." The DNC press office told us that Wasserman Schultz was thinking of President George W. Bush, and that the time period she had in mind were the last few months of his presidency, November through January. President Barack Obama took office on Jan. 20, 2009, so it’s reasonable to count that month as part of the Bush legacy. We pulled up the Bureau of Labor Statistics numbers and Wasserman Schultz is on solid ground. Month Jobs (000’s) Loss Nov 135,469 -765 Dec 134,773 -696 Jan 133,977 -796 Average -752 Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Current Employment Statistics Benchmark comparison The number is particularly high because Wasserman Schultz chose the three worst months of the Bush presidency. If she had chosen a longer period, say the last full year, the losses would have averaged about 365,000 per month. The losses would shrink even more if you look at longer period of time. Wasserman Schultz didn’t mention that the economy continued to shed jobs at or above the 700,000 mark for the first two months of Obama’s presidency before the trend began to ease. This chart from the Bureau of Labor Statistics gives a more complete jobs picture. The Great Recession saw employment declines of historic proportions. Government analysts compared the relative losses from 2007 to 2009 to past downturns. The bottom purple line on their chart tracks jobs in the Great Recession which officially began December 2007. Of course, Wasserman Schultz’s statement implies that conservative Republican policies alone brought about a massive loss of jobs and the reality is more complicated. Some analysts believe that a portion of the blame goes back to policies that enjoyed Democratic support, including changes in financial regulation passed during the Clinton administration. But Wasserman Schultz did not make that claim specifically. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said that under a conservative Republican president the country was losing 750,000 jobs a month. Wasserman Schultz was speaking of President George W. Bush and at the end of his term, the monthly job losses averaged about 750,000 jobs. The average would of course be less if she had included Bush’s final 12 months -- or a period longer than that. There is an element of cherry-picking here, but the overall point holds up.

pomt-08225	"The (federal) debt is growing by more than $4 billion a day."	true	/texas/statements/2010/nov/17/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-says-national-debt-increasing-more-/	In his book Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington, Gov. Rick Perry calls the federal debt "too overwhelming to comprehend." "The national debt is already more than $13.4 trillion," he writes. "For perspective, that is over $43,000 per man, woman and child in America. Worse yet, the debt is growing by more than $4 billion a day." Or more than $2.7 million a minute and more than $46,000 per second. Yikes. Is Perry's call right? A footnote in Perry's book cites a Bloomberg news article that says "the budget deficit will be $1.5 trillion next year... higher than previous Obama administration forecasts because of a recession that was deeper and longer than expected, White House budget chief Peter Orszag said." (The book incorrectly says the article was written Aug. 25, 2010; it was last updated online Aug. 25, 2009.) The public debt is the sum of each year's spending deficits. Most years we spend more than we take in, and we have to make up that gap by borrowing. Clinton announced a surplus in September 1998 — the first U.S. budget surplus in 29 years. Federal budgets were balanced in both fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2000, and 2001 was the last year we had a surplus. That wasn't the expectation of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which issued this cheerful report in 2002: "The outlook for the federal budget over the next decade continues to be bright. Assuming that current tax and spending policies are maintained, the Congressional Budget Office projects that mounting federal revenues will continue to outstrip spending and produce growing budget surpluses for the next 10 years." At the time, the CBO estimated $5.6 trillion in surpluses by 2011. But we digress — back to the grimmer future. Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier also pointed us to the CBO's March 2010 analysis of President Barack Obama's budget proposals for fiscal year 2011. "The CBO projected the same (debt) figure around the time the book was being compiled," she said. The CBO found that if Obama's proposals — including the health care overhaul — were enacted, the federal government's deficits would total $1.5 trillion in fiscal year 2010 (which ended Sept. 30) and $1.3 trillion in 2011. Divide the CBO's projected addition of $1.5 trillion in debt in 2010 by the 365 days in a year, and you have about $4.1 billion in debt each day. And the $1.3 trillion in 2011? About $3.6 billion each day. What does that tell us? Josh Gordon, policy director at the Concord Coalition, a group that advocates fiscal responsibility, agreed that people have a hard time wrapping their heads around trillions of dollars of public debt. Also, Gordon cautioned against interpreting the per-day spending rate as as a reflection on Washington policy makers as opposed to the health of the economy. "We always like to measure debt as a percent of the economy, because as the economy grows, the key question is whether the debt is growing more slowly or more quickly," he said. That is, surging debt is worse if the economy is sagging. According to the CBO analysis noted by Perry's spokeswoman, the projected 2010 and 2011 deficits were expected to amount to 10.3 and 8.9 percent of the gross domestic product, respectively. "By comparison," the report says, "the deficit in 2009 totaled 9.9 percent of the GDP." The U.S. Treasury tracks a daily history of total public debt — to the penny. On Nov. 9, total public debt outstanding was $13,727,147,399,038.59 — about $13.7 trillion, according to the Treasury. That's up from $13,725,166,759,183.46 on Nov. 8, a difference of about $2 billion. And that's up $1.8 billion from Nov. 5. Finally, we chased more recent data since the CBO estimates that Perry cites were from March. In August, the CBO projected the 2011 deficit would be about $1.1 trillion — assuming tax cuts signed into law by then-President George W. Bush in 2001 expire at the end of the year. And on Oct. 7, the CBO estimated that the federal budget deficit was "slightly less than $1.3 trillion fiscal year 2010, down from slightly more than $1.4 trillion in 2009." That's a debt increase of about $3.5 billion and $3.8 billion per day, respectively. "Outlays were lower and revenues were higher than previously expected," the CBO's analysis says. Upshot: We think it's reasonable to pause where Perry's research team landed in March. At that time, the CBO estimated the government would record $1.5 trillion in debt for fiscal year 2010, which breaks down to about $4.1 billion per day, though (as we note) those figures have since ratcheted down a bit. We're persuaded too that a case could be made for paying closer attention to the shifting ratio of the debt to the GDP. Regardless, Perry's calculation was on target. We rate his statement as True.

pomt-12101	"At the PEAK of slavery in 1860, only 1.4% of Americans owned slaves. What your history books (don't) tell you is that 3,000 blacks owned a total of 20,000 slaves the same year."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/24/viral-image/viral-post-gets-it-wrong-extent-slavery-1860/	Confederate-themed posts are cropping up on social media in the wake of the Unite the Right march in Charlottesville, Va. The march was sparked by efforts to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee and included some marchers carrying Confederate symbols. One viral post sent to us by a reader said, "At the PEAK of slavery in 1860, only 1.4% of Americans owned slaves. What your history books doesn’t tell you is that 3,000 blacks owned a total of 20,000 slaves the same year." The post is signed, "Proud Southern Deplorable - Southern Rebel" and goes on to say, "If you're sick of the race baiting, please LIKE and SHARE." When we took a closer look, we found that the percentage of slaveholding families was dramatically higher than what the meme said, and that the number of slaves owned by blacks was presented in a misleading way. 'At the PEAK of Slavery in 1860, Only 1.4% of Americans owned slaves.' The primary source of data about slaves and slaveholding in 1860 is that year’s census. Census data from 1860 isn’t perfect, said University of North Carolina historian Joseph T. Glatthaar, author of Soldiering in the Army of Northern Virginia: A Statistical Portrait of the Troops Who Served under Robert E. Lee. But it remains "the best evidence we have." In the big picture, the 1860 Census counted a total of 31,443,321 people, of which 3,953,760 were slaves. So slaves accounted for 12.6 percent of the national population. However, to address the assertion in the post requires more detailed data. Many states had outlawed slavery by 1860, so the national population figure dilutes the measurement by including many Americans whose states did not allow them to own slaves. The national population figure also includes slaves and children, and it doesn’t account either for family groupings or how many slaves a given family owned. So experts say that a more accurate measure of slaveholding in 1860 America would focus on states that allowed slavery, and would zero in on family or household units, as a way of limiting the statistical noise caused by counting slaves and children. "The number that really matters is how many American households in the South had slaves," said Adam Goodheart, a Washington College historian and author of 1861: The Civil War Awakening. Using Census data to research his book, Glatthaar calculated that 4.9 percent of people in the slaveholding states owned slaves, that 19.9 percent of family units in those states owned slaves, and that 24.9 percent of households owned slaves. (Households are a broader category than families.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Each of these figures is significantly higher than the 1.4 percent cited in the social media post. State-by-state figures show some variation. In Mississippi, 49 percent of families owned slaves, and in South Carolina, 46 percent did. In border states, the percentage was lower -- 3 percent in Delaware and 12 percent in Maryland. The median for slaveholding states was about 27 percent. Using the same data, it's possible to calculate the statistic of dubious value cited in the viral image -- the percentage of all American families that owned slaves. The answer: 7.4 percent, which about five times greater than what the meme says. It's also possible that the Census data is misleadingly low, Goodheart said. "Many non-slaveholding whites in the South rented slaves from wealthier slaveholders," he said. "So it was very common for a white Southerner to be a 'slave master' but not technically a 'slave owner." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com '3,000 blacks owned a total of 20,000 slaves the same year.' We were unable to find hard data to debunk -- or support -- this figure. The most solid data we found was published in an article in the Root by Henry Louis Gates Jr., a Harvard University historian. Gates cited research by Carter G. Woodson, an African-American historian who died in 1950. He found that in 1830, a total of "3,776 free Negroes owned 12,907 slaves." With three more decades of population growth, it’s plausible that the number of black-owned slaves could have grown to 20,000 by 1860, historians told us. "I'd imagine that the (20,000 figure) quoted in the meme is probably not that far off from being true," said Junius Rodriguez, a Eureka College historian and author of Slavery in the United States: A Social, Political, and Historical Encyclopedia. But the 20,000 number is not necessarily as eye-popping as the meme makes it out to be. For starters, even if the number is accurate, it would still account for just a tiny percentage of all slaves held in the United States in 1860 -- specifically, one half of 1 percent. That runs contrary to the post’s framing. "That’s a very small number compared to Latin American or Caribbean societies," said Stephanie McCurry, a Columbia University historian and author of Confederate Reckoning: Power and Politics in the Civil War South. In addition, the figure is almost certainly inflated by a legal quirk in most antebellum southern states. It includes "many ‘owned’ family members whom they had purchased to become free," said Eric Foner, a Columbia University historian and the author of such books as The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery. "You could not free a slave in most southern states without sending them out of the state." Gates, writing in the Root, noted that the late historian Thomas J. Pressly used Woodson's statistics for 1830 to determine that about 42 percent of these black slaveholders owned just one slave. To Gates, this suggests that many -- though hardly all -- black "slaveholders" legally needed to "own" a family member such as a wife or child. As Woodson wrote in his 1924 book Free Negro Owners of Slaves in the United States in 1830, "In many instances the husband purchased the wife or vice versa. … Slaves of Negroes were in some cases the children of a free father who had purchased his wife. If he did not thereafter emancipate the mother, as so many such husbands failed to do, his own children were born his slaves and were thus reported to the numerators." In other cases, Woodson wrote, "Benevolent Negroes often purchased slaves to make their lot easier by granting them their freedom for a nominal sum, or by permitting them to work it out on liberal terms." Our ruling The viral post said that "at the PEAK of slavery in 1860, only 1.4% of Americans owned slaves. What your history books doesn’t tell you is that 3,000 blacks owned a total of 20,000 slaves the same year." In reality, far more than 1.4 percent of families in slaveholding states -- the most reasonable way to measure it -- owned slaves. The number was between 20 and 25 percent, and in some states, the rate was twice as high. As for black-owned slaves, they certainly existed, but they represented a tiny fraction of all slaves in the United States, and many were likely "owned" by their spouses or parents due to the prevailing laws in many slaveholding states.

pomt-14632	"I have not insulted Donald personally."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/28/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-said-he-never-insulted-donald-trump-recor/	During the Fox News-Google debate in Des Moines, Iowa, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said he’s taken the high road in his squabbling with fellow candidate -- and frontrunner -- Donald Trump. "I have not insulted Donald personally, and I don't intend to," Cruz said during the Jan. 28, 2016, debate. We wondered, is Cruz’s claim accurate? Not really. Cruz, who once had a warm relationship with Trump, has been increasingly taking jabs at him, ever since Trump attacked him for possibly not qualifying for the presidency (due to his birth in Canada) and for saying things like, "Ted is a nasty guy. People don't like him." (Cruz’s staff did not respond to an inquiry.) One attack line Cruz has used that might be considered a personal insult is that Trump embodies "New York values." During a previous GOP debate in North Charleston, S.C., moderator Maria Bartiromo pressed Cruz on his use of that line. The Texas senator doubled down. "You know, I think most people know exactly what New York values are," Cruz said. "I am from New York," Bartiromo said. "I don't." Cruz responded, "What? You're from New York? So you might not. But I promise you, in the state of South Carolina, they do." Later in the debate, Trump parried Cruz’s attack by citing the city’s response to the 9/11 attacks as examples of "New York values." Trump received plaudits from many observers for his counter-shot, but that didn’t stop Cruz from later releasing a television ad with the closing line, "Donald Trump: New York values. Not ours." Another example of a Cruz swipe at Trump: After Trump pulled out of the Des Moines debate, saying that Fox moderator Megyn Kelly was biased against him, Cruz mockingly referred to the businessman as "gentle Donald" at a West Des Moines event. "Apparently Mr. Trump considers Megyn Kelly very, very scary," Cruz continued. "And, you know, Donald is a fragile soul." He also said that debate questioning could make Trump’s hair "stand on end." Cruz also had a joke at Trump’s expense during an appearance at the Jackson County Fairgrounds in Iowa. Cruz referred to Trump’s earlier citation of "two Corinthians" in the Bible, rather than the more usual title, "Second Corinthians." Cruz joked, "Two Corinthians walk into a bar -- Ah, yes, Ricardo Montalban -- genuine Corinthian leather!" (Those Cruz’s age or older may recall the old Chrysler Cordoba commercials in which Montalban, the late, debonair actor, touted the car’s "Corinthian leather," which was actually a figment of the carmaker’s marketing imagination.) Then there’s the line Cruz used earlier in the very same Des Moines debate in which he made light of the absent Trump’s habit of insulting his fellow candidates: "Let me say I’m a maniac and everyone on this stage is stupid, fat and ugly. And Ben (Carson), you’re a terrible surgeon. Now that we’ve gotten the Donald Trump portion out of the way…." To be fair to Cruz, there’s a fuzzy line between making personal insults and fair-game critiques. And Todd J. Gillman has written in the Dallas Morning News that Cruz’s attacks "are sharp but indirect. And usually, he leaves enough wiggle room that Iowans believe him when he insists that he’s the one taking the high road, refraining from name-calling and personal insult." For instance, Gillman cited a comment Cruz made on the Christian Broadcasting Network, that "this election is not about any one person, any one individual who believes he or she will make America great. You know what, for seven years we’ve had a president in the White House who has had a Messiah complex." Gillman asked, "Did Cruz say Trump has a Messiah complex? Not exactly, but it definitely sounded that way." Our ruling Cruz said, "I have not insulted Donald personally." Determining what qualifies as an "insult" is somewhat in the eye of the beholder, but Cruz has certainly mocked Trump during several recent public appearances. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-13104	"The photonics bill that was sponsored in Congress and written, was written by Congressman Tom Reed, not Congresswoman Louise Slaughter."	false	/new-york/statements/2016/nov/04/mark-assini/photonics-funding-rochester-came-reed-bill/	U.S. Rep. Louise Slaughter, D- Fairport, often takes credit for a new photonics manufacturing institute coming to Rochester. But her Republican opponent for the 25th Congressional District seat says the credit belongs elsewhere. During a debate, Gates Town Supervisor Mark Assini credited a congressman from another district in New York State for securing the photonics funding. "The photonics bill that was sponsored in Congress and written, was written by Congressman Tom Reed, not Congresswoman Louise Slaughter," said Assini, a Republican. Reed, R-Corning, represents a congressional district south of Rochester. "There's about 100 co-sponsors on this bill, and guess whose name was not on that co-sponsorship list?" Assini asked. Slaughter replied that her work on the project took place several years before Reed introduced his bill in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. "So he didn’t have a thing in the world to do with it, didn’t even have it decide to be photonics and to have it come to Rochester," she said. So, who’s right? The photonics timeline Vice President Joseph R. Biden and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced the American Institute for Manufacturing Integrated Photonics in Rochester last year. When completed, the institute is expected to add hundreds of new jobs to the region. It’s one of the largest investments in Rochester by the state and federal governments in recent years. Assini does not dispute Slaughter supported the project, but he believes she had no part in the legislation that brought the institute to the region. In fact, there was no legislation that led to the photonics institute. It was the result of an Obama administration initiative to spur advanced manufacturing in the United States, largely funded out of existing Defense Department money. In 2012, the President’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology issued a report with its recommendations for boosting manufacturing investment and innovation. Among those recommendations: a "national network of innovation institutes." In response to that recommendation, the Obama administration created the National Network for Manufacturing Innovation in 2014. The network brings together research institutions, private-sector companies and nonprofits to come up with innovations in advanced manufacturing. No member of Congress had to do anything to secure funding. The money was already in the Department of Defense, which announced funding for creation of a photonics institute in 2014. Slaughter did send three letters that year asking the Obama administration to consider Rochester as a location for one of the institutes created under the program. But it was SUNY Polytechnic Institute that submitted the Rochester proposal on behalf of the SUNY Research Foundation and a consortium of 124 companies, nonprofits and universities. No elected officials, including Slaughter, were involved in writing and submitting the application, according to Empire State Development. In June 2015, Cuomo, Biden and other lawmakers announced state and federal funding for the institute. Where did the funding come from? Assini says his debate reference was to the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014, or RAMI. Under RAMI, the Secretary of Defense can provide financial assistance "to a person or group of persons to assist the organization in planning, establishing, or supporting a center for manufacturing innovation." The bill was sponsored by Reed in the House, but did not pass as a standalone bill. It was later included in an omnibus spending bill that became law in December 2014. RAMI had nothing to do with the Rochester institute, according to the National Institute of Standards and Technology, part of the U.S. Department of Commerce. The Rochester institute would have been approved and funded even if RAMI had not passed. The funding had already been announced by the Department of Defense before RAMI became law in December 2014. Our ruling At a debate between candidates in the 25th Congressional District, Assini said, "The photonics bill that was sponsored in Congress and written, was written by Congressman Tom Reed, not Congresswoman Louise Slaughter." Financial support for the new photonics institute comes from Department of Defense funds that existed before Congress approved the Revitalize American Manufacturing and Innovation Act of 2014. The Department of Defense says Rochester was selected based on the application prepared by SUNY Polytechnic Institute. The state says no lawmakers were involved in crafting the application, but Slaughter did ask the Obama administration to consider Rochester in the selection process. We rate Assini’s claim as False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0a6ff59a-dc68-4f2b-907f-a66231686f02	None	Mark Assini	None	None	None	2016-11-04T17:42:33	2016-10-18	['United_States_Congress', 'Louise_Slaughter', 'United_States_House_of_Representatives']

pomt-06451	Even a 100 percent tax on millionaires would only fund four months of government operations, failing to seriously address budget deficits and debt.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/20/paul-ryan/ryan-says-100-percent-tax-millionaires-would-only-/	In the view of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the government should limit the subsidies given to the wealthy through Social Security and other entitlement programs. But the House Budget Committee chairman is against slapping higher tax rates on millionaires -- the plan President Barack Obama and other Democrats are pushing in the name of tax fairness and deficit reduction. In early October, Senate Democrats backed the president’s 5.6 percent surcharge on income over $1 million. Ryan argues some small businesses would get hurt by the approach because of the way they file taxes. And more taxes on the rich don’t add up to much when compared with the deficit and debt, Ryan said Oct. 9, 2011 on NBC’s "Meet the Press." "If you took all the income from every millionaire in America today, it would run the government for about four months." he said. "I have a better idea. Instead of job-killing tax increases why don’t we just stop subsidizing wealthy people? Let’s go after the crony capitalism, the corporate welfare in the tax code, in spending. And why don’t we income adjust our spending programs so we don’t subsidize wealthy people as much? I think that’s a better idea to get more savings in the budget, and get our debt down without doing economic damage." That first sound bite -- discussing in hypothetical terms the impact of a 100 percent tax rate on people making $1 million a year -- drew some attention. So we decided to take a look. A critical bit of background: America’s millionaire-earners club has shrunk in size during hard times -- 235,000 tax returns listed adjusted gross income over $1 million in 2009, down 26 percent from the 320,000 a year earlier. (Editor's note: For clarity, we added the word "earners" to this paragraph. 10/21/2010) So the year matters in Ryan’s comparison. (PolitiFact Wisconsin has examined claims about the wealthy before. On March 10, 2011, we rated True a statement by liberal filmmaker Michael Moore that 400 Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans combined. Moore referred to net worth rather than income.) We asked Ryan’s office for support for his claim, and were pointed to analyses by the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based research organization. Ryan based his math on one that used 2008 IRS numbers, while citing some arguments from another that was based on 2009 figures. The 2009 data, which came out in summer 2011, is the latest available. It shows $727 billion in income reported by the million-and-up set in 2009, based on the adjusted gross income line on the federal tax return. In the same year, you could have run the $3.5 trillion federal government for about 2.5 months on that income, according to our calculations and those of the Tax Foundation’s David Logan, an economist whose work Ryan cited. Ryan’s office said he was basing his statement on the now-outdated 2008 IRS data that showed about $1.07 trillion in income from people making more than $1 million. Run that into the $2.9 trillion federal budget for 2008 and you do get the four months Ryan mentioned. (We found there’s another way to get to four months: Use a broader income measure favored by some researchers, including those at the Tax Policy Center, another Washington, D.C.-based research organization. That measure, though, goes beyond the "adjusted gross income" used on federal tax forms.) So, settling the math: By choosing 2008, Ryan was using outdated numbers … but also more conservative ones. His point would have been stronger with the new numbers, showing government could be run for an even shorter period. Now, what about the way Ryan presents the statement? Critics said Ryan’s quip falsely implied that some Democrat is actually proposing a 100% tax on millionaires to run the government. We think that’s a bit too literal; Ryan is clearly raising a hypothetical to make a point. But what specific point was he trying to make? Ryan spokesman Kevin Seifert told us his point was that raising income taxes on higher-income earners "would not address the federal government’s debt and deficits." Ryan uses a wildly hypothetical scenario. A 100 percent tax obviously would have negative effects and is a political non-starter. But Ryan is using it to address a serious issue, so let’s take it at face value for a moment. By our calculation, the U.S. government would have taken in $800 billion more in tax revenue if it had taxed people making more than $1 million at 100 percent, according to IRS data from 2008, the year Ryan used as his base point. That doesn’t make much of dent in America’s $14 trillion debt, to be sure. But if we’re talking about the deficit, which Ryan did on "Meet the Press," that $800 billion would have wiped out the 2008 deficit -- with another $370 billion to spare. Looked at that way, the number undermines Ryan’s larger point. Our conclusion Ryan conjures a hypothetical to make a point about the limits of taxation for budget savings, saying that that even a 100% tax on people making more than $1 million would run the government only for about four months. He’s right, if you use slightly outdated data or adopt a measure that’s not as on point as the one he uses. Newer data tells a bit different story, even while somewhat bolstering Ryan’s point. But he misfires in suggesting a limited budget impact from such a hypothetical tax. In the year he chose, the federal deficit would have been wiped out. So, Ryan is close to the mark on his math but the details work against his overall point. We rate his claim Half True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2011-10-20T09:00:00	2011-10-09	['None']

pomt-08133	"They tried to give us $400 million to build a high-speed train that goes 39 miles an hour."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/dec/08/john-kasich/ohio-gov-elect-john-kasich-rejects-passenger-train/	Gov.-elect John Kasich rarely minces words when it comes to the proposed Cleveland-to-Cincinnati passenger train, declaring the idea "dead" under his watch while deriding the locomotives "high speed" moniker. The train, supported by outgoing Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland, would operate four times a day, making six stops (including Cleveland, Columbus, Dayton and Cincinnati) over its 258-mile trek across Ohio. And it comes with a $400 million check from the federal government, enough to get the train up and running by late 2012, supporters say. The rail plan Kasich says prefers -- one to get Ohio’s economy moving forward -- is to get more freight trains to ship goods made in Ohio to out-of-state places. He calls the passenger train a "money pit" because it is estimated it will cost the state about $17 million annually to maintain and operate it, with no guarantee enough Ohioans will buy tickets to eat up those expenses. But most of Kasich’s criticism about the passenger train has targeted its projected speed. "They tried to give us $400 million to build a high-speed train that goes 39 miles an hour," Kasich told CNN reporter John King during a television interview on Nov. 19. He said something similar the day after his election during a news conference in Columbus. Kasich recalled being in a deli in Plain City while on the campaign trail where a model train was set up inside the restaurant going in a huge circle. "You know, I think that (toy) train goes faster than the 39 mph high-speed train," Kasich said. He was being sarcastic, yes, but sticking to an underlying point that the proposed passenger train would travel too slowly for anyone to actually want to ride on it. Strickland’s administration says Kasich is deliberately misleading Ohioans about the train’s speed to win support for his idea to scrap the plan altogether and that the new governor knows that its average speed will be faster than 39 mph. Politifact Ohio decided to check. Confusion over the train’s projected speed can actually be pinned on the Strickland administration. The initial proposed schedule called for the train to complete the route from Cleveland to Cincinnati in 6.5 hours. While the top speed would be about 79 mph, the average would be just 39 mph. A person driving a car between the two cities could make the trip at the posted vehicle speed limits in a little over 4 hours. To combat that criticism, the Ohio Department of Transportation hired a railroad planning firm to study and revise the travel schedule. It surmised that by taking out some curves and switching up the planned route it could shorten the trip’s duration. ODOT released an updated report in September saying the newer analysis cuts the trip down from 6.5 hours to 5 hours and 15 minutes and increases the average speed from 39 mph to just over 50 mph. That report has gone unchallenged to this point, and it’s average speed is in line with the average speeds of passenger trains in Illinois, Michigan, Missouri, Texas and Oklahoma, according to ODOT. That’s fast enough for Strickland officials to want to keep this project on track. Strickland rejected Kasich’s request to pull the idea saying not only will Ohioans ride the train but that the plan could produce about 16,000 jobs. Also, ODOT in October released a report declaring that more Ohioans are riding passenger trains, proof the Strickland administration says that the 3C train would be a success. Kasich has not let up. He’s written to both Strickland and President Barack Obama asking them to forget the train program altogether and allow Ohio instead to use the $400 million on some other infrastructure projects. After the Obama administration rejected that request, Kasich enlisted the help of outgoing Republican Sen. George Voinovich. In November, Voinovich introduced a bill to allow Kasich to bypass federal authorities and use the money to fix Ohio’s roads and bridges rather than build a passenger train. The bill, however, isn’t expected to survive. Other states, meanwhile, have said they’d like Ohio’s share of rail money if Kasich doesn’t want it. So Kasich is correct in that the federal government has approved $400 million in stimulus for development of high-speed rail service in Ohio. But his use of 39 mph as an average speed for the train relies on projections the administration discarded and ignores results of a newer study that included changes to the rail route. That’s an important detail; one that’s needed to keep things in context. We rate Kasich claim about the 3C train as Half True.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2010-12-08T06:00:00	2010-11-19	['None']
pomt-01368	"In 2013," Dan Patrick voted "against funding to test the backlog of rape kits, allowing rapists to walk free."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/oct/17/leticia-van-de-putte/leticia-van-de-putte-says-dan-patrick-voted-agains/	In a video ad, Democratic lieutenant governor nominee Leticia Van de Putte presents Republican nominee Dan Patrick as too extreme on vital public safety issues. The ad’s narrator initially says Patrick, a Houston senator, "would deny victims of rape any options at all," a claim rooted in Patrick’s statement in a January 2014 debate that he would permit an abortion only to save the life of an endangered mother. "And," the narrator says, "he voted against funding to test the backlog of rape kits. Allowing rapists to walk free." Patrick, the narrator says, "is just too dangerous." Did Patrick vote against testing backlogged rape kits, letting rapists walk? Van de Putte cites Patrick vote against 2014-15 state budget Manny Garcia, a spokesman for Van de Putte, a San Antonio state senator, told us by email the basis of her rape-kit claim was Patrick’s vote against the final version of the overall 2014-15 state budget that cleared the Senate in May 2013. A backup document Garcia sent over noted a June 6, 2013, Texas Tribune news story stating that the budget allotted $11 million to the Texas Department of Public Safety "to help address the state’s massive backlog of untested rape kits. "In 2011," the story said, "the Legislature passed Senate Bill 1636, by state Sen. Wendy Davis, D-Fort Worth, which requires that state law enforcement agencies report the number of untested rape kits and submit a certain number to DPS for testing." The story said the new funding would "cover the outsourcing costs to have the kits tested, and DPS estimates that based on historical data, about half of the untested kits will yield traces of DNA." According to legislative records, Davis in May 2011 won unanimous Senate approval of her proposal when it was sent to the House and again in the body’s concurrence with House amendments--meaning Patrick voted "aye" twice as well. We asked the Texas Association Against Sexual Assault about the impact of the funding. A staff attorney, Chris Kaiser, said by email the tests are just starting to happen, but it’s "reasonable to assume that out of all those kits there will be some investigations and prosecutions resulting from DNA hits. However, we’re talking about fairly long-term effects of the 82nd Legislature’s funding, not immediate analysis that is helping to scoop offenders off the streets today." Patrick’s actions in 2013 session Next, we focused on Patrick’s actions. As noted in a previous fact check, Patrick was among four senators who voted against the final version of the 2014-15 state budget. In a May 30, 2013, public interview with the Texas Tribune’s Evan Smith, Patrick said he voted "no" -- after backing earlier versions -- because education initiatives, including funds to pay for students to take the SAT, weren’t in it. He did not mention the budgeted money to test the kits. Legislative records show Patrick supporting, and even having a hand in launching, the spending to test the kits. Patrick serves on the Senate Finance Committee, which on March 13, 2013, unanimously voted in favor of the panel’s version of Senate Bill 1, the budget act, including the money for testing the kits. To our inquiry about Patrick’s position on the rape-kit expenditure in the 2013 session, Torie Camp, an Austin consultant who was then a TAASA official, emailed us what she described as a March 13, 2013, Senate Finance Committee document indicating Patrick was among a subset of senators to initially put the kit funding into the budget. The document, including the typed notation "tentative work group decisions," indicates several committee members, including Patrick, were tasked as a "work group" with resolving the finance panel’s public safety new spending items. And, the document indicates, those senators by that date had agreed to pencil in $10.95 million in state revenue to pay for outsourcing DNA screening and testing services for approximately 10,000 sexual assault kits a year. (The document is also posted online by the Legislative Budget Board which has also posted a similar document indicating the commitment of money to the kits was an unsettled issue for senators as of Feb. 12, 2013.) On March 20, 2013, Patrick was among 28 senators who voted to advance the budget (including the kit-test funding) to the House, according to the Senate Journal entry for that day. Two senators (though not Patrick) voted "no." Generally in the 2013 session, Camp said by phone, "we never got a sense that anybody was opposed to this money in there. This wasn’t something anybody wanted to oppose." Rapists walking free? Camp said that after the budget took effect in September 2013, DPS proceeded to bid out the tests of the kits to private laboratories which, Camp said, started working through kits in fall 2014. Camp said it makes sense that some of the resulting DNA "hits," to be passed along by DPS to local police departments, will lead to individuals being convicted of assaults -- and be taken off the streets. For now," she said, "we’re just not far enough into the process to know we’re going to take sexual offenders off the streets. But my guess is we will." By email, DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said that effective June 2014, the agency had an agreement for the University of North Texas Health Science Center to test about 1,000 kits. Also, Vinger said, the department has contracted with companies in Dallas and Virginia to test the kits. "In the coming months, we will ultimately direct agencies where to send their kits," he said. "The actual testing is expected to take place over two years." Vinger said DPS doesn’t track successful prosecutions related to sexual assault testing — whether via kits or other evidence. Vinger also said "backlog" is misleading in reference to the kits now being tested since most of them hadn’t previously been submitted to a crime lab for testing, based on decisions by local law enforcement agencies and prosecutors, he said. In August 2013, according to a New York Times/Texas Tribune news story published at the time, DPS estimated there were close to 20,000 untested kits statewide per information from various law enforcement agencies. The story said the untested kits had collected in police evidence rooms amid tight budgets, overworked crime labs and, in some cases, determinations by authorities that there was insufficient cause to test a kit. By email, we pointed out to Van de Putte that Patrick evidently played a role in initially putting the money for testing the kits into the budget and there is no indication his vote against the full final budget allowed rapists to walk. Garcia, stressing Patrick’s opposition to the final budget, emailed: "If it was up to him alone, the budget would not have passed at that point in time, Meaning that testing for the rape kits would not be funded." Our ruling Van de Putte said Patrick voted "against funding to test the backlog of rape kits, allowing rapists to walk free." This claim is flawed in various ways -- starting with blaming Patrick for a result that didn’t come to be. In reality, Patrick appears to have been among senators to initially put the kit-test funding into the state budget. And while he voted against the final overall budget, there’s no indication he did so to stop the kits from being tested. Also, the contention that rapists walked free as a result of Patrick’s action is incorrect. The funding (to repeat) passed into law.

pomt-10319	"McCain got more money from Airbus' U.S. executives than any other politician."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/31/campaign-money-watch/mccain-campaign-bouyed-by-airbus-execs-and-lobbyis/	An independent political group called Campaign Money Watch has begun airing a TV ad that paints Sen. John McCain as a bought-and-paid-for politician who swung a lucrative defense contract to a European company over an American competitor. The issue is McCain's role in a highly contentious and much-publicized battle over a contract to build a fleet of air refueling tankers for the Air Force. Chicago-based Boeing has been at odds with a rival bidder, a partnership between U.S.-based Northrop Grumman and European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company (EADS), the parent company of Airbus. To the surprise of many, Airbus was awarded the roughly $40-billion contract in March 2008, but the General Accounting Office upheld a protest from Boeing, concluding that the Air Force made a number of errors in the bidding process. The contract will now be re-bid. What's interesting about this attack is that McCain's role in this particular defense project has long been seen as one of taxpayer hero. The whole reason there was a competitive bid for a contract to build the tankers is because McCain led a charge to scrap the Air Force's original plan, which was to lease jetliners from Boeing. As McCain made noise, government studies concluded that costs for the lease plan had been vastly underestimated. People were fired, some went to jail. It was a big scandal, and McCain has rightly claimed credit for it on the trail. None of that background appears in the ad. The ad claims McCain's campaign has been too cozy with Airbus. An announcer in the TV ad states: "Seven of McCain's staff and fundraisers lobbied for Airbus" and "McCain got more money from Airbus' U.S. executives than any other politician." The ad is on target when it calls out McCain for having seven campaign staffers and fundraisers who lobbied for Airbus; and for accepting contributions from Airbus executives. Former McCain finance chairman Thomas G. Loeffler's firm lobbied for Airbus parent company EADS. Loeffler's lobbying ties led to his departure from the McCain campaign in March. Susan E. Nelson left Loeffler's lobbying firm to be McCain's finance director. William L. Ball III, a former secretary of the Navy and frequent McCain surrogate, and John Green, who took a leave from Ogilvy Public Relations to serve as McCain's legislative liaison, also have lobbied for EADS. And three McCain fundraising bundlers — Kirk Blalock, Kirsten Chadwick and Aleix Jarvis — are with Fierce Isakowitz & Blalock, which has done lobbying work for EADS, according to campaign finance records at Opensecrets.org and Public Citizen. As for political contributions, the ad states that "McCain got more money from Airbus' U.S. executives than any other politician." The Center for Responsive Politics prepared a report for PolitiFact that backs that up. U.S. employees of EADS/Airbus have contributed $15,700 in this election cycle to McCain's campaign. The next highest recipient was Mark Warner, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, who has gotten $2,800. Barack Obama has gotten $2,650. Neither McCain nor Obama has gotten any money from Airbus PACs, which have spread around $123,000 to 22 congressional candidates this election cycle. Given those numbers, we rule this claim True.

pomt-01795	Between June 30 and July 10, CNN interviewed "17 Israeli public officials versus one" Palestinian official.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/24/rula-jebreal/fact-checking-rula-jebreals-claim-cnn-had-17-israe/	Palestinian journalist Rula Jebreal accused CNN of presenting a one-sided picture of the fighting in the Gaza Strip in a heated July 22 interview on MSNBC. A day earlier, she called MSNBC’s coverage "disgustingly biased" toward Israel. PunditFact wanted to see if Jebreal had a point, using the evidence she laid out in her interview with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes. (Watch the video for more from their chat.) Jebreal told Hayes that on CNN "between June 30 and July 10, you had 17 Israeli public officials vs. one" Palestinian public official. While the statistic doesn’t necessarily prove bias, it does suggest lopsided coverage of the Israel-Gaza crisis. Is Jebreal right? The source of her count Biased coverage of the Israel-Gaza crisis has been a constant cable news subplot. ABC News’ Diane Sawyer acknowledged she mislabeled a Palestinian family assessing damage after an Israeli bomb strike as an Israeli family. NBC News raised questions for pulling reporter Ayman Mohyeldin off the story for a script he wrote about four Gaza children killed by a bomb on a beach because it was allegedly seen as too sympathetic to Palestinians. Jebreal emerged as a Middle Eastern voice in Western media after sharing her experiences about growing up in the West Bank and reporting in Egypt during the Arab Spring. While Jebreal did not respond to our attempts to reach her, we were able to find the source of her claim about CNN. Two years ago, Yousef Munayyer, executive director of The Jerusalem Fund and The Palestine Center, reviewed transcripts of CNN’s coverage of Gaza fighting from Nov. 14, 2012, when Hamas military commander Ahmed Jabari was killed in an Israeli airstrike, until Nov. 21, 2012, the day a cease-fire was announced. During that week, he found officials from Israel appeared on the network 45 times, compared to five appearances by Hamas officials and 20 combined appearances of spokespersons for the Palestine Liberation Organization, Palestinian Legislative Council and Hamas. Munayyer revived the media watching to document the current crisis, and on July 10, Munayyer tweeted new observations of CNN. Munayyer again relied on available transcripts of CNN programming. In @CNN coverage of Israel/Palestine since 6/29 they have had 35 guests on the topic this is how they break down (1/2) — Yousef Munayyer (@YousefMunayyer) July 11, 2014 17 Israeli officials 4 Israel lay persons 1 Palestinian official 4 Palestinian lay persons 8 Unaffiliated 6 Michael Oren appearances (2/2) — Yousef Munayyer (@YousefMunayyer) July 11, 2014 In an interview with PunditFact, Munayyer said the exercise shows CNN alarmingly favored Israeli perspectives. Munayyer said a more thorough analysis will be done whenever the conflict ends. Munayyer started analyzing coverage to coincide with the discovery of the bodies of three missing Israeli teens in the West Bank on June 30. (The boys had been missing since June 12, the tipping point of the conflict. And Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced June 15 that Hamas was responsible "for a fact.") On July 2, a retaliatory killing of a Palestinian teen escalated the fighting. Four days later, the beating of an American-Palestinian teen by Israeli police made the U.S. airwaves. On July 8, the Israelis launched an official offensive operation known as "Protective Edge." When Munayyer tweeted on July 10, the death toll in Gaza had reached at least 78. Who did Munayyer count? For starters, he was looking at appearances, not individual guests. He counted Israel’s ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, as six Israeli officials because he gave six interviews. Mark Regev, spokesman for the Israeli Prime Minister’s office, was also counted six times. Israel Defense Forces spokesman Peter Lerner was counted twice and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was counted once. President Shimon Peres was counted twice, bringing Munayyer’s tally to 17 appearances from Israeli officials. (However, Munayyer told us he counted two more appearances from Peres on July 10, the same day as his tweet, upping the total for that period to 19. He says he thinks he sent the tweet without "closing out" the July 10 appearances.) Former Israeli ambassador Michael Oren got his own category in Munayyer’s tally because he is now CNN’s Middle East analyst. Conversely, Munayyer counted just one Palestinian official, -- Palestinian Ambassador Maen Areikat, though there were other Palestinian "lay persons" invited as CNN guests, including lawyers for the Tampa teen beaten up by Israeli police, and Muyanner himself. Munayyer told us he focused on CNN because it’s more mainstream than MSNBC and Fox News and typically throws more resources on the ground to cover international crises. His team reviewed transcripts for every hour of news coverage to see who was invited to weigh in. He excluded interviews within correspondent’s reports, looking instead for pundits and analysts asked to provide their take of the situation by phone or in-studio. "The question we’re trying to ask is, who is CNN trying to give a platform on this issue, and is it done in a balanced way?" Munayyer said. "My hunch is there’s going to be slight improvement over 2012, but there’s still a lot of work to do to get towards parity." In the interview with Jebreal, Hayes argued one reason for the uneven coverage is the difficulty of booking a spokesperson for the militant group firing rockets into Israel, Hamas. Still, Munayyer told us, "that doesn't mean there aren't Palestinian voices who can speak to the situation on the ground from an informed Palestinian perspective that would provide a greater sense of balance to all of the Israeli perspectives that are there." In a statement, CNN said, "Our team of correspondents, anchors and contributors have been reporting live from the Mideast fairly across all our platforms. Our reporting represents all sides (Israeli, Palestinian and Hamas) daily. We're comfortable with the Palestinian voices we have included from Gaza, Qatar, Washington, D.C., and New York when supplemented with our countless live reports from Gaza with three correspondents on the ground." Our own tally We set out to match up Munayyer’s preliminary analysis with our own, using a computer program we subscribe to called Critical Mention. The program allows us to search video going back 30 days for all major news networks, and it allows us to search using the closed captioning transcript. We scanned the network’s discussion of Israel, Gaza and Palestine from June 29 to July 10, the same window as Munayyer. Our findings suggest Munayyer undercounted the number of Palestinian officials CNN had on air. The following breakdown somewhat mirrors the categories Munayyer outlined, which do not include voices from correspondents’ news packages. There is no perfect way to do this, however, as it’s awkward to classify appearances by people with neutral titles and biased commentary and vice versa. With that note, here’s what we found (and here’s a link to our chart of who appeared when): 20 appearances by Israeli public officials (four of these were replays); 2 appearances by Israeli laymen; 5 appearances by Palestinian officials; 11 appearances by Palestinian laymen, including Munayyer himself; 6 appearances by Michael Oren. While Munayyer found one appearance by a Palestinian official, we found five. Four were by Palestinian Ambassador Maen Areikat, and one was a prerecorded interview with PLO committee member Hanan Ashrawi. Other "pro-Palestinian" voices included four appearances by Palestinian-American relatives and lawyers commenting on the case of Tariq Abu Khdeir, the Tampa teen beaten by Israeli security. Former PLO legal adviser and spokesperson Diana Buttu accounts for five "layman" appearances, though one appearance was cut before it began when CNN lost the phone connection. Another former PLO adviser and current Brookings Institution fellow, Khaled Elgindy, appeared once on CNN. It’s also worth noting efforts to incorporate more Palestinian voices that fall outside of the timeline Munayyer and Jebreal talked about, closer to daily news. CNN host Jake Tapper, for example, interviewed Hamas spokesman Ghazi Hamad by phone on July 18. Seem complicated? It is. What drives the disparity Marda Dunsky, a former journalist who teaches at Northwestern University’s Medill School and author of Pens and Swords: How the American Mainstream Media Report the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, said the imbalance of Israeli and Palestinian news sources in most mainstream coverage is well documented, but it does not necessarily imply a deliberate attempt to mislead. It’s an accessibility issue. The shortage of Palestinian voices is more often a symptom of two very different warring societies, she said. "The Israeli government has people in many different branches who are trained specifically to speak to the media," she said. "The Palestinian government is not as well developed, and as a result it lacks the same depth of field when it comes to official sources." Buttu, the former PLO spokeswoman and legal adviser, told us in an interview that her CNN appearances are a "drop in the bucket" compared to Michael Oren, the network’s on-hand Middle East analyst and former Israeli ambassador to the United States. "No matter what any Palestinian commentator says on the show, at the end of the day they always have Michael Oren," she said. "That’s quite problematic. Can you imagine if a former Palestinian ambassador of the United States served as a commentator on Fox, don’t you think they would be up in arms in that? It’s accepted as commonplace at CNN." Buttu’s bigger issue is with the style of questions directed at Palestinian guests, and that she is often asked about the official Palestinian position even though she has not been an official for years. Another thing to remember: Both sides point to bias in reporting. Countering Munayyer’s media-monitoring group are U.S.- and Israel-based organizations such as the Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America (CAMERA) and HonestReporting. Our ruling Jebreal said, on CNN "this time around, you have, between June 30 and July 10, you had 17 Israeli public officials vs. one" Palestinian public official. She is referencing a preliminary tally of Israeli and Palestinian officials’ voices during that time by a pro-Palestinian media watcher. Our tally confirms there was a disparity, but it was not quite as lopsided as Jebreal said. We found 20 appearances by Israeli public officials on CNN compared to 5 appearances by Palestinian officials. Also, the tally is measuring appearances, not the number of officials from each side who appeared. And it's worth noting that any look at the media coverage is incomplete because the story is continuing to unfold. Because of those caveats, we rate Jebreal’s claim Half True.

pomt-11887	Says Roy Moore "has advocated getting the federal government out of health care altogether, which means doing away with Medicaid, which means doing away with Medicare."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/26/doug-jones/does-roy-moore-want-end-medicaid-and-medicare-his-/	In the race for Alabama’s Senate seat, Democratic candidate Doug Jones is warning that Republican nominee Roy Moore’s small government conservatism could imperil federal programs that provide health care to millions of Americans. "My opponent in this race has advocated getting the federal government out of health care altogether, which means doing away with Medicaid, which means doing away with Medicare," Jones said in a Sept. 27 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press Daily. With the Dec. 12 general election drawing near, we wondered whether Jones had accurately stated Moore’s small government approach to health care reform. Jones put words in Moore's mouth. Jones' campaign pointed to this statement from Moore’s spokesman: "Roy Moore wants to make sure that the federal government is getting out of the health care business entirely," Moore campaign chairman Bill Armistead said in a Sept. 23 press release, which highlighted differences between Moore and his former Republican rival Sen. Luther Strange on the issue of Obamacare repeal. There is a subtle but crucial difference between Armistead’s and Jones’ statements. Jones said Moore wants the federal government out of health care — Moore’s spokesman said he wants the federal government out of the health care business. The space between those statements is the crux of this fact-check. For more than 50 years, the federal government has played a role in giving health insurance to the poor and elderly through Medicaid and Medicare. These public insurance programs are distinct from the kind of private insurance customers can buy from companies like Unitedhealth and Aetna. While Moore clearly supports shrinking the federal government, the key question is whether Moore wants the federal government out of private insurance only, or if he also wants the federal government to end its role in public programs such as Medicaid and Medicare, as Jones said. No evidence Moore wants to end Medicaid, Medicare Moore’s campaign declined to say if he wants to do away with Medicaid or Medicare. A description of his policy positions on his campaign website is silent as to these specific programs, and we were unable to find a single instance where Moore explicitly called to end the government’s role in public insurance. What we did find were numerous examples of Moore calling for the repeal of Obamacare. "We do not need socialized medicine which will ultimately lead to loss of quality and affordability of heath care, as well as a loss of access to the latest medical technology. Obamacare should be completely repealed as soon as possible," Moore’s campaign website states. It’s unclear exactly what Moore would like to see Obamacare replaced with. But the record seems to suggest he’s amenable to the federal government playing some role in Medicaid and Medicare into the future. One clue is Moore’s support for the House-passed American Health Care Act. That bill would have curtailed, but not abolished, Medicaid, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It would not have eliminated Medicare either. "Obamacare has not been fully repealed, although steps have been made in the right direction, and I support the bill that has passed Congress," Moore said in a Sept. 21 Republican primary debate against Strange. An interview Moore gave to the Montgomery Advertiser suggests he recognized the federal government’s fundamental role in public insurance as a given even before Obamacare took effect. "It’s not the role of the government to be involved in health insurance," Moore told the Montgomery Advertiser June 27. "Before Obama came in, the federal government wasn’t involved, except for Medicaid and Medicare, with health insurance." A Moore profile in the July 24 Montgomery Advertiser described him as "noncommittal on cuts to Medicaid." With respect to Republican replacement efforts at the time, Moore said he "would have to see what cuts they’re talking about" for Medicaid before he took a position. That’s a far cry from calling to abolish the program. It’s possible Moore may take a harder line on public insurance programs in the future. But for now, we’ve found no evidence he wants to abolish Medicaid or Medicare. Our ruling Jones said Moore wants to end the federal government’s role in Medicaid and Medicare. The record clearly demonstrates Moore wants to repeal Obamacare. He may not have articulated what he wants the health insurance system to look like, but we found no evidence to suggest he wants to end the federal government’s role in Medicaid and Medicare.

pomt-05601	"Medicare will be bankrupt in nine years."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/mar/29/pat-boone/pat-boone-claims-medicare-will-be-bankrupt-nine-ye/	The 60 Plus Association, an advocacy group that bills itself as "the conservative alternative" to the AARP, has a fondness for golden oldies. The group hired singer Pat Boone as its pitchman in an ad that targets the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act, the health reform bill often called Obamacare approved by Congress in 2010. In the ad, Boone warns seniors of potential dangers in the bill and urges them to call Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Look-alike versions aired in other states target four other Democratic senators. PolitiFact already has run several of Boone’s claims in the ad through the Truth-O-Meter. A statement that an independent payment advisory board created by the health care act "can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments" was rated Pants on Fire, as was the claim that the IPAB is "like a Medicare IRS with the power to cut Medicare in order to pay for new government programs." And the statement that the health care law "will cut $500 billion from Medicare" was rated Mostly False. That leaves us with another alarming assertion: "Medicare will be bankrupt in nine years, but Washington politicians, like Sherrod Brown, are ignoring the problem, putting their own re-elections first." The second part of the statement is subjective political rhetoric that we can't rate. We can, however, examine the foundation of the claim about Medicare going bankrupt. PolitiFact Ohio won’t try to predict the future. But the claim about Medicare going bankrupt isn’t a predictions as a result of an ideological debate. Rather, it’s rooted in research and projections by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. 60 Plus cited two reports from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office when we asked about the claim. The CBO's "March 2011 Medicare Baseline," 60 Plus said, "estimated that the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would be exhausted in 2021." Another CBO report, the "Budget and Economic Outlook" for fiscal 2012 to 2022," estimated that the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund would be exhausted by early 2022," it said. That's true -- and it's not what Boone says in the ad. The Hospital Insurance Trust Fund to which the reports refer is one of two separate trust funds run by the federal government for Medicare. This trust fund, which collects most of its money from federal payroll taxes, pays for one of four parts of Medicare, Part A, which covers inpatient hospital care, home health care, and services at skilled nursing facilities and hospices. The other trust fund is the Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund. It is mostly covered by the federal government’s general fund and premiums and pays bills for Medicare Part B, which covers doctor visits and other outpatient costs, and Part D, which covers prescription drugs. Medicare Advantage, or Part C, gives recipients the option to receive care through private insurers. It doesn’t have a trust fund. The Supplementary Medical Insurance fund is in good shape. It is "projected to remain in financial balance for all future years," according to a 2011 report by the fund’s trustees. The Hospital Insurance fund does have big problems, but that's not the same thing as being "bankrupt," a legal term of art that doesn’t apply to federal governmental programs. A report by the Congressional Research Service leaves open the question of what would happen if the Hospital Insurance fund were to run out of money. "There are no provisions in the Social Security Act governing what would happen in such an event," the report says. "There is no authority in law for a general revenue funding of the shortfall. The fund would continue to have payroll taxes credited to it though these would be insufficient to pay all the pending claims." But the CRS report also notes that the Hospital Insurance trust fund has faced a projected shortfall "almost from its inception." In 1970, when the program was only four years old, the insolvency date was 1972. For the next 16 years, trustees expected the fund to be exhausted by the 1990s. Congress repeatedly changed legislation to lower fund spending and keep it from going dry. ("Baseline" projections are made with the assumption that current laws and formulas remain unchanged.) Our colleagues at FactCheck.org wrote in 2009 about a TV ad for another conservative group, Americans for Prosperity, which predicted Medicare would be bankrupt in eight years -- 5 1/2 years from now. They checked a nearly identical claim of bankruptcy by Rep. Paul Ryan a year ago. In both cases, FactCheck said, the claim "goes too far." Again, we won’t try to predict the future. But for this claim, we don’t have to. 60 Plus cited reports showing that Medicare's Hospital Insurance Trust Fund faces insolvency in nine years. And while it’s worth noting that Congress has always pulled the fund from the brink of insolvency, and that insolvency has been forecast almost from the program’s start, that’s an event in the future that we won’t try to predict. What we do know from research that 60 Plus cited is that that Boone’s claim -- that Medicare will be bankrupt in nine years -- takes a projection for one trust fund and applies it to all of Medicare. By doing so, Boone’s claim overstates what the CBO reports forecast. The Hospital Insurance Trust Fund supports just one of the four parts of Medicare. The portions of Medicare that cover regular doctor visits and prescriptions are covered by a different trust fund that trustees say is in good shape. On the Truth-O-Meter, Boone’s claim rates False.

pomt-09833	Most of the stimulus money will be spent "not this year, not next year, but in 2011."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/26/george-will/george-will-claims-stimulus-money-will-be-spent-sl/	Faced with larger deficit projections than expected, the White House is shifting its attention back to the economy and so is conservative columnist George Will. In a round table discussion on the Aug. 23, 2009, episode of This Week with George Stephanopoulos , four commentators including Will lamented the administration's loose fiscal practices, including how little of the $787 billion stimulus package has been spent. "Well, I noticed that the stimulus, which has sent out, what, about 10 percent of what has been voted on this, that most of the stimulus spending will be not this year, not next year, but in 2011," Will said. We've already discussed the difference between stimulus money that's been literally spent and money that's been obligated, and we've already looked at a claim about how quickly the stimulus money will be spent here . For this Truth-O-Meter item, we'll focus on Will's claim that most of the stimulus money will be spent "not this year, not next year, but in 2011." It seems that Will's information springs from a bit of confusion that happened back in January 2009, when the White House and Congress were just starting to hash over the stimulus package. At the time, the White House had released a $825 billion stimulus proposal that included about $355 billion in spending on everything from alternative energy to road construction. Repeatedly, the White House maintained it would spend about 75 percent of the money within the first 18 months of enactment. A flurry of news reports cited a Congressional Budget Office prediction that much of the spending would happen in 2011 or later, but the White House contended that report was incomplete: "The Congressional Budget Office recently released an analysis of a component of the economic recovery proposal; that analysis, however, did not assess the overall package," Office of Management and Budget director Peter Orszag wrote in a Jan. 22 letter to House Budget Committee Chairman John Spratt. "Our analysis indicates that at least 75 percent of the overall package (including its tax component and the other spending provisions that were not analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office) will be spent over the next year and a half." Nevertheless, Republicans seized on the estimate as a way to demonstrate that stimulus money would drip slowly rather than flood into the economy. The final cost estimate of the $787 billion passed by Congress on Feb. 13 shows that about $145.4 billion will be spent on infrastructure and other job-creating projects in 2009 and 2010, and about $162.5 billion will be spent between 2011 and 2019. Just using those numbers, Will would be correct: most discretionary spending — the Washington term for the portion of the budget that Congress controls — will go out in 2011 or after. But discretionary spending is only part of the $787 billion package. Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy for Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank, said the rest of the package includes mandatory spending — such as money for food stamps and health care — and spending on tax breaks. That money must also be taken into account to get the most accurate idea of how much cash is literally leaving Washington each year. In that regard, the numbers look very different. According to the CBO, about $185 billion will go out in 2009 and $399 billion will go out in 2010. Together, that's about 75 percent of the $787 billion bill. Also worth noting: Will said "in 2011" not "after 2011." In the heat of debate, it's clear that he slipped up his words. Nevertheless, in this case he's wrong no matter how you crunch the numbers; in every scenario, 2010 is the biggest spending year. To recap: If the government were only considering discretionary spending, Will would be correct; CBO's cost estimates of the White House proposal and the final version of the bill demonstrate that most discretionary funding will go out in 2011 and later. However, that's not the whole story because Will's claim does not take into account mandatory spending or tax breaks. In that case, the bulk of the money will be spent in 2009 and 2010. As a result, we give Will a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00284	Says Sen. Joe Manchin has a "$700,000 D.C. luxury yacht."	half-true	/west-virginia/statements/2018/sep/28/national-republican-senatorial-committee/does-joe-manchin-have-700000-luxury-yacht/	The National Republican Senatorial Committee -- the Senate Republicans’ campaign arm -- didn’t hold back in a campaign ad aimed at Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va. The ad, released in early August, charged that "West Virginia Joe" had transformed himself into "Washington Joe." And a key exhibit for this argument was a pricey boat he owned. Manchin owns a "$700,000 D.C. luxury yacht," the ad said, illustrating the claim with a photograph showing a docked vessel. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Is this accurate? We took a closer look. Does Manchin own a boat? Manchin’s campaign does not dispute that he owns a boat, "Almost Heaven," saying it is where Manchin has typically lived when in Washington and not back home in West Virginia. In fact, the boat is hardly a secret. It has been written about periodically before; articles often mention sessions he’s held on the boat with other lawmakers to negotiate legislation and strategy. In 2014, for instance, Time magazine wrote that both "Almost Heaven" and Manchin’s previous vessel, the "Black Tie," serve as "a kind of floating incubator of that tenderest of Washington flowers in the first decades of the 21st century: bipartisanship." Is the vessel worth $700,000? To back up its assertion, the NRSC provided PolitiFact with a document labeled "general index or abstract of title continuation sheet No. 1," the cost of the vessel was listed $700,000. Manchin’s campaign instead offered a different document with a lower dollar figure. That document, a memorandum of sale from 2014, said the purchase price for the vessel was $220,000. The document says that Manchin purchased the boat from M&T Bank, with National Liquidators as the broker of the sale. Independent experts we contacted were unable to explain the difference in the two dollar figures, beyond speculating that the vessel was purchased from a seller eager to get rid of it and later insured at the boat’s market value. Is it a "luxury yacht"? According to Boats.com, any vessel "over 40 feet long almost always qualifies" as a yacht. By the length standard alone, that would qualify "Almost Heaven" as a yacht: The vessel, built in 2001, is 65 feet long, according to Coast Guard documents provided to PolitiFact by the NRSC. Whether it’s a "luxury" vessel, however, is in the eye of the beholder. According to the Westlawn Institute of Marine Technology, the word "yacht ... connotes elegance and expense." Boats.com adds, "Just as a cocky walk would never be mistaken for a limping shuffle, yacht attitude is the net result of a combination of factors that are easy to spot as a group but hard to quantify individually." The vessel is listed as "recreational" on documents. However, a less confrontational -- but similarly accurate -- description could be "houseboat," since it is Manchin’s residence in Washington. Our ruling The NRSC said that Manchin has a "$700,000 D.C. luxury yacht." There’s no dispute that Manchin has a boat docked in Washington, D.C. Its 40-foot length would generally qualify it as a yacht, but since Manchin lives there when he is in town, it could be just as easily described as a houseboat. The vessel was purchased for much less, but it appears to be insured for $700,000. Whether it qualifies as a "luxury" vessel is a matter of opinion. The information we’ve found backs up elements of both the NRSC’s original assertion and Manchin’s counterargument, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-02021	Four (maybe five) Latinos have served on the Austin City Council.	true	/texas/statements/2014/jun/06/mike-martinez/few-hispanic-residents-elected-austin-city-council/	Austin City Council member Mike Martinez, who declared his candidacy for mayor in April 2014, says he could be part of historic changes in the November 2014 elections. We didn’t catch Martinez’s precise remarks at the May 28, 2014, HABLA Platica gathering in East Austin. Asked later to repeat himself, Martinez said in a voice-mail message: "I think we’ve had four Latinos in the designated ‘gentlemen’s agreement’ seat" on the council," plus, he said, another council member who says he was Latino, the late Robert Barnstone. "That would be five total," Martinez said, adding he speculated at the event that up to five Hispanic residents could be elevated to the council all at once in the November elections. For the first time, voters are poised to fill 10 council seats from within geographic districts with the mayor’s job filled, as before, by citywide balloting. And has Austin, which was incorporated in 1839, only had a few Hispanic council members? News organizations including the Austin American-Statesman have noted the "gentlemen’s agreement" mentioned by Martinez as explaining why the seven-member council, elected citywide, has rarely had more than a black and an Hispanic member. Under the so-called agreement, certain seats on the council were seen among many as reserved for members of those minority groups to seek. The results: A "Milestones" web page created by the city says John Treviño was the first Hispanic citizen elected to the council; he won Place 5 on May 3, 1975. Voters had made Beryl Handcox the council’s first African American in May 1971, according to the page. An Aug. 20, 2010, Statesman news feature story on local Mexican American pioneers called Treviño the first Hispanic on the council and further said Gus Garcia, a former Austin school board trustee, later won election to the council before winning election in 2000 as mayor. Garcia, who like Treviño initially won Place 5 on the council, said Treviño and Richard Moya, the first Mexican American elected to the Travis County Commissioners Court, were "young Turks" who sought to break free from a long-standing system in which a handful of Hispanic leaders and businessmen had access to Anglo leaders, the story said. "We wanted to make it more democratic," Garcia said then. "None of us thought about doing this so we could be recognized. We did it because there was a need in the (Mexican American) community." To our request for detail, city spokeswoman Alicia Dean guided us to the Austin History Center where researcher Jeff Carrillo pointed out city election results through history, posted online. This enabled us to build a chart indicating four Spanish-surnamed winners of council seats. In 2000, environmental activist Raul Alvarez won election to Place 2 on the council, to which Garcia didn’t seek re-election, our chart indicates. Alvarez was re-elected in 2003 but didn’t seek another term in 2006, when Martinez initially won the seat. This leaves Barnstone, who succeeded Treviño in Place 5 in 1988. Garcia, asked for his recollections, told us by email that in Austin’s Mexican-American community, Barnstone wasn’t considered "one of us." Separately, the center’s Molly Hults pointed out Barnstone’s June 25, 2008, Statesman paid obituary stating Barnstone grew up in Laredo as part of a "legendary Texas and Mexican family." At the time, the Statesman’s front-page news story on Barnstone’s passing described him as a charismatic developer and "campaigner who never failed to use his fluent Spanish on the trail - his mother, born in Veracruz, Mexico, raised him; his Anglo father died before Barnstone was born." Our ruling Martinez said there have been four or maybe five Hispanic council members. We'd say five. We rate this statement as True.

pomt-12632	"Just last May, the Department of Justice inspector general found that these (‘sanctuary city’) policies also violate federal law."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/30/jeff-sessions/jeff-sessions-misleads-saying-inspector-general-fo/	Attorney General Jeff Sessions said "sanctuary cities" that won’t cooperate immigration authorities are acting unlawfully and stand to lose funds if they don’t comply. The Justice Department’s inspector general has determined that policies in such jurisdictions are illegal, Sessions said March 27. "Not only do these policies endanger lives of every American, just last May, the Department of Justice inspector general found that these policies also violate federal law," Sessions, who began leading the department this year under Trump’s administration, said during a White House press briefing. Is that accurate? Sessions is exaggerating what the inspector general actually said. Inspector general’s memo President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to cut federal funding for so-called sanctuary cities, claiming they harbor criminals and risk public safety. There is not a legal, federal definition for "sanctuary cities," but they’re generally regarded as local governments that limit their cooperation with immigration officials. Usually they do that by refusing to hold people in local jails (beyond the time they would have been released) when asked to do so by U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement. That’s called a refusal to honor a detainer request. ICE detainers ask local law enforcement agencies to alert the federal agency of upcoming releases of individuals and to detain them for up to 48 hours so that immigration authorities can pick them up. Jurisdictions with "sanctuary" policies argue that they have good reasons not to co-operate with immigration officials. They say that their policies help build trust between local police and their community, and that their cities are not crime magnets. Amid Trump’s call to cut funding for sanctuary cities, some cities such as Boston and New York remain committed to policies that shield immigrants. Others, fearing a loss of money, have walked back their policies. A day after Trump signed an executive order to advance his promise, Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez directed county officials to comply with detainer requests, though he had previously claimed his jurisdiction was not a sanctuary. Sessions was basing his claim that the cities were violating the law on an inspector general’s memo. In May 2016, Michael E. Horowitz, the Justice Department inspector general wrote a memo to the assistant attorney general for the Office of Justice Programs in response to queries on whether jurisdictions receiving department grants were violating the law, specifically 8 U.S. Code Section 1373. Section 1373 says federal, state or local government entities or officials may not prohibit or restrict the exchange of information with federal immigration officers regarding the citizenship or immigration status of any individual. Of the more than 140 jurisdictions in question, the inspector general’s office took a sample of 10 jurisdictions, which included the state of California, Chicago, and Miami-Dade County in Florida. It reviewed their policies regarding their interaction and communication with ICE and asked ICE officials for feedback. All 10 jurisdictions had policies limiting in some way their cooperation with ICE detainer requests, the May 2016 memo said. But local jails are not required by law to respond to detainers requests, and the handling of detainers is not addressed in Section 1373. Yet the May 2016 memo raised concerns about the wording in some local ordinances and how officials may be interpreting and applying them. For instance, a Chicago ordinance said, "except as otherwise provided under applicable federal law, no agent or agency shall disclose information regarding the citizenship or immigration status of any person unless required to do so by legal process." The inspector general’s office raised concerns on whether Chicago city employees were aware of their legal authority to act against the local ordinance and respond to ICE detainer requests. Policies in other jurisdictions besides Chicago "may be causing local officials to believe and apply the policies in a manner that prohibits or restricts cooperation with ICE in all respects. That, of course, would be inconsistent with and prohibited by Section 1373." A spokesman for Sessions highlighted the previous line as backup for the attorney general’s claim. But that line has a footnote, which says: "The ICE officials we spoke with noted that no one at (Department of Homeland Security) or ICE has made a formal legal determination whether certain state and local laws or policies violate Section 1373, and we are unaware of any Department of Justice decision in that regard. These ICE officials were also unaware of any legal action taken by the federal government against a state or local jurisdiction to require cooperation." Experts evaluate Sessions’ interpretation Several immigration law scholars we reached out to disagreed with Sessions’ read of the memo. We spoke with five immigration law scholars; four of them disagreed with Sessions' interpretation of the memo. The closest support for Sessions' claim came from Gabriel (Jack) Chin, a professor and director of clinical legal education at the University of California-Davis law school. The concerns raised by the inspector general give Sessions’ claim some credence, he said. "While there is a little hedge because no jurisdiction has been accused of violating 1373, or found to have done so, my reading is that some jurisdictions are in apparent violation of the law," Chin said. The other were more skeptical. "Sessions went beyond what the report said. The report expresses concern that some cities’ policies might violate section 1373, but in the end the report stops short of finding any violations," said Hiroshi Motomura, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law. "In fact, the language of the report seems carefully chosen to limit itself to raising concerns without finding violations." The "may" qualification in the report "is far from a definitive conclusion that these policies are against the law," said Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University who has opined in the Washington Post that Trump’s executive order related to so-called sanctuary cities is unconstitutional. "The inspector general had no real information, but merely a vague idea that it was possible that in some jurisdictions policies may be causing a violation of Section 1373," said Margo Schlanger, a law professor at the University of Michigan who used to run the civil rights office at Department of Homeland Security during the Obama administration. The argument in the inspector general's memo seems to be that the policies could violate Section 1373 as applied, noted Huyen Pham, a law professor at Texas A&M University School of Law. "But the inspector general recognizes that this argument would require a lot more systematic gathering of empirical information than what it did in its investigation," Pham said. "Thus the carefully couched 'may be' language." Our ruling Sessions said, "Just last May, the Department of Justice inspector general found that these (‘sanctuary’) policies also violate federal law." A memo issued by the inspector general raised questions about how local officials may be interpreting and applying ordinances that limit their cooperation with federal immigration authorities. But the memo also explicitly said a formal legal determination on whether certain state and local laws or policies violate Section 1373 had not been made by immigration officials and that his office was unaware of any Justice Department decision in that regard. Sessions’ statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-09439	"Obama has proposed a 1.4% pay increase for active duty military in 2011. This is THE LOWEST SINCE 1973 ... A LOWER PAY INCREASE THAN WELFARE RECIPIENTS!!!"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/11/chain-email/obama-pay-increase-military-based-formula/	Here at PolitiFact, we're huge fans of social media. So when readers requested we check a claim that had gone viral over Facebook, we jumped at the chance. Here's what they sent us: "Obama has proposed a 1.4% pay increase for active duty military in 2011. This is THE LOWEST SINCE 1973! Nice to know that during a time of rampant inflation, while war is fought in 2 theatres, our men and women in uniform get A LOWER PAY INCREASE THAN WELFARE RECIPIENTS!!! Please repost if you support our troops" This is a first for us; the claim is part status update, part chain e-mail. To check this claim, it's important to understand how the government typically treats military pay raises. By law, the administration is required to propose pay increases that match increases in the Employment Cost Index, a quarterly economic report that details changes in the costs of labor for businesses. Military pay is tied to this measure to ensure that pay keeps up with salaries in the private sector. Now, while the administration is required to match the ECI, the law does give the president some discretion. In national emergencies or "serious economic conditions affecting the general welfare" the president can propose an alternative pay adjustment up or down. In fact, the last president to use this authority was Bill Clinton, who actually proposed no pay increase for the military in 1994, according to Colonel Michael Hayden, deputy director of government relations for the Military Officers Association of America. But Congress ultimately approved a 2.2 percent increase. Obama recently released his budget for 2011, and it included a 1.4 percent pay raise for military personnel, which, again, is in line with the ECI. Clearly, that's lower than the 2.9 percent increase Obama requested last year. But that's because wages and salaries in the private sector only increased 1.4 percent during 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collects and publishes the data. It's the smallest percentage change since the BLS started collecting such data in 1975. So, it's true that Obama has proposed a 1.4 percent pay increase for the military in 2011. By law, it's what he was required to propose. In fact, because the pay raises come out of the Department of Defense budget, it has asked Congress not to exceed the 1.4 percent pay raise, because the department needs those funds for other programs, including $50 billion to fully fund the Defense Health Program and sustain benefits for about 9.5 million beneficiaries, $2.2 billion for the care of wounded soldiers, and a $500 million increase in funding for family support programs, according to the Department of Defense. But the smallest since 1973, as the Facebook message suggests? It seems that number came from news reports that, if approved, the pay increase would be the smallest since the military became an all-volunteer force in 1973 and military pay rates were overhauled to match private sector pay for civilian workers with similar skills, education and experience. So, setting 1973 as the benchmark sets up a reasonable comparison. But Hayden also sent us the a copy of page 51 of the Fifth Edition of the the Military Compensation Background Papers, which includes data going as far back as 1945. According to that document, military personnel got no pay increase in 1962, making Obama's proposal the smallest since then. The last part of the claim -- that the military pay increase is lower than what welfare recipients are getting this year -- was nearly impossible to sort out. That's because the term "welfare" refers to an array of programs, including Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), Medicaid, the Child Nutrition Program and food stamps. Many of these programs are administered by the states. For example, with TANF the federal government gives block grants to states, which use these funds to operate low-income benefits. That funding has not increased since 1996, according to Liz Schott, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. It's worth noting that the food stamp program got a funding boost in the stimulus bill; the legislation allocated $295 million to states to administer the program and a $19.9 billion temporary benefits increase for recipients. But Congress doesn't approve an annual "pay increase" for welfare recipients as it does for the military. So, there's really no comparison. So, this viral Facebook update is correct that Obama proposed a 1.4 percent pay increase for military personnel in 2011. Depending on the time frame, it's the smallest since 1973 or 1962. But there are some big inaccuracies about this claim as well. First and foremost, there's really no such thing as a pay increase for welfare recipients, so it's impossible to compare military pay to support for low-income communities. Furthermore, the claim leaves out important details about why Obama chose a 1.4 percent pay increase; in short, he's required to by law. And while Congress can approve a larger number -- and under extenuating circumstances, the president can propose an alternative pay raise -- the administration is discouraging Congress from doing so in order to keep other military programs, such as health care, well funded. Because this claim leaves out important details, we find it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2010-03-11T13:51:54	2010-03-10	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-00837	Recent solar energy policies in Georgia "have resulted in rate hikes and did not result in solar becoming any more economically viable."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2015/mar/24/americans-prosperity-florida/koch-backed-group-says-georgia-solar-policies-cost/	A group backed by the Koch brothers is arguing a proposed constitutional amendment that would change Florida solar energy regulations will lead the Sunshine State down a dark path. Americans For Prosperity Florida says a petition being circulated by solar advocates Floridians for Solar Choice is the wrong move for the state, and will result in higher costs and decreased competition. The proposal needs nearly 700,000 signatures to get on the 2016 ballot, allowing voters to decide on an amendment that would change current Florida law that says customers can only buy electricity from a utility. If the amendment is approved, customers could buy electricity from solar installers and not just utility companies. We’ve written about it before here. At a March 10, 2015, news conference, AFP members said the amendment was misguided. They backed up their point of view by implying Georgia’s solar policies are "burdensome and expensive government mandates" that shouldn’t be emulated, and cited a Louisiana study that solar power would be very expensive to implement. AFP Florida followed up the conference with a release that read, "In Georgia, similar net metering policies have resulted in rate hikes and did not result in solar becoming any more economically viable." Is it true that energy regulations in Georgia -- often cited as a leader in implementing new solar policies -- have made electric rates go up? Time to rate the rates. Electric move It turns out we’ll be taking a quick look at Louisiana, too, because that’s the state AFP meant to name when citing net metering. They apologized and said they would correct the release, thanking PolitiFact for pointing out the error. We’ll be discussing both states for this check. What is net metering, anyway? In simplest terms, it’s the process of selling self-generated electricity, such as the power made by solar panels on your house, back to a utility company for a credit. The proposed Florida amendment doesn’t really concern itself with that, but rather removes a roadblock to buying power from someone other than a registered electric provider, like Duke Energy or Florida Power & Light. Right now, if a solar provider wants to sell its power, it must sell it to one of these utilities. Critics say being able to end this monopoly is key to expanding solar efforts in Florida, which is ranked 13th in solar installations by the Solar Energy Industries Association. Florida also is one of five states that specifically outlaw buying solar power directly from a provider. The others are Kentucky, North Carolina, Oklahoma and Georgia. While Georgia isn’t trying to open the market the same way the Florida amendment would, the Peach State is enjoying its own moment in the sunshine on the subject of solar. The state in 2008 offered homeowner tax credits to boost solar installations, a program that expired in 2014.The Georgia Public Service Commission worked with the state’s largest utility, Georgia Power, to create the Georgia Power Advanced Solar Initiative in 2012. The utility created programs to let businesses and homeowners sell solar energy to Georgia Power, as well as working out power-purchase agreements with big solar developers. The plan has been called a success by advocates, the state’s PSC and electric providers, and plans for expanding the amount of solar power in the state are in the works. Georgia Power has said there has been no "upward pressure on consumer rates." Spokesman John Kraft told PolitiFact Florida that from the beginning, part of the initiative was that the company would be able to buy solar-generated electricity at or below rates it would cost the company for traditional means, such as electricity generated by burning fossil fuels or using nuclear power. The program was voluntary from the beginning and not a state mandate. "There isn’t a regulation per se that says you have to do this amount," Kraft said. "The PSC had been asking us for ways to do more solar." So what about Louisiana? AFP Florida told us that’s really the place that saw higher electric rates because of solar policies. They cited a 2015 study for the Louisiana Public Service Commission, which was debating what to charge solar power customers for electricity. The report focused on the state’s 50 percent tax credit for installing new solar panels, and said those credits cost the state at least $89 million. The study became controversial because the study’s author -- consultant and Louisiana State University energy studies professor David Dismukes -- had written favorably about the oil and gas industries before. Solar advocates called the report biased for not focusing on the jobs the industry had created and misrepresenting how the state’s tax credits work. Setting aside the controversy over the study, Louisiana customers outside of New Orleans did see a base rate hike in 2014, which cost the average ratepayer about 47 cents per month. But that increase was approved by the PSC in 2013 and was over several issues, including the cost of maintaining an aging power grid. Electric utility company Entergy did not specifically mention solar as being an issue when announcing the base rate change. Last year, Louisiana voted to end its 50 percent tax credit for solar installations in 2017. Gov. Bobby Jindal is considering cutting it sooner to fill a $1.6 billion budget gap this year. So while Louisiana did see a rate increase, we don’t see evidence that it was specifically related to a solar initiative. Our ruling Americans for Prosperity Florida said recent solar energy policies in Georgia "have resulted in rate hikes and did not result in solar becoming any more economically viable." The group admitted it meant to say Louisiana, which is having its own debate on the issue. But the program in Georgia is thriving. Part of Georgia's implementation plan was that using solar power wouldn’t affect rates, and it hasn’t, Georgia’s largest utility said. Louisiana did see a rate increase, but it doesn't seem to be specifically related to a solar initiative. The statement is completely wrong. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-13905	Gov. Terry McAuliffe "has made several statements that he would love to be in a Cabinet secretary position with the Clinton administration."	false	/virginia/statements/2016/jun/27/bryce-reeves/bryce-reeves-falsely-says-terry-mcauliffe-has-voic/	State Sen. Bryce Reeves is out to prove that Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s restoration of voting rights to more than 200,000 felons who served their time is a ploy to help Democrat Hillary Clinton win the presidency this fall. On June 17, Reeves filed a request under the Virginia’s Freedom of Information Act for all communications between the governor’s office and Clinton’s campaign. In a news release that day, the senator said that McAuliffe’s restoration order was "motivated by his attempt to help Hillary Clinton win Virginia in the fall." Reeves, R-Spotsylvania, elaborated during a June 19 interview on NewsRadio WINA in Charlottesville. "Certainly, he’s looking out for his own skin," Reeves said of McAuliffe. "It goes without saying that he’s made several statements that he would love to be in a Cabinet secretary position with the Clinton administration, and we’re trying to uncover that. We’re going to get to the bottom of this. One way or another, we’re going to find out what’s going on." No doubt McAuliffe, a Democrat, is a longtime close friend and key fundraiser for Clinton and, should she win, we wouldn’t be surprised to see him working for the White House in some capacity. But we hadn’t heard the governor say once - let alone "several" times - that he’s aiming for a Cabinet seat. On the other hand, we have heard the governor promise to serve out his term, ending in January 2018. And during a June 3 interview on radio station WURV (103.7 FM) in Richmond, McAuliffe questioned whether his "temperament is right to be sitting in a Cabinet" and said he’s "never worked for someone else in his life." So we asked Reeves for evidence that McAuliffe has stated his ambition to be in Clinton’s Cabinet. Bill Clinton Reeves, in an email, pointed to a story McAuliffe told in his 2007 autobiography, "What a Party!" McAuliffe devoted a large part of the book to talking about his friendship and fundraising feats for another Clinton - former President Bill Clinton. McAuliffe wrote that during a 1 a.m. game of cards with the Clintons at the White House in May 1999, the president mentioned that Secretary of Commerce Bill Daley would be resigning. Dorothy McAuliffe said her husband would be a good replacement, and both Clintons agreed. "I was excited driving home that night with Dorothy thinking about being in Bill Clinton’s cabinet as secretary of commerce, and was especially pleased by the prospect of not raising money any more," McAuliffe wrote. But the appointment was scrubbed the next morning. McAuliffe wrote that John Podesta, the White House chief of staff, told him it would be hard to win congressional approval of a Cabinet nominee who had such close political ties to the president. McAuliffe wrote that Bill Clinton instead was willing to name him to be ambassador to the United Kingdom - a job he also would "love" to land. But at the request of then-Vice President Al Gore, McAuliffe wrote that he instead agreed to become chairman of the 2000 Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles. Hillary Clinton Reeves never mentioned Bill Clinton during the radio interview. But he and radio host Rob Schilling named Hillary Clinton five times during the six-minute chat and referred to her campaign three more times. And, of course, Reeves said the goal of his FOIA request is to uncover what he claims is a political deal between McAuliffe and Hillary Clinton. So what evidence does Reeves offer that McAuliffe has said he would love to be in Hillary Clinton’s Cabinet? The senator points to: •Five articles from newspapers and electronic publications about McAuliffe’s intentions to help Clinton’s campaign. None of them mention a Cabinet position. •A partial transcript of a March 31 radio interview on WVMP in Roanoke during which McAuliffe talks about his friendship with Hillary Clinton and says, if she’s elected, "I’m going to try to convince her that everything should go to Virginia." No mention of an administration post. •An April 22 article in the Richmond Times-Dispatch on McAuliffe’s announcement of the blanket restoration of voting rights for felons. Reeves points to a disapproving quote by House Speaker Bill Howell, R-Stafford, who said McAuliffe views the governorship "as a stepping stone to a job in Hillary Clinton’s Cabinet." We searched the archives of four newspapers - The Times-Dispatch, The Washington Post, The Virginian-Pilot and the Daily Press -- from the start of McAuliffe’s term in January 2014 to present. We didn’t find a single article in which the governor said he wanted a Cabinet post, or any White House position, should Hillary Clinton become president. Our ruling Reeves says McAuliffe "has made several statements that he would love to be in a Cabinet secretary position with the Clinton administration." We wouldn’t be surprised to see McAuliffe wind up in the White House if Hillary Clinton becomes president. The two are longtime friends and political allies. Perhaps they’ve had private conversations about this. But Reeves says the governor is pining for a position and uses that statement as the basis of an attack: that McAuliffe has restored voting rights to more than 200,000 felons as part of an agreement to help Clinton win the presidency and to receive a Cabinet seat in return. There’s a burden on Reeves to provide evidence that McAuliffe is seeking a Cabinet seat, and he comes up empty. We rate his statement False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/813764b8-f84a-42d9-9446-c9da950d443a	None	Bryce Reeves	None	None	None	2016-06-27T12:00:00	2016-06-17	['Bill_Clinton']

Interesting claims, eh? But true? The number of Canadians visiting Florida each year is collected by Visit Florida, the state's official tourism marketing corporation. Visit Florida bases its data on credit card information and statistics supplied the Canadian government. The agency found that about 3.05 million Canadians visited Florida in 2010. That's about 9 percent of the country's total population of about 34 million. The Toronto Star noted in a recent story -- based on the Visit Florida data -- that the Canadian boost to Florida's tourism happened even as oil from the Deepwater Horizon disaster threatened Gulf of Mexico beaches. So Scott is right about the tourists. But what about Canadian homeowners? Scott's press office directed us to a 2010 study on Florida's international home buyers. The study is researched by the National Association of Realtors, which creates an annual report on the country's housing market and additional reports for states with a high rate of sales to foreign buyers. The national group takes a survey of Florida members each year, and that includes a question about foreign clients. Florida has the strongest international home sales market in the country. In 2010, foreign clients were responsible for 22 percent of existing home purchases in the state, according to the study. "Florida has consistently been the No. 1 destination among foreign buyers," said Lawrence Yun, a National Association of Realtors economist. And Canadians are a big part of that distinction. They out-bought all international buyers in 2010, accounting for 36 percent of Florida's foreign sales in 2010. United Kingdom residents are the next-best buyers at 15 percent. Sure, residents of the Great White North love the state's beaches and toasty climate. What's more, Yun said, is that these slices of paradise don't cost nearly as much as they used to, and the Canadian dollar is stronger than its weakened U.S. counterpart. There's greater consumer confidence among Canadians, which is not a bad thing for Florida. "It's absolutely helpful," Yun said. "Anytime the market is down, one way to help alleviate the pain or help the healing process is for buyers to come into the market and absorb the inventory." We wanted to find the percentage of Canadians who bought homes in Florida in 2010. So we multiplied 0.22 (portion of Florida home sales to foreign buyers in 2010) by 0.36 (Canada's share of international sales among foreign buyers) to get 0.0792. That's 7.92 percent. Scott's office did not specify how he arrived at 7.4 percent, but he's close enough. He's right that there's a clear Canadian infatuation with Florida. As one Canadian-turned-Floridian-real-estate-agent joked in a National Public Radio report on the housing phenomenon, "If there ever was an 11th (Canadian) province, it probably would be Florida." Scott has his Canada trivia down cold, and we were unable to find any statistics that contradict him. We rate his claim True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2011-06-21T12:01:45	2011-06-16	['Canada']
pomt-10249	"John McCain has voted with George Bush 90 percent of the time."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/28/barack-obama/update-obama-nailed-it/	Update: This item has been updated, but the new information didn't change the ruling. If you've been following the Democratic National Convention, you've doubtless heard any number of speakers cite the statistic that Sen. John McCain has voted with President Bush 90 percent of the time. There's no mystery to the Democratic strategy here: A vote for McCain amounts to four more years of Bush, whose approval rating is hovering near an abysmal 30 percent. So it came as no surprise when Sen. Barack Obama cited the statistic in his major convention address. "But the record's clear: John McCain has voted with George Bush 90 percent of the time. Senator McCain likes to talk about judgment, but really, what does it say about your judgment when you think George Bush was right more than ninety percent of the time? I don't know about you, but I'm not ready to take a 10 percent chance on change." The number is based on a "presidential support" score from Congressional Quarterly, which rates how often lawmakers back or oppose the president. Since 2001, McCain has, in fact, backed the president's position an average of 90 percent of the time. By congressional standards, that's solidly partisan, but hardly marching in lockstep. McCain supported Bush as infrequently as 77 percent of the time in 2005; and as high as 95 percent of the time in 2007. We should also note some factors that helped to drive up McCain's 2007 score, which was partly a reflection of the new political calculus in the Democratic-controlled Congress. That year, McCain missed more than half the votes on which Bush had a position, as he campaigned for the White House. But repeated votes on immigration and the Iraq war — two issues on which he was closely allied with Bush — as well as filibuster votes helped elevate McCain from one of the president's chief Republican adversaries three years ago to one of his biggest supporters. Over the course of the election, we've looked at this statistic a couple of times, and in a couple variations. In June, we ruled it True when Obama said "McCain decided to stand with George Bush 95 percent of the time (last year)." But we dinged running mate Joe Biden a bit when he said at an Aug. 23, 2008, rally in Springfield, Ill., "You can't change America when you supported George Bush's policies 95 percent of the time." Because Biden didn't note a year when he cited McCain's highest "presidential support" score — thereby suggesting an overall score — we ruled his statement only Half True. Here, Obama cites McCain's average presidential support score since Bush was elected. We checked our math, and although we had first said Obama was off by 1 percent, we have since realized that Obama wasn't, we were. It's 90 percent on the nose. True.

pomt-07305	Says there are more federal dollars in Gov. John Kasich's budget plan than in the previous state budget.	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/may/18/jay-goyal/state-rep-jay-goyal-says-new-kasich-budget-plan-us/	A long-running debate at the Statehouse has focused on the role that federal stimulus money played in former Gov. Ted Strickland’s last state budget. From the day it was first introduced in February 2009, Republicans ripped Strickland’s budget for relying on billions in federal stimulus dollars to help Ohio shore its state budget. The now-absent federal stimulus dollars are the chief reason, Republicans have long argued, that they are now forced to make gouging cuts in education and local government funds to keep the next state budget in balance. House Democrats tried to turn the tables on that GOP argument during the seven-hour-long floor debate May 5, 2011, over the next state budget. They did so by noting that the state budget proposed by Republican Gov. John Kasich actually had more federal dollars in it then the one crafted by Democrats in 2009. "I think it’s important to note that even accounting for the federal stimulus dollars, there are more federal dollars in this biennial than there are federal dollars in the previous biennial budget," said Rep. Jay Goyal, a Mansfield lawmaker. "I think that’s an important fact to note." House Republicans immediately jumped on Goyal’s statement with Rep. Ron Amstutz, a Wooster Republican, even invoking PolitiFact Ohio saying that should be awarded a Pants on Fire rating. Does it? House Democratic Caucus spokeswoman Melissa Fazekas pulled some numbers from Strickland’s current state budget, which runs through June 30, as well as Kasich’s proposal for the next state budget. The House Democratic numbers — taken from the state budget summary put together by the Office of Budget and Management under Kasich — show a total of $6.9 billion in federal dollars in 2010 and $8.2 billion in 2011 deposited into Ohio’s general revenue fund. That’s a total of $15.1 billion in federal dollars over both years of Strickland’s budget. Meanwhile, Kasich’s proposed budget for 2012-13 relies on $7.55 billion in 2012 and $8.49 billion in 2013. That’s a total of $16.04 billion — or about $940 million more than what Strickland had to used in his budget, according to the chart Democrats relied upon. So Goyal’s right? Not so fast. The chart on which House Democrats relied only compares the federal dollars in the state’s general revenue fund in both budgets. And while that’s the usual place where federal dollars end up in state budgets, Strickland’s budget director Pari Sabety moved portions of the state’s Medicaid program "off-budget" in 2009, so not all the federal money went into the state’s general revenue fund. In fact, a state budget document titled "estimated one-time revenue source" prepared by the Strickland administration has a notation marked "footnote D" concerning a pot of federal money known as enhanced Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP. Basically, federal officials decided to reimburse states at a higher rate for Medicare and Medicaid costs than they normally do—picking up 73 cents of every dollar spent on medical care instead of the usual rate of 64 cents. The footnote explains that only a small portion of that enhanced FMAP money was funneled into the state’s general revenue fund. "Under budget framework, an additional $1.3 billion in FY 2010 and $590 million in FY 2011 is deposited into non-GRF funds," the footnote says. Put simply, there was nearly $1.9 billion in federal dollars in the last budget beyond what was in Ohio’s general revenue fund. And that’s not all. That’s because federal officials added even more money to the enhanced FMAP program in September 2010—about $293 million funneled "off-budget" which was ladled out to Ohio hospitals, mental health providers and drug assistance for HIV positive patients as well as the state departments of aging and mental health. Add this to our previous pile of federal money and you have about $17.3 billion in federal dollars that flowed into Ohio in the last budget cycle -- roughly $1.26 billion more than the budget proposed by Kasich. Goyal’s statement did contain some element of truth, but the phrase he used was "more federal dollars" which should include all of the money coming from the federal government, not just funds flowing into the GRF. Not including the Medicaid dollars ignores a critical fact that would give the listener a different impression. On the Truth-O-Meter, that mean’s Goyal’s statement rates as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07216	Virginia is "headed towards another surplus this year, unlike most states."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2011/jun/04/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-virginia-among-few-state-heading-to/	While touring Asia to drum up business for Virginia, Gov. Bob McDonnell boasted about the Old Dominion’s prudent state government. "We’re headed towards another surplus this year, unlike most states," McDonnell said in a Skype interview from Beijing with NBC 12 reporter Ryan Nobles. After years of budget cutting in Richmond and other state capitols, is Virginia really among an elite group of states in the black? We decided to find out. Like many states, Virginia has cut spending in recent years. McDonnell and his predecessor, Tim Kaine, worked with legislators to overcome about $6 billion in budget shortfalls. Virginia, like just about every state, is required to have a balanced budget. About $2.34 billion of the shortfall was mended through budget cuts. The rest of the shortfall was closed with federal stimulus money, transfers from the state’s "rainy day" fund and other one-time bookkeeping maneuvers, including the deferment of $850 million in contributions to the state retirement system. In addition, the state required businesses to pay one month of sales tax revenue early. Virginia’s fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30. Last summer, McDonnell announced the state closed the 2010 budget with a $403 million surplus. About $175 million came from lower-than-expected spending by stage agencies. The rest came from tax revenues that were higher than projected. So with one month left in the 2011 fiscal year, is another surplus on its way? Finance Secretary Ric Brown estimated that state tax revenues in fiscal 2011 would be 3.5 percent higher than the prior year. But through 10 months, receipts have actually climbed by 4.5 percent. That extra money, if it holds, would yield a surplus in the state’s $15.4 billion general fund which pays for education, health programs and public safety. The McDonnell administration has not publicly estimated of the amount of left-over money it expects. But that doesn’t mean Virginia is back to full financial health. The 2010 surplus, even if supplemented by a 2011 windfall, is far smaller than the cuts made by Virginia during past years. And the $1.9 billion in federal stimulus money used by the state won’t be in future budgets. According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, Virginia’s general tax revenues peaked in at $17 billion in 2008 and probably won’t return to that pre-recession high until 2013. So Virginia is indeed on track to post its second consecutive surplus. But the state will also need to make up deferred pension contributions in future budgets. Robert Vaughn, staff director of the House Appropriations Committee, said the pension retributions will be made over a number of years and won’t necessarily match the $850 million in contributions Virginia skipped during the recession. What’s the story in other states? Todd Haggerty, a fiscal policy analyst for the National Conference of State Legislatures, said most states expect 2011 revenue to climb from 2010. Despite the growth, he said all states except North Dakota are still below their peak revenue levels, which most reached in 2008. A majority of states are not expected to return to peak revenues until 2014 or later, according to a study. Michigan does not anticipate hitting that mark before 2020 -- at least seven years after Virginia. Haggerty pointed out that states try to match spending to revenue as closely as possible, and posting a surplus means those estimates were off. Still, he said, it is "better to be off towards a surplus rather than a deficit." In March, the NCSL said 21 states were reporting that personal income taxes were coming in above estimates, while 17 more said the receipts were on target. The National Association of State Budget Officers came up with similar numbers in a June 2 report. The group said that fiscal 2011 tax revenues are exceeding projections in 22 states, on target in 11 states, and below estimates in 17 states. That may sound like good news, but NASBO says there is more to these possible surpluses than meets the eye. "While any surplus is a positive sign, such surpluses are more likely the result of cuts in spending from previous fiscal years as well as conservative revenue forecasts," the group said in its June report. Let’s review our findings. McDonnell said, "We’re heading towards a surplus this year, unlike most states." With 10 months of revenue data in hand, Virginia is on track to post a surplus in the 2011 fiscal year. That would follow a surplus in 2010, but state revenue is still below pre-recession levels. McDonnell seems correct that a minority of states are heading towards surpluses. The NCSL said in March that 21 states were reporting personal income tax revenues were exceeding projections. In June, NASBO reported that overall tax revenues were coming in over estimates in 22 states. Even with a surplus, Virginia will be working for years to make up for contributions it withheld from the state pension fund to balance the budget during the recession. The state has also relied on federal stimulus dollars that will not be available in the future. So it’s reasonable to question whether the state is really in the black. For that reason, we rate the governor’s statement Mostly True.	None	Bob McDonnell	None	None	None	2011-06-04T06:00:00	2011-05-13	['None']
pomt-00261	Viral internet photo shows a young Christine Blasey Ford	pants on fire!	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/04/lanny-lancaster/gop-county-leader-shares-fake-photo-ford-blasey/	The internet meme machine went into overdrive when sexual assault allegations were made against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. Dallas Woodhouse, director of the North Carolina Republican Party, tweeted that one of Kavanaugh’s accusers, Julie Swetnick, should be arrested, The News & Observer reported. Bloggers claimed to have photos of professor Christine Blasey Ford, the first woman to bring forward allegations against Kavanaugh, has been pictured George Soros, and that Ford’s lawyer was pictured with Hillary Clinton. As PolitiFact shows, it’s not Ford in the photos. Now, Lanny Lancaster, Cabarrus County GOP chairman, has shared a photo allegedly of Ford, one of Kavanaugh’s accusers, that was originally posted on Facebook by an account under the name Joseph T. Mannarino. Lancaster shared the photo, which shows a young woman wearing braces and large glasses, adding the comment: "This is the alleged sexual assault victim. Wow." On Oct. 2, Democratic congressional candidate Frank McNeill included the post in an email newsletter as an example of a Republican "assault on the safety and dignity of American women." McNeill is running against Republican U.S. Rep. Richard Hudson in the 8th district, which runs from Fayetteville in southeastern North Carolina to the north Charlotte area. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Mannarino’s post has been shared over 12,000 times, and has around 800 comments. Contacted by The News & Observer, Lancaster said in a phone interview that there’s nothing inappropriate about his post. "I didn’t say anything. I just said this is her picture. Basically, the media is distorting the facts on this lady. Everything she’s said is made up. She has no evidence whatsoever. I support that theory," Lancaster said. In addition, Lancaster shared why he shared the photo. "The media wants you to think she was a beautiful young lady who was on her way home from the tennis courts ... " Lancaster said. "I just wanted you to see the real person. I wanted people to see that this is really her." This caught our attention because several photos of Ford from her teenage years are circulating, and they don’t look like the one Lancaster shared. If there are different photos of Ford, then which is real? A member of Ford’s legal team confirmed the photo from Mannarino's post isn’t Ford. The picture was circulating as early as 2012 in a Daily Mail article, though no name was provided. The first known claim the person in the photo is Ford appears on Oct. 1 on the messaging board 4Chan -- a site known for spreading false information. (PolitiFact explained how 4Chan was used to spread false information during the 2016 presidential elections.) The image also appeared on Reddit, and has been used in lists focusing on bad yearbook photos or hairstyles, like this one. Our ruling The photo shared by Lanny Lancaster is not Ford. Her legal team has confirmed that. In addition, the picture has appeared as early as six years prior to the allegation, and has since been circulating as a meme. We rate this claim Pants on Fire! This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

pomt-10644	"Ronald Reagan did amnesty."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/06/rudy-giuliani/yep-reagan-did-the-a-word/	The GOP candidates keep sparring over who's tougher on immigration. In this climate, dem is fightin' words to say your opponent supports "sanctuary" or "amnesty" for illegal immigrants. But as Giuliani reminded his foes during the Jan. 5, 2008, Republican debate, none other than Ronald Reagan, the patron saint of modern-day conservatism, signed the very law that Republicans call amnesty. Say it ain't so! Sorry. It's so. In 1986, Reagan signed an immigration reform bill, the first in 20 years, that legalized the status for 1.7-million people. Some defenders of the law dispute the term "amnesty." But here's how Edwin Meese, Reagan's former attorney general, characterizes what his boss did: "President Reagan called this what it was: amnesty. Indeed, look up the term 'amnesty' in Black's Law Dictionary, and you'll find it says, 'the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act provided amnesty for undocumented aliens already in the country.' " Reagan signed the bill after Republicans and Democrats cobbled together an amnesty program in response to concerns from farmers worried about harvesting profits. The official record of congressional debates shows that lawmakers intended the program to provide a steady supply of labor for growers of perishable crops, such as cherries, grapes, peaches, etc. At the time the bill was written, however, "perishable" was defined so loosely that more durable crops such as potted plants, tobacco and seedlings were lumped in as well. So even at the start, this program could be interpreted in ways that would benefit employers looking to save on wages. To qualify for temporary status, migrants had to show they entered the United States before Jan. 1, 1982, and that they had continuously resided since then. They could get permanent residency within 18 months after that if they met certain requirements, such as learning English. The program took effect in 1987, also covering up to 350,000 people who had worked in U.S. agriculture at least 90 days in each of the preceding three years. Many have called the program a success because it awarded green cards to 2.7-million migrants, giving them the hope of entry to the American middle class. In exchange for the amnesty, the new law was supposed to have beefed up border patrols and stiffened fines for both the migrant workers and employers in cases of violation. Alas, the law failed to stop illegal immigration, and many critics of the law say the government never thoroughly regulated employers who skirted the law's requirements. This much is certain: If the law aimed to curb illegal immigration, it failed: When the law was passed, there were about 5-million illegal immigrants; now, there's an estimated 12-million. When Reagan signed the law, many predicted it would encourage the hiring of more migrants, especially outside of agriculture, and that this would spur the backlash against immigration that we're seeing today. Giuliani, it would seem, brought up Reagan's legacy to show how difficult the immigration issue is. In doing so, he didn't trip any alarms on the Truth-O-Meter, which scores him a True.

pomt-08784	"Reporters have uncovered another Scott company accused of criminal acts. But Scott won't come clean."	false	/florida/statements/2010/aug/20/florida-first-initiative/bill-mccollum-group-attacks-rick-scotts-new-health/	Can you believe it? There's another ad in the Republican primary for governor accusing Rick Scott of fraud. This one comes from the Bill McCollum-backed group Florida First Initiative. But the subject isn't Columbia/HCA, the for-profit hospital company Scott helped build to become the nation's largest. This ad is talking about some other, unnamed company. The ad is called "Private." It opens with a narrator talking over newspaper headlines. "Rick Scott's company pleaded guilty to one of the largest Medicare frauds in American history," the narrator says, referring to Columbia/HCA. Then, the screen flips to an image of Scott ripped from one of his commercials. It shows Scott saying: "And as CEO, I take responsibility." The narrator returns. "And now, reporters have uncovered another Scott company accused of criminal acts. But Scott won't come clean." Video returns to Scott. "It's a private matter," an angry-looking Scott says. Then, the narrator responds. "Rick Scott, it's not a private matter. It's a failure of character." The ad's final frame includes big type that spells out "Rick Scott," only the C and O of Scott's last name have been replaced by handcuffs. As the ad ends, the handcuffs interlock. If our meter measured tackiness, that over-the-top symbolism would rate pretty high, but in this case we can only examine the facts surrounding the ad. So we decided to look at this statement: "Reporters have uncovered another Scott company accused of criminal acts. But Scott won't come clean." Scott company background The narrator doesn't identify the company in question by name, but when he makes the claim a tearsheet of an Aug. 5, 2010, St. Petersburg Times article appears on the screen. The article is titled "Lawsuits point to trouble at Rick Scott's current health care business." That headline refers to this story about a company Scott co-founded in 2001, Solantic. Solantic is a chain of walk-in urgent care centers, primarily around northeast Florida. The company currently operates 30 walk-in centers across the state. The article, which was written by the Miami Herald and St. Petersburg Times reported that Scott was deposed in a Solantic civil suit just six days before he announced his bid for governor. The suit, brought by Dr. P. Mark Glencross, alleged that Glencross' medical license was misused by the Jacksonville-based chain of walk-in clinics. Glencross said Solantic, without his knowledge, used his name in 2004 when it filed state paperwork designed to ensure that clinics have a medical director in charge. Within a month of Scott's deposition, the 2-year-old case was settled and both parties signed a confidentiality agreement. The story went on to mention nine other court actions filed against Solantic since 2001, which were settled. Solantic chief executive Karen Bowling told Herald/Times reporter Marc Caputo that Solantic settled the cases at the request of its insurance company, which found protracted court fights too expensive. A spokesman for Scott noted that while he is a major investor in Solantic, he doesn't run its day-to-day operations, and that Scott was involved in only two of the suits. A few days later, on Aug. 10, Scott appeared at a Tallahassee press conference where reporters asked him repeatedly if he would release the sealed deposition in the Glencross case. That's when Scott provided the line used in the Florida First Initiative ad: "It's a private matter," he said. Later in the press conference he said: "It's a private matter and I will not release the deposition." Glencross case is civil, not criminal Based on the whole of the ad -- the words of the narrator, the clips flashed on the screen, and the choice of Scott's words -- viewers and fact-checkers are left to assume that the ad is talking about the Solantic/Glencross case. In that case, there are two large distortions. First, the Solantic/Glencross case is a civil matter, not a criminal one. There are no charges of criminal wrongdoing. Second, the allegation that Scott won't come clean is misleading. He gave a deposition. He just has said he won't share that deposition with reporters. He has no legal requirement to do so, either. We tried to reach the registered agent of Florida First Initiative, J. Nottingham, for an explanation. But the number on file at the Florida Division of Elections rang dead. We should note that there is another allegation surrounding Solantic currently making news. Another former Solantic physician, Dr. Randy Prokes, sent an e-mail to the McCollum campaign claiming that Solantic billed Medicare at full rates for patients seen by a nurse practitioner, when federal rules require that billing be at 85 percent of the fee paid for physician examinations. The McCollum campaign passed the letter on to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. The FDLE then sent the letter on to the inspector general’s office at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. That's where the letter sits today. There is no formal investigation. Solantic executives, meanwhile, have described Prokes as a disgruntled former employee who was fired in 2009 for fraudulently prescribing drugs last year. Even if Prokes' claim has merit, it's not what the Florida First Initiative ad is referencing based on the ads visuals and wording. So we're not considering it. Our ruling The ad says that "reporters have uncovered another Scott company accused of criminal acts. But Scott won't come clean." The line refers to a civil lawsuit involving Solantic, a company Scott co-founded, and Dr. Gary Glencross. Glencross alleged that his medical license was misused by the Jacksonville-based chain of walk-in clinics. A month after Scott gave a deposition in the case, it was settled. Terms of the settlement are confidential. The case was a civil one, not criminal. And Scott provided a deposition as required. The only instance of him failing to "come clean" is not providing the results of that deposition to the public. Which he doesn't have to. We rate the accusation False.

pomt-08639	"Taxes went down under Jerry Brown."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/17/jerry-brown/jerry-brown-raised-taxes-not-overall/	The California governor's race between Republican Meg Whitman and Democrat Jerry Brown has turned into a political retrospective of the '70s, '80s and '90s, with a special guest appearance from Bill Clinton. Our story begins with an ad from the Whitman campaign and goes on to check a claim in a campaign ad by Brown. "Jerry Brown's good old days -- but what really happened?" asks a narrator in the Whitman ad. Cut to Clinton himself in his 1992 prime. "CNN -- not me, CNN -- says his assertion about his tax record was quote, just plain wrong. Jerry Brown went out there and took credit for the fact that the people of California voted for Proposition 13, which lowered taxes, which he opposed. And now he's going around and taking credit for it. He raised taxes as governor of California. He had a surplus when he took office and a deficit when he left. He doesn't tell the people the truth." Clinton's words were from the 1992 Democratic primary for president, when Brown and Clinton ran against each other and regularly traded barbs. Today, of course, Clinton is the former president considered to be one of the best at getting the Democratic base to turn out in elections. Brown responded to the new ad with the old footage at a meeting with his supporters on a Sunday just days after the ad ran. Either the ad touched a nerve or maybe Brown didn't know there was a camera in the room, but he lashed out -- not at the Whitman campaign, but at Clinton himself. "I mean, Clinton's a nice guy, but who ever said he always told the truth?" Brown said on Sept. 12, 2010. "You remember, right? There's that whole story there about 'did he or didn't he.' ... I did not have taxes with this state, so let's be clear about that." That's a not-so-subtle reference to Clinton's impeachment. It's not clear that Brown knew he was being taped that Sunday. He apologized to Clinton on Monday, and Clinton endorsed Brown on Tuesday. In a statement, Clinton said the ad is misleading because the CNN report he cited was "erroneous." "Moreover the tough campaign we fought 18 years ago is not relevant to the choice facing Californians today. Jerry and I put that behind us a long time ago," Clinton wrote. Brown defended his record on taxes again in his own ad. His ad says, "Wouldn't it be nice if every time Meg Whitman told a lie her nose would grow? Newspapers report that claims in this Meg Whitman ad are false, and she knows it. Taxes went down under Jerry Brown. But Whitman's nose keeps growing by the millions." Here, we're checking Brown's statement that, "Taxes went down under Jerry Brown." We started by going back to Clinton's statements in the Whitman ad and then looking at the former governor's record. The metric that the CNN report used was a calculation put together by the California Department of Finance showing the tax burden per $100 of income. In 2010, for example, the tax burden was estimated at $6.48 per $100 of personal income. (See the historical chart here.) Back in 1992, CNN's fact-check looked at the wrong years and reported that taxes went up. The most recent data shows that the tax burden went down. Factcheck.org's Brooks Jackson -- who worked for CNN back then -- explained the issue with the data in a post at the Factcheck.org website. The budgets Jerry Brown oversaw were for fiscal years 1975 to 1982. The tax burden during that time started at $6.95, increased to a high of $7.74 in 1977, then declined to $6.56 in 1982. There were no major laws passed increasing taxes during that time, so what made the collections rise and fall? We had a hard time finding consensus on this 20-year-old question. Property values were rising, which led to Proposition 13 in 1978, which lowered property taxes and made it harder to increase other taxes. But there's a dispute over whether Proposition 13 affected state tax revenues that much; some say that it curtailed local taxes, not state taxes. The reason for the state tax decline, according to this view, is that a poor economy depressed tax revenues. We also wanted to check and see if Brown had signed any major new tax changes into law while he was governor. We looked through old news stories and found that Brown approved a two-cent per gallon gasoline tax for highways toward the end of his term. But he also approved a measure to index income tax brackets for inflation, a move that had the effect of reducing taxes for some. We also found news coverage of various business-related taxes; Brown signed measures that both increased and decreased taxes for some businesses. In fact, Brown oversaw large state surpluses in his early years as governor, which happened without any new tax increases. Some people blame Brown for sitting on the surpluses, which allowed the tax revolt movement for Proposition 13 to gain steam. Brown opposed Proposition 13 before it passed, but after it did, he became an ardent defender. Los Angeles Times columnist George Skelton wrote about Brown's reversal in a column recently, reminding Californians that Brown called himself a "born-again tax-cutter" after the vote, and won the endorsement of Howard Jarvis, the proposition's chief backer. In this year's race, Brown says there should be no tax increases without a vote. We found that when Brown was governor, he signed an increase to gas taxes, a decrease to income taxes through indexing, and various increases and decreases for business. He had significant surpluses for the first part of his governorship and in all likelihood didn't need to raise taxes. The most significant evidence in favor of Brown's statement are the state numbers that show taxes per $100 of resident income. By that metric, taxes went up, and then down under Brown, and finished a little lower than when he started. Those numbers sway the meter in a positive direction. We rate the statement "Taxes went down under Jerry Brown," as Mostly True.	None	Jerry Brown	None	None	None	2010-09-17T09:58:59	2010-09-14	['None']
pomt-10128	"(Bill) Ayers and Obama ran a radical education foundation together."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/10/john-mccain/not-a-radical-group-and-ayers-didnt-run-it/	For most of the election, Sen. John McCain's campaign has been somewhat subtle about trying to tie Sen. Barack Obama to the former '60s radical William Ayers. No longer. A 90-second Web ad released Oct. 8, 2008, features sinister music, side-by-side photographs of Obama and Ayers, and a series of dubious allegations about their past connections, including this one: "Ayers and Obama ran a radical education foundation together." Ayers was a founding member of the militant Vietnam-era anti-war group the Weathermen. He was investigated for his role in a series of domestic bombings, but the charges were dropped in 1974 due to prosecutorial misconduct. He is now an education professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, and actively engaged in the city's civic life. The McCain campaign said the "radical education foundation" to which they were referring is the Chicago Annenberg Challenge, a charity endowed by publishing magnate Walter Annenberg that funded public-school programs in Chicago from 1995 to 2001. We'll look at whether the foundation was radical. But first we have to grapple with whether Obama and Ayers ran it. Obama served on the foundation's volunteer board from its inception in 1995 through its dissolution in 2001, and was chair for the first four years. So an argument can be made that he ran it, though an executive director handled day-to-day operations. Ayers, who received his doctorate in education from Columbia University in 1987 and is now a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago, was active in getting the foundation up and running. He and two other activists led the effort to secure the grant from Annenberg, and he worked without pay in the early months of 1995, prior to the board's hiring of an executive director, to help the foundation get incorporated and formulate its bylaws, said Ken Rolling, who was the foundation's only executive director. Ayers went on to become a member of the "collaborative," an advisory group that advised the board of directors and the staff. However, Ayers "was never on the board of the Chicago Annenberg Challenge," and he "never made a decision programmatically or had a vote," Rolling said. "He (Ayers) was at board meetings — which, by the way, were open — as a guest," Rolling said. "That is not anything near Bill Ayers and Barack Obama running the Chicago Annenberg Challenge." Now, was the foundation radical? The McCain campaign cited several pieces of evidence for that allegation, including a 1995 invitation from the foundation for applications from schools "that want to make radical changes in the way teachers teach and students learn." The campaign appears to have confused two different definitions of the word "radical." Clearly the invitation referred to "a considerable departure from the usual or traditional," rather than "advocating extreme measures to retain or restore a political state of affairs." The campaign also cited two projects the foundation funded, one having to do with a United Nations-themed Peace School and another that focused on African-American studies. "That is radical in the eye of this campaign and we imagine in the eyes of most Americans," said Michael Goldfarb, a spokesman for McCain. "It is a subjective thing, and there are going to be people in Berkeley and Chicago who think that is totally legitimate." Teaching about the United Nations and African-American studies may not be everyone's cup of tea, but it's hardly "radical" in the same way Ayers' Vietnam-era activities were. Moreover, most of the projects the foundation funded (more on that below) were not remotely controversial. The McCain campaign also cited an opinion piece by conservative commentator Stanley Kurtz in the Sept. 23, 2008, Wall Street Journal as evidence of the foundation's radicalism. Kurtz wrote that Ayers was the "guiding spirit" of the foundation, and it "translated Mr. Ayers's radicalism into practice." But Ayers' views on education, though certainly reform-oriented and left-of-center, are not considered anywhere near as radical as his Vietnam-era views on war. And even if they were, there was a long list of individuals involved with the Chicago Annenberg Challenge whose positions provided them far more authority over its direction than Ayers' advisory role gave him. Let's look at a few, starting with the funder. Annenberg was a lifelong Republican and former ambassador to the United Kingdom under President Richard Nixon. His widow, Leonore, has endorsed McCain. Kurtz might just as plausibly have accused Obama and the foundation of "translating Annenberg's conservatism into practice." Among the other board members who served with Obama were: Stanley Ikenberry, former president of the University of Illinois; Arnold Weber, former president of Northwestern University and assistant secretary of labor in the Nixon administration; Scott Smith, then publisher of the Chicago Tribune; venture capitalist Edward Bottum; John McCarter, president of the Field Museum; Patricia Albjerg Graham, former dean of the Harvard University Graduate School of Education, and a host of other mainstream folks. "The whole idea of it being radical when it was this tie of blue-chip, white-collar, CEOs and civic leaders is just ridiculous," said the foundation's former development director, Marianne Philbin. The foundation gave money to groups of public schools – usually three to 10 – who partnered with some sort of outside organization to improve their students' achievement. In his opinion piece, Kurtz puts a sinister spin on this: "Instead of funding schools directly, it required schools to affiliate with 'external partners,' which actually got the money...CAC disbursed money through various far-left community organizers, such as the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (or ACORN)." Rollings said the foundation tried to fund the schools directly, but doing so proved to be a "bureaucratic nightmare." But any external group that received money had to have created a program in partnership with a network of public schools. And though ACORN is considered a liberal organization, the vast majority of the foundation's external partners were not remotely controversial. Here are a few examples: the Chicago Symphony, the University of Chicago, Loyola University, Northwestern University, the Chicago Children's Museum, the Museum of Science and Industry, the Field Museum, the Commercial Club of Chicago, the Garfield Park Conservatory Alliance and the Logan Square Neighborhood Association. Had Kurtz chosen to accuse Obama of carrying water for the conservative Annenberg, he might have written: "CAC disbursed money to various business-friendly entities, such as the Museum of Science and Industry and the Commercial Club of Chicago." See how easy it is? The programs the foundation funded were designed to allow individuals from the "external partners" – whether the musicians in the symphony or the business leaders in the commercial club – to help improve student achievement. They were along the lines of mentoring by artists, literacy instruction, professional development for teachers and administrators, and training for parents in everything from computer skills to helping their children with homework to advocating for their children at school. This last activity – something suburban parents practice with zeal – is also suspect in Kurtz's view: "CAC records show that board member Arnold Weber was concerned that parents 'organized' by community groups might be viewed by school principals 'as a political threat.'" That is typical of Kurtz's essay – relatively innocuous facts cast in the worst possible light. That's appropriate for an opinion piece, perhaps, but hardly grounds for a purportedly factual political ad accusing the group of radicalism. We could go on and on with evidence that the Chicago Annenberg Challenge was a rather vanilla charitable group. For example, under the deal with Annenberg every dollar from him had to be matched by two from elsewhere. The co-funders were a host of respected, mainstream institutions, such as the National Science Foundation, the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation and the Chicago Public Schools. In short, this was a mainstream foundation funded by a mainstream, Republican business leader and led by an overwhelmingly mainstream, civic-minded group of individuals. Ayers' involvement in its inception and on an advisory committee do not make it radical – nor does the funding of programs involving the United Nations and African-American studies. This attack is false, but it's more than that – it's malicious. It unfairly tars not just Obama, but all the other prominent, well-respected Chicagoans who also volunteered their time to the foundation. They came from all walks of life and all political backgrounds, and there's ample evidence their mission was nothing more than improving ailing public schools in Chicago. Yet in the heat of a political campaign they have been accused of financing radicalism. That's Pants on Fire wrong.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-10-10T00:00:00	2008-10-09	['None']
pomt-04056	Says "Abortion clinics in Oregon, as in most states, have no state oversight and are not held to basic health or safety standards."	mostly false	/oregon/statements/2013/jan/26/gayle-atteberry/are-abortion-clinics-oregon-not-held-basic-health-/	Gayle Atteberry, the executive director of anti-abortion group Oregon Right to Life, wrote a recent post on the organization’s website titled "About those safe abortions." She goes on to write about how abortions are "anything but safe." Part of the problem here, she writes, is that "abortion clinics in Oregon, as in most states, have no state oversight and are not held to basic health or safety standards." Even tattoo parlors and veterinary clinics follow state-imposed health standards, she wrote. We wondered whether that was true. Do abortion clinics in Oregon really face no state oversight? Is it true that they don’t have to meet basic health and safety standards? In an interview, Atteberry said that "ambulatory surgical" clinics, such as ones for eye or shoulder surgery, are subject to state oversight, but that "abortion clinics are exempted specifically from abiding by these restrictions and safety guidelines." She directed us to three Oregon administrative rules.The first rule includes a definition of a state-licensed "ambulatory surgical center," which includes many outpatient surgery clinics, and goes on to list safety regulations the clinics must meet. Sure enough, there’s an exemption for abortion clinics. The other rules spell out safety provisions for tattoo parlors and veterinary facilities. Next, we researched abortions in Oregon. In 2011, 9,566 abortions were performed in the state, according to the Oregon Health Authority. Of those, about 6 percent were performed in hospitals and doctors’ offices. The rest were performed in ambulatory surgical centers and at free-standing clinics. At least one abortion clinic, Lovejoy Surgicenter in Northwest Portland, is a state-licensed ambulatory surgical center. The Oregon Health Authority’s Health Care Regulation and Quality Improvement program regulates abortion clinics that fall under this category. Lovejoy is subject to unannounced site visits every year and a half to three or four years, said administrator Kayla Reich. "They’ll pull patient charts, look at medications, make sure there’s nothing out of date," she said. "We’ll have surveyors here for two or three days going through everything." Lovejoy performed about 2,400 abortions last year and about 2,500 in 2011, just more than a quarter of the abortions performed in the state in 2011. Also, some abortion clinics are satellite hospital clinics that operate under hospital licenses, said Alissa Robbins, a spokeswoman with the Oregon Health Authority. So we’ve learned that some locations that provide abortions are regulated and some aren’t. Most free-standing abortion clinics, however, face multiple layers of state and federal oversight because they accept Medicaid patients and seek reimbursements. For example, Planned Parenthood Columbia Willamette’s eight clinics in Oregon, which are categorized as free-standing clinics, are subject to inspections, audits and other health and safety oversight. The three co-medical directors who oversee medical care at the clinics are all licensed doctors on the obstetrics and gynecology faculty of OHSU, spokeswoman Liz Delapoer said. There is a chance an abortion clinic could refuse to see Medicaid patients, meaning those clinics wouldn’t be subject to some of the layers of oversight Planned Parenthood experiences, but many do. We also looked at who performs abortions. Those people -- doctors and some physician assistants and nurse practitioners -- are licensed and overseen by the state. Kathleen Haley, executive director of the Oregon Medical Board, which licenses doctors, said the agency has not received any complaints about abortion providers or unsafe abortions in the 18 years she has worked there. Atteberry, in a follow-up interview, said that having state-licensed doctors does not guarantee they meet health standards. "The state does not come into where they’re doing an abortion, making sure they’re doing it under health and safety standards, or in a building that (meets) health and safety standards." We understand the larger political context here: Opponents of abortion in Oregon and nationally have tried to seek more regulation for abortion clinics, but supporters of abortion rights say these types of structural regulations have no bearing on the safety of the procedures. PolitiFact Oregon will stay clear of that debate. We’re looking into the factual basis of Atteberry’s statement that abortion clinics in Oregon have no state oversight and are not held to basic health or safety standards. There is an element of truth to this statement. Some abortion clinics are not licensed in the way other outpatient medical offices are regulated. But we found at least one abortion clinic, Lovejoy, which does roughly 25 percent of Oregon abortions, that is regulated as a state-licensed ambulatory surgical center. Atteberry acknowledged Lovejoy’s regulation in our initial interview. Some other clinics operate under a hospital license. All of those are subject to health and safety regulations. Plus, the people who perform the abortions are licensed medical personnel subject to state oversight. While some abortion clinics are not subject to the state oversight that veterinary clinics or tattoo parlors receive, that doesn’t mean they and the people who work in them are not held to basic health standards. Those are critical facts that would give readers a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.	None	Gayle Atteberry	None	None	None	2013-01-26T03:00:00	2012-12-26	['Oregon']
pomt-06093	Says he lived up to a 2008 promise when he "closed corporate tax loopholes that were sending profits overseas."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/05/barack-obama/barack-obama-reelection-video-says-he-closed-corpo/	With all eyes on Iowa for the Republican caucuses, President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign reminded watchers of his own Iowa win — and what he has done to keep his campaign promises. Obama for America bought banner ads across the home page of the online Des Moines Register on Jan. 3, 2012, with a link to Obama's 2008 victory speech in the state. Music plays as candidate Obama promises action on health care, taxes, energy independence and the war in Iraq. Between clips, white text across the screen highlights Obama's policy accomplishments. For example, candidate Obama declares, "I’ll be a president who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas." At that point, an on-screen visual reads: "Closed corporate tax loopholes that were sending profits overseas." We wondered whether the ad’s claim about Obama’s accomplishment is justified. We asked the Obama campaign for supporting material, and they said they were referring to Public Law 111-226, a measure that was primarily aimed at providing economic aid to states. To offset the cost of new spending, however, the bill included a few provisions related to taxation of international corporations -- what a number of tax experts have told us can be fairly described as loopholes. As we explained in a previous item, Obama signed the bill into law on Aug. 10, 2010. The tax provisions took away more than a half dozen existing exemptions and credits estimated to be worth $9.8 billion over the subsequent 10 years. Here’s how it worked. The United States, unlike a variety of other countries, taxes its companies on the foreign profits they earn. But the companies don't have to pay taxes on their foreign earnings until they bring those profits back to the U.S. So companies tend to keep the money with their foreign subsidiaries as long as they can. But companies also get U.S. tax credits for taxes they pay to foreign governments, and some companies figured out how to game the system by keeping their profits overseas while still claiming a tax credit for taxes paid on the same income to foreign governments. That's what the law tried to address. It said that companies can't claim the foreign tax credit until they report their income. But while there is some truth to the claim that the president signed legislation that "closed corporate tax loopholes thta were sending profits overseas," we should point out a few issues. First, under the old law, companies weren’t necessarily "sending profits overseas," as the ad states, but may have been keeping in place profits that were already being generated overseas. Still, this strikes us as a fairly minor linguistic quibble. A more pertinent question is whether the legislation Obama signed fulfills the pledge he made in Iowa in 2008 -- that he’ll "be a president who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas." H. David Rosenbloom, director of the International Tax Program at the New York University School of Law, calls the legislation "very narrow." "It addresses a specific tax planning strategy whereby foreign taxes and credits are ‘split’ from the foreign income that gave rise to them," he said. Left relatively unscathed is the broader "deferral regime" that allows companies to avoid U.S. taxes on foreign income as long as they do not "repatriate" -- bring home -- the money and avoid a few other hurdles. For instance, one proposal by former Walt Disney Co. executive Preston Padden, now an adjunct law professor at the University of Colorado, urges a reduction in the corporate income tax rate to 20 percent, which would be aligned with most foreign countries, paired with stricter "anti-deferral" rules. "A tax rate comparable to foreign countries would greatly eliminate the incentives to move operations and jobs offshore because of rate differentials, and the anti-deferral regime would minimize the benefits to U.S. companies from offshoring operations and jobs," Padden wrote in a recent op-ed. The narrower law signed by Obama, by contrast, "will hardly prevent companies from sending profits abroad, keeping them abroad, and otherwise profiting from the current set of international tax rules," Rosenbloom said. Even after passage of the 2010 law, "most experts would agree that the U.S. international tax system encourages U.S. multinationals to accumulate profits offshore," said Lawrence Lokken, an emeritus professor of law at the University of Florida. Our ruling While there is some truth to the claim that Obama signed legislation that "closed corporate tax loopholes that were sending profits overseas," experts say the law by itself doesn’t live up to Obama’s promise in Iowa to "be a president who ends the tax breaks for companies that ship our jobs overseas." Incentives deeply embedded in the tax code still exist. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-01-05T18:04:26	2012-01-03	['None']

pomt-04006	Says the pension and health benefits reform "eliminated collective bargaining for health benefits."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/feb/07/barbara-buono/barbara-buono-claims-state-reform-eliminated-colle/	Just as Gov. Chris Christie celebrates how he approved pension and health benefits reform in June 2011, state Sen. Barbara Buono says she stood up for her beliefs by opposing the landmark bill. As the senator emerged last week as the most likely Democrat to take on the Republican governor in his re-election bid this year, Buono claimed in TV interviews that she rejected the legislation because it eliminated collective bargaining for public employees’ health benefits. Buono, who was Senate Majority Leader when the reform passed, broke with Senate President Stephen Sweeney when she voted against the legislation. That vote likely contributed to her ultimately losing the leadership post. In a Jan. 28 interview on NJToday, Buono (D-Middlesex) said she "drew a line in the sand when it came to eliminating collective bargaining for employee health benefits." The senator repeated that claim in an interview the following day on Fox 5’s Good Day New York. "I’ll continue to stand up for what I believe in, even if it’s not politically expedient -- and that is, I opposed this last piece of legislation that also eliminated collective bargaining for health benefits," Buono said. The 2011 reform mandates increases in health care contributions without employees’ approval through negotiations, but the senator’s wrong to suggest that bargaining right is eliminated forever. Once the increases are fully implemented after a four-year period, unions can resume negotiating those contribution levels. Let’s review the legislation. Signed into law by Christie on June 28, 2011, the reform requires employees to contribute higher payments toward their pension and health care benefits. Phased in over four years, the health care contributions are based on a percentage of one’s premium and vary according to salaries and levels of coverage. The new contribution levels took effect immediately for employees whose union contracts had expired. For workers under an existing contract when the law went into effect, the payment levels and four-year time frame begin when their contract expires. Those increases are non-negotiable, but after the fourth year of implementation, the health care contributions can become part of union negotiations. Here’s what the law says: "After full implementation, those contribution levels shall become part of the parties’ collective negotiations and shall then be subject to collective negotiations in a manner similar to other negotiable items between the parties." But David Turner, communications director for the Buono campaign, argued in an e-mail that the legislation took away workers’ bargaining right to negotiate health benefits when it imposed higher costs without their consent. "Sen. Buono strongly believes in the right of workers to collectively bargain for their health benefits," Turner said. "Governor Christie's legislation explicitly takes away this right by unilaterally imposing higher costs without workers' consent. "This is by definition eliminating employees right to negotiate their healthcare. Collective bargaining was vital in building the middle class in New Jersey and America and Sen. Buono will continue to support this fundamental right." Our ruling In a TV interview, Buono claimed that the pension and health benefits reform "eliminated collective bargaining for health benefits." The reform does mandate higher health care contributions over a four-year period without the employees’ approval through negotiations, but the senator is wrong to suggest that bargaining right is eliminated indefinitely. After the payment increases have been fully implemented, those contribution levels return to the bargaining table as a part of union negotiations. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-10820	Obama "won health care for 150,000 people."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/20/barack-obama/making-more-families-eligible-expanded-coverage/	In a campaign ad, an announcer says Obama "won health care for 150,000 people." The statement is based on a 2003 law Obama sponsored when he was an Illinois state senator. His bill expanded income eligibility for KidsCare and FamilyCare, the state health insurance programs low-income families. Both programs saw sizable increases in enrollment after the law was passed. The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation looked at the Illinois program and found that the children's enrollment increased by 55,421 between 2003 and 2005, the year Illinois abolished an income requirement. Adult enrollment increased by 100,458 between 2003 and 2006. That comes to a total of 155,879. Of course, it bears noting that expansion of health insurance was a big goal of the Democratic governor who signed the bill, and Obama's legislation had a co-sponsor, a Republican, in the Illinois House. But the simplicity of his claim is hard to dispute, and being able to work with others to achieve goals is a theme of the ad in which he makes the claim. It all ads up to true.

Host David Gregory asked him, "On a lighter note, before I let you go, Mr. President, you were brazen this summer at the All-Star Game wearing your Chicago White Sox jacket out there to throw out the first pitch. Hate to break it to you, but doesn't look so good for your White Sox here. So I want to know who is your pick to win the World Series?" Obama replied, "You know — I am — I think mathematically, the White Sox can still get in the playoffs." Here at PolitiFact, we're focused more on the American League East (Go Rays!), so we had lost track of how the White Sox were doing in the AL Central. We turned to our favorite baseball writer, Marc Topkin of the St. Petersburg Times , to find out if Obama was right. Topkin told us that while the White Sox are out of the running to be the wild-card team for the American League, it's mathematically possible they could still win their division and then be in the playoffs. As of Sunday morning when Meet the Press aired, the White Sox were 5 1/2 games behind the first-place Detroit Tigers. Topkin told us the White Sox "wouldn't be mathematically eliminated until there were 6 games left, and going into today they have 13 left." So Obama can hold out hope for at least another week or so. The odds are against the Sox — they play the Tigers and the Minnesota Twins, the No. 2 team in the division, in the next week. And Topkin noted that a lot of things have to break in favor of the Sox. But Obama is right that it's at least mathematically possible, so he earns a True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-09-20T19:12:55	2009-09-20	['None']
pomt-01388	The Greenlight Pinellas 1-cent sales tax "is permanent, we never get to vote on this again."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/oct/14/no-tax-tracks/greenlight-pinellas-opponents-says-residents-will-/	When it comes to discussing the Greenlight Pinellas mass transit initiative, two things are certain: Taxes and citizens complaining about taxes. If the measure passes on Election Day, the county’s sales tax would go up 1 cent. So an opposition group has made the alleged unfairness of it all a cornerstone of their campaign. No Tax For Tracks, a grassroots group opposed to Greenlight Pinellas, said in an email to voters that not only is the switch from a property tax for the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority to an increased sales tax unfair, it’s going to last forever. "They call it a ‘tax swap,’ but PSTA's revenue will increase from $32 million per year to $148 million per year," the email reads. "Any financial dictionary will tell you that this is not a ‘tax swap’, this is a revenue increase of over 300 percent! And the tax is permanent, we never get to vote on this again." The group has notably been mindful of its wording here, because they have said in the past that the swap was a "300 percent tax increase." We rated that False, because that number would be the change to the PSTA operating budget, and not any individual taxpayer. Will the tax swap be permanent, though? We decided to find out. The swap The countywide transportation plan aims to expand bus service by adding routes and extending hours, but also would add a 24-mile light rail line between St. Petersburg and Clearwater. In order to pay for the changes, the county’s sales tax would go up from 7 percent to 8 percent, becoming the highest tax rate in the state. Some things, like medicine, groceries, and certain agricultural and manufacturing startup equipment, would be exempt from the sales tax, and the increase would be limited to the first $5,000 of major purchases. This would replace the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority’s current county funding through a property tax. Greenlight Pinellas is different from something like Penny for Pinellas, the county's 1-cent capital improvement tax. The Penny for Pinellas has to be reauthorized by voters every 10 years. Here, the interlocal agreement the PSTA and the county commission created for the plan does not specifically guarantee a future vote on the sales tax increase. The "tax swap," as Greenlight Pinellas organizers call it, would boost the authority’s budget from about $34 million to as high as $120 million to $130 million, PSTA calculates. If voters approve the change in November, the change would take effect Jan. 1, 2016. Any future changes to the Greenlight plan, such as an extension of the proposed rail line or other major alteration, would be subject to a referendum. The property tax technically wouldn’t go away, as the PSTA needs the state to approve its elimination. Gov. Rick Scott vetoed a bill in 2012 that would have done this, getting rid of the property tax and replacing it with the increased sales tax if voters choose. Now, if Greenlight Pinellas passes, the PSTA would set the millage rate to zero and start collecting the sales tax. The property tax could be eliminated by the Legislature in the future, but the fact that it would still exist on property tax bills has led No Tax For Tracks to speculate this could lead to double taxation. Greenlight Pinellas rules say PSTA can’t have both sets of tax revenue. The new sales tax itself stays in place "until repealed," as the ballot language for Nov. 4 says. No Tax For Tracks argues that repeal won’t ever take place, because of how the PSTA and Pinellas County agreed to fund the project. The interlocal agreement says the surtax money can only be used to fund Greenlight projects, PSTA chief development officer Cassandra Borchers told us. It also specifies that the county has to continue to fund PSTA operations and maintenance. There are ways for the tax to be rescinded written into the agreement, however. If the plan isn’t implemented as promised or in the time frame allotted, if the money from the sales tax is used for something other than the Greenlight plan, if there is a payment default or some unforeseen calamity in the future, the tax can be reduced or terminated. It also is slated for review in 50 years, and every 20 years thereafter. But overall, it won’t be easy to stop the tax once it starts. That’s because the tax money is going to pay for a major construction project. Jewel White from the Pinellas County Attorney’s Office said there are clauses written into the contract that allow for decades of guaranteed tax money in order to secure financing for capital projects, like more buses and the proposed light rail line. Unless one of the triggers to end the sales tax is met, the county commission likely wouldn’t examine the issue, White said. Because the sales tax is under the same ordinance that governs initiatives like Penny For Pinellas, it has to be put to voters to be enacted, she said. After that, options for repeal are few. Pinellas residents could ask the commission to address the issue, but that would probably not get any results either, White said. Residents could not force the commission to put the issue back on the ballot. "Certainly, anyone can approach the commission at any time," she said. "Once money gets bonded, though, it’s pretty hard to undo." No Tax For Tracks activists also said these steps are wholly improbable, because if the county ended the tax, they would have to find some way to continue to pay its obligations to PSTA. Borchers agreed that just ending the sales tax or reinstituting the property tax -- which would bring in much less money for the operating budget -- would result in major problems. "You couldn’t just stop it without some consequences," Borchers said, noting that not only is the operating budget at issue, there is a lot of promised state and federal money tied up in the plan. "You’d have to pay back all those grants." Our ruling No Tax For Tracks said the Greenlight Pinellas 1-cent sales tax "is permanent, we never get to vote on this again." There is no clause or provision in the proposal that allows for another vote. However, saying the tax is "permanent" also goes too far. While it is certainly likely that the sales tax would be in place for the foreseeable future if passed, the tax has a review clause set for 50 years from now. The long time frame is because the taxes are dedicated to paying for major long-term construction projects like light rail. As to whether the county commission would ever bring the question back to voters, it’s improbable but not impossible. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

pomt-10144	"Obama held one of the first meetings of his political career in Bill Ayers's home. And they've worked together on various projects in Chicago."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/06/sarah-palin/obama-and-ayers-round-ii/	We at PolitiFact wondered when the toaster would pop on the William Ayers -Sen. Barack Obama connection. Back in the primary, Sens. Hillary Clinton and John McCain made some political hay of Obama’s relationship with Ayers, a onetime member of the Weather Underground, a leftist fringe of the 1960s antiwar movement that was responsible for bombings at several federal buildings in the early 1970s. PolitiFact looked at the claim then and found from 1999 to 2001, Obama and Ayers served overlapping terms on the board of directors for the Woods Fund, a philanthropic organization in Chicago. We also noted that campaign finance reports show Ayers donated $200 to Obama’s state senate re-election campaign in 2001. Since the general election began, the McCain campaign had largely kept the issue on the shelf. But with the economy sagging and McCain’s numbers dipping in the polls, an Oct. 3, 2008, a story in the New York Times that added some new details to the association between the two provided the McCain campaign just enough kindling to revisit Obama’s long-ago association with the controversial figure. And now, Gov. Sarah Palin is running with it. "Well, I was reading my copy of The New York Times the other day, and I was really interested to read about Barack’s friends from Chicago," Palin said at a rally in Clearwater, Fla., on Oct. 6. "Turns out, one of his earliest supporters is a man named Bill Ayers. And according to The New York Times , he was a domestic terrorist and part of a group that, quote, ‘launched a campaign of bombings that would target the Pentagon and the U.S. Capitol.’ Wow. "And there’s even more to the story," Palin said. "Barack Obama said Ayers was just someone in the neighborhood. But that’s less than truthful. His own top advisor said they were, quote, ‘certainly friendly.’ In fact, Obama held one of the first meetings of his political career in Bill Ayers’s home. And they’ve worked together on various projects in Chicago." First, a little background on Ayers. He was, in fact, a founding member of a group known as the Weathermen, who were responsible for bombings of the New York City police headquarters in 1970, of the Capitol building in 1971 and of the Pentagon in 1972 in protest of the Vietnam War. Ayers and his wife, Bernardine Dohrn, also a Weather Underground member, spent years as fugitives in the 1970s, but federal riot and bombing conspiracy charges were dropped in 1974 because of illegal wiretaps and other prosecutorial misconduct. Since then, Ayers has rehabilitated his image with many in the Chicago community, including Mayor Richard M. Daley. Ayers is now a professor of education at the University of Illinois at Chicago and has developed a reputation as an advocate for school reform. Which is, according to Ben LaBolt, an Obama campaign spokesman, how the two met. The recent New York Times story added to the understanding of Obama's association with Ayers, through an education project. Ayers helped Chicago win nearly $50 million for Chicago schools as part of a national school reform project, the Chicago Annenberg Challenge. In March 1995, Obama was named chair of the six-member Chicago Annenberg Challenge board that distributed the grants. A New York Times review of archives of the Chicago Annenberg project found that the two attended six board meetings together. Later that year, the Ayers’ hosted a coffee at which Illinois State Sen. Alice Palmer, who planned to run for Congress, introduced Obama to some of her long-time supporters as her chosen successor. According to the New York Times story, it was one of several neighborhood events held that year on Obama’s behalf, and it was not the first. Obama campaign officials also note the event at Ayers’ home was not a fundraiser. And they claim that Obama did not know Ayers’ history with the Weather Underground at that time. They did not say when Obama found that out. Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt told PolitiFact the two have not communicated by phone or e-mail since Obama became a U.S. senator in 2005, and that they last spoke to one another about a year ago, when they bumped into each other in the neighborhood - they live just a few blocks apart. "The suggestion that Ayers was a political adviser to Obama or someone who shaped his political views is patently false," LaBolt said. "As the New York Times confirmed, the two were not close." Asked about his relationship at a Democratic debate on April 16, 2008, Obama said, "This is a guy who lives in my neighborhood, who’s a professor of English in Chicago who I know and who I have not received some official endorsement from. He’s not somebody who I exchange ideas from on a regular basis. "And the notion that somehow as a consequence of me knowing somebody who engaged in detestable acts 40 years ago, when I was 8 years old, somehow reflects on me and my values doesn’t make much sense." For what it’s worth, the story Palin cited in her comments, the Oct. 3, 2008, New York Times piece, concluded after a review of Chicago Annenberg archives and interviews with a dozen people who know both men, that Obama "has played down his contacts with Mr. Ayers...But the two men do not appear to have been close. Nor has Mr. Obama ever expressed sympathy for the radical views and actions of Mr. Ayers." In previous speeches the day before her appearance in Clearwater, Palin accused Obama of "palling around with terrorists." We think that statement goes too far, and is just false, as there is no evidence that Obama has had any relationship with Ayers as a U.S. senator. But let’s review what Palin said in Clearwater, and weigh it against the facts as we know them. Palin called Ayers one of Obama’s "earliest supporters" and said Obama "held one of the first meetings of his political career in Bill Ayers’ home." Obama campaign officials acknowledge Ayers hosted a coffee in 1995, the purpose of which was to introduce Obama to some local political players leading up to his first run for public office. Obama campaign officials say Obama didn’t know Ayers’ past at that time, and McCain campaign officials wonder why this week was the first time that has ever been mentioned. Make of that what you will, but that part of Palin’s statement is true. Palin said Ayers was a "domestic terrorist." The Weather Undergound group was labeled a "domestic terrorist group" by the FBI, and Ayers was a founding member of the group, but charges against him were dropped due to prosecutorial misconduct. Palin said Obama claimed Ayers was "just someone in the neighborhood," but her remark ignored Obama's condemnation of Ayers in that very sentence she quotes. Obama did seem to downplay his relationship with Ayers, stating that he was "a guy who lives in my neighborhood," but Obama in that same answer acknowledged that he knew Ayers and called his actions 40 years ago "detestable" and said they do not reflect his own values. Lastly, Palin said Obama and Ayers have "worked together on various projects in Chicago." They were both involved with the Chicago Annenberg Challenge. And they both served for a time as directors of the Woods Fund. Neither chose the other to work with either group. Voters can decide for themselves how much stock to put in all that. And they may disagree with the implications that are inherent in Palin mentioning such connections. Palin generally has her facts right here, but she ignores an important element -- Obama's condemnation of Ayers' history -- and implies a closer relationship than the record supports. We find her claim Mostly True.	None	Sarah Palin	None	None	None	2008-10-06T00:00:00	2008-10-06	['Chicago', 'Barack_Obama', 'Bill_Ayers']

pomt-11314	"Greitens accuser admits photo session may have been a ‘dream.’ "	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/13/sentinel/headline-about-greitens-accuser-sex-case-doesn/	Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens is expected to go to trial in May on a felony indictment of invasion of privacy related to an allegation that he took a photo of a woman who was partially nude without her consent. Greitens admitted the extramarital affair with his former hairdresser in January, but described it as consensual and denied allegations that he threatened her. Greitens, a combat veteran and a Republican, was elected governor in 2016. How Greitens behaved during the affair, and especially whether he had specific sexual interactions with the woman without her consent, have become key points of dispute. An April 8 headline on the Sentinel, a website that writes about government in Missouri, said that his accuser "admits photo session may have been a dream." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found news reports show the woman did make this statement in a deposition, but the Sentinel omitted a complete explanation about the woman’s testimony. The Sentinel quoted from a few paragraphs in a defense motion filed on behalf of Greitens April 8. When the defense counsel asked the woman, "Did you ever see (Greitens) in possession of a camera or phone?" she answered: "Not to my knowledge. I didn’t see him with it." An assistant circuit attorney asked the woman, "Did you see what you believed to be a phone?" She answered, "… I haven’t talked about it because I don’t know if it’s because I’m remembering it through a dream or I – I’m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven’t spoken about it because of that." Jack Cashill, co-editor of the Sentinel, told PolitiFact that he didn’t have the full deposition and relied on excerpts in the court filing. "It is for this reason I used the subjunctive in the headline ‘may have,’ " he said, noting that other news outlets including the Daily Mail used a similar approach in headlines. Greitens has seized on the dream portion of the woman’s statement, telling media that the case is "a political witch hunt now based on the testimony of somebody who said under oath that they may be remembering this through a dream." Other news reports state that that the woman’s testimony came during a deposition that lasted for several hours. The Associated Press wrote that "the prosecutor in the case says the defense ‘cherry picked bits and pieces’ of her nine-hour deposition and the woman's attorney says the comment referred to one particular instance concerning the photo." The Missouri House committee investigation into the allegations against Greitens also mentioned the dream comment, but stated in a footnote that the committee "includes these quotes in the absence of a full transcript from the deposition." The woman told the committee that during an encounter with Greitens, "I can hear like a, like a cell phone – like a picture, and I can see a flash through the blindfold." The committee concluded that the woman was a credible witness. Greitens did not testify before the House committee. St. Louis Circuit Judge Rex Burlison issued a gag order in the case which prohibits comments related to the deposition and requires the judge to sign off on certain court filings before they're made public. Without the deposition, we can’t fully evaluate the woman’s comments. The woman’s attorney, Scott Simpson, said in statement to media that the woman supports the release of the full transcript. Simpson said that Greitens "has admitted to my client, on multiple occasions that he took her photograph without her consent, and threatened to release it if she ever told anyone about their relationship." Our ruling A headline by the Sentinel website said that "Greitens accuser admits photo session may have been a ‘dream.’ " News articles state that the woman made that comment during a lengthy deposition. Since we don’t have a transcript of the deposition, it is difficult to evaluate her comment but it appears to be cherry-picking from a deposition that lasted several hours.

pomt-08881	"As President George W. Bush’s trade representative, Portman failed to address China’s currency manipulation, which was inflated to as much as 40 percent in 2006."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/02/lee-fisher/fisher-claim-portman-failed-address-china-currency/	China makes the goods that Americans used to make, but that’s because politicians failed to stop China’s unfair trade practices. It’s a theme as recurrent as the buzzards returning to Hinckley, and Ohio campaign managers know it works. But Lee Fisher’s campaign presented a new angle on the theme, and it is intriguing. Fisher, the Democratic lieutenant governor, is running for U.S. Senate against Rob Portman, a Republican who served for a year as President George W. Bush’s trade ambassador. Portman played a key advisory role in helping the president deal with economic competition from China, whose manufacturing might rose as Ohio’s declined. You’ll hear plenty more about that before November, and The Plain Dealer examined Portman’s trade record in May. But Fisher presented a brand new perspective in a news release on July 13 when he complained about currency manipulation by China. Although this has been an issue for years, Fisher put some of the blame on Portman. His news release said, "As President George W. Bush’s trade representative, Portman failed to address China’s currency manipulation, which was inflated to as much as 40 percent in 2006." That’s shorthand for saying that China propped up its currency rather than letting it rise and fall against the dollar, enabling China’s factories to make steel, auto parts and toys and ship them to the United States at artificially low prices that undercut American manufacturers. It was little different from other unfair trade practices, many American manufacturers say. You’ll hear few disputes about that, whether the president is named Bush or Barack Obama. But there’s plenty of bickering over what to do about it. That’s where Portman comes in. Portman, a Republican, could have used his authority as trade representative to take China to the World Trade Organization and push for penalties, according to critics. But Portman was such an unabashed proponent of free trade that he gave China a pass, Fisher says. We asked Fisher’s spokesman, John Collins (who recently left to work for a candidate in Kentucky), to provide support for the claim, and he cited several news articles from early 2006. That’s when Portman’s office issued a lengthy and critical report on other trade practices by China. But Portman’s report gave little space to currency manipulation – and that angered Sen. Chuck Schumer, Democrat of New York. According to news articles and congressional transcripts we reviewed, Schumer blasted Portman’s report for failing to fully deal with the "800-pound gorilla" – currency manipulation -- that had to be tamed for any trade balance to occur. OK, so Portman failed to adequately mention China’s currency manipulation -- according to a senator from New York -- in a report. Was that really a failure to "address" the problem? It turns out the issue gets more complex. Portman didn’t address the currency issue in the broader sense -- that is, embrace it as a problem he could solve -- because, his campaign says, it wasn’t even under his jurisdiction. Transcripts of a confirmation hearing for Portman on April 21, 2005, show that he voiced concern about the issue but said, "By the same token, as you know, the Treasury Department has the lead on this, appropriately. It’s a currency issue, not USTR," he said, using the initials of U.S. Trade Representative’s office. He mentioned the jurisdictional issue several more times during his stint as trade ambassador. On Feb. 16, 2006, he told Schumer during a Senate Finance Committee hearing that "currency policy is very distinctly not within the ambit of the USTR. And I'm reminded of that constantly in the inter-agency process, which is appropriate that Treasury take the lead and that they speak for us on currency policy." Four days later he told it to another congressional committee: "We need to address the currency issue, which the Treasury Department takes the lead on and not USTR." So is Fisher blaming Portman for something he bore no responsibility for? That’s what Portman’s spokeswoman, Jessica Towhey, suggested, citing the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. The act says it is the Treasury secretary’s job to analyze exchange rate policies of other countries, in consultation with the International Monetary Fund, and consider whether countries manipulate their currencies. If the answer is yes, Treasury is to negotiate with the offending country through the IMF. We contacted the office of the current trade representative, Ron Kirk, an Obama appointee, to see if it agreed on the jurisdiction issue. It did. We asked Treasury as well, and Treasury said it was in fact in charge. We asked the Obama White House, too, just in case the agencies had a fuzzy view. No, said the White House. Currency manipulation is on Treasury’s watch. That cast significant doubt on Fisher’s claim, then, that Portman "failed to address" the problem. It wasn’t his job. But we wondered if small American manufacturers agreed, so we asked a few trade experts in Washington, including attorneys who take cases to the trade courts. It turned out that the story was more complex, because on April 20, 2005, nine days before Portman was sworn in, a group of 35 senators and representatives filed a petition asking the trade representative’s office to haul China before the WTO and press the currency issue as an unfair trade practice. The Congress members -- nearly all Democrats -- had grown frustrated with Treasury, saying it had failed to stop China’s manipulation and that the right recourse was for the trade ambassador to go to the trade courts and ask for tariffs against Chinese imports. A coalition of labor unions and manufacturing groups had tried this twice before, but their petitions had been rejected. But this 2005 congressional petition was different because members of Congress filed it. They included several U.S. House members from Ohio, including Democrats Tim Ryan, Stephanie Tubbs Jones (since deceased), Sherrod Brown (now a senator) and Ted Strickland (now Ohio’s governor). They also included a dozen U.S. senators, including one from Illinois named Barack Obama. On May 27, 2005, not quite a month into his term, Portman’s office turned them down. His spokesman at the agency, Richard Mills, said at the time that the Treasury secretary, John Snow, had the lead in talks with China on the currency matter and, as a result, "Chinese officials have publicly committed that they will move to a more flexible system." A notice in the Federal Register said the trade office turned down the lawmakers’ request "because, among other reasons, an investigation would not be effective in addressing the acts, policies, and practices covered in the petition." The Bush administration was already dealing with China through Treasury, and launching a trade office investigation "would hamper, rather than advance, administration efforts to address China’s currency valuation policies." Neither Mills’ statement nor the Federal Register notice said it was strictly a matter of jurisdiction. Mills said at the time that many tools were available "to ensure a level playing field," but that the administration preferred to put Treasury in the lead. This suggested some leeway on choice, not just jurisdiction, or so say the parties who wanted the trade representative’s involvement. "That is a major issue, and we’ve always argued that it is a hybrid issue," says David Hartquist, a Washington trade attorney who had filed a similar petition earlier that was turned down by a Portman predecessor.. Charles Blum, a trade office official in the 1980s who is now executive director of the Fair Currency Coalition, representing manufacturers, labor and agricultural interests, says that Portman "was essentially saying, ‘I refuse to enforce the law because diplomacy is the proper venue.’" The question then becomes: Did Portman lack jurisdiction, or did he just believe that Treasury was the better agency to deal with the issue? Kevin Dempsey, a trade lawyer and senior vice president at the American Iron and Steel Institute, which also has tried to halt unfairly priced imports, says that Congress has been fairly clear: It intended for Treasury to take the lead. Portman "had some discretion," Dempsey says. "But it’s been established for some years, before Portman and after Portman, that Treasury does have the lead." Congress has considered changing that so currency could be treated as a trade issue in certain circumstances. Ryan and Brown are involved in these efforts. But their measures have stalled repeatedly. And now that he’s president, even Obama has kept Treasury in the lead – and frustrated those who want more forceful action. So we’re persuaded that in a narrow sense, Portman "failed to address China’s currency manipulation," as Fisher’s campaign says. But he was following a long-held policy that has been articulated by Congress and presidents. The Obama administration agrees with Portman: Currency is not the trade ambassador’s job. And Portman "addressed" it repeatedly in congressional hearings, telling Congress exactly what his campaign says today. That’s why we rate Fisher’s claim Barely True. Comment on this item. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05505	Georgia is one of three states that "effectively have no regulations whatsoever on lobbyists giving to legislators."	true	/georgia/statements/2012/apr/15/joshua-mckoon/no-limit-gifts-ga-legislature-senator-says/	Georgia state Sen. Joshua McKoon, by some accounts, committed political suicide this year. The freshman Republican from Columbus proposed legislation to cap gifts from lobbyists to state lawmakers at $100. Statehouse leaders apparently didn’t care for his approach, removing McKoon from a committee to study the idea. There’s been mumbling, as one former senator put it, that Republicans were recruiting a candidate to run against McKoon. "I have not been making a lot of friends inside the Capitol," McKoon said, when asked by PolitiFact Georgia about his proposal. Throughout the legislative session, McKoon attempted to buttress his argument with a fact to help fellow lawmakers see the light. Georgia, he said, is one of three states that "effectively have no regulations whatsoever on lobbyists giving to legislators." The other states, he says, are Indiana and South Dakota. McKoon held a news conference last month and pointed to a map of the United States with those three states in red. So, is McKoon correct? Government watchdog groups have argued ardently in recent years that Georgia needs to tighten its ethics laws and make it more difficult for lobbyists to influence state lawmakers with gifts of meals or trips. A recent joint report by the Center for Public Integrity and Global Integrity ranked Georgia last in the nation in the strength of its laws on public corruption and government openness. Some state lawmakers called the report biased. Georgia code section 21-5-11 spells out the policy on gifts. It says that only statewide elected officials can accept gifts of more than $100 for a speech, seminar or panel discussion that directly relates to the duties of that official, but prohibits it otherwise. It states no rules for members of the Georgia Legislature or other types of gifts. A section on prohibited lobbying practices, Title 28, Chapter 7, mentions nothing about gift limits. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution took a close look at lobbyists during the recent legislative session. A recent AJC story found lobbyists spent $866,747 --- the equivalent of $9,525 per day --- on gifts for lawmakers from Jan. 1 through March 31. Many of the gifts would have easily surpassed the $100 limit McKoon proposed. For example, the AJC found lobbyists took Rep. Mickey Channell, R-Greensboro, and his wife to dinner on Valentine’s Day, spending about $230. Another House member, Rahn Mayo, D-Decatur, said he was unaware that the four Atlanta Hawks basketball tickets that lobbyists gave him cost about $500. House Speaker David Ralston has defended the current system, saying eliminating lobbying gifts would drive the practice "underground," where the public would know less about what is happening between lawmakers and special interests. So how does Georgia compare with other states when it comes to laws on gifts from lobbyists? The National Conference of State Legislatures has a chart that examines gift policy in each state. McKoon said he used the NCSL chart to make his claim. Many states employ what’s referred to as the "cup of coffee" policy, which prohibits any gifts whatsoever from lobbyists. About a dozen states set the limit at $100. Four states set the limit at $250. A handful limit gifts from lobbyists to between $250 and $1,000. The NCSL chart says Indiana requires lobbyists to report gifts, but does not specify any limits of what they can give lawmakers. In 2010, state lawmakers changed some of the rules on gifts from lobbyists. They must now disclose any gifts in a day greater than $50. Before, the limit was $100, said Julia Vaughn, Common Cause Indiana policy director. "We don’t limit. We require some disclosure," Vaughn said. Vaughn said some state lawmakers argue a gift ban isn’t necessary because it’s better for the public to know what they’re getting from lobbyists. In South Dakota, the code section on lobbyists mentions nothing about gift limits for lobbyists. The NCSL lists South Dakota as having "no restrictions." We found no discrepancies in the NCSL’s research. The current laws in Georgia, Indiana and South Dakota afford lobbyists freedom to give state lawmakers as much as they want. We rate McKoon’s claim as True.	None	Josh McKoon	None	None	None	2012-04-15T06:00:00	2012-04-03	['None']

pomt-03838	Rhode Island is the last state still using the Optech III P voting machines and they don’t meet suggested federal standards.	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/mar/16/robert-kando/head-rhode-island-board-elections-says-state-last-/	Robert Kando, executive director of the Rhode Island Board of Elections, appeared before the House Oversight Committee earlier this month as it continued its inquiry into what caused long lines at some polling places during the November general election. Among suggestions Kando made to ease problems in the future was replacing the machines Rhode Island uses at its voting precincts to count ballots. The optical scanners -- known by their trade name, the Optech III P Eagle -- were purchased in 1997. In fact, said Kando, Rhode Island is the last state still using them and they don’t meet the suggested standards set by the federal Help America Vote Act, known as HAVA. Kando’s comments, implying that our voting machines are deficient, caught our attention. When we contacted Kando he was adamant that Rhode Island is the last state still using the Optech III P Eagles. But he was less sure what exactly made our voting machines non-compliant with some new -- and the important word here is "voluntary" -- federal guidelines for voting machines. "You would have to be an engineer to figure that out," he replied. Kando said he would contact the company that maintained Rhode Island’s machines -- Election Systems and Software (ES&S), based in Nebraska -- and get back to us with the reasons. In the meantime, we did some research. Congress passed the Help America Vote Act in 2002 in response to the "hanging chad" debacle of the 2000 presidential election. In that contest between George W. Bush and Al Gore, confusion with reading paper ballots in Florida and deciphering voters’ intent eventually led to the U.S. Supreme Court intervening and stopping the recount, putting Bush in the White House. HAVA provided money to states to upgrade their voting systems to assure a higher level of accuracy, a better recount system and improved access for voters with disabilities. The act also created a new federal agency called the Elections Assistance Commission to advise states on how to comply with HAVA. The commission wrote up some technical guidelines for voting machines -- dealing with among other things software and electrical capabilities -- but made these guidelines voluntary. States could use the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines if they wanted to have the EAC certify that their voting machines met HAVA requirements. But states such as Rhode Island, which used machines purchased before the 2002 HAVA requirements, weren’t required to do so. We found through various sources, including verifiedvoting.org, that more than 200 counties and communities in at least at least seven other states -- Alabama, Idaho, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maine, Wisconsin and Virginia -- were still using Optech III P Eagle voting machines. (Unlike Rhode Island, most states don’t use the same machine statewide.) We also checked in with Rhode Island’s Secretary of State A. Ralph Mollis on whether our voting machines meet the voluntary standards. Spokesman Chris Barnett wouldn’t answer that question directly, but issued a general statement: "We agree that Rhode Island’s voting machines are beyond their useful life," and he said his office hoped the machines would be replaced before the next election in 2014. Finally Kando forwarded to us an e-mail he had received from ES&S which cited three specific areas in which Rhode Island’s voting machines were "non-compliant" with the voluntary standards. And we quote: "No operating system -- all OS type functions included in the assembler firmware" "No life cycle counter" "No poll open process - power on allows ballots to be read." When we asked Kando to explain, noting that legislators would likely need something in English if they were to approve spending $5 million to replace the machines, Kando replied: "While I have my own understanding of the three deficiencies . . . I am fearful that any answer that I provide will be dissected to uncover any flaw and that the best source of information is the vendor." In a phone interview, Kathy A. Rogers, vice president of government affairs with ES&S, explained the three deficiencies. "No operating system . . . " pertains to the machine’s aging hardware and software no longer being capable of tabulating votes at the speed and efficiency the suggested standards recommend. "No life cycle counter" means that Rhode Island’s machines, unlike newer models, can’t keep a running count of how many votes were counted through them in their lifetimes. And finally "no poll open process" concerns turning the machines on. For security reasons, the standards require that voting machines have a password or a lock system in order to turn them on. The Optech Eagles, however, "were designed to begin counting ballots as soon as you plugged it in," said Rogers In a follow up interview, Kando said the point he was trying to make with his statement is that Rhode Island’s voting machines are substandard, not obsolete. They still assure "an accurate and fair" tabulation of votes, he said. And ES&S did say in an e-mail to Kando that while the machines don’t comply with some new standards, they are "performing accurately, reliably and securely if used and maintained according to recommendations." Our ruling Robert Kando said that Rhode Island is the only state still using the Optech III P Eagle voting machine, and that the machines do not meet suggested federal standards. He’s wrong on the first count: a quick search found at least seven other states still using the old machines. He’s right on the second: the vendor confirmed to us that the machines aren’t compliant with some voluntary federal standards. We rule his statement Half True.

pomt-12475	Donald Trump’s "golf course on the island defaulted, like so many of his other failed business schemes. The failure left Puerto Rican taxpayers with a nearly $33 million bill."	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/may/04/florida-democratic-party/did-bankrupt-trump-golf-course-puerto-rico-leave-t/	President Donald Trump accused Democrats of using Puerto Rico’s debt as a bargaining chip before the deadline to settle the federal budget. "The Democrats want to shut government if we don't bail out Puerto Rico and give billions to their insurance companies for OCare failure. NO!" Trump tweeted April 27. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump appeared to be referring to an effort by Democrats including Florida Sen. Bill Nelson to address a Medicaid shortfall in Puerto Rico, which became the largest municipal bankruptcy May 3. The Florida Democratic Party fired back at Trump’s tweet in a press release suggesting that Trump shares blame in the island’s economic downfall. A Trump golf resort, the party said, crashed in Puerto Rico and hurt taxpayers. "Trump conveniently left out the fact that his golf course on the island defaulted, like so many of his other failed business schemes. The failure left Puerto Rican taxpayers with a nearly $33 million bill, another example of Trump's many scams that make him wealthier and con hardworking families," the party wrote. Did Trump really leave the island with a bungled investment? We found that the bankruptcy of the golf resort did leave taxpayers with a bill, and that Trump had pledged to turn things around. But the Democrats portrayed the situation in a misleading light by omitting that the business was in dire financial straits years before Trump entered the picture. The Trump family has tried to create space in the years since between the resort and their business. Golf resort’s pre-Trump financial woes The resort in Rio Grande opened as Coco Beach Golf & Country Club in 2004 and ultimately included two 18-hole golf courses and a clubhouse. Trump entered the picture in 2008. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The resort was built with support from the Puerto Rican government through the Puerto Rico Tourism Development Fund. The fund issued about $25 million in bonds in 2000 and 2004, according to a 2016 BuzzFeed article that included documents about the golf resort’s bankruptcy. The tourism development fund is paid for by tax dollars. If a private entity defaults on its obligations -- as the golf resort did in this case -- the fund has to make good on the principal and interest. The resort suffered amid the recession that hit Puerto Rico a few years before Trump got involved. To learn more about what went wrong, we interviewed Craig McCann, a principal at Securities Litigation and Consulting Group, who has testified several times in arbitrations about Puerto Rican municipal bonds but has had no role in this particular case. McCann was a key source for the BuzzFeed article, and his firm reviewed annual financial reports that were included. The recession in Puerto Rico was much worse than the mainland and started earlier as manufacturers left in 2006-07 due to the elimination of a tax subsidy for manufacturers, McCann told PolitiFact. Then the island got a second financial hit, this time rattled by the recession in the United States. The resort lost about $5.7 million in 2007 and $6.3 million in 2008. "This resort just got hammered and is hemorrhaging money before the Trump Organization’s involvement," McCann told PolitiFact. As the losses piled up, property owners went looking for help. Enter Trump. Problems continued under Trump In 2008, Trump signed two deals: a licensing agreement to rename the club as Trump International Golf Club Puerto Rico, and a management agreement to position Trump to handle the club’s operations in exchange for a share of its annual revenue and a slice of the profit. A document stated that as manager, Trump International Co had developed a plan to maintain positive operating cash flow. Trump claimed more than $600,000 in profits by the end of 2012. "Puerto Rico is a fantastic place and deserves the best, which is what we will deliver," Trump said at a 2008 news conference on the island, according to the Washington Post. "Every detail will be important to me." It isn’t clear from the documents how involved Trump really was. It is clear, however, that he didn’t solve the resort’s problems. There was at least one bright spot as the resort racked up losses: The course landed on the PGA tour in 2008. But in 2011, the resort sought more bonds to repay the earlier bonds. McCann said that even if Trump had not gotten involved, the resort was headed toward bankruptcy because the 2000 and 2004 bonds were about to default. In 2015, the resort filed for bankruptcy under its original name, the Coco Beach Golf and Country Club. The resort claimed it owed more than $78 million but only had $9 million in assets. Johanna Cervone, spokeswoman for the Democrats, says Trump was brought in to save the golf course but left taxpayers on the hook. "He was tasked with turning it around, he made revenue off of it, and it failed," she said. Eric Trump distanced his father from the project when it fell into bankruptcy "We have zero financial investment in this course," Eric Trump told Bloomberg News in July 2015. "This has absolutely nothing to do with Trump. This is a separate owner. We purely manage the golf course." (Eric Trump filed a bankruptcy claim for about $927,000 for unpaid fees on behalf of Trump Golf Coco Beach LLC.) Bankruptcy court records show that the Puerto Rico Tourism Development Fund, the largest creditor, filed a claim for $32.67 million for the real estate mortgage in 2015. The resort later sold for about $2 million to OHorizons Global, a private investment firm. This left the Government Development Bank -- the tourism fund is a subsidiary of the bank -- to make payments on the outstanding bonds. We sent a summary of the golf course’s financial problems to a few experts and asked if Trump should be blamed for the bankruptcy. (These experts on bankruptcy or corporate law received our summary with links to news reports but didn’t pore over financial records for days, as McCann’s firm did.) John A. E. Pottow, a University of Michigan law professor and bankruptcy expert, said Trump bears some blame for the failure of the golf course because he failed to turn it around. But he said it is debatable if management is to blame for bankruptcy because the context of the recession is a factor. "I don't know if I like to ‘blame’ anyone for bankruptcy, but to the extent you want to blame people, sure, blame the president (or his company)," Pottow said. Miami attorney Milton Vescovacci, of Gray Robinson law firm, says the only way to blame Trump for the bankruptcy would be if his involvement was so costly to the operation that it caused the business to fail, and that didn’t appear to be the case here. (Vescovacci is an expert on banking and finance and is currently working with an organization to lobby the U.S. government to allow Puerto Rico to restructure its debt) The golf course bankruptcy is different from bankruptcies of multiple Trump casinos, McCann said. With the casinos, Trump was a major investor and had a significant role such as controlling shareholder or as an executive. In Puerto Rico, he said, "The Trump Organization was providing services and a brand all for a fee. No equity interest. No deep involvement." The Trump Organization sent PolitiFact a statement: "The Trump Organization was neither the owner nor the developer of this property and had nothing to do with the financing of the development. Our role was to operate and manage the property." Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party said that Trump’s "golf course on the island defaulted, like so many of his other failed business schemes. The failure left Puerto Rican taxpayers with a nearly $33 million bill." Trump entered into a licensing and management agreement in 2008 -- after the golf course resort had fallen into debt. Trump failed to turn around the resort and it declared bankruptcy in 2015. The Puerto Rico Tourism Development Fund, which provided project financing in 2000 and 2004, filed a claim in bankruptcy court for $32.7 million. The fund is paid for with tax dollars. The Democratic Party is correct that taxpayers are left with a nearly $33 million bill, but it exaggerates when it points the finger exclusively at Trump, omitting important details about the recession’s impact on the resort and its financial woes years before Trump’s involvement.

pomt-03941	"Nobody in total is proposing cutting anything. We’re trying to reduce the rate of growth in government."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/feb/20/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-says-republican-budget-proposals-dont-/	Making the rounds reacting to President Barack Obama’s State of the Union speech, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson was asked why Republicans didn’t "cut their way to solvency" during the Bush administration in the 1990s. Johnson, a deficit hawk elected in 2010, reacted to the word "cut." "Nobody in total is proposing cutting anything. We’re trying to reduce the rate of growth in government," he said Feb. 13, 2013, on public radio station WUWM-FM (89.7) in Milwaukee. "And that’s what we need to do. The fact of the matter is, the extreme position is to do nothing on either Social Security or Medicare, because those programs are going broke." The bitter partisan warfare over who is cutting what and by how much can obscure the true nature of various deficit-relief plans. So let’s test Johnson’s claim that "nobody in total is proposing cutting anything." Rather, he claims, officials are "trying to reduce the rate of growth in government." In the case of Johnson, we’ve been down this road before, but with the shoe on the other foot. In defeating liberal Democrat Russ Feingold in 2010, it was Johnson who portrayed limits on spending growth in Medicare -- supported by Feingold in the federal health care law -- as "cuts" that would harm seniors. Now it’s Johnson who complains that critics misconstrue caps on the rate of spending growth as "cuts." Such is politics. But let’s look at the core issue raised by Johnson’s comments. In Johnson’s two years, have he and fellow Republicans advocated limits on federal spending growth -- or have they actually tried to shrink the budget from its current size? Over the next decade, looking at federal spending as a whole, it’s clear that the intent is to slow the growth rate. You can see that in U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget proposals, in the sequester set to take effect in March 2013 and in various spending-cap proposals pushed by Republican lawmakers. To be sure, the measures propose significant and often controversial reductions in spending over multiple years compared with current rates of growth, but they do not shrink the budget below current spending over the course of a decade. A few Johnson-specific examples: He supported both Ryan budgets. He signed onto the Contract from America plan to put a per-capita inflation cap on spending growth. He backed a spending-cap proposal by U.S. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) that tied spending to economic growth. And Johnson’s comments in various forums, most recently in January, make clear he endorses limits on total growth. In the Ryan budgets, it’s notable that in the first year of the 10-year projections, his blueprints called for spending less in year one than the year before. Federal budget plans typically are framed in 10-year increments, though, and spending rises in every year but the first under his plans. So Johnson’s point is not knocked down by this, but it’s something to consider when evaluating his claim. It’s also worth noting that Johnson praised the 2012 Ryan proposal but said it wasn’t aggressive enough in limiting growth. When you look more narrowly at specific categories of spending, instead of the whole budget, Ryan’s proposals did indeed make actual year-to-year cuts -- and over the long-term. Example: Ryan’s fiscal year 2012 plan proposed a cut in Medicaid outlays for that year, and didn’t get them back to the previous level until 2019. And Ryan’s 2012 plan cut non-defense discretionary programs by 25 percent over 10 years. Johnson, for his part, has endorsed enormous cuts on an agency-by-agency basis -- and even talks of eliminating some agencies entirely. In a January 2013 interview with The Daily Caller, Johnson said he’d go across the board. "I truly believe that any of these agencies could easily withstand a 10 or 20 percent across the board cut and still be able to perform their function," he told reporter Alex Pappas. Pappas quoted Johnson saying "an awful lot of these" agencies "probably have a harmful effect on the economy anyways, so I don’t necessarily want to maintain their function." Johnson has also scoffed at the size of the looming cuts called for in the sequester, which supposedly was a poison pill so horrible that it would force lawmakers to compromise to avoid swallowing the automatic, across-the-board cuts. A recent Congressional Budget Office estimate said the sequester would cost the United States 750,000 jobs in 2013 alone. Johnson said the sequester’s cuts over 10 years amount to "barely a rounding error" in the giant federal budget. He spoke on WTMJ-AM (620) radio in Milwaukee on February 14, 2013, about the sequester, which totals more than $1 trillion over a decade. So it’s clear Johnson supports steep budget cuts in some areas in order to slow the overall budget’s growth curve. Our rating Johnson said: "Nobody in total is proposing cutting anything. We’re trying to reduce the rate of growth in government." While Johnson supports deep cutbacks in some budget areas, he and fellow Republicans repeatedly have made clear that in Washington budget-speak -- which typically covers 10-year increments -- they are talking about limiting the size of future spending increases. Those growth limits likely would mean significant program changes and fewer federal employees. But the budget would still grow overall. We’ve examined similar claims. PolitiFact National debunked Democrats’ claims in 2011 that Ryan’s budget would "end" Medicare. And it declared Mostly False claims in 2010 by Republicans that the federal health care law cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare at the elderly’s expense. Both ratings rested in part on the recognition that Medicare’s budget would continue to grow, just at a slower pace, under the cost-savings plans. Johnson’s claim is something of a reverse image of those claims, though on a grander scale. With the points of clarification noted above, we think his main point is on target. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2013-02-20T09:00:00	2013-02-13	['None']
pomt-03328	"Homicides against blacks have tripled" since Florida’s "stand your ground" law has been in existence.	false	/florida/statements/2013/jul/24/jesse-jackson/homicides-blacks-have-tripled-stand-your-ground-wa/	Rev. Jesse Jackson called for a boycott of Florida, which he labeled an "apartheid state" after George Zimmerman was acquitted in the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin. "No doubt ... the inclination (is) to boycott Florida, to stop conventions, to isolate Florida as a kind of apartheid state given this whole 'stand your ground' laws,"Jackson said on CNN July 18. "Homicides against blacks have tripled since this law has been in existence. Now more homicides and more guns make us less secure." On July 13, a jury acquitted Zimmerman, a white Hispanic volunteer neighborhood watchman, in the death of Martin, an unarmed black teenager killed in Sanford in 2012. Zimmerman claimed self-defense. The case has sparked much discussion about the impact of the "stand your ground" law in Florida -- particularly for the black community. After Jackson made his remarks, several readers emailed us: Is Jackson correct that since the law passed, homicides of black victims have tripled? Data on black homicide victims in Florida Signed into law by then-Gov. Jeb Bush in 2005, Florida’s "stand your ground" law says a person has "no duty to retreat and has the right to stand his or her ground and meet force with force, including deadly force if he or she reasonably believes it is necessary to do so to prevent death or great bodily harm to himself or herself or another or to prevent the commission of a forcible felony." The Florida Department of Law Enforcement emailed PolitiFact data showing the number of black homicide victims each year. Since "stand your ground" went into effect part way through 2005, we started the clock ticking in 2006. Here are the number of black homicide victims each year: 2006: 524 2007: 573 2008: 564 2009: 494 2010: 452 2011: 476 2012: 532 That shows the sheer number of black homicide victims between 2006 and 2012 barely changed: it rose from 524 to 532. (Even if we did include 2005 -- which wouldn’t be a fair analysis since the law went into effect part way through the year -- we would not find the number of homicides of black people tripled. The number rose from 428 in 2005 to 532 in 2012, or a 24 percent increase.) We also looked at the number of homicides of black people as a percentage of the total number of homicides and did not find they tripled. Justifiable homicides So where did Jackson get this idea that homicides of black people had tripled? We aren’t certain, since Jackson’s Rainbow PUSH Coalition did not respond to our questions. However, we suspect that he might have been referring to justifiable homicides by civilians. Reports of justifiable homicides tripled after "stand your ground" went into effect, the Tampa Bay Times reported in October 2010 based on FDLE data. (The Times and Miami Herald are partners in PolitiFact Florida.) Later in the CNN interview, Jackson seems to be referring to these numbers. After a question specifically about the "stand your ground," Jackson said, "There has been a triple increase in these shootings since this law has been in effect." If what he meant by "these shootings" were justifiable homicides, then Jackson was on track. But that’s different from the statement he made earlier. (Read more about the increase in justifiable homicides.) Our ruling During an interview on CNN about Florida’s "stand your ground" law Jackson said: "Homicides against blacks have tripled since this law has been in existence." The law was enacted part way through 2005. The number of homicides in which black people were the victims fluctuated from year to year between 2006 and 2012 and didn’t come anywhere close to tripling. It’s possible Jackson is confusing homicides with justifiable homicides, but that’s a key qualifier that he omitted in part of his comments. We’re rating his statement that homicides against blacks have tripled. That’s not accurate, so we rate the statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f87b2e8f-1ede-48fa-a331-d1dca3f923e7	None	Jesse Jackson	None	None	None	2013-07-24T16:42:41	2013-07-18	['None']

He went on to say he traveled all over the world looking at the effects of greenhouse gas emissions, and introduced legislation on the subject of global warming. But let's check the record – as we have in the past when McCain made similar claims on the campaign trail – and see if he was in fact at odds with Bush on global warming. McCain spoke up about global warming in January 2003. And as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he held hearings on the issue several years before that. On Jan. 9, 2003, McCain and Sen. Joe Liberman introduced the Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship Act, which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capping them and allowing companies and utilities to sell or trade their emission rights. When he introduced the bill, McCain called it "the first comprehensive piece of legislation" in capping emissions. "The U.S. is responsible for 25 percent of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions," he said. "It is time for the U.S. government to do its part to address this global problem, and legislation on mandatory reductions is the form of leadership that is required to address this global problem." By contrast, the Bush administration has opposed cap-and-trade programs and preferred voluntary efforts on climate change. Manik Roy, director of congressional affairs for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said McCain had actually been working on the climate change bill in 2001, but it got delayed after the 9/11 attacks. The Lieberman-McCain bill ultimately failed in October 2003 by a 43-55 vote, but Roy said it was a key step in "educating the Senate" about how government could respond to global warming. "It is absolutely correct that McCain stood up on this issue, forced the Senate to focus on this issue when nobody else thought it made sense and did it with strong opposition from the White House," Roy said. He called McCain "a huge leader on this issue in the Senate." And so we find McCain's statement to be True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-10-07T00:00:00	2008-10-07	['George_W._Bush']

pomt-14988	On the Keystone XL pipeline	no flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/14/hillary-clinton/clinton-says-her-keystone-xl-position-isnt-flip-fl/	Hillary Clinton says she now opposes the Keystone XL oil pipeline. Is that a flip-flop? Former Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley said yes during the first Democratic presidential debate on Oct. 13. "Secretary Clinton's campaign put out a lot of reversals on positions on Keystone and many other things," he said. Clinton said no. "You know, we know that if you are learning, you're going to change your position," Clinton said in response. "I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone." We wanted to look at Clinton’s comments, which drew the ire of some critics. They pointed to something Clinton said in 2010. Then, she said the administration was "inclined" to approve the pipeline extension. But isolating that single word leaves out a good bit of context. The Keystone XL pipeline, which would carry heavy crude oil mixture from Western Canada to the United States, has long been on hold pending a review by President Barack Obama and the State Department. The administration must first determine if the pipeline "serves the national interest" because it crosses an international border. Chief opposition to the project comes from environmental groups. Throughout her campaign in 2015, Clinton has avoided taking a position on the pipeline -- until she announced in September that she opposes it. Prior to that, Clinton’s last substantial comment on her Keystone position was in 2010 when she was secretary of state. Speaking on Oct. 15, 2010, with the Commonwealth Club, a public forum in California, Clinton took a question asking if the administration would be willing to "reconsider" the pipeline. Here’s Clinton’s response: "Well, there hasn't been a final decision made. (Crosstalk) Probably not. And we -- but we haven't finished all of the analysis. So as I say, we've not yet signed off on it. But we are inclined to do so, and we are for several reasons -- going back to one of your original questions -- we're either going to be dependent on dirty oil from the Gulf or dirty oil from Canada. And until we can get our act together as a country and figure out that clean, renewable energy is in both our economic interests and the interests of our planet -- (applause) -- I mean, I don't think it will come as a surprise to anyone how deeply disappointed the president and I are about our inability to get the kind of legislation through the Senate that the United States was seeking." A couple of days later in 2010, a State Department spokesman said, "her words obviously stand," and "her response reflected the status of the Keystone XL pipeline." So yes, Clinton indicated that the administration at the time was "inclined" to sign off on the pipeline. But she did say multiple times that the analysis was not complete -- leaving open the possibility that the administration could backtrack if negative information were to come forward. The answer was positive toward the pipeline’s prospects, but she did not in any way say she supported it unequivocally. In a 2011 news conference with the Canadian foreign minister, Clinton answered a couple questions about the administration’s preliminary Keystone XL review. But she did not indicate her position beyond vague comments such as, "We are leaving no stone unturned in this process." Our conclusion Clinton said, "I never took a position on Keystone until I took a position on Keystone." In 2010, she said the administration was "inclined" to back it, but she qualified that statement by noting that the analysis was not complete, and the administration had not taken a final position. While this shows a more positive attitude toward Keystone XL than Clinton’s position today, it was not a firm stance. Other than that one comment, Clinton did not indicate her position on Keystone until she announced that she opposed it in September 2015. We rate Clinton's position a No Flip.

pomt-14367	"Requiring photo ID would keep about 200,000 Missourians from voting."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2016/mar/21/kip-kendrick/rep-kip-kendrick-half-right-voter-id-statement/	What documents should voters have to show to make it to the polls? The question continues to spark debate in state legislatures across the country, with new voter ID legislation coming to the forefront in a number of states. The Missouri legislature is discussing measures that would narrow the acceptable forms of voter ID to non-expired photo identification issued by the state or federal government. The proposed legislation would exclude currently acceptable forms of voter identification like student IDs, out-of-state driver’s licenses, or bank statements and utility bills. State Rep. Kip Kendrick, D-Columbia, recently weighed in on the legislation’s potential for disenfranchising voters, saying "requiring photo ID would keep about 200,000 Missourians from voting." That number caught our attention. We decided to dig into the details of the proposed legislation, and take a closer look at just how many Missouri voters would be affected by photo ID requirements. Numbers from the Secretary of State Kendrick said he got his estimate of those who would be kept from voting — "more than 200,000" — from Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander. A report from Kander’s office corroborates Kendrick’s statement, showing 220,000 people potentially disenfranchised. According to the Secretary of State’s office, that number came from comparing the list of registered voters in Missouri to the Department of Revenue’s accounting of those without driver’s licenses (about 150,000 people) and those with expired driver’s licenses (about 70,000). Those numbers are at best a rough approximation. Marvin Overby, political science professor at MU, said he can think of two factors that would make the Secretary of State’s estimate too high. "A number of people who don’t have driver’s licenses do have photo identification, it’s just in a non-driver’s license form," Overby said. "And those in prison or on parole or probation can’t vote, regardless of their ID status." Numbers from the proposed legislation An even higher estimate of Missourians without non-expired photo identification — almost 400,000 people — actually is cited in the proposed legislation’s fiscal note. The note sets aside up to $10.7 million to cover costs associated with providing new photo IDs. That’s because unless the House Budget and Senate Appropriations committees allocate the necessary funding to provide photo ID at no charge for those currently without, the state would be barred from implementing the new requirements. Kendrick’s source, Secretary of State Jason Kander’s report, doesn’t take this information into account. Kander’s report is two years old and refers to an older bill that did not require the state to bear the cost of providing supporting documentation necessary for photo ID — theoretically making the requirement of photo ID a poll tax. But the current proposed legislation does hold the state responsible for providing birth certificates or other necessary documents free of charge for photo ID. In theory, this would reduce the chances that any new ID requirements might disenfranchise voters currently lacking photo identification. The cost of photo ID The $10.7 million suggested in the proposed legislation’s fiscal note would cover other costs as well as providing supporting documentation for IDs, like manufacturing and postage for new photo IDs. It also includes funding for an updated DMV website; new hires in the Department of Revenue, the Department of Health and Senior Service, and the Bureau of Vital records; and pre-election TV, radio, and print ads to let voters know of the change in ID requirements. But it doesn’t mention any plans for in-person help for Missouri residents unfamiliar with navigating a bureaucracy — a lack of familiarity that could easily be a symptom of not needing to procure a photo ID in the past. And for some, even a photo ID supplied for no charge isn’t free. Missouri League of Women Voters President Elaine Blodgett said the costs associated with the new IDs go beyond creating a new document. "There’s an undue burden on women, who might have to get their birth certificates and marriage certificates and divorce certificates in order to get photo ID, if they’ve changed their names," she said. "Also, simply getting to all the offices needed can be nearly impossible for some of our disabled or elderly voters." Kendrick told Politifact Missouri that older adults may have issues tracking down birth certificates because states don’t necessarily have the same standards for maintaining birth records. He also added a time qualifier to his earlier statement and said "if voter photo ID was in place right now, over 200,000 registered MO voters would not be able to vote." In addition, even with the plan outlined in the bill’s fiscal note, some voters may still remain unaware of the new requirements. If voters came to the polls without the correct ID, they could cast provisional ballots; but in the 2012 presidential election, fewer than 3 in 10 provisional ballots were counted because many voters did not return to verify their address or identity after casting a provisional ballot. Our ruling While requiring a photo ID could be expensive and might affect or inconvenience between 220,000 and 400,000 Missourians, it wouldn’t necessarily keep them from voting. Unlike past bills, the legislation currently proposed does address the cost of supplying supporting documentation necessary for obtaining photo ID, making it difficult to say it would financially "keep people from voting." No one knows exactly how many Missourians would be affected by new photo ID requirements — but there is consensus that the number who would need new photo IDs is in the hundreds of thousands.

pomt-02546	Pinellas County voters "elected me as their chief financial officer … (and) elected me as (their) governor four years ago."	true	/florida/statements/2014/feb/05/alex-sink/alex-sink-says-pinellas-county-voted-her-be-cfo-go/	Democrat Alex Sink’s bid for the late C.W. Bill Young’s vacant U.S. House seat hasn’t exactly been helped by the fact that she isn’t a Pinellas native, though she did rent a condo and move there while launching her campaign. Republicans have harped on this point for months, calling Sink a "carpetbagger." They ask how could she well represent an area she didn’t grow up in. So it was no surprise that Sink addressed this concern at Monday night’s debate at St. Petersburg College. "One of the things that sets me apart is that I’ve actually been elected by the people of Pinellas County," she said, responding to a moderator’s question about how she differs from Jolly and Libertarian Lucas Overby, both of whom have never ran for elected office before. "They elected me as their chief financial officer and I served them and their interests. And they actually elected me as governor four years ago." PolitiFact Florida revisited 2006 and 2010 election results to see if Sink was right that a majority of Pinellas County voters supported her. Sink won her bid for chief financial officer in 2006, beating out Republican Tom Lee with 55.5 percent of the vote in Pinellas and 53.5 percent statewide. That’s different than what happened in 2010, when Sink lost a tight gubernatorial race to Republican Rick Scott. She netted 47.7 percent of the statewide vote, shy of Scott’s 48.9 percent. In Pinellas, though, the story was different. There, Sink came out on top, and by a bigger margin, with 50.7 percent to Scott’s 45 percent. We chose to focus on Pinellas County percentages because that’s what Sink referred to in her claim. But for the March 11 special election, not all Pinellas voters are eligible to weigh in. Florida’s 13th congressional district spans from Fort de Soto Park up to Dunedin, but excludes parts of downtown and southern St. Petersburg. Our ruling Sink claimed that Pinellas County voters supported her in both her 2006 run for chief financial officer and her 2010 bid for governor. On both counts, the election results support her point. We rated her claim True.	None	Alex Sink	None	None	None	2014-02-05T15:15:53	2014-02-03	['None']
pomt-11054	"Most (immigrants) do show up in court."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/26/wolf-blitzer/majority-undocumented-immigrants-show-court-data-s/	Defenders of President Donald Trump’s aggressive approach to illegal U.S.-Mexico border crossings say the country faces a binary choice: hold offenders in detention centers while their cases are adjudicated, or allow them to fall off immigration authorities’ radar. The argument hinges on the belief that undocumented border-crossers released from federal custody are more likely to skip court and abscond than show up for mandatory court hearings. This rationale led the Trump administration to hold border-crossers in detention facilities without the possibility of being released on bond, in a break with the previous administration’s so-called "catch-and-release" practice. The acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Thomas Homan pressed the "no show" argument on CNN’s Situation Room, before anchor Wolf Blitzer pushed back. "They'll say the right thing to get released from detention, then they won't show up in court," Homan said June 19. "But they're already in the United States. They're lost in society. They never get removed. So as long as we send the world this message — ‘Come and say the right thing, get released, never to show up in court’ — you're never going to fix this." Blitzer countered, "Most of them do show up in court. They don't necessarily disappear." Immigrants’ purported low court attendance rate has become a popular talking point, from Trump himself ("When we release the people, they never come back to the judge, anyway — they're gone"), to White House staff and law enforcement officials, to the administration’s conservative media allies. In absolute terms, more than 100,000 non-detained immigrants have been ordered to be deported in recent years because they failed to appear before an immigration judge. However, as a percentage, most undocumented immigrants do show up for court. Court attendance by all types of immigrants According to Justice Department data from the last five available years, around 60 to 75 percent of non-detained migrants have attended their immigration court proceedings. That’s determined by subtracting the percentage of judgments entered against migrants in their absence (known as an in absentia ruling) from total judgments entered. So Blitzer is right, in percentage terms: Most of them do show up in court. But it’s worth noting that in absolute terms, that’s nearly 140,000 non-detained immigrants who were ordered to be deported between 2012-16 because they were not present in the courtroom, according to Justice Department data. (Though some immigration advocates say that count is high.) "On the overall question of the importance immigration officials should attach to no-shows: the glass is either half full or half empty," said Peter Margulies, an immigration law and national security law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law. Despite a majority attending their hearings, he said, "that still yields a significant number of no-shows (and) noncitizens unaccounted for." Several experts emphasized that using monitoring devices and providing immigrants with legal counsel correlated with higher attendance. "I do think having appropriate legal representation for asylum claimants would help a lot," Margulies said. "Many may not know that they have good claims. Better legal advice would further improve the attendance rate." Court attendance by asylum-seekers As the CNN transcript shows, Homan and Blitzer were discussing asylees, so it’s worth distinguishing that group from other migrants. Asylum-seekers flee to the United States out of fear of persecution in their home country due to race, religion, nationality, or because their social or political activities have put a target on their back. One example is the case of an asylee identified in court documents only as M.G.U., who is suing the Trump administration in relation to its family separation policy. M.G.U. fled Guatemala with her three minor-age sons after her husband received death threats for his community organizing efforts there, according the lawsuit. M.G.U. and her sons appeared at the San Ysidro, Calif., port of entry in May to request asylum due to their fear of returning to Guatemala. As a technical matter, M.G.U. and her family’s case is considered an "affirmative" application for asylum because the applicants went to U.S. authorities to make the request. In contrast, undocumented migrants requesting asylum during a deportation proceeding make a "defensive" application. In either case, immigrants must be found to have a credible fear of persecution to be considered for asylum. As we’ve noted before, there’s been a nearly 1,700 percent increase in U.S. asylum claims over the last 10 years. What’s fueling the increase is growing instability, gang violence and worsening economic conditions in Central America’s "Northern Triangle" countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. "Initially, a lot of migration was single males from Mexico coming for work," said Joshua Breisblatt, a senior policy analyst at the American Immigration Council. "Now you’re seeing a shift to Central American families fleeing record levels of violence in the Northern Triangle." So what do the court attendance rates of asylees look like? While the data is scarce, they show higher rates, compared to when all migrants are tallied together. One source of data comes from an Obama-era program that released asylees from detention and matched them with case managers who encouraged compliance with court-ordered obligations. As of April, the Family Case Management Program, or FCMP, had 630 enrolled families. Before the Trump administration ended the program in June, participants had a 100 percent attendance record at court hearings. They also had a 99 percent rate of check-ins and appointments with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to a Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General report. "According to ICE, overall program compliance for all five regions is an average of 99 percent for ICE check-ins and appointments, as well as 100 percent attendance at court hearings," the report said. "Since the inception of FCMP, 23 out of 954 participants (2 percent) were reported as absconders." In 2015, the immigration advocacy group American Immigration Council published a report that looked at studies from over the previous two decades that examined how well asylum seekers fulfilled their legal obligations. It found studies showed "very high rates of compliance with proceedings by asylum seekers who were placed into alternatives to detention." The report cited a 2000 U.S. government-commissioned study that found an "83 percent rate of compliance with court proceedings among asylum seekers who were found to have a credible fear in the expedited removal process." It also showed an 84 percent compliance rate among asylees under minimal supervision, and 78 percent among those who were unsupervised. A 2013 study sponsored by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that looked at asylees in Toronto and Geneva noted a "cooperative predisposition" among asylum seekers. While the study did not look specifically at U.S.-bound asylees, it cited characteristics common among asylees, including an "inclination towards law-abidingness," perhaps in relation to having fled home counties lacking in rule of law. It also noted asylum-seekers "lack of a plan B" due to the "impossibility of returning home." Our ruling Blitzer said "most (immigrants) do show up in court." Around 60-75 percent of non-detained migrants have attended their immigration court proceedings, according to Justice Department data from the last five available years. Some limited data suggests rates may be higher for asylum-seekers. That said, it’s important to note that in absolute terms, a significant number of migrants have had in absentia deportation orders filed against them for failure to appear in court, which Blitzer’s statement overlooks.

pomt-03624	Says Gov. Rick Scott allowed Republican legislators to cut his teacher pay raise proposal by 60 percent.	false	/florida/statements/2013/may/06/allison-tant/democratic-party-chair-allison-tant-attacks-gov-ri/	Florida Democratic Party chairwoman Allison Tant attacked Gov. Rick Scott as a feckless chief executive who let the Florida Legislature steamroll his session priorities. "He boasted that his No. 1 priority for the 2013 session was a $2,500 across-the-board raise for classroom teachers," Tant wrote in an April 30 column for Florida Voices. "Seven weeks later his abject failure to defend his top issue has allowed Republican legislators to cut that raise by 60 percent with a multitude of strings attached." We detailed the Legislature’s compromise with Scott on teacher pay raises in this fact-check. In this case, we were intrigued by Tant’s claim that legislators cut Scott’s requested pay raise by 60 percent. (Tant’s column ran a few days before the Legislature lifted some of the more controversial strings on the raises, including the requirement that they be paid no sooner than June 2014.) Before the session, Scott asked for a pot of $480 million from which to dole out a $2,500 raise to every teacher. The Legislature set aside the amount he wanted, on top of adding $1 billion to education spending. But lawmakers did not exactly follow his request. The raises will not go just to teachers. Principals, vice principals, guidance counselors, social workers, psychologists and librarians are also eligible for raises. Scott said every teacher will get a raise. While a raise is likely for most, it is not guaranteed. School districts in negotiations with unions will ultimately decide who gets raises and how much. Lawmakers outlined a merit-pay system but gave districts the choice to implement their own merit plans. Adding thousands of noninstructional personnel into the pool for raises is another point of consideration, as superintendents may have to shuffle the amount of raises for teachers or the number of people who get them to make everyone fit. Bottom line: The specifics are TBD, to be determined. We asked the Democrats to support the 60 percent figure. Did Tant crunch the numbers and find that teachers will get raises of just $1,000, or 60 percent less than what Scott wanted? The Democrats: The line was a mistake. Tant’s column conflated money for teacher pay raises with money that was set aside for raises for state workers. "It was an error," said party spokesman Max Steele. State and university workers will receive a $1,000 or $1,400 raise depending on income (some may earn an extra $600 for performance) for the first time in seven years starting in October. Law enforcement officers will get even higher raises. What the Democrats did is divide the $200 million pot for state and university workers by the $480 million Scott asked for. Using that (flawed) math, Scott got about 40 percent of his request -- or, viewed another way, a 60 percent cut of what he asked for. Our ruling Tant said Scott only got 60 percent of the teacher pay raise he wanted. The final budget compromise adds thousands of noninstructors into the pay raise mix, which could affect the number of teachers who get raises or at least how much those raises are. Still, we don’t know what that will mean on a statewide level because teacher pay is worked out by local districts and their unions. Still, this isn’t even what Tant was trying to analyze. She just used a mismatched number. We give the Democrats props for coming clean with their mistake. But we rate Tant’s statement False.

pomt-09182	"Sixty-four percent of Americans support the Arizona immigration law.''	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/03/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-says-president-obama-out-step-nation-ar/	With the stroke of a pen, Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer catapulted herself into the national spotlight. On April 23, 2010, she signed into law what many call the toughest bill on illegal immigration in the country. The bill makes it a crime to stay in the country illegally, requires all aliens to carry immigration paperwork, and sanctions employers who knowingly hire illegal workers. Facing criticism that the law would legalize racial profiling, the Arizona Legislature modified the law on May 1, 2010. It now states that police officers cannot use race as the sole grounds for suspecting that someone is in the country illegally. The law produced mixed reactions among political leaders. President Barack Obama commented that it threatened ''to undermine basic notions of fairness that we cherish as Americans, as well as the trust between police and our communities that is so crucial to keeping us safe.'' But some people argue that President Obama's reaction is unfounded, given that the majority of Americans actually supports Arizona's immigration law. During his May 27 show, talk host Glenn Beck said that "Sixty-four percent of Americans support the Arizona immigration law. Yet we're going to -- we're actually -- our government is going down there to fight them. Eric Holder is fighting them in court. They're becoming more and more brazen each and every day." Beck is referring to an announcement by Attorney General Eric Holder that the U.S. Department of Justice may challenge the law in court. Given the public outrage over the law, is Beck correct that more than 6 in 10 Americans stand behind Arizona? We decided to find out. The number that Beck cites comes from a Wall Street Journal/NBC poll that was conducted in early May. The poll found that 64 percent of Americans were either somewhat or strongly supportive of the law. There are other polls, however, that show a slightly different result. • An April 27-28 Gallup poll found that of those Americans who have heard of the law, 51 percent support it. Among all Americans, 39 percent favor it, 30 percent oppose it, and 31 percent either had no opinion or have not heard of the law. • A Pew Research Center poll conducted between May 6 and May 9 found that 59 percent approve of the law. • A May 19-24 poll by the Quinnipiac University found 51 percent of American voters support the Arizona law. Moreover, 48 percent say that they want their state to pass an immigration law similar to Arizona's. All of the polls that we've looked at show that more Americans favor the law than oppose it, but the numbers vary widely. To recap. Glenn Beck said on his program that 64 percent of Americans support Arizona's new immigration law. That statistic, however, comes from a single poll. Other polls show slightly lower approval ratings. Still, his underlying point that most Americans agree with Arizona is correct. We rate this one Mostly True.	None	Glenn Beck	None	None	None	2010-06-03T13:22:07	2010-05-27	['United_States', 'Arizona']

pomt-12521	"The pace of missile development between (Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un) has increased the testing about twenty-fold."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/apr/24/richard-burr/north-koreas-missile-testing-and-development-has-i/	Shortly after North Korea failed to launch a missile in an attempted show of force, one of the U.S. congressmen who keeps a particularly close eye on the erratic dictatorship had a warning. North Carolina Republican Sen. Richard Burr, the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, told a group of constituents at a meeting in Youngsville, N.C., that North Korea’s latest actions were "something to really be concerned about." Burr went on to explain two reasons for his warning. One, he said, is that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un might be crazy. The other, he said, is that Kim has significantly ramped up missile development and testing since taking over for his father, the late Kim Jong-il. "When you do things like he does, you automatically assume he’s crazy," Burr said of Kim Jong Un. "The pace of missile development between his father’s term and his term has increased the testing about twenty-fold." There has been plenty of bluster and confusion surrounding the country’s missile launch lately – including the launch itself, a pre-launch parade replete with new military technology, and the Trump administration saying it had sent an aircraft carrier strike force to the area when, in reality, the ships were thousands of miles away and sailing in the opposite direction. So in the midst of so much noise, we wanted to know if Burr was right. Specifically, we looked into his claim that "the pace of missile development between (Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un) has increased the testing about twenty-fold." A tiny but well-armed country In terms of troops, North Korea has one of the world’s largest militaries, along with the United States (a major adversary), China (its biggest ally) and India. Kim Jong Il wasn’t hesitant to build and test missiles, much to the dismay of neighboring countries. So increasing missile activity by a factor of 20 would require serious commitment by the younger Kim. Burr’s office didn’t respond when we asked where he got his information. He is, of course, privy to all sorts of secret reports and briefings we don’t have at our own disposal. He’s the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, which oversees the 17 U.S. spy agencies. But we don’t think he would have unveiled classified information. And from the information that is public, it appears Burr is more or less correct. Missile testing and development We interviewed multiple North Korea experts, none of whom said they could verify the numerical accuracy of Burr’s claim – especially as it relates to missile development. Missile tests can be counted, but it’s harder to quantify the speed at which new technologies are being developed and perfected. "Perhaps saying the ‘pace of missile development’ is not quite accurate wording, but the pace of testing has indeed been unprecedented under Kim Jong Un," said Jean H. Lee. Lee is a former journalist who covered North Korea and now works for the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. She said even failed tests are worrisome because North Korea is trying to create a nuclear-armed intercontinental ballistic missile that could hit the United States. "With every test, they get closer to mastering that technology," she said. We couldn’t find any report from the Department of Defense that might vouch for Burr’s numbers. But we did find a February speech by Admiral Harry Harris, the head of the DoD’s Pacific Command. He spoke about North Korea’s "aggressive weapons test schedule" and a growing missile threat in the Pacific, which is in keeping with the general theme of Burr’s claim. The North Korea experts we interviewed all said something like Lee’s assessment: That Burr is correct to say Kim Jong Un put a greater focus on missiles, even if it’s hard to define how much. "The range of their missiles is being extended," said T.J. Pempel, a University of California, Berkeley, political science professor who specializes in northeast Asia. "They have substantial submarine launched missiles; they have ICBMs. The frequency and number of their tests is also going up." Joseph Bermudez, an expert with the North Korea analysis group 38 North who has testified before Congress and the United Nations on the country’s missiles, said Burr is right about the increased pace of testing. One of Bermudez’s colleagues at 38 North put together a timeline of missile tests by North Korea, along with an assessment that nearly backs up Burr’s point – at least about testing, if not about development. It said North Korea tested only one missile in 2006 (under Kim Jong Il) but tested 15 in 2014 (under Kim Jong Un). In 2016, the DoD’s annual report to Congress made a similar point. "Kim Jong Un seems to prioritize the development of new weapons systems, as demonstrated by his numerous appearances with military units and research and development organizations," the report read. But Bermudez said Burr’s not necessarily right to say an increase in testing equates to breakthroughs in development. Every missile program requires research and development, testing, training, tweaking and more testing. It’s not a fluid timeline, Bermudez said. There are spikes in activity surrounded by relatively dormant periods. "Now if you have multiple missile programs going on, these cycles overlap," he said. "... It might give the false impression that something is happening that isn't happening." Furthermore, he said, many North Korean missile tests are conducted for political reasons, intended to send a message instead of to further research and development. That’s another factor making it difficult to tell if the pace of development has driven the increase in the pace of testing, as Burr had claimed. Our ruling Sen. Richard Burr said that in North Korea, "the pace of missile development between (Kim Jong Il and Kim Jong Un) has increased the testing about twenty-fold." Experts say missile testing has certainly increased, and at least one analysis shows that increase was close to what Burr said. What’s less clear is if the increased testing has gone hand-in-hand with increased development, or if the tests aren’t moving the country’s missile program forward as much as they might seem. We rate this claim Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Richard Burr	None	None	None	2017-04-24T12:56:05	2017-04-18	['None']

pomt-13034	Lady Gaga announced she would cover her face "until Trump gets fired from office."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2016/dec/01/blog-posting/lady-gaga-did-not-say-she-would-cover-her-face-unt/	A story about recording artist Lady Gaga announcing she would cover her face until President-elect Donald Trump is out of office appears to be masking the truth. A Nov. 25, 2016, post on TheRightists.com claimed that Gaga — née Stefani Germanotta — revealed her protest plan on a CBS Sunday Morning interview. The original post, with the headline "Lady Gaga Reveals Plan To Cover Her Face Again ‘Until Trump Gets Fired From Office And I Feel Free Once More,’" was temporarily missing after the interview aired, but has reappeared. The story also was posted practically verbatim on several other sites. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com After a brief synopsis of Gaga saying she lamented losing her privacy to the paparazzi as a pop singer, the post quoted her as saying she was opposed to a Trump presidency. "I might have to go back to hiding my face again until he gets kicked out of the White House," the story quoted her as saying. She allegedly told CBS correspondent Lee Cowan that she had moved past "wearing a mask" as she had done with elaborate costumes earlier in her career. She thought Trump was a real monster who would drive her back to the practice, whether it was with makeup or an actual mask. "I’m sorry to have to disappoint my fans, but I’m afraid I’m going to have to revert to wearing a mask whenever I’m out in public, and that includes performing during live shows and on television as well," the story quoted her as saying. "Until Donald Trump is fired from office and stops making everybody’s life miserable, and simultaneously, until things quiet down around me a bit to a point where I’m able to go out to lunch and not have my picture taken 10,000 times on the way to the diner, I’ll be going back to wearing a mask." While Gaga did appear in a CBS Sunday Morning segment on Nov. 27, the idea that she announced a new kind of poker face turned out to be a bald-faced lie. She said no such thing in the nine-minute interview. We also could find no mention of it on her profiles at Twitter, Facebook or Instagram, or her website. (Our inquiries to her Interscope Records label and CBS News went unanswered.) Gaga, a Hillary Clinton supporter, did make a number of moves after Election Day, protesting Trump’s victory in front of Trump Tower, signing a Change.org petition asking Republican electors to switch their votes to Clinton and recently admonishing Melania Trump’s "hypocrisy" for the future first lady’s plans for an anti-bullying campaign. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Gaga also really discussed with Cowan how she felt trapped in a bad romance with her public persona, unable to freely express herself outside of her own home: "I’m very acutely aware that once I cross that property line, I’m not free anymore. As soon as I go out into the world, I belong, in a way, to everyone else. It’s legal to follow me. It’s legal to stalk me at the beach. I can’t call the police or ask them to leave. And I took a long, hard look at that property line, and I said, ‘Well, you know, if I can’t be free out there, I can be free in here.’" The Nov. 25 story on TheRightists.com used similar, but not identical, wording before launching into the alleged Trump tirade. It’s possible the site was able to lift the initial gist of the interview before it aired thanks to a Nov. 23 preview of the segment on CBSNews.com. The site bills itself as a "HYBRID site of news and satire," and that "part of our stories already happens, part, not yet." It also admits that "NOT all of our stories are true!" There was no indication which part of the Gaga story might be true and which part was not. Other sites that posted the story didn’t specify, either. That gives us a million reasons to find their claims unreliable. Our ruling Bloggers said Lady Gaga announced she would cover her face "until Trump gets fired from office." The original post, which has been taken down, was on a site that billed itself as a hybrid of news and satire, and referenced a real interview on CBS Sunday Morning. There was no indication of what was real and what was made up in the story, and it was copied by several other sites that also didn’t identify the fabricated portions. Although Gaga has spoken out against Trump, there’s no mention of him in the CBS interview — nor did she announce a plan to shield her face out of grief. Bloggers may have been looking to garner applause for this one, but Gaga’s supposed mask appears to be made out of whole cloth.

pomt-09718	"Forcing Americans off of their current health coverage and onto a government-run plan isn't the answer, but that's exactly what the Democrats' plan would do."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/28/john-boehner/health-care-reform-will-not-force-people-governmen/	When Democratic Sen. Harry Reid announced this week that he was including a form of a public option in health care reform, Republicans didn't like it. "Whether you call it a public option, an opt-out, a trigger, or a co-op, the fact is all of these proposals put us on the path to government-run health care," said Republican House leader John Boehner. "Forcing Americans off of their current health coverage and onto a government-run plan isn't the answer, but that's exactly what the Democrats' plan would do." We've been studying the health care reform proposals in both the House and the Senate for some time now. All the plans have rules that would prevent people from being "forced" off their current health coverage and into a government-run plan. We asked Boehner's office for a response. Staffers sent us to a study by the Lewin Group , which predicts that 123 million people would be enrolled in a public plan three years after the exchange is opened. (The Lewin Group is respected by many health care analysts and operates with editorial independence, but it is a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group, whose primary business is private health insurance.) Here's an outline of the general argument on how 123 million people could become enrolled in a public plan: The public option will be a health insurance plan backed by the U.S. government, so it will have access to unlimited taxpayer funds and have unsurpassed bargaining power with hospitals and doctors. It will be able to force providers to accept low payments, such as what Medicare, the government-run health program for seniors, pays. So the public option will be the cheapest insurance option available on the exchange. Employers will see this and decide to sign up all their workers for the public option. The private insurance industry will wither and die. A single-payer system is upon us. The problem with this line of reasoning is that the Democratic proposals so far include rules specifically to stop this from happening. We'll take it point-by-point: • The public option is not to be supplemented with unlimited taxpayer funds. The House and Senate bills say the federal government can support its administrative expenses when it begins, but it will have to be self-sustaining with patient premiums. • It will not be able to force hospitals and doctors to accept Medicare rates. The details of how the public option will work are still being developed, but committees in the House and Senate have indicated the public option should have to negotiate rates with providers, not pay Medicare rates. • Most employers will not have access to the health care exchange. The Senate Finance Committee proposal is very clear on this point; only small businesses will have access to the exchange. The House proposal is a little less clear. In the third year, it gives a health commissioner the power to allow businesses into the exchange. But the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office seemed to think the exchange would continue to be restricted to smaller businesses. The CBO projected only 30 million people would be in the exchange by 2019, a number too small to imply that all employers would be given access. • Employers can't sign up their employees for a health care plan. The House and Senate proposals specifically forbid that. The employer can provide a set amount of money as a benefit, but the employee decides which plan to buy. If an employee is willing to pay more for a more generous plan, the employer can't stop him. And employers definitely can't force employees to enroll in the public option against their will. An argument others have made along these same lines: If a public option is offered on the exchange, employers will dump their coverage and send them into the exchange to buy their own insurance. This is a largely speculative argument, however. Employers are under significant competitive pressure to offer health plans to recruit and retain workers, according to experts we've spoken with. Surveys show that workers see health insurance as the top benefit affecting their decisions on where they work. If there's evidence to indicate that the availability of a public option would overcome that dynamic, we haven't found it. There's another argument specific to seniors that Boehner's staff pointed to as evidence for his statement. They said that under the Democratic plans, seniors in Medicare Advantage would have to switch to regular Medicare. We've looked at this argument before: Medicare Advantage is a government program that pays private insurance companies a set rate to treat Medicare beneficiaries. It was conceived as a cost-containment measure on the theory that competition among private plans would drive down costs. That has not happened. The health care proposals would stop the extra payments that Medicare Advantage receives. (About 23 percent of all Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in Medicare Advantage.) So it is conceivable that some people in Medicare Advantage will lose some of their current benefits , and they might have to enroll in regular Medicare. But does this really fit the criteria of "forcing Americans off of their current health coverage and onto a government-run plan"? While private companies are contractors in the Medicare Advantage program — so it does have more of a free market element to it — at the end of the day, Medicare and Medicare Advantage are both government-run plans, where the government decides how much it will pay for a basic package of benefits. In refuting this argument, we are not trying to imply that no one will ever have to switch plans if health care reform passes. Indeed, we looked at President Obama's statement, "If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan ," and rated it Half True, because health care reform will change many aspects of health care regulation, and it seems likely that will prompt insurers, employers and consumers to re-evaluate their health care plans and make changes. Obama later made a more accurate statement, that if you "already have health insurance through your job, or Medicare, or Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have ." We rated that True. But we've also found nothing in the proposals so far that would force people off their current coverage into a government-run plan, if they prefer and can pay for private coverage. Boehner said that was "exactly what the Democrats' plan would do." So we rate Boehner's statement False.

pomt-14434	Donald Trump has "described Hillary Clinton as one of the best secretaries of state in history."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/mar/08/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-best-secreta/	Just before Ted Cruz won the Republican presidential primaries in Texas and Oklahoma plus the GOP caucuses in Alaska, the Texas senator hammered Donald Trump as ill-equipped to face Democrat Hillary Clinton on the November 2016 ballot. On the Feb. 28, 2016, edition of CNN’s State of the Union, Cruz confirmed he personally will support whoever lands his party’s presidential nomination, "period, the end." "But I will tell you this," Cruz said to host Jake Tapper. "Listen, I think, if we nominate Donald, Hillary probably beats him. Not only does she get to attack him on a whole host of issues where he agrees with her, but… he's described Hillary Clinton as... one of the best secretaries of state in history." Cruz leveled a similar claim during the Feb. 25, 2016, Republican presidential debate in Houston, saying: "And on substance, how do we nominate a candidate who has said Hillary Clinton was the best secretary of state of modern times…?" We wondered. Did Trump truly rate Clinton’s performance as secretary of state among the best ever? In response to our request for backup, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier emailed us a link to a Jan. 17, 2016, web post by The Daily Caller, a conservative news site, presenting video of Trump saying on camera: "And how did she do as secretary of state? Probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else." A portion of the same video earlier appeared in a January 2016 Cruz campaign video suggesting tight ties between Trump and Clinton. Web searches led us to the Trump clip, posted by someone on LiveLeak.com, a British video-sharing site, Dec. 8, 2015. Asked where the video originated, the same individual (with the screen name Exec) pointed us to video from an NBC News interview of Trump after the builder-developer gave an Iowa talk on politics in August 2013. NBC News headlined the interview by reporter Kasie Hunt: "Trump: Clinton will have to defend record as secretary of state." Our transcript of Trump talking to Hunt on Aug. 10 or 11, 2013, about Hillary Clinton and President Bill Clinton: "Well first of all, I know her very well and I know her husband very well and I like them both. And they are, uh, you know, just really terrific people. I like them both very much. "But I think you’ll be, you know, you’ll be looking at the record of Hillary Clinton. And how did she do as secretary of state? Probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else. You’ll be looking at her record and everybody else is, will be looking at her record. "I don’t know that Benghazi, it doesn’t seem to have resonated like perhaps it should have. But many other things have come up and the world is in turmoil. And I think that a lot of people will be looking at Hillary’s record as secretary of state and she will be defending that record. And I’m sure she’ll do a good job of defending it. But that will be the thing they will be going for." No doubt, Trump said: "And how did she do as secretary of state? Probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else." That’s not explicitly best-in-history, but could be bandied in that way. Then again, it occurred to us, that comment could be taken as having a different scope; that is, Trump saying only that anyone appraising Clinton would focus on her record as secretary of state. (We encourage you to watch for yourself.) Consider this change of punctuation: "And how did she do as secretary of state, probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else." Note too that Trump said next: "You’ll be looking at her record and everybody else is, will be looking at her record," a point he made several times in the interview. Trump praised Clinton in 2012-13 Web searches led us to other instances of Trump making positive comments about Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state, which ran from the start of Barack Obama’s presidency in 2009 through January 2013. From a Trump-Greta Van Susteren exchange on the March 28, 2012 episode of "On the Record," a Fox News program: VAN SUSTEREN: "Looking at the administration, how do you think the vice president has done? (Joe) Biden, although, being a vice-president is not a job that is very visible, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, I'm curious what you think about those two." TRUMP: "I think Biden has been a very loyal person, to be honest with you. I think he has been a good vice president for the agenda that they set and he has been a very, very loyal person. I respect him for that. "Hillary Clinton I think is a terrific woman. I am biased because I have known her for years. I live in New York. She lives in New York. I really like her and her husband both a lot. I think she really works hard. And I think, again, she's given an agenda, it is not all of her, but I think she really works hard and I think she does a good job. I like her." VAN SUSTEREN: "She says she's out at the end of this term. Do you think we will see her again running for office?" TRUMP: "I think so. Assuming she is healthy, I think she probably runs after the next four years, I would imagine." VAN SUSTEREN: "Do you support her?" TRUMP: "I don't want to get into this because I will get myself into trouble --" VAN SUSTEREN: "That's why I asked you." TRUMP: "I just like her. I like her husband. Her husband made a speech on Monday and was very well received. He is -- he is a really good guy, and she's a really good person and woman." Also, a July 2012 MSNBC news story noted Trump’s statement in an October 2013 interview with Larry King about Hillary and Bill Clinton: "I like them both very much." (See Trump’s "like" about the 15:46 mark of the King interview posted here.) So, Trump in 2012 and 2013 indicated he personally liked Clinton and in 2012, when Clinton was still the secretary, Trump said she "works hard and I think she does a good job." Trump in 2015 But, unnoted by Cruz, Trump has most recently been critical of Clinton's work, calling her one of the country’s worst secretaries of state. On July 8, 2015, he sent a statement to the Business Insider calling Clinton "the worst secretary of state in the history of the United States." The publication said Trump issued his statement after Clinton told CNN she was disappointed in Trump’s campaign-opening remarks about Mexican immigrants. In his June 14, 2015, kickoff, Trump said: "When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best. They’re not sending you. They’re not sending you. They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people." Our ruling Cruz said Trump has "described Hillary Clinton as one of the best secretaries of state in history." To the contrary, Trump last year called Clinton the worst secretary of state in history and we didn't find any instance of Trump calling Clinton one of the best ever. Still, Trump previously said he liked Clinton and even that she was doing a good job as secretary -- while, in the 2013 NBC News interview, he said: "And how did she do as secretary of state, probably above and beyond everybody else and everything else." We see ambiguity in this phrasing, which could be taken as high praise or, more logically, as a clumsy rehash of Trump’s repeatedly expressed prediction in the interview that Clinton’s record would be a target of scrutiny.

pomt-10422	Iran "might not be a superpower, but the threat the government of Iran poses is anything but 'tiny,'" as Obama says.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/21/john-mccain/mccain-twists-obamas-words/	In trying to portray Sen. Barack Obama as a neophyte when it comes to international relations, Sen. John McCain seized on some comparisons Obama made between the relative threat of Iran now vs. the Soviet Union during the Cold War. "Senator Obama claimed that the threat Iran poses to our security is 'tiny' compared to the threat once posed by the former Soviet Union," McCain said before the National Restaurant Association in Chicago on May 19, 2008. "Obviously, Iran isn't a superpower and doesn't possess the military power the Soviet Union had. But that does not mean that the threat posed by Iran is insignificant. "On the contrary, right now Iran provides some of the deadliest explosive devices used in Iraq to kill our soldiers. They are the chief sponsor of Shia extremists in Iraq, and terrorist organizations in the Middle East. ... Should Iran acquire nuclear weapons, that danger would become very dire, indeed. They might not be a superpower, but the threat the government of Iran poses is anything but 'tiny.' " The jab provides the backdrop for McCain's repeated criticism of Obama for saying that he would meet without preconditions with leaders of rogue nations, like Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. Here's the full context of Obama's remarks in Pendelton, Ore., on May 18, 2008: "Strong countries and strong presidents talk to their adversaries," Obama said. "That's what Kennedy did with Khrushchev. That's what Reagan did with Gorbachev. That's what Nixon did with Mao. I mean, think about it. Iran, Cuba, Venezuela, these countries are tiny compared to the Soviet Union. They don't pose a serious threat to us the way the Soviet Union posed a threat to us. And yet we were willing to talk to the Soviet Union at the time when they were saying we're going to wipe you off the planet. And ultimately that direct engagement led to a series of measures that helped prevent nuclear war, and over time allowed the kind of opening that brought down the Berlin Wall. Now, that has to be the kind of approach that we take. "You know, Iran, they spend one-one hundredth of what we spend on the military. If Iran ever tried to pose a serious threat to us, they wouldn't stand a chance. And we should use that position of strength that we have to be bold enough to go ahead and listen. That doesn't mean we agree with them on everything. We might not compromise on any issues, but at least we should find out other areas of potential common interest, and we can reduce some of the tensions that have caused us so many problems around the world." The first part of McCain's recap of Obama's quote puts the context accurately, that Obama noted the threat from Iran was tiny "compared to the threat once posed by the Soviet Union." But McCain veers off the rails when he takes the next step, claiming that Obama characterized the threat from Iran as tiny or insignificant. Obama never said that. Later in the same day, Obama issued a retort to McCain's comments: "So John McCain, he said, 'Oh, Obama doesn't understand the threat of Iran.' I understand the threat of Iran. But what I know is that the Soviet Union had the ability to destroy the world several times over, had satellites spanning the globe, had huge masses of conventional military power all directed at destroying us, and so I've made it clear for years that the threat from Iran is grave, but what I've said is that we should not just talk to our friends, we should be willing to engage our enemies as well, that's what diplomacy is all about. "So let me be absolutely clear: Iran is a grave threat. It has an illicit nuclear program, it supports terrorism across the region and militias in Iraq, it threatens Israel's existence, it denies the Holocaust. But this threat has grown, primarily – and this is the irony - the reason Iran is so much more powerful now than it was a few years ago is because of the Bush-McCain policy of fighting an endless war in Iraq and refusing to pursue direct diplomacy with Iran." This isn't the first time Obama has talked about the grave threat posed by Iran. Obama has repeatedly characterized it as such during his campaign. Still, Reginald Dale, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, Obama's comparisons of the threats posed by Iran versus the Soviet Union during the Cold War are misguided. "Iran is a completely different threat," Dale said. During the Cold War, both sides had stockpiles of nuclear weapons. There was mutually assured destruction. "They could negotiate like people who are equals," Dale said. "Neither side wanted to fire first. Both sides knew, more or less, how the other would behave." That provided some stability, he said. Iran, on the other hand, presents an "asymmetrical" warfare problem, he said. "It's not one super power facing another super power," Dale said. Iran is attempting to develop nuclear weapons, Dale said, while unapologetically supporting terrorist groups like Hamas, who would have little hesitation about setting off a nuclear weapon in the United States. "You could definitely say it's more dangerous than the Cold War," he said. One could argue whether it's wise to meet with leaders of rogue nations. One could also debate whether Obama wrongly downplayed the threat posed by Iran.

pomt-06390	Says that "we brought CHI Manufacturing, that had business in China, back to" Texas.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/oct/31/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-we-brought-chi-manufacturing-had-b/	After former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney revisited his vow to challenge China for manipulating its currency to advantage in foreign trade, Rick Perry said at the Oct. 11, 2011, Bloomberg/Washington Post Republican debate that one policy or another isn’t vital to getting more Americans back to work. Talking up domestic energy resources, the Texas governor also said the country needs a president committed to "pulling the regulations back, freeing this country to go develop the energy industry that we have in this country. I can promise you that we do that and we'll create an environment in this country where the manufacturing will come back to this country. We did it in Texas. We brought CHI Manufacturing, that had business in China, back to the state of Texas." Among online politicos, Perry’s comment touched off Twitter mentions of Farouk Shami, a Houston hair-care mogul who sought the state’s 2010 Democratic gubernatorial nomination. In his campaign, Shami said in a TV ad that he had just brought 1,200 jobs to Texas "by moving his factories here from China." Half True, we said at the time. Shami’s campaign told us that the jobs were created at a new Houston facility, CHI USA, in July 2009 as a result of moving production from South Korea, not China. Shami’s endeavors appear to be operating under the umbrella of Houston-based Farouk Systems, Inc. Shami’s campaign said at the time that a miscommunication over where the jobs were cut led to incorrect information in the ad, which was changed after our inquiry to say that jobs were only moved from South Korea. Then-Shami spokesman Vince Leibowitz said that some jobs had been created as a result of relocating production from China, but not the ones advertised as part of Shami's campaign. Also at the time, Elizabeth Yong, public relations manager for Houston-based Farouk Systems Group, said CHI USA produces "five to 10" of the company's five dozen hair care tools, including the original flat iron. Yong said bringing all production stateside would take two years, though "more than 1,000" jobs had already been shifted. In July 2010, the company said it hopes to shift 4,000 jobs to Texas by 2012, starting with the move of 1,000 jobs from South Korea and China. For this review, Perry’s campaign referred us to his state office, which reminded us that Perry attended a July 30, 2009, ribbon-cutting in Houston when Farouk Systems announced its plans to shift 1,200 jobs from South Korea and China to Houston. As the Austin American-Statesman noted in a Sept. 4, 2009, news article, Perry that day called Shami someone "who pretty much embodies the American dream." According to a video posted on the governor’s website, Perry also said: "Inspired by the freedoms we enjoy, he was drawn to this state where people are still free to achieve. He's built a life of significance and an organization that is respected around the world. His is the story of Texas." Thanking Shami for his "bold move," Perry said: "We are celebrating a leader who is moving jobs from another country ... to Texas." A press release issued by the governor’s office that day starts by saying that at the plant, Perry "credited Texas’ predictable regulatory climate, low taxes and skilled workforce with attracting jobs and companies from around the world." Shami isn’t shown speaking in the video. He’s also not quoted in the press release. News accounts do not mention any state role in Shami's decision to move jobs from abroad to Houston, nor is he quoted crediting a state action for prompting him to shift jobs from abroad. So why did Perry attend? "It was a major jobs announcement in the state of Texas," Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed told us by email. "He was invited." In describing the job moves, Shami has been quoted citing automation at the Houston plant as critical and his desire to get away from counterfeiting of his products in China, among other factors. An Aug. 2, 2009, news article in the Houston Business Journal says Shami decided to move the manufacturing of the CHI and other Farouk Systems products from overseas to Houston for safety and economic reasons. "Our employees are more efficient, and our quality control is superior," Shami said of U.S. workers. "Plus, I’m seeing more people in other countries wanting the American lifestyle and American products. They want to buy products made in the U.S.A." The story further says that while conducting the manufacturing here opposed to overseas would be more expensive, Shami said other benefits would make up for the increased costs. "We won’t have to fly products in, we won’t have to pay duties and we won’t have as many defects," Shami told the publication. "We may be sacrificing some of the profit, but the increase in volume will make up for that loss in profit." An Aug. 6, 2010, USA Today news article quotes Shami as saying his company had spent $500,000 a month battling foreign counterfeiters who put the company's trademark on copies of its products. "Counterfeiting is killing us," Shami said. "To remedy the problem and whittle inventory costs to $50 million from $120 million," the story continues, the company "moved some assembly of its irons and dryers from South Korea and China to a Houston factory that employs 1,000. Manufacturing costs in China are still about 30 percent lower. But (Shami) believes the appliances' ‘Made in the USA’ stamp will increase sales to hair salons." In a recent telephone interview, Farouk Systems spokeswoman Amy Johnson told us the Houston plant has 1,200 jobs with 300 additional jobs to be added soon. Johnson also told us that some limited-edition hair irons are still made in China. In earlier years, she said, 40 percent of the company’s products were made here, 60 percent overseas. Now, she said, the split is 80 percent here, 20 percent overseas. "We’re definitely happy to be a positive example," she said. We asked Johnson for details about how many jobs have shifted from China to Texas and how either the Texas economy or actions by Texas state government encouraged those moves. She replied that Shami wanted to talk to us, but we did not hear from him. Ironing all this out, it seems likely the manufacturer of the CHI hair iron moved some jobs from China to Texas. However, there’s no indication that qualities specific to the Texas economy or actions by state government merit credit for the shift. It could be, too, that most of the moved jobs came from South Korea. In any event, CHI still has products made in China. Ultimately, Perry’s statement overreaches by indicating the company deserted China and by claiming that anyone besides Shami "brought" the jobs from abroad. We rate Perry’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-09848	Preventive care does not save the government money.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/17/david-brooks/brooks-claims-preventive-care-will-cost-government/	The logic behind preventive care seems simple enough: stopping illnesses before they happen will mean fewer pricey procedures at the hospital and lower health care costs for all. Not so, says columnist David Brooks, who was interviewed on the Aug. 14, 2009, edition of the NewsHour with Jim Lehrer . He said President Barack Obama claims that "preventive care saves money," but the reality is "that's not true. ... If you're testing people, say, for an illness, you have to give 100 people a test to get five people — to find five people. Now, preventive care is good for health. Everyone agrees on that. But if you look at the CBO studies and the other research, it doesn't save you money. We should do it. But because you have to test so many people to get the few you're really going to prevent serious illness from, you're really not adding up to a lot of cost saving." Brooks was talking about a core principle of Obama's health care overhaul: That many costly procedures and treatments can be prevented by catching disease earlier or preventing it all together. Operating under that logic, the House health care bill expands access to procedures such as hypertension screening and vaccines. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer sang the praises of preventive care in an Aug. 10 USA Today op-ed. "Reform will also mean higher-quality care by promoting preventive care so health problems can be addressed before they become crises," they wrote. "This, too, will save money. We'll be a much healthier country if all patients can receive regular checkups and tests, such as mammograms and diabetes exams, without paying a dime out-of-pocket." Brooks's critique relied on new numbers from the Congressional Budget Office that indicate that preventive care isn't as cost-effective as Pelosi and Hoyer claim. "The evidence suggests that for most preventive services, expanded utilization leads to higher, not lower, medical spending overall," CBO director Douglas Elmendorf wrote in an Aug. 7 letter to Rep. Nathan Deal, the top Republican on a congressional subcommittee involved in the debate. Elmendorf explained that, while the cost of a simple test might be cheap for each individual, the cumulative cost of many tests could be quite expensive: "But when analyzing the effects of preventive care on total spending for health care, it is important to recognize that doctors do not know beforehand which patients are going to develop costly illnesses. To avert one case of acute illness, it is usually necessary to provide preventive care to many patients, most of whom would not have suffered that illness anyway. ... Preventive care can have the largest benefits relative to costs when it is targeted at people who are most likely to suffer from a particular medical problem; however, such targeting can be difficult because preventive services are generally provided to patients who have the potential to contract a given disease but have not yet shown symptoms of having it." In fact, a new government policy to encourage prevention could end up paying for services that people are already receiving, including breast and colon cancer screenings and vaccines, Elmendorf went on. The CBO did not put a price tag on the costs or savings associated with preventive care measures in the House bills because budgeting rules prevent them from doing so. But a few other studies back up the CBO's analysis, including a Feb. 14, 2008, article in the New England Journal of Medicine that was written in response to campaign promises for more preventive care. "Sweeping statements about the cost-saving potential of prevention ... are overreaching," according to the paper. "Studies have concluded that preventing illness can in some cases save money but in other cases can add to health care costs." And a study conducted by researchers from the American Diabetes Association, American Heart Association and the American Cancer Society concluded that, while interventions to prevent cardiovascular disease would prevent many strokes and deaths, "as they are currently delivered, most of the prevention activities will substantially increase costs." So, the consensus is that, while preventive care will almost certainly save lives, it's a stretch to say that it will save government spending on health care. As a result, we give Brooks a True.

pomt-10407	John McCain "has not led on nonproliferation issues when he had the chance in the Senate."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/02/barack-obama/present-for-votes-but-not-a-player/	Nuclear proliferation is one of those arcane-but-important issues that tends to get pushed into the shadows during presidential campaigns. But as Sen. John McCain tries to distance himself from Bush administration policies, he's using the topic to help make his case. In a May 27, 2008, speech in Denver, McCain endorsed seeking a new disarmament treaty with Russia and said he was open to re-evaluating the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty on underground nuclear tests that he voted against in 1999. Additionally, McCain called for eliminating the "bunker buster" that President Bush supports. Experts say the positions put McCain in a more centrist camp than Bush on the question of how to reduce the threat of nuclear weapons. They may also reflect a desire by McCain to steal some of his Democratic rival's thunder. Sen. Barack Obama has made nonproliferation something of a specialty during his 3 years in the Senate, partly by virtue of his seat on the Foreign Relations Committee. Responding to McCain's speech, Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton charged the veteran Arizona senator was playing catch-up, and asserted that Obama has been the more prominent player on nonproliferation during his brief tenure in the chamber. "By embracing many aspects of Barack Obama's nonproliferation agenda today, John McCain highlighted Obama's leadership on nuclear weapons throughout this campaign, and his bipartisan work with Richard Lugar in the Senate. No speech by John McCain can change the fact that he has not led on nonproliferation issues when he had the chance in the Senate," Burton said. He's got it right. Obama last year teamed with Nebraska Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel to write a nuclear nonproliferation bill that, among other things, called for disarmament talks with Russia and for ratifying a global ban on nuclear testing, and strengthened efforts to halt the transfer of weapons and fissile material. Portions of the bill dealing with terrorist threats were incorporated into a fiscal 2008 Foreign Operations spending bill enacted into law. Obama also collaborated with Sen. Richard G. Lugar, R-Ind., on enacting a 2007 law allowing the United States to export nuclear fuel, technology and reactors to India for peaceful purposes for the first time in three decades. President Bush praised it for increasing the transparency of India's civilian nuclear program. McCain certainly has been a key player on many thorny and controversial issues during his long Senate career, among them campaign finance reform, tobacco regulation and national security by virtue of his seat on the Senate Armed Services Committee. But a look at his record on nonproliferation shows he mostly showed up for key votes but didn't influence debates. During a 2004 debate on a fiscal 2005 defense authorization bill, McCain endorsed the continuation of the nuclear bunker buster by voting against a Democratic amendment that would have eliminated money for studying the weapon and for research efforts into low-yield nuclear weapons. The amendment was rejected 42-55. As he noted in the Denver speech, McCain in 1999 voted with a majority of Republicans against the Test Ban Treaty, a pact that garnered attention after nuclear tests in India and Pakistan increased tension between the countries. Conservatives at the time questioned how the ban would affect the long-term prospects of the U.S. nuclear arsenal, and thought then-President Bill Clinton's desire to set an example to the global community by ratifying the treaty was misguided. The pact – which the Senate rejected, 48-51 – also required the approval of the 44 nations with nuclear capability; at the time of vote, only 26 had approved it. In 1997, McCain was among 29 of 55 Republicans who joined with 45 Democrats to ratify the 1993 Chemical Weapons Convention, which banned the development, production, sale, use or stockpiling of chemical weapons. And in 1992, he voted with the majority of the Senate in a 93-6 tally to ratify the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, which provided for reduction of about one-third in the arsenals of long-range missiles and bombers of the United States and former Soviet Union. "The majority of people following the issue would point out McCain has not taken a leadership role on nonproliferation during his career in the Senate," said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Washington-based Arms Control Association. In spite of McCain's moves to the center, and his more fleshed-out positions on nonproliferation, we don't find much in McCain's Senate record to refute the charge of the Obama camp. We say, True.

pomt-12385	"You can collude all you want with a foreign government in an election. There's no such statute" (that makes collusion a crime).	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/31/gregg-jarrett/fox-news-hosts-wrong-no-law-forbids-russia-trump-c/	Fox News host Gregg Jarrett has a distinctive take on the investigation into possible links between Russia and the Trump campaign. Jarrett, a former defense attorney, said that even if the two worked together, it wasn’t illegal. "Collusion is not a crime, only an antitrust law," he said on May 30. "You can collude all you want with a foreign government in an election. There's no such statute." Jarrett made the same point in an article on the Fox News website. He wrote that special counsel Robert Mueller had been given the "futile" task of investigating a crime that doesn’t exist. "As special counsel, Mueller can engage in all manner of spectacular jurisprudential gymnastics," Jarrett wrote. "However, it will not change the fact that colluding with Russia is not, under America’s criminal codes, a crime." Really? We thought we’d look into the legal landscape. We wanted to know what election law does or doesn’t say; this is a separate question from what did or did not occur. By way of brief recap, the U.S. Justice Department appointed Mueller to investigate Russian interference with the 2016 presidential election. His first task was to explore "any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump." Jarrett said the only real trouble for the Trump campaign would be if it committed some other crime, such as helping the Russians hack into Democratic emails. He dismissed that as implausible and unsupported by any public evidence. We ran Jarrett’s argument by three election law professors, and they all said that while the word "collusion" might not appear in key statutes (they couldn’t say for sure that it was totally absent), working with the Russians could violate criminal laws. Nathaniel Persily at Stanford University Law School said one relevant statute is the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. "A foreign national spending money to influence a federal election can be a crime," Persily said. "And if a U.S. citizen coordinates, conspires or assists in that spending, then it could be a crime." Persily pointed to a 2011 U.S. District Court ruling based on the 2002 law. The judges said that the law bans foreign nationals "from making expenditures to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a political candidate." Another election law specialist, John Coates at Harvard University Law School, said if Russians aimed to shape the outcome of the presidential election, that would meet the definition of an expenditure. "The related funds could also be viewed as an illegal contribution to any candidate who coordinates (colludes) with the foreign speaker," Coates said. To be sure, no one is saying that coordination took place. What’s in doubt is whether the word "collusion" is as pivotal as Jarrett makes it out to be. Coates said discussions between a campaign and a foreigner could violate the law against fraud. "Under that statute, it is a federal crime to conspire with anyone, including a foreign government, to ‘deprive another of the intangible right of honest services,’ " Coates said. "That would include fixing a fraudulent election, in my view, within the plain meaning of the statute." Josh Douglas at the University of Kentucky Law School offered two other possible relevant statutes. "Collusion in a federal election with a foreign entity could potentially fall under other crimes, such as against public corruption," Douglas said. "There's also a general anti-coercion federal election law." In sum, legal experts mentioned four criminal laws that might have been broken. The key is not whether those statutes use the word collusion, but whether the activities of the Russians and Trump associates went beyond permissible acts. Our ruling Jarrett said that "you can collude all you want with a foreign government in an election," because there’s no law that says collusion is a crime. Three prominent election law scholars said there are at least four laws that would prohibit the sort of activities under investigation, whether those laws mention collusion or not. Jarrett’s focus on a single word fails to reflect the reach of the criminal code. We rate this claim False.

pomt-13042	There was "serious voter fraud" in California.	pants on fire!	/california/statements/2016/nov/28/donald-trump/pants-fire-trumps-claim-about-california-voter-fra/	Grabbing the attention of the Golden State, President-Elect Donald Trump claimed in a recent tweet there was "serious voter fraud" in three states won by Hillary Clinton during the General Election, including California. Here’s his tweet: Trump made this claim on Sunday during a flood of tweets about voter fraud. The president-elect also said he would have won the popular vote if not for "the millions of people who voted illegally." PolitiFact national examined that claim and rated it Pants on Fire. We decided to fact-check Trump’s eye-opening claim about "serious voter fraud" in California. Our research Trump offered no evidence about California voter fraud in his series of tweets. On Monday, Trump spokesman Jason Miller cited a national study done by the Pew Research Center showing that approximately 24 million voter registrations in the United States are no longer valid or inaccurate. However, no one from Trump’s office has shown evidence of "serious voter fraud" in California. Trump may be drawing on an unsupported claim that 3 million "illegal aliens" cast votes in this year’s election. That allegation was made on Twitter by Gregg Phillips, who has worked for the Republican Party and has a voter fraud reporting app. PolitiFact reported that Phillips has not released any corroborating evidence and noted that public information undermines his statement. It rated his claim False. On Nov. 8 in California, there were reports of election glitches, such as the wrong names being placed on some absentee ballots and long lines at some polling places. But state and local election officials, along with independent observers, say there have been no reports of widespread voter fraud in the state. "His allegations are completely unfounded," California Secretary of State Alex Padilla said in an interview. "I think it’s a big disservice to our country and to our democracy to continue to raise these doubts. If anything, a message back to Mr. Trump is, if you have proof, if you have evidence, please bring it forward. Procedures are in place to investigate any real voter fraud. But as the evidence has shown, the cases of voter fraud across the country are statistically minimal if you go back decades." Padilla’s office could not immediately say how many voter fraud complaints it’s received for this and past general elections. Hillary Clinton held a 3.9 million vote lead over Trump as of Nov. 28, a margin that’s grown substantially as California continues to count the state’s many absentee ballots. 'Broad brush allegations' Dean Logan, president of the California Association of Clerks and Election Officials and the top elections official in Los Angeles County, said in a statement responding to Trump’s tweets, that the state has "a history of accurate and accountable elections." Logan described Trump’s voter fraud claims as "broad brush allegations." Logan added in an email to PolitiFact California that: "Quantifying complaints or allegations of voter fraud is not a specific data set that we track. That alone probably gives you a sense of the frequency, but there is no indication that the rate of concern on this issue was higher in this election cycle than in any other." He added that there are legal avenues for challenging a voter’s eligibility. But none were used before or after the election, he said. "And I think that sort of goes to the point that there’s nothing to back up those allegations," Logan said. Sacramento County’s Assistant Registrar of Voters Alice Jarboe said of the more than 530,000 county voters that turned out on Election Day, none has made a complaint about voter fraud. Jarboe, who’s worked at the department for 18 years, said no complaints are "the norm" for elections in her county. "I’ve never seen anything (related to voter fraud) that would affect the outcome of an election -- ever," she added. Kim Alexander, president of the California Voter Foundation, a nonprofit voter advocacy group, said she’s not seen evidence of serious voter fraud. "No system is perfect -- people do make mistakes," Alexander said. She added, however, that California’s voter verification laws are among the most robust in the country. Each county, she noted, is automatically required to perform a recount a fraction of its ballots by hand. The state also prohibits paperless electronic voting, a type of voting that makes audits nearly impossible, she said. Trump’s unsupported claim about voter fraud in California may also draw on misinformation about two recent state laws: AB 60, which allows undocumented immigrants to obtain state driver’s licenses; and the New Motor Voter Act, which by mid-2017 will automatically register citizens to vote when they obtain or renew a driver’s license. The automatic registration only applies to citizens who are already eligible to vote, not to undocumented immigrants. Padilla, California’s secretary of state, has said the new system would require potential voters to show identification such as a birth certificate or passport to reflect their citizenship before they are registered. California voters, in most cases, are not required to show identification at their polling places. Our ruling Donald Trump claimed "serious voter fraud" took place on Election Day in California. He offered no evidence backing up his statement and his press team did not respond specifically to a request about fraud in the state. Elections officials and nonpartisan observers in California said there were no widespread reports of voter fraud. The state has some of the most stringent voter verification laws in the country. Allegations of fraud are so rare that Los Angeles County, the state’s largest county, does not track them. PolitiFact New Hampshire examined Trump’s claim that the Granite State also experienced "serious voter fraud." It described Trump’s statement as "reckless claim with zero evidence," and rated it Pants On Fire after finding there were "no complaints of voter fraud filed in an election in which more than 728,000 ballots were cast." Trump’s claim about California voter fraud is equally reckless and without substantiation. We rate it Pants on Fire. PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

pomt-13316	"Repeated requests for additional security in Benghazi were routinely denied" by Hillary "Clinton’s State Department."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/oct/07/paul-ryan/state-department-under-hillary-clinton-refused-sec/	The Sept. 11, 2012 attacks in Benghazi, Libya, which killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, have spurred numerous Republican allegations against Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. GOP nominee Donald Trump went so far as to say the Benghazi victims were "left helpless to die" as Clinton, then the secretary of state, "soundly slept in her bed." That earned a False from PolitiFact National. Congressional investigations did not find Clinton was inattentive, much less asleep. Rather, she worked into the night after the attacks occurred. Several days after that fact check was published, the sister of Christopher Stephens, the slain ambassador, said she did not blame Clinton. But Patricia Smith, the mother of one of the other victims, has blamed Clinton. And Clinton, in part because of her "What difference does it make?" remark on the attacks, continues to be a target. House Speaker Paul Ryan tweeted this on Sept. 26, 2016, a couple of weeks after the fourth anniversary of the attacks: "Repeated requests for additional security in #Benghazi were routinely denied by Secretary Clinton's State Dept." In contrast to Trump, the Wisconsin Republican didn’t go quite as personal -- referring to Clinton’s State Department, rather than Clinton herself. That helps his claim. Prior fact check In May 2014, ahead of one of the congressional investigations into the Benghazi attacks, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., claimed the State Department "not only failed to honor repeated requests for additional security, but instead actually reduced security in Libya." Our rating was True. As we noted in that article: "There are disagreements about whether State acted reasonably, but that it didn't honor requests for additional security is established fact," said Georgetown University adjunct assistant professor Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, who is also a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, which focuses on foreign policy and national security. The State Department has acknowledged it rejected requests to provide more security personnel in Libya. It also acknowledged rejecting a request to erect guard towers at the Benghazi mission, but notes that a number of physical security upgrades, such as the installation of concrete barriers to block unused gates, were made during 2012. The State Department’s own Accountability Review Board concluded that the number of diplomatic security staff in Benghazi in the months leading up to the attacks was inadequate "despite repeated requests" from the Benghazi mission and the embassy in Tripoli for additional staffing. In addition, PolitiFact National has reported that the numerous requests from officials on the ground in Libya for better security for the Benghazi compound are undeniable and well-documented. It’s worth noting, though, that our colleagues have also pointed out there is no evidence that Clinton herself was aware of the requests, or that she willfully denied them. Our rating Ryan said: "Repeated requests for additional security in Benghazi were routinely denied" by Hillary "Clinton's State Department." Ryan’s claim avoids trouble by focusing on the State Department, then led by Clinton, rather than on Clinton herself. It’s well documented that the department didn’t honor requests for more security prior to the 2012 attacks that killed four Americans.

Gates and his wife, Melinda, have invested billions of dollars to research, develop and deliver vaccines around the world to help reduce child mortality. "Bill Gates’ former doctor says billionaire ‘refused to vaccinate his children,’" said the headline on a Feb. 7 post on yournewswire.com. Yournewswire.com’s story does not identify the purported doctor and says the information was divulged privately at a "medical symposium in Seattle," without naming the symposium or a date. The story claimed "the comments caused a stir among physicians at the symposium with claims he was breaking doctor-patient confidentiality, according to reports. However as he was speaking to other physicians, he was not breaking the industry code of conduct." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. (Check out all yournewswire.com’s posts debunked by PunditFact.) Yournewswire.com’s post includes information from a December 2015 CNN report about unvaccinated children in California. But it offers no evidence to support the claim about Gates’ children and their vaccination records. In their 2018 annual letter, the Gateses said they’ve "spent $15.3 billion on vaccines over the past 18 years. And it’s been a terrific investment." (The Gates children are 15, 18 and 22 years old.) Melinda Gates in a Feb. 22 Instagram post wrote: "When my first child, Jenn, was born, over 800,000 children were dying each year of rotavirus — a preventable, curable disease. It broke my heart to imagine watching your child get sick and knowing that medicine could save her — if only you had access to it. That was a clarifying moment for me. No child should die a preventable death. Bill and I have dedicated our lives to reducing the number who do."

pomt-12836	"ISIS is already using the rhetoric from the Trump administration, the text of this executive order, to incite attacks against us and to recruit more terrorists to their side."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/07/seth-moulton/mostly-false-claim-isis-already-using-trumps-execu/	A Democratic congressman called out President Donald Trump’s travel ban from seven majority-Muslim countries as counterproductive in the fight against terrorism. ISIS has already used the executive order in its recruitment propaganda, said Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass. In a Jan. 31 CNN interview, Moulton disagreed with Trump’s misleading comparison of his executive order to actions taken by President Barack Obama’s administration on Iraqi refugees in 2011. "Improvements to the vetting process are something that you'll find bipartisan support for here in Congress. What Trump has done in contrast is just put this blanket ban that will be used against us and our troops," said Moulton, who served four tours of duty in Iraq as a Marine Corps infantry officer. "In fact, ISIS is already using the rhetoric from the Trump administration, the text of this executive order, to incite attacks against us and to recruit more terrorists to their side." We previously confirmed that Trump was featured in terrorist propaganda videos for comments during the presidential campaign. But is the text of his executive order now being circulated to incite attacks against the United States and for terrorist recruitment? Experts said there have not been official releases from major terrorist groups, though their supporters are talking about it on social media. Trump’s executive order About a week into his presidency, Trump signed an executive order banning immigrants and nonimmigrants from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia and Yemen from entering the United States for 90 days. The order also banned refugees for 120 days, and Syrian refugees indefinitely. The order was quickly challenged in courts and as of early Feb. 7, there was a temporary restraining order on Trump’s mandate ruled by a federal judge in Washington. The issue is now before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. We had not seen reports of ISIS using the ban for recruitment during that week, so we asked Moulton’s office for support for his claim. They directed us to a Jan. 29 Washington Post article headlined, "Jihadist groups hail Trump’s travel ban as a victory." A comment on a pro-Islamic State channel on a social media platform, Telegram, compared Trump’s executive order to the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, "which Islamic militant leaders at the time hailed as a ‘blessed invasion’ that ignited anti-Western fervor across the Islamic world," the Washington Post reported. Other comments described Trump's order as one that would convince American Muslims to align with extremists, the article said. It also includes comments by Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, on the Jan. 29 edition of CBS’ Face the Nation: "The effect will probably in some areas give ISIS some more propaganda." McCain and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R.-S.C., released a similar, forward-looking statement that said: "Ultimately, we fear this executive order will become a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism ... Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred. This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country. That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security." Moulton’s team referred us to tweets by Rita Katz, director of SITE Intelligence Group, a group monitoring jihadist websites. Katz’s tweets posted Feb. 3, a few days after Moulton’s comment, said: "First official #AQ response to #Trump presidency calls him"foolish" says "the flame of Jihad has been ignited & reached the East & West" "2) #AQ on #Trump's vow to "eradicate radical Islamic terrorism": "not directed only to the mujahideen...but also to the Muslims in general" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Katz told PolitiFact her Feb. 3 tweets were about a statement by al-Qaida, not ISIS, and that the statement she was referring to only mentioned a botched Yemen raid and Trump’s vow to "eradicate radical Islamic terrorism," not the ban specifically. "At the official level, there have been no direct mentions of the travel ban by ISIS, al-Qaida, or any other major jihadi terrorist organization," Katz said. "Even the sixth issue of ISIS’ monthly Rumiyah magazine, which was released this past Saturday, did not mention it." Katz said silence from such groups is "absolutely noteworthy, and goes against the conventional jihadi propaganda practice to exploit any event—especially high-profile ones like that of the travel ban—by which Muslims are affected." Terrorist groups' supporters, mainly al-Qaida supporters, have discussed the travel ban citing deceased al-Qaida recruiter Anwar al-Awlaki’s statement that the United States will "turn against its Muslim citizens," Katz said. She tweeted about that Jan. 29. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Pro-ISIS social media channels are largely posting links to articles with very little commentary, Katz added. Moulton’s office also linked us to a tweet from @theosint, identified on its Twitter bio as a contributor to open source and social media investigation group Bellingcat. The tweet, posted Jan. 28, reads: "ISIS doesn't even share its own propaganda anymore. It just shares CNN and NYTimes articles about the @POTUS muslim ban on Telegram." See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Rukmini Callimachi, a New York Times correspondent who reports on ISIS and al-Qaida, asked @theosint to name what channel was sharing New York Times stories, because she had not seeing that happen. @theosint replied to her clarifying that the New York Times article wasn't specifically about the ban. On Jan. 30 Reuters reported that an Islamic State supporter in response to Trump’s order posted on Telegram: "Your decision will do nothing. Attacks will come at you from inside America, from Americans born in America with American parents and grandparents." Several channels on Telegram and on which Islamist militants posted about Trump’s order have been taken down, Reuters noted. Still, some experts are cautious about reading sympathizers’ support as official communication. Terrorist organizations are emboldened by statements or actions from elected officials, "but not always in as visible or simple a way as is often implied," said Charlie Winter, a senior research fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence, based in London. "I am in no doubt that Trump's executive order will make the lives of ISIS and its like-minded rivals easier, but I would be wary of drawing too linear a link. So far at least, ISIS has made no official pronouncement on the policy, nor has (al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula)," Winter said via email Feb. 6. "That said, supporters of the former have expressed that Trump is something of a ‘useful idiot’ to their group and official propagandists for the latter have written extensively about why Trump bolsters the salafi-jihadist worldview." Terrorist groups like ISIS use Trump’s "anti-Islam rhetoric to say that the U.S. is waging war on Islam," said William C. Banks, director of the Institute for National Security and Counterterrorism at Syracuse University College of Law. However, Banks said he was not aware of specific incitements or attacks based on Trump’s executive order. A New York magazine profile story on Callimachi, the New York Times correspondent focused on ISIS and al-Qaida, also notes that ISIS still had not made an official statement, though militants applauded the order. The New York piece published online Feb. 5. J.M. Berger, a fellow at International Centre for Counter Terrorism at The Hague, said that while he hasn’t been tracking Islamic State activity daily since Trump’s inauguration, claims like Moulton’s "often get out ahead of the actuality." But he agrees with concerns that Trump’s order may endanger America. "There are several levels at which the travel ban makes things worse. It furthers the jihadist narrative that America is broadly at war with Islam. It also creates new tensions with countries we should be cooperating with," Berger said. Our ruling Moulton said, "ISIS is already using the rhetoric from the Trump administration, the text of this executive order, to incite attacks against us and to recruit more terrorists to their side." Experts we communicated with said they believe the order plays into terrorist groups’ message that the United States is at war with Islam. Terrorist groups' sympathizers have discussed the ban on social media channels. However, experts said that neither ISIS or other major groups had made official announcements on Trump’s policy.

pomt-03192	"We are about halfway" to the president’s goal to cut greenhouse gas emissions and "about half of that is because of the substitution of natural gas for coal in the power sector."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/30/ernest-moniz/energy-secretary-moniz-says-us-halfway-greenhouse-/	When President Barack Obama took office in 2009, he set a goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent by 2020 if all other major economies pledged to limit their emissions, too. Improvements would be tallied against how much of those gases the United States put into the atmosphere in 2005, the year the global climate change treaty known as the Kyoto Protocol was supposed to take effect. The White House would have liked it if Congress had passed a cap-and-trade bill that in theory would create strong market pressures to reduce the release of carbon into the air. That never happened, but two major changes gave the president a shot at making serious headway toward his target. Energy consumption cratered when the economy collapsed and, as you would expect, lower energy use means lower emissions. On the more positive side of the ledger, the surge in natural gas production also helped the country move toward Obama’s goal, although not without concern over environmental side effects. In a question-and-answer session on climate change at Columbia University on Aug. 26, 2013, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz highlighted the impact of natural gas on emissions. "In these last years, the natural gas revolution, shall we say, has been a major contributor to reducing carbon emissions," Moniz said. "The president has a goal, as I mentioned, of 17 percent by 2020. We are about halfway there, and about half of that is because of the substitution of natural gas for coal in the power sector, essentially driven by market forces." We pay attention to the president’s promises and track how well he delivers the goods on the Obameter. But we also thought it would be worth digging into Moniz’s claim. Department of Energy’s focus on carbon dioxide The Energy Department, predictably, looks at the way energy use contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and in particular, it tracks the dominant greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. The department’s Energy Information Administration recently published the numbers for 2012, and the details surprised many people. The update reported that energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2012 were the lowest since 1994. Compared to 2005, those emissions had fallen by 11.8 percent. That is much more than halfway toward the president’s goal of 17 percent. The update also said the biggest drop was due to the declining use of coal to produce electricity. "Low natural gas prices led to competition between natural gas — and coal-fired electric power generators," the authors wrote. "Lower natural gas prices resulted in reduced levels of coal generation, and increased natural gas generation." And to produce the same amount of energy, natural gas puts less carbon dioxide into the air than coal does. The most detailed data is only as recent as 2011, but the shift from coal to natural gas is clear. In terms of power generation, between 2005 and 2011, use of coal fell from 50 percent to 42 percent while the use of natural gas rose from 19 percent to 25 percent. This isn't bulletproof evidence of causation, but it strongly suggests that the switch from coal to natural gas has played a role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Greenhouse gases — more than carbon dioxide If the only molecule to worry about were carbon dioxide, Moniz would have been totally right, but many compounds contribute to climate change. Obama pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent, not just carbon dioxide. The Environmental Protection Agency’s latest report looks at all the relevant gases, some of which are thousands of times more potent in their climate change impact than carbon dioxide. The EPA’s tally also includes activities other than energy production that put gases into the atmosphere. The agency’s figures show that from 2005 to 2011, emissions fell by 7 percent. Measured against the goal of 17 percent, the country has more than halfway to go. It’s roughly at the 40 percent mark. It is possible that when the 2012 numbers are in, the rate of progress will have shot up. The Department of Energy reported a relatively dramatic decline in the release of carbon dioxide in 2012. The EPA’s next report is planned for April 2014. We should note that a separate report from Moniz’s agency gives cause for concern. The Energy Information Administration projects that energy-related carbon dioxide emissions will start to creep up in 2018. By 2020, analysts predict they will show only a 9 percent reduction from 2005 levels. Our ruling Moniz said the country is "about halfway" toward the president’s goal of a 17 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 2005 levels. In terms of carbon dioxide, Moniz is correct, but when looking at all greenhouse gases, data from the EPA suggests the country has a little more progress to make. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-09385	"Marco Rubio thinks that government shouldn't be in the health care business at all."	false	/florida/statements/2010/mar/26/kendrick-meek/meek-accuses-rubio-wanting-government-out-health-c/	The day before the U.S. House of Representatives approved the health care reform bill, Democratic U.S. Rep. Kendrick Meek, who is running for the U.S. Senate, fired off this accusation about the Republican frontrunner: "Marco Rubio thinks that government shouldn't be in the health care business at all." Meek made that statement on his campaign Web site March 20, 2010 -- the day before the historic vote. Here is the full quote: Rubio's "ideas on health care could jeopardize Medicare and veterans' care, programs which cover more than 5 million Floridians. Marco Rubio thinks that government shouldn't be in the health care business at all. That means these programs could be shut down. Moreover, his obstruction of the current health care bill means we could lose our best chance ever to prevent insurance companies from denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions and to close the Medicare prescription drug coverage 'donut hole.' That's what he stands for. If he were in the Senate he would lead the charge to scrap health care reform. If elected, he has sworn to do everything he can to repeal it." Meek has leveled a sweeping claim that Rubio thinks government should get out of the health care business entirely -- in a state where millions of voters depend on government health care such as Medicare and veterans programs. We know that Rubio is against the Democratic-led health care reform plan that the House approved March 21, but is it fair to say he wants government out of health care entirely? Meek's e-mail cites two sources: an article "Scrap Obamacare Today" written by Rubio on March 15, in Human Events, a conservative publication, and a blog item in The Buzz, a St. Petersburg Times politics blog. Both quote Rubio criticizing the health care proposal. "The President’s health care proposal is a deeply flawed plan that should be scrapped entirely in favor of a truly bipartisan approach that pursues step-by-step reforms,'' Rubio wrote in Human Events March 15. Meek's campaign also cited a March 3 press release from Rubio in which he spoke against "government-run health care." "Unfortunately, my opponent [Charlie Crist] disagrees and has said he would not scrap this bill and process. It underscores why, fundamentally, this campaign is about trust. It’s about who Floridians can trust to go to Washington to unapologetically stand on principle against ideas like the stimulus, cap-and-trade and government-run health care," Rubio said in the press release. The Meek campaign's logic is that Rubio's use of "government-run health care" in that paragraph has a broader meaning that indicates he's not just against the Obama reform plan, he's against all government health programs. Meek's campaign also cited Rubio's vote in the Florida House of Representatives April 6, 2006, against a Democratic amendment to an appropriations bill that reduced contract services by $5 million and included funding for a dental program for veterans. The Meek campaign also cited three Rubio votes on the Cover Florida state health care initiative requiring coverage for prenatal care and prostate screening and mammograms. All three amendments, introduced by Democrat Dan Gelber, ultimately failed and Rubio voted against them. Rubio voted in favor of the overall bill. But we find those citations are flimsy evidence for a big, sweeping claim that could alarm Florida voters, particularly senior citizens. In our view it's clear that "government-run health care" was referring to the Obama plan and it doesn't prove that Rubio is against programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Rubio's campaign also provided us with some evidence that he does believe government has a role in health care: * Rubio wrote an op-ed in the Orlando Sentinel Dec. 3, 2009, about the proposed health care bill that indicated he was concerned about cuts in Medicare: "The bill also would expand a financially unsustainable Medicaid entitlement program that is already straining state budgets. And it would fundamentally hurt Medicare by taking away access to Medicare Advantage plans and installing a new government bureaucracy to oversee Medicare reimbursements." * In 2000, Rubio was part of a unanimous vote in favor of hearing screening for newborns and a unanimous vote related to expanding Kidcare, a health program for poor children. In 2004, Rubio voted in favor of changes to Kidcare. He also voted for changes to the Kidcare program in 2004 fought by Democrats because of changes to eligibility requirements. Our own search turned up a few other examples that showed that Rubio has supported certain health care programs or proposals. In a Feb. 19 interview on Morning Joe, Rubio said Medicare "needs to be reformed," but did not provide details. Rubio supported expanding Florida's controversial Medicaid reform, which was initiated by former Gov. Jeb Bush in an effort to allow private companies to compete to provide serves for the poor, with the hope that it would slow growth in costs. Rubio was quoted in a March 6, 2008, Miami Herald article about the rising costs of Medicaid and the need to save it: "Florida simply cannot afford to continue doing business like we are currently. In order to save the Medicaid system, continuing reform is vital. Expanding Medicaid Reform into Miami-Dade County is an important step in creating a system that can survive and is a step that we should enact this session." In addition, Rubio supported a budget in 2008 that included an estimated $15.7 billion for Medicaid from federal and state sources, according to Florida's Medicaid expenditure estimating conference. Here is a list that shows Medicaid expenditures over several sessions when Rubio was in the House. Someone who believed government "shouldn't be in the health care business at all" wouldn't be supporting Medicaid. Another piece of evidence: A budget list compiled by the governor's office shows Rubio supported money for Jackson Memorial Hospital, a public hospital. "The budget list also links Rubio to a $20 million special line item for Jackson Memorial Hospital in 2008. Months later, Rubio established a consulting firm with a former aide and scored an $8,000 monthly consulting contract with the hospital,'' the Miami Herald wrote in a March 10 article. The Meek campaign has failed to prove its claim. Rubio clearly has spoken against the federal health care bill, which he has repeatedly referred to as a "government takeover" of health care (a characterization we've repeatedly rated Pants on Fire). But Rubio's votes and his comments indicate he has supported government health programs such as Medicaid. Lambasting a health care reform bill isn't the same as declaring that "government shouldn't be in the health care business at all." We rate Meek's claim False.

pomt-14064	A three-cents-per-ounce soda tax in Philadelphia "would result in the loss of 2,000 family-sustaining Teamster Union jobs and countless other jobs in the beverage industry."	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/may/20/daniel-grace/teamsters-say-soda-tax-would-cost-thousands-jobs-d/	Most of organized labor -- nearly all -- is just fine with Jim Kenney’s proposed sugary drinks tax. But the Teamsters have a big problem with it. They’re arguing they’ll lose jobs. Opponents to the tax argue higher prices will lead to decreased sales that will eventually trickle down and cause the soda bottling and delivery industry in Philadelphia to collapse. In fact, the loudest voice against the tax (outside lobbyists for the nation’s largest beverage companies) come from the Teamsters. Literally: They organized a ring of 18-wheelers that circled City Hall, horns blaring, to protest the measure. The first-year mayor wants to tax sugary drinks at three cents per ounce -- an unprecedented tax in America -- and use the revenue to fund pre-K, community schools and the city’s ailing pension fund. In a statement, Teamsters Local 830 secretary Daniel Grace wrote that the implementation of a three-cents-per-ounce sugary drinks tax "would result in the loss of 2,000 family-sustaining Teamster Union jobs and countless other jobs in the beverage industry." But there are about 2,000 people working in the beverage industry in Philadelphia in total. So we decided to look a little deeper into this claim. The American Beverage Association has claimed a soda tax in Philadelphia would result in job loss, but didn’t offer an estimate to PolitiFact and referred us to a local firm handling communications for those opposed to the tax. That firm also didn’t have an estimate on job loss and referred us to Grace, the Teamsters head in Philadelphia who didn’t respond to requests for more information. Instead, his spokesman Frank Keel emailed: "The Kenney administration has no idea about the Teamsters’ various roles in the beverage industry and no right to question the very real job losses we'll suffer if this regressive three-cents-an-ounce sugary drinks tax is passed into law." He again reiterated that "we stand to lose as many as 2,000 regional jobs in the beverage industry." Keel didn’t clarify what was meant by "regional," other than to say "there are several Teamsters locals in the Philadelphia regional jurisdiction." The Kenney administration disputes the figures as a "doomsday scenario" and said any job loss suffered due to the implementation of a soda tax will be offset by jobs created by the programming the tax would fund. "If sugary drink prices go up, then consumers will choose tax-exempt beverages like bottled water and diet drinks instead," Kenney’s spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said. "Small businesses will avoid job loss and maintain their profit margins by selling more tax-exempt drinks; and, accordingly, truck drivers will also be fine because they’ll be delivering more bottled water and diet soda." Without their clarification, it’s hard to discern how the Teamsters arrived at their job loss estimate. But economists and studies suggest it’s an overshoot. Robert P. Inman, a professor of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton school, called the estimate of 2,000 job losses "off the bounds of realistic." About 2,000 jobs would represent nearly the entire soda bottling and delivering industry in Philadelphia, and Inman said it’s inaccurate to assume that a three-cents-per-ounce tax on soda would cause the entire industry to crumble. He said his studies show the city could see a reduction in sales in the $150 million to $200 million range. But Inman said people won’t stop buying bottled drinks. They’ll either switch to bottled beverages like water that’s also bottled and delivered by large beverage companies, or they’ll switch to smaller sized bottles that also still need to be bottled and delivered in the city. "Wherever they’re getting the number from," he said, "it is so far above anything that strikes me as plausible." The Teamsters say they don’t buy the idea that the sale of water, diet sodas and the like will increase enough to cover the loss suffered as a result of the soda tax. In Grace’s statement, he wrote: "Consumers simply don't react that way." A 2014 study published in the American Journal of Public Health found a 20 percent tax on sugar-sweetened beverages (which correlates with about a two-cents-per-ounce tax) would result in small job gains. The study isn’t neutral -- it was funded by The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation’s Healthy Eating Research program. But it found that jobs lost as a result of the tax were offset by jobs created due to consumers switching to untaxed drinks like bottled water. A study published this year by Mexico’s Center for Health Systems Research found that after the country instituted a soda tax, there was a bump: Overall sales increased, largely due to higher amounts of bottled water being purchased. But then, after a year, sales fell to where they were before the tax was passed. The estimate is also higher than any other made before. When city officials floated a soda tax in 2011, the soda companies themselves predicted a job loss of 1,200 people. Al Taubenberger, a current city councilman and the former head of the Greater Northeast Philadelphia Chamber of Commerce, said at the time it would cost the city 1,000 jobs. After Baltimore instituted a two-cents tax on beverage containers last year, about 75 people lost their jobs. But Inman said any job loss estimate when it comes to a soda tax is dubious. Without statistical data -- as no other place in America has instituted a three-cents-per-ounce soda tax -- it’s nearly impossible to accurately calculate predicted job loss. "There’s been no soda tax, so you don’t have any experience who has actually seen what the effects are," he said. "So you end up trying to guess, and you get into this game of ‘your guess is as good as mine.’" Our Rating The Teamsters claim they stand to lose as many as 2,000 jobs in the region and "countless" others if Philadelphia implements a soda tax. This estimate is higher than any estimate floated before and tops what studies show the impact would be. And, at the end of the day, it’s nearly impossible to predict exact job loss as the result of a tax that hasn’t been implemented anywhere else in this way before. Is it within the realm of possibility that 2,000 beverage industry employees would lose their jobs due to the soda tax? Maybe. Is it likely? Not at all. We rate this claim False.

pomt-00742	Says Loretta Lynch’s nomination "has been now sitting there longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees combined."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/20/barack-obama/loretta-lynch-nomination-delayed-attorney-generals/	Democrats have recently been accusing Senate Republicans of obstructing the nomination of Loretta Lynch to succeed Eric Holder as attorney general. Lynch, currently the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, would become the first African-American woman to head the Justice Department, but she’s been awaiting a confirmation vote by the full Senate for several months. While observers expect Lynch to win confirmation, the Senate’s Republican majority has been withholding a vote as leverage to secure other legislative items. In addition, some Republicans have taken issue with Lynch’s refusal to speak out against President Barack Obama’s executive actions on immigration, which some in the GOP have called unconstitutional. Obama himself decried the delay at a joint press conference with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on April 17, 2015. Obama called it a "crazy situation where a woman who everybody agrees is qualified, who has gone after terrorists, who has worked with police officers to get gangs off the streets, who is trusted by the civil rights community and by police unions as being somebody who is fair and effective and a good manager -- nobody suggests otherwise -- who has been confirmed twice before by the United States Senate for one of the biggest law enforcement jobs in the country, has been now sitting there longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees combined." We wondered: Has Lynch’s nomination been "sitting there longer than the previous seven Attorney General nominees combined"? We looked at data from the Senate about the past seven nominees. Here’s a rundown, in reverse chronological order: Nominee President Nomination received by Senate Confirmed by Senate Days Eric Holder Obama Jan. 20, 2009 Feb. 2, 2009 13 Michael Mukasey G.W. Bush Sept. 21, 2007 Nov. 8, 2007 17 Alberto Gonzales G.W. Bush Jan. 4, 2005 Feb. 3, 2005 30 John Ashcroft G.W. Bush Jan. 29, 2001 Feb. 1, 2001 3 Janet Reno Clinton Feb. 26, 1993 Mar. 11, 1993 13 William Barr G.H.W. Bush Oct. 25, 1991 Nov. 20, 1991 26 Richard Thornburgh Reagan July 25, 1988 Aug. 11, 1988 17 TOTAL 119 So the previous seven nominees waited a collective 119 days. How about Lynch? Here it gets a little complicated. Lynch’s nomination was initially received in the Senate on Nov. 13, 2014. The Senate -- then under lame-duck Democratic control -- did not move the nomination forward. One obvious problem, beyond a short calendar interrupted by Thanksgiving and Christmas breaks: Rushing the nomination through might have been seen as thwarting the will of the people, who had just voted for a Republican Senate. Then, the Obama administration resubmitted Lynch’s nomination to the newly Republican-held chamber on Jan. 7, 2015. That’s standard procedure when one Congress ends and another begins. If you count the entire period -- from Nov. 13 to April 17, the day of Obama’s remark -- then Lynch had waited for 155 days (and 158 by this article’s publication date). That’s easily more than the 119 logged by the previous seven nominees. However, if you count only the time after the Republicans took over the Senate -- the period for which Obama’s obstructionism argument is strongest -- the delay was 100 days by the time of Obama’s comments, and 103 by this article’s publication. That’s less than the 119 days waited by the previous seven nominees, though it’s possible the wait could ultimately reach or exceed 119 days if no action is taken by early May. Obama does has a point that the delay for Lynch -- however many days it was -- has been unusually long. Of the hundreds and hundreds of nominations submitted in recent decades, only a few have waited for longer than 100 days, according to the Senate Historical Office. Among the more notable waits: • Richard Cordray, nominated for director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, 2011-13: 1+ years • Miguel Estrada, nominated for U.S. Circuit Court judgeship, 2003: 240 days • Richard Holbrooke, ambassador to the United Nations, 1999: 176 days • Lewis L. Strauss, nominated for Commerce Secretary, 1959: 152 days • Robert Gates, nominated for CIA Director, 1991: 134 days • Robert Bork, nominated for Supreme Court, 1987: 108 days Of these, the only nominee for an official Cabinet position to wait longer than Lynch was Strauss, and that was more than half a century ago. So Lynch’s case is pretty unusual by historical standards. Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and a political scientist at George Washington University, sees the argument for starting the clock with the resubmission of Lynch’s nomination, but she added that focusing on that distinction misses the larger point. "Presidents are typically given the right to field their own team," Binder said. "Given Lynch's previous confirmations and stellar credentials, why force her and the president to wait so long for a confirmation vote?" Burdett Loomis, a University of Kansas political scientist who has studied the Senate, agreed. "There’s a little sleight of hand" in Obama’s comment, "but the overall message is that there’s been a lot of delay and that it’s historic in length." And it’s not as if Republicans were powerless to resist even if the Democratic-controlled Senate had tried to act, said Steven S. Smith, a political scientist and Senate expert at Washington University in St. Louis. "The Democrats could have moved the nomination quickly at the end of the last Congress if the Republicans were not requiring cloture on everything, even nominations, which created a backlog of must-pass legislation and nominations as the Congress came to a close," Smith said. Our ruling Obama said that Lynch’s nomination "has been now sitting there longer than the previous seven attorney general nominees combined." Mathematically, Obama was correct if you start counting from Lynch’s initial nomination, but short by 19 days if you start counting from the resubmission of her nomination to the newly installed Republican-controlled Senate. Either way, it’s clear that Obama has a point that Lynch’s delay has been long by historical standards, especially for a Cabinet nominee. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-05101	"If you're one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-under-his-health-care-law-those-/	After the Supreme Court upheld the health care bill he’d signed into law, President Barack Obama applauded the decision in a speech at the White House. In that speech, Obama responded to critics, including Mitt Romney, who say the law could force many Americans off their health care plans. "If you're one of the more than 250 million Americans who already have health insurance, you will keep your health insurance," Obama said. "This law will only make it more secure and more affordable." This is a variation on a line Obama has used before, and which we have rated in the past. For instance, at a town hall meeting in New Hampshire on Aug. 11, 2009, Obama said, "If you like your health care plan, you can keep your health care plan." We found that overly optimistic given the bill’s details at the time, so we rated it Half True. Later, Obama spoke more specifically. In a speech to a joint session of Congress in September 2009, Obama said, "If you are among the hundreds of millions of Americans who already have health insurance through your job, or Medicare, or Medicaid, or the VA, nothing in this plan will require you or your employer to change the coverage or the doctor you have." We concluded that nothing in Obama’s proposal proactively forced such changes, and the bills clearly intended to leave much of the current health care system in place. So we rated the claim True. The claim Obama made after the Supreme Court decision on June 28, 2012, was a broader statement, and as a result, it’s less accurate. First, a March 2012 study by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, projected that 3 million to 5 million fewer non-elderly people would obtain coverage through their employer each year from 2019 through 2022 than would have been the case before the law was passed. Including those with individually purchased policies enlarges that decline by an additional 1 million to 3 million Americans. CBO’s estimate is broadly in line with a number of other independent estimates. A study by the Urban Institute projected a decline of about 500,000 people. The Lewin Group predicted a decline of about 3 million people. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services actuary pegged the number at about 1 million fewer people. And the RAND Corp. projected that about 4 million more individuals would be covered by employment-based coverage by 2016. Why are these changes occurring? Some will be made voluntarily by Americans seeking better health care options outside of their employer’s plan, but we think it’s reasonable for Obama to ignore these changes in his calculation. Other switches will be involuntary. As we have previously noted, many Americans already lose their current health plan for reasons that have nothing to do with the new law. Your employer may change insurance carriers, for instance, or your insurance carrier may unilaterally modify the terms of your plan. How common is this? The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found that in 2007, just over 14 percent of the entire U.S. population "switched" health insurance. However, this underestimates the rate of switching, because the study included people of all ages (including those covered by Medicare, who rarely switch) and because it doesn’t count a switch from one plan to the other within the same insurance company. The latter scenario is common. Mercer, a private consulting firm, found that in each of the years from 2005 to 2008, roughly a quarter of companies said they made changes to their plans that would result in employees paying a greater share of the cost. In 2009 and 2010, it rose to one-third. The number becomes substantial if you add up the workers who lose coverage entirely; who change jobs (voluntarily or involuntarily); who work for companies that change insurance carriers or adjust plan terms significantly; or whose employer’s insurance carrier is merged or bought out. And knowing that many workers every year are already required to change plans provides a different impression than what Obama is suggesting. Our ruling Obama has a reasonable point: His health care law does take pains to allow Americans to keep their health plan if they want to remain on it. But Obama suggests that keeping the insurance you like is guaranteed. In reality, Americans are not simply able to keep their insurance through thick and thin. Even before the law has taken effect, the rate of forced plan-switching among policyholders every year is substantial, and the CBO figures suggest that the law could increase that rate, at least modestly, even if Americans on balance benefit from the law’s provisions. We rate Obama’s claim Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-06-29T15:59:27	2012-06-28	['None']

pomt-06836	Says state Sen. Alberta Darling is "allowing mercury to harm our children" because she voted against an electronics recycling bill.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/05/wisconsin-sierra-club/wisconsin-sierra-club-says-state-sen-alberta-darli/	The political arm of the Wisconsin Sierra Club is slamming Republican state Sen. Alberta Darling in direct mail pieces that mince few words about the group’s view of her environmental voting record. She "looks the other way while corporate polluters ravage our lakes, our rivers and our air." She’s a "corporate Darling" whose actions are "damaging Wisconsin’s future." The claim that jumped out at us involved a 2009 vote on a bill banning disposal of computers, TVs and other electronics in landfills or incinerators. The "e-waste" recycling bill put the onus on product manufacturers to collect obsolete goods containing heavy metals and keep them out of the trash. "Alberta Darling’s Gone Too Far," the headline in one mailer reads. "Allowing Mercury to Harm Our Children." Another mailer claims Darling "voted to allow mercury and other harmful toxins into landfills where they can seep into our water supply." With these accusations flooding mailboxes in the weeks before the August 9, 2011, recall election between Darling and state Rep. Sandy Pasch, D-Whitefish Bay, we thought we’d take a look. The ban and recycling program passed 23-10 with little fanfare and some bipartisan support in June 2009 and was signed by Gov. Jim Doyle. Five Republican senators joined the majority. Twenty-five states, including Minnesota, now have such programs. Darling felt the fees and recycling requirements on manufacturers were excessive, said Andrew Davis, her campaign manager. In the end, Darling, as the Sierra Club claims, did vote against the bill. But the main thrust of the claim is that her "allowing mercury to harm our children" vote will "allow mercury and other harmful toxins into landfills where they can seep into our water supply." The political director of the Sierra Club, David Blouin, said the claim is justified because the goal of the bill was to keep mercury and other toxins out of the waste supply. "If it’s going into landfills, which all eventually leak, that threatens our water supplies," Blouin said. "Any increase (in mercury waste) via reduction of regulation allows mercury to harm our kids, or potentially could." That’s a strong statement, but with a couple of big "ifs." Let’s examine the evidence. The nonpartisan U.S. General Accountability Office in 2005 reviewed studies on e-waste and found that, by one account, 100 million computers, monitors, and televisions become obsolete each year and that the level is growing. Research showed two major concerns: the loss of natural resources such as copper, and the potential release of toxic substances in the environment. "EPA has identified lead, mercury, and cadmium (which are typically found in computers or monitors), as priority toxic chemicals for reduction under an agency program, the GAO reported. "According to EPA, these toxic substances do not break down when released into the environment and can be dangerous, even in small quantities." EPA’s website says that some electronics (such as color CRT computer monitors, color CRT TV tubes, and smaller items such as cell phones and other "hand-helds") test "hazardous" under federal law. The GAO report says that the Solid Waste Association of North America found an apparent increase in lead from used electronics showing up in municipal landfills. And "tests conducted at the University of Florida indicate that lead leachate from color computer monitors and televisions with CRTs"... could be considered hazardous waste under federal rules. But GAO added that the Florida researcher cautioned that his findings don’t necessarily mean it would leak from a modern landfill. And GAO noted that the Solid Waste Association declares municipal landfills as safe for managing used electronics "without exceeding toxicity limits." The GAO’s bottom line: "Regarding the issue of toxicity, the research we reviewed is unclear on the extent to which toxic substances may leach from used electronics in landfills." We heard the same kind of terminology about possible risks from other experts: A Congressional Research Service report to lawmakers in 2002 said that "disposal of these products, when they become "e-waste" at the end of their useful lives poses major potential environmental problems." "There is a possibility eventually that metals leach out over time," said Sarah Murray, a Wisconsin DNR employee who heads Wisconsin’s e-cycle program. That’s what drove states to implement the laws. The new program ended an exemption for households and electronics disposal. The new program, Murray said, has boosted recycling through drop-off programs: 30 million pounds of various categories of electronics have been recycled since the law kicked in. "It’s hard to say absolutely that there is less in landfills, but people have used it," Murray said. Barbara Kyle, national coordinator of the San Francisco-based Electronics TakeBack Coalition, called e-waste laws common sense preventive measures. In Wisconsin, Kyle said, there was little resistance by manufacturers to the bill. "It could cause harm, and it’s a waste of resources," she said. "Can you prove it ever got into the water stream? No, you can’t prove a link because (electronics) are all crunched up with other garbage." We’ll give the final word to Brad Wolbert, Wisconsin DNR’s chief of recycling and solid waste. Wolbert told us it’s true that landfill liners don’t last forever. And it’s true, he said, that mercury can get into landfill gas and escape. And DNR believes it makes sense to divert electronics from landfills. But it’s a stretch to say that harm has already come, or will come, to anyone from metals in discarded electronics, Wolbert said. "Nobody knows," he said. Let’s dig out. There’s little doubt that disposal of electronic products is a serious environmental issue involving hazardous substances. There is an element of truth in that Darling voted against the bill that aims to prevent harm. The Sierra Club mailers, though, push past what is known and attack Darling for "allowing mercury to harm our children." That day could come -- or not. But nobody claims it has already arrived. The statement earns a Mostly False on the Truth-O-Meter.	None	Wisconsin Sierra Club	None	None	None	2011-08-05T18:45:29	2011-07-23	['None']

pomt-11730	"Under Trump’s new tax plan … 99.8% of Americans" get "not one nickel" in tax cuts.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2017/dec/13/kelda-helen-roys/claim-998-americans-wouldnt-get-tax-cut-under-gop-/	Kelda Helen Roys picked an unusual way to become the latest of the major Democrats to join the 2018 race for governor of Wisconsin. She announced her candidacy on a private Facebook page. Roys, a former Wisconsin state representative from Madison, undoubtedly will be training her sights on GOP Gov. Scott Walker, who is seeking a third term. But on Dec. 1, 2017, six days before her Facebook announcement, Roys used social media in a different way to criticize tax reform efforts by President Donald Trump and other Republicans. She posted this tweet: Never let the GOP tell you again that they support low taxes. They don’t—unless you’re already a billionaire or a massive corporation. #TaxBill (Attached was the graphic shown above.) Many have criticized the proposed GOP tax cuts as favoring the richest. But 99.8 percent of Americans wouldn’t get any tax cut? That’s not correct. Not close. The estate tax Roys told us she was referring to an April 2017 Facebook post by U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, the Vermont independent who ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. That post blasted Trump’s proposal to repeal the estate tax, and it included the figures about the Waltons, the Koch brothers and Trump’s family that were part of Roys’ tweet. Sanders’ post also said "99.8 percent of Americans would not benefit by one nickel under Trump’s plan to repeal the estate tax." So, Sanders was clearly referring to only one tax reform provision: repeal of the estate tax. We’ve rated True a claim by U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Wis., that what some call the "death tax" was paid by only "two out of every 1,000 people" in 2016. That’s the equivalent of 99.8 percent. The tax applies only if an estate’s value exceeds $5.45 million, or $10.9 million, if there is a surviving spouse, and is paid by only about 5,000 estates per year. But Roys’ tweet was making a general reference to Trump’s tax plan -- with no indication that the numbers referred only to the estate tax. And its bottom-line claim was that "under Trump’s new tax plan … 99.8% of Americans" get "not one nickel" in tax cuts. Roys told us she now realizes that what she posted did not make it clear she was referring only to the estate tax. Indeed, a reader could only assume her claim was about the tax plan generally, with the "#TaxBill" reference she used and the "Trump’s new tax plan" in the headline. As for the House and Senate tax reform plans now in play, with Republicans hoping to finalize a plan for Trump’s signature before the end of 2017, several tax-cut provisions benefit the rich specifically. But the tax cuts would be widespread: Both plans would lower individual income tax rates for the middle class, and most people in lower-income households would see cuts, as well. Our rating Roys said that "under Trump’s new tax plan … 99.8% of Americans" get "not one nickel" in tax cuts. Roys said she was referring to the Republican proposal to repeal the federal estate tax, which would only benefit the wealthiest and does not apply to 99.8 percent of Americans. But her tweet made no reference to the estate tax. It gave the impression she was referring to Trump’s overall tax plan. That plan has its critics, including those who believe it gives too much to the rich. Nevertheless, as has been widely reported, the plan offers widespread tax cuts.

pomt-14896	"I am the only person in this field who is against amnesty. Every other person in this field wants to allow people who are here illegally to be able to stay here, in one form or another."	false	/iowa/statements/2015/nov/08/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-claims-hes-only-candidate-who-doesnt/	Presidential candidate Rick Santorum cast himself as the only candidate in the 15-person Republican field who opposes legal status for undocumented immigrants. "I am the only person in this field who is against amnesty," Santorum said during remarks at the Republican Party of Iowa’s Growth and Opportunity Party event on Oct. 31. "Every other person in this field wants to allow people who are here illegally to be able to stay here in one form or another." Of the 15 candidates in a GOP race that has focused heavily on immigration, is Santorum really the only one who’s "against" amnesty? As previous fact checks on similar statements have noted, "amnesty" is a tough word to define, and can mean different things to different people. Santorum offers a pretty succinct definition in his statement, though, by noting that other candidates would "allow people who are here illegally to be able to stay here, in one form or another." In a follow-up email, a campaign staffer said Santorum defines amnesty as "providing legal status to illegal immigrants." Fellow presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas has made similar statements, which we’ve previously found to be Mostly True. Santorum’s statement differs in important ways, however. In August and again in September, Cruz said "a majority" of GOP candidates have supported amnesty — wording that acknowledges some candidates’ views may have shifted over time. Santorum, by contrast, asserts that every other candidate currently supports an immigration policy that could be defined as amnesty. That’s a much higher standard — and a harder one to support. Let’s review each candidate individually, starting with those who have clearly indicated support for citizenship or legal status that meets Santorum’s definition of amnesty: Jeb Bush: The former Florida governor has made clear that he supports immigration reform that would provide legal status to the millions of undocumented people currently living in the U.S. Marco Rubio: The Florida senator was a member of the so-called Gang of Eight who pursued comprehensive immigration reform that included a path to citizenship. He has since taken more hardline views on immigration but still supports legal status for undocumented people currently living in the U.S. Lindsey Graham: The senator from South Carolina was also a member of the "Gang of Eight" who led efforts to pass immigration reform in 2013, and supports a pathway to citizenship. Carly Fiorina: The former Hewlett-Packard CEO said in June that she was open to legal status for the undocumented. John Kasich: The Ohio governor has said he "doesn’t like the idea of citizenship" but believes it may be necessary. George Pataki: The former New York governor supports legal-resident status for undocumented immigrants who have no criminal history and agree to 200 hours of community service. Jim Gilmore: The former Virginia governor supports legal status allowing undocumented immigrants to work in the United States, but opposes a pathway to citizenship. Other candidates supported citizenship or legal status in the past, but have tempered or reversed their views since entering the presidential race: Rand Paul: In 2013, the Kentucky senator told undocumented immigrants in a speech that "We will find a place for you" and implied (according to the New York Times) that he supported a pathway to citizenship. In more recent presidential campaign materials, though, Paul states that he "opposes amnesty" and believes the U.S.-Mexico border must be "secured" before "issuing any visas or starting the legal immigration process." Mike Huckabee: The former Arkansas governor has indicated support for a pathway to citizenship in the past, but used much tougher rhetoric this year, stating that he opposes "amnesty" and is unwilling discuss legal status until the border is secure. Chris Christie: In 2010, the New Jersey governor plainly said he supported a path to citizenship. Last May, however, he said he opposed a pathway to legal status. Donald Trump: Trump’s views on immigration have evolved over time, but his position now is among the toughest in the GOP field. He reportedly was supportive of the DREAM Act in a 2013 meeting with immigration activists and said just last July that he could support a "merit-based" system for allowing undocumented immigrants to remain in the U.S. Since then, though, he’s advocated for deporting all of the estimated 11 million undocumented people living in the country. Finally, in direct contradiction to Santorum’s claim, some candidates have simply never supported amnesty as his campaign defines it. Ben Carson: In a 2014 op-ed in National Review, the retired neurosurgeon proposed a guest-worker program for immigrants, but said all participants would have to apply from outside the United States — meaning undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S. would have to leave and apply to re-enter. Bobby Jindal: Despite an op-ed endorsing legal status in 2013, the Louisiana governor has repeatedly refused to take a position on the millions of undocumented immigrants currently living in the U.S since becoming a presidential candidate. He argues that the border must be secured before devising a policy to address those already living here. Ted Cruz. He has repeatedly stated that he’s the only candidate in the race who has never supported amnesty – statements that have been found to be Mostly True. Cruz voted against the 2013 Senate immigration bill and opposed a 2014 House proposal to grant more limited legal status to undocumented immigrants. Correspondence with Santorum’s campaign team makes clear his statement was aimed at drawing a contrast with Cruz, who’s lately been gaining momentum in the GOP race. A Santorum aide pointed to a series of amendments Cruz offered to the 2013 reform bill, which laid out additional conditions for granting legal status to those who are undocumented. Among other measures, those amendments removed the bill’s pathway to citizenship and made it more challenging for undocumented residents to receive legal status. Santorum’s campaign says those amendments amount to support for amnesty, but they could just as easily be read as efforts to weaken the bill and undermine the amnesty measures it contained. Our ruling Santorum said, "I am the only person in this field who is against amnesty. Every other person in this field wants to allow people who are here illegally to be able to stay here, in one form or another." While it’s true that seven of 15 GOP candidates currently support policies that meet Santorum’s definition of "amnesty," four candidates who once supported such policies no longer do, and two more have consistent records of opposition. The last, Jindal, hasn’t outlined his position. We rate Santorum’s claim False.	None	Rick Santorum	None	None	None	2015-11-08T08:06:14	2015-10-31	['None']
pomt-12250	Tax cuts approved and those proposed in his state budget "will exceed $8 billion by the time the budget is done."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jul/12/scott-walker/walker-tax-cuts-will-exceed-8-billion-if-budget-pr/	While Wisconsin’s budget remains stalled in the Legislature, Gov. Scott Walker is counting on it to increase the total amount of tax cuts generated during his tenure by at least $3.3 billion. In a recent appearance on Jay Weber’s WISN (1130-AM) talk show, Walker claimed that tax cuts approved and those included in his budget proposal "will exceed $8 billion by the time the budget is done." This isn’t the first time the governor has boasted about tax cuts. As part of his 2014 re-election bid, as well as his unsuccessful 2016 presidential bid, Walker pledged to reduce the tax burden on Wisconsinites and Americans. In his January State of the State address, Walker touted that state taxes had been cut by a cumulative $4.7 billion since he took office. In 2015, we fact checked that $4.7 billion tax cut claim and found it to be on the money. Is Walker right about the $8 billion mark? Looking at the numbers In our 2015 item, we noted that the vast majority of the $4.7 billion in tax cuts came from the 2011 manufacturing and industry tax cut and a 2013 income and property tax cut. Walker’s new claim still hinges on those 2011 and 2013 tax cuts and since there is a longer period of time involved, the reduction from them is larger as well. The new number comes from estimates by the Wisconsin State Budget Office. Walker’s office provided a copy of the spreadsheet he used to make his claim. Experts at the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau and the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance both looked over the numbers and consider them accurate. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said that the governor made a conservative estimate. The budget office’s spreadsheet indicates that tax cuts will amount to $8,826,601,340 through fiscal year 2019, meaning Walker gave himself about $800 million in wiggle room. The total includes proposed tax cuts of $500 million from the pending budget, but the bulk of the total comes from existing, ongoing cuts, specifically those related to manufacturing, agriculture and the income tax. Even if the $500 million in cuts is not passed in the final budget, projections suggest he could still reach the $8 billion figure. Whatever the final budget looks like, and by extension the total of tax cuts generated under Walker, hinge on a couple of caveats. One, the budget is still being negotiated, meaning the amount in additional tax cuts he’s seeking for the next two years could change. Walker originally sought $500 million in tax cuts for the upcoming budget and has said he’s willing to negotiate this amount in light of the impasse. Two, the numbers Walker is using are estimates, not final figures. To be sure, tax cuts make up one part of the budget picture. Walker’s budgets have historically included numerous, controversial cuts to education and other areas. However, the claim at hand strictly relates to tax cuts. Our rating Walker said tax cuts approved and those proposed in his pending state budget "will exceed $8 billion by the time the budget is done." The governor made a similar claim in 2015, which we rated True. His continued claims about the size of tax cuts remain on the money. Regardless of the budget passed, the state is on track to have generated more than $8 billion in tax cuts by the end of fiscal year 2019.

pomt-09790	The Obama administration's cap-and-trade plan would create "a $1,761 yearly energy tax."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/18/lamar-alexander/alexander-claims-cap-and-trade-will-cost-consumer-/	It's hard to keep track of all those estimates about how much a cap-and-trade bill would cost American families. So, the latest prediction, coming from Sen. Lamar Alexander and other Republicans, is just adding to the confusion. In a Sept. 16, 2009, press release, the Tennessean said, "American families can’t afford a new $1,761 yearly energy tax." Similar numbers were widely posted on conservative blogs. A story on the Weekly Standard was headlined, "Obama Admin Concedes: Cap and Trade Will Raise Your Taxes by 15%." Those were new numbers to us, so we decided to look into the claim. But first, a little recap. At its heart, cap-and-trade is a simple concept: To slow climate change, the government would set a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. To comply, companies such as electric utilities must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or buy credits — also known as allowances — to continue polluting. The cap-and-trade bill currently making its way through Congress was written by Reps. Henry Waxman and Edward Markey, Democrats from California and Massachusetts, respectively. Their goal is to lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Under their plan, most pollution permits initially would be given out for free. But eventually, companies would have to buy those permits from the government. It's an issue we've explored several times over . Opponents of cap-and-trade argue that forcing industry to buy pollution credits is nothing more than a tax on consumers and business. Firms will have no choice but to pass the cost of buying those permits on to consumers. There has been much debate about how much those costs could be, and it's been difficult to come up with a reliable number because the bills have been changing as they move through the House and the Senate. Republicans have cited numbers as high as $3,000 per year, a claim that when it was combined with a falsehood on health care, earned our Pants on Fire rating. Republicans often refer to it as a tax, although we have found that is incorrect. Only utilities that exceed their limits would have to pay for the allowances, which does not sound to us like a tax on families. Recent estimates by the Congressional Budget Office and the Environmental Protection Agency are much lower — between $80 and $340 a year, depending on income. The new numbers spring from some Treasury Department documents recently acquired by the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, through a Freedom of Information Act request. Some of the documents are from 2008, shortly after the election, according to the group, and others are undated, though they appear to be from early 2009. Nowhere in the documents does the Treasury Department cite the $1,761 figure. It seems Alexander got that number from a Sept. 15, 2009, story by Declan McCullagh, a blogger who writes the "Taking Liberties" column for CBS News. (Our calls to Alexander's office were not returned.) So it's worth noting that Alexander is relying not on a study by an economist, but on an estimate from a blogger. "The Obama administration has privately concluded that a cap and trade law would cost American taxpayers up to $200 billion a year, the equivalent of hiking personal income taxes by about 15 percent," McCullagh wrote. "A previously unreleased analysis prepared by the U.S. Department of Treasury says the total in new taxes would be between $100 billion to $200 billion a year. At the upper end of the administration's estimate, the cost per American household would be an extra $1,761 a year." We contacted McCullagh via e-mail, and he told us that he came up with $1,761 per household annually by simply dividing the number $200 billion by the number of households in the United States. According to the census, there are about 113.5 million households in the country this year. We reviewed the estimate with people involved in the climate change debate who told us there are significant flaws in McCullagh's methodology. Stephen Seidel, vice president for policy analysis and general counsel for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said the math is too simple and doesn't reflect the true impact of the House bill, which specifies that any revenue from the plan be rebated to consumers to offset higher electrical bills they might have to pay. "What [Treasury] was looking at was a situation where 100 percent of the permits were auctioned, and ignored what would be done with revenue," he said. The Waxman-Markey bill "uses revenue to offset cost to consumers." There also have been changes to the bill since that Treasury document was created. Obama originally envisioned that every polluting permit would be sold, starting when the bill was enacted. But in the spirit of compromise, Waxman and Markey scaled back that plan by giving about 85 percent of the permits for free in the early years of the bill's implementation. Also, under the latest version of the Waxman-Markey bill, which passed the House in June, 30 to 40 percent of the revenue would go back to electric utilities to be passed on to consumers to offset higher rates they would have to pay. The money would be passed to consumers through rebates or expanded efficiency programs, and an additional 15 percent of the revenue would go directly to low-income consumers. "The bottom line is that it goes back to the consumers," Seidel said. Seidel said there's another problem with the blogger's report, as quoted by the senator: the Treasury documents report that $100 billion to $200 billion in revenue raised each year by selling those pollution permits we mentioned earlier. Alexander and McCullagh incorrectly portray them as taxes. There are legitimate questions that can be raised about how much the cost might ultimately be passed on to consumers, but it is not correct to refer to the revenue as a tax. And higher energy costs are not a sure thing. Regional cap-and-trade programs in Europe and in the northeast United States show that auctioning most or all credits have actually decreased the cost of energy, said Barry Rabe, a public policy professor at the University of Michigan. "What we've seen is that there's a lot of volatility," he said. "It's hard to make those projections and say how these things are going to work as a result. That just underscores the difficulty of attaching numbers to these things that people can live with." Alan Krueger, the Obama administration's assistant treasury secretary for economic policy, sent us this statement via e-mail: "The reporting on the Treasury memo is flat-out wrong," he wrote. "Treasury's summary is consistent with public analyses by the EIA [Energy Information Administration], EPA, and CBO, and the reporting and blogging on this issue ignore the fact that the revenue raised from emission permits would be returned to consumers under both administration and legislative proposals." We spoke with Christopher Horner with the Competitive Enterprise Institute about the documents. He conceded that they don't reflect legislation currently under consideration, but he pointed out that the Senate is planning to start from scratch on the climate issue. "Congress writes legislation for one reason," Horner said. "This [document] sets forth the administration's desire and expectations." In the meantime, McCullagh has been fielding criticism about his column. On Sept. 16 he defended his analysis and wrote that revenue returned to consumers in the form of tax cuts and rebates is uncertain. "The tax revenue might end up being directed at income tax cuts (or rescuing kittens and feeding orphans, for that matter), or it could end up being wasted on boondoggles," he wrote. "If it is returned to American citizens, it's unlikely to be a wash: some people will end up paying much more in taxes, some will pay a little more, and some will see a net benefit." But back to Alexander's original claim. His statement that households will pay $1,761 in new taxes every year is based on a blogger's incorrect assumptions and overly simple math. The estimate does not account for revenue that will be returned to consumers in the form of rebates and other efficiency measures. Furthermore, the number is based on old numbers; the Treasury estimate was written on the premise that all permits would be sold, which, ultimately, is not the form that the Waxman-Markey legislation has taken. Finally, both Alexander and McCullagh portray money raised by selling these permits as a tax. We rate Alexander's claim False.

ranz-00031	The prison population has been rising under Labour and National… We’ll be at twice the OECD average by 2027, according to our projections.	fiction	https://www.radionz.co.nz/programmes/election17-fact-or-fiction/story/201859218/fact-or-fiction-how-correct-are-corrections-claims	The Opportunities Party co-deputy leader Geoff Simmons (in a video on the party's Facebook page) The prison population in New Zealand actually dipped slightly between 2011 and 2013. Increases since 2013 can largely be attributed to changes in the Bail Act & Sentencing Act. The Bail Act placed tougher conditions on those seeking bail, while also limiting which offences would qualify for bail. Changes to the Sentencing Act were introduced to ensure all victims were offered restorative justice prior to their sentencing. These changes have meant an overall higher proportion of prisoners are remanded in custody (kept in prison while their case is going through the courts) at any given time, as an overall percentage of the total prisoner population. At the top end of projections, the Ministry of Justice has forecast that prison numbers will likely increase by about 19 percent by the 2025/26 year. Inside Paremoremo PrisonPhoto: RNZ / Claire Eastham-Farrelly New Zealand’s total number of incarcerated persons are the seventh highest per capita in the OECD at a rate of 210 prisoners per 100,000 people, while the OECD average hovers around 140 per 100,000 people. Using the ministry's projections, the imprisonment rate would rise to 232 per 100,000 (accounting for a general population increase) by 2025/26 - about 66 percent higher than the current OECD average but not double.

pomt-10867	We live in "a time of historically low violent crime rates and historically high gun ownership rates nationally."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/aug/29/fred-thompson/researchers-split-about-whether-guns-reduce-crime/	Fred Thompson suggests that gun ownership reduces crime, but his commentary is backed by little more than disputed NRA statistics. In a posting on his Web site on Aug. 21, Thompson provided his take on the controversy with a commentary about New York City and its efforts to sue gun makers. "Ironically, all of this comes at a time of historically low violent crime rates and historically high gun ownership rates nationally," Thompson wrote. He went on to cite National Rifle Association figures. His statistics fall short in several ways. First, gun ownership rates are extremely difficult to calculate. The NRA used 8-year-old federal estimates and then used gun purchase figures to assume there are additional guns in the United States. However, a spokeswoman for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms said it is impossible to estimate how gun ownership has grown because there is no national gun registry. Violent crime had been at historic lows, dropping between 1993 and 2004. However, the FBI reports that the estimated rate of violent crime increased 2.3 percent in 2005 and 1.3 percent in 2006. Advocates on both sides of the issue have used the statistics to argue their own cases. The neutral Congressional Research Service declared in May 2005 that there's not enough evidence on either side: "According to a recent study...none of the existing sources of statistics provide either comprehensive, timely or accurate data with which to definitively assess whether there is a causal connection between firearms and violence."

pomt-04330	"6,400 Ohioans ... lost manufacturing jobs in the month of September."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/oct/26/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-camp-says-6400-ohioans-lost-manufactur/	The national unemployment rate has ticked down slowly -- much too slowly, says Mitt Romney’s campaign -- and Ohio’s economy has generally grown. Its unemployment rate is even 0.8 percent below the national average. But the unsteadiness of the recovery, even in Ohio, underlined a recent claim by the campaign for Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate. On Oct. 22, the spokesman, Robert Reid, said in an email to reporters: "Vice President Biden may believe there is a ‘renaissance’ in manufacturing happening in the Buckeye state, but don’t tell that to the 6,400 Ohioans who lost manufacturing jobs in the month of September." Could this job loss be true? After all, didn’t the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services announce just a few days earlier that the state’s unemployment rate had gone down yet again, reaching 7.0? The answer to both questions is yes. According to the monthly survey of businesses that state and federal officials use to assess job gains or losses, Ohio’s lost 12,800 non-farm jobs in September. Jobs in manufacturing accounted for 6,400 of those job, or half the loss. This was a preliminary figure and it could be adjusted upward or downward in the coming months as more surveys are turned in. The survey, called Current Employment Statistics, is conducted by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in conjunction with ODJFS. Sure, that seems inconsistent with the reported drop in Ohio’s unemployment, from 7.2 percent to 7.0 percent. But as many Americans have learned this year, the two numbers do not always move in the same direction. Here’s why: The unemployment rate is based on a a different and broader survey. It is not a survey of businesses. Rather, it is a civilian survey, called the Current Population Survey, and it asks people whether they are in the workforce or looking for a job. Each time someone stops looking for work -- whether it’s because he or she has retired, has given up on looking, has become self-employed or has some other reason -- that is one fewer person counted as unemployed. The unemployment rate has other factors, including the number of people who come of age and start looking for jobs. That’s why the opposite trend of what occurred in September sometimes happens: The country can gain jobs yet the unemployment rate might still rise. Economists say that a healthy economy must add enough jobs to at least keep up with adult population growth. As for the Romney spokesman’s comment, an article in The Plain Dealer by business reporter Olivera Perkins made a similar point, sans politics. It said, "Ohio’s unemployment rate down to 7 percent, though state lost jobs." Speaking to the conflicting direction of the trends -- that is, employers who reported they had fewer jobs, yet people in the workforce who nevertheless said they were, in fact, employed -- Hiram College economics professor Ugur Aker told the newspaper that gains in self-employment could explain the difference. "What is happening is that there are wage and salary jobs being eliminated," Aker told The Plain Dealer. "On the other hand, it looks like jobs are increasing because there are more people working for themselves. Is that a good thing? Bad thing? I don't know." Economic research analyst George Zeller, noting that manufacturing "has been driving this recovery," told the newspaper that the losses "are very bad news." The numbers cited by the Romney campaign were confirmed by ODJFS and the BLS. They were reported by other media, too. Romney’s spokesman made the statement in an attempt to lay political blame. Voters in Ohio will have their say on that soon enough. PolitiFact Ohio is only ruling on the accuracy of the claim about job losses in manufacturing. The statement is accurate, but some additional information is needed to provide clarification. Reid, the Romney spokesman, was citing losses from one month -- losses that totaled just shy of 1 percent. To get a better sense of changes in manufacturing employment during President Barack Obama’s term to date, consider these monthly figures provided by ODJFS and BLS. Here is what the numbers and a calculator show: From the start of Obama’s term in January 2009 to the lowest point for manufacturing in Ohio, November 2009, the state lost 9.75 percent of its manufacturing jobs. From the start of Obama’s term through the latest month reported, September, Ohio has lost nearly 2.8 percent of its manufacturing jobs. Why a lower number? Factory jobs started coming back slowly at the very end of 2009, though not robustly enough to make up for the early losses. From the lowest point for manufacturing in Ohio (November 2009) through September, a period of 34 months, Ohio has gained 7.7 percent more manufacturing jobs. What’s this tell you? That many but not all of those factory jobs lost during Obama’s term have come back. In that single sentence you have both parties’ economic messages. Curious to see another trend, we looked back further. Not to be the bearer of bad news, but you probably know this anyway: Ohio was losing manufacturing jobs for a long time. The number fell during both of George W. Bush’s terms, with Ohio losing a third of its manufacturing jobs by the end of the eight years. During Bill Clinton’s first term, the number of those jobs rose by 4.2 percent, but declined by 2.7 percent in his second term. So was the Romney campaign cherry picking its figure, given these broader trends? You might argue that, but as The Plain Dealer reported, the latest monthly jobs report troubled economists, too. It was just one monthly report and more information will be required to know if there is a trend, but it suggested a weaker recovery. And, combined with the latest unemployment number, it raised questions about the trade-offs of self-employment, perhaps at lower wages. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Mostly True.

pomt-10075	"Mr. Warren compared same-sex couples to incest."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/13/barney-frank/warren-gay-marriage-and-incest/	One of the first controversies faced by freshly elected Barack Obama came with his selection of evangelical Rev. Rick Warren to deliver the invocation at his Jan. 20 inauguration. Although viewed by some as a moderate, Warren's outspoken support of California's recently passed Proposition 8 — which amended the state constitution to ban gay marriage — angered some in Obama's liberal base, particularly those who support gay marriage. In the days after Obama announced that Warren would deliver the invocation, one of the popular sound bites coming from opponents was an accusation that Warren recently likened gay couples to incest. Leading the charge was U.S. Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., who is openly gay. "Mr. Warren compared same-sex couples to incest," Frank said in an interview on CNN's Late Edition on Dec. 21, 2008. "I found that deeply offensive and unfair." Frank repeated his objections to Obama's pick during an interview with MSNBC the following day: "I think Rick Warren's comments comparing same-sex relationships to incest is deeply offensive, wildly inaccurate and very socially disruptive." The comments Frank is referring to come from an interview Warren gave in mid December to Steven Waldman, editor in chief of Beliefnet. Context is the critical thing here, so we'll provide a generous helping of Warren's statements to give you a complete view: Waldman: Do you support civil unions or domestic partnerships? Warren: I don't know if I'd use the term there. But I support full equal rights for everybody in America. I don't believe we should have unequal rights depending on particular lifestyles, or whatever stuff like that. So I fully support equal rights. Waldman: What about partnership benefits in terms of insurance or hospital visitation? Warren: "Not a problem with me ... I'm not opposed to that as much as I'm opposed to the redefinition of a 5,000-year-old definition of marriage. I'm opposed to having a brother and sister be together and call that marriage. I'm opposed to an older guy marrying a child and calling that a marriage. I'm opposed to one guy having multiple wives and calling that marriage." Q: "Do you think those are equivalent to gays getting married?" A: "Oh, I do. For 5,000 years marriage has been defined by every single culture and every single religion...as a man and a woman." We'll note here that Warren's statement about the 5,000-year history of marriage seems wrong on its face, given that several cultures and religions have accepted polygamy. But we're not rating that statement here, just the allegation that he compared gay couples to incest. On the one hand, Warren did throw out examples of brothers and sisters marrying (incest) or an adult marrying a child (pedophilia) in the context of explaining his opposition to gay marriage. But they were cited as examples of unions outside his definition of marriage. And he agreed that same-sex couples would be another. Warren did not, however, compare "same-sex relationships to incest" or say they are similar. He only said they all fall outside his definition of marriage. That's an important distinction. In fact, Warren noted that he is okay with partnership benefits for same-sex couples. Later in the interview, Warren noted that he has "many gay friends. I've eaten dinner in gay homes. No church has probably done more for people with AIDS than Saddlebrook Church. Kay (his wife) and I have given millions of dollars out of the Purpose Driven Life helping people who got AIDS through gay relationships. So they can't accuse me of homophobia. I just don't believe in the redefinition of marriage." For his part, Obama opposes gay marriage, though he supports extending "full and equal rights and benefits to same-sex couples under both state and federal law." And Obama opposed Proposition 8, calling it "divisive and discriminatory." While noting that he differs with Warren on some issues, Obama defended Warren's selection, saying, "During the course of the entire inaugural festivities, there are going to be a wide range of viewpoints that are presented. And that's how it should be, because that's what America is about." Frank agreed that "everybody should speak, and there could be a dialogue." But, he said, "giving that kind of mark of approval and honor to someone who has frankly spoken in ways that I and many others have found personally very offensive, I thought that was a mistake for the president-elect to do." You can argue the appropriateness of Obama's choice, and you can argue the appropriateness of Warren citing examples of incest in the context of explaining his opposition to gay marriage, but Frank distorts Warren's words when he says Warren "compared same-sex couples to incest." He didn't. He just cited them as types of relationships that should not be eligible for marriage. We rule his comment Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09031	"You know, when this thing first hit, I signed a declaration of emergency for the six counties that were directly affected, impacted in the Panhandle, then I extended that not long thereafter down into Sarasota County."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/06/charlie-crist/charlie-crists-oil-response-evolved-over-time/	The Deepwater Horizon oil drilling rig exploded and caught fire in the Gulf of Mexico on the night of April 20, 2010. A week later, on April 29, as the first of many oil-soiled birds were being washed down, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency. Florida Gov. Charlie Crist also made an announcement that day. He was leaving the Republican party to run as an independent for U.S. Senate. In the weeks since waves of oil began seeping into the Gulf of Mexico, Crist has appeared on the nightly news on a near-daily basis to discuss the oil crisis. He regularly tours the Panhandle. He meets with affected business owners. And, he highlights his response to the oil disaster whenever he is in a large, bustling room. "You know, when this thing first hit, I signed a declaration of emergency for the six counties that were directly affected, impacted in the Panhandle," he told a crowd at the Florida Association of Counties conference in Tampa on July 1, 2010. "Then, I extended that not long thereafter down into Sarasota County. And then we started to hear about the loop current -- I mean we've all become sort of mini-experts in the study of this spill -- after hearing about the looper and the possibility that this could get all the way down into Monroe County and even up, you know, to Miami-Dade, Broward, Palm Beach, we extended that emergency declaration through Palm Beach County." Crist's message: I've been getting things done. But, we wondered, was Crist's response really that nimble? It wasn't until the day after he announced he was running as an independent that Crist signed a 6-page executive order declaring a state of emergency for six Florida counties: Escambia, Santa Rosa, Okaloosa, Walton, Bay and Gulf. In that April 30 order, he also tapped the state Department of Environmental Protection to coordinate the response effort. Crist added 13 more counties on May 3, extending the state of emergency south along the Gulf Coast through Sarasota County. The proclamations were good enough for Florida, but Crist still needed to let the federal government know Florida was in crisis if he wanted federal help. That step didn't come until more than two weeks after the rig explosion with a May 6 letter to President Barack Obama requesting a $50 million disaster grant from the federal Department of Labor. He later requested help from the federal Small Business Administration on May 12, which allowed business owners to qualify for federal grants. A month after the explosion, Crist extended the state of emergency further south and back up the Atlantic coast through Palm Beach County. In all, the May 20 executive order brought the number of Florida counties in a declared state of emergency to a total of 26. Crist explained his decision by citing reports that oil from the spill had entered into a loop current that could potentially carry it out to other counties bordering the gulf and the Atlantic seaboard. Crist broke out his special executive order pen one more time on June 18, extending the state of emergency through Aug. 28. "Depending on weather and ocean currents, this ecological disaster poses a potential threat to Florida's entire coastline," read the order. We weren't sure how Crist would define "when this thing first hit." For context, we looked at what the governors did in Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, the other gulf states immediately threatened by the oil spill. Alabama Gov. Bob Riley also declared a state of emergency on April 30, but his covered the entire state. More recently, Riley reached out for some divine help when he declared Sunday, June 27, a "Day of Prayer," and urged his residents to ask God for a solution. April 30 was also a productive day for Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, who declared a state of emergency in all areas affected by the oil leak, including, "but not limited to, Hancock, Harrison and Jackson counties, the littoral areas of these counties, any state, national or international waters through which state or federal personnel shall traverse or operate in responding to this oil leak." Then there's Jindal, one of the few government leaders whose outspokenness on the oil leak might rival Crist's. Jindal was the first of the four gulf coast governors to declare a state of emergency. His came April 29 and covered the entire state of Louisiana. That same day, Jindal shared his declaration with the federal Small Business Administration, the first step in ensuring small businesses in areas ravaged by the oil spill would be eligible for low-interest loans of up to $2 million to cover basic operating expenses. He also asked that the Small Business Administration temporarily suspend loan repayments for coastal businesses impacted by the spill that had received earlier loans related to Hurricanes Katrina, Rita, Ike and Gustav. So, that means Crist was mostly in step with his peers when he declared a state of emergency in six Florida counties 10 days after the oil rig explosion. And he did go on to expand the emergency declaration to include 20 more counties within a month. On the other hand, of the four states closest to the oil disaster, Florida is still the only state with a limited emergency area. And, unlike Jindal, Crist did not immediately seek financial help from the federal government. Crist's initial emergency proclamation was timely and he did continue to expand it. But given that he didn't immediately reach out for federal dollars and that other gulf governors beat him to the punch by issuing broad state of emergency proclamations from the beginning -- we give him a Mostly True.

pomt-06109	Says Rick Santorum voted for the Bridge to Nowhere.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/jan/02/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-rick-santorum-voted-bridge-nowhere/	A day before the Iowa caucuses, Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s presidential campaign posted online a video that portrays rival candidate Rick Santorum as a supporter of pork-barrel spending during the 16 years he served in Congress. Calling Santorum "a porker's best friend," the video, using on-screen text, gives several examples, including that "Santorum voted to spend millions on the Bridge to Nowhere." Perry’s campaign made the same charge in a radio ad that it released in Iowa on Dec. 29, 2011. Mimicking the format of a game show, Perry's ad kicks off with an announcer asking: "Which Republican running for president voted for the Bridge to Nowhere earmark?" The "correct" answer comes from contestant "Susie from Des Moines," who responds by naming Santorum. (He represented Pennsylvania in the U.S. Senate from 1995 to 2007 after serving two terms in the U.S. House.) We wondered whether Perry was right that Santorum had voted for the now-infamous bridge project? Perry's charge takes us back to 2005, when the nearly $400 million plan to connect the Alaskan city of Ketchikan (population about 8,000) with Gravina, an island with a few dozen residents and an airport, became an object of national ridicule and a symbol of federal pork-barrel spending. Critics pointed to the bridge plan as evidence that congressional earmarking — the setting aside of federal money for pet projects — had run amok, and on Nov. 6, 2005, Parade magazine highlighted the project in a cover story with the headline "Are Your Tax Dollars Being Wasted?" The project was again thrust into the spotlight during the 2008 presidential contest. The Republican nominee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, used the bridge to highlight his record of fighting against pork-barrel spending. And perhaps most memorably, McCain's running mate, then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, said repeatedly during the campaign that she "told Congress, 'Thanks, but no thanks,' on that Bridge to Nowhere" — a statement rated Half True by the PolitiFact Truth-O-Meter. As backup for Perry's statement that Santorum had voted for the project, the governor's campaign points to a "presidential white paper" about Santorum by the Washington-based anti-tax group The Club for Growth. The assessment of Santorum's record on economic issues in the U.S. Senate concludes that "on the whole," he was "above average." However, the paper says Santorum was weak in some areas, including on spending during the Bush administration. Santorum "voted for the 2005 highway bill that included thousands of wasteful earmarks, including the Bridge to Nowhere," the paper says, referring to a $286.5 billion federal highway and transportation bill that included about $225 million for the Gravina Island bridge project. On July 29, 2005, the U.S. Senate passed the legislation with a vote of 91-4. Santorum was among the backers of the bill. But does that prove correct Perry's statement that Santorum voted for the Bridge to Nowhere? Not quite. In other fact-checks, PolitiFact has dismissed that claim because the Senate wasn't voting yes-or-no just on the Alaska bridge. Funding for the bridge project was less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the spending in the transportation bill. However, the Club for Growth white paper points to another Senate vote related to the bridge project that took place about three months later: "In a separate vote, Santorum had the audacity to vote to continue funding the Bridge to Nowhere rather than send the money to rebuild New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina." The paper was referring to a vote on an amendment in a later transportation appropriations bill that called for stripping some funding from the Bridge to Nowhere project. The amendment, sponsored by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., sought to redirect part of the funding to a project to rebuild the Twin Spans bridge between New Orleans and Slidell, La., which had been damaged during Hurricane Katrina. The amendment failed 82-15. Santorum was in the majority, voting against killing the funding for the Bridge to Nowhere. After the amendment's defeat, lawmakers hashing out differences between the House and Senate measure of the appropriations bill removed the earmark for the bridge project and instead provided the money directly to Alaska's transportation department to spend on whatever projects it saw fit. That funding still could have gone to the Ketchikan-Gravina Island span, but ultimately the bridge was never built. After Perry's earmark-related attack in Iowa, Santorum defended his record in interviews. Speaking with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly on Dec. 29, Santorum said: "If you look at the Constitution, the Constitution gives the power of the purse to the Congress, and the Congress is the one that's supposed to spend the money. And so the idea that earmarks are somehow against the Constitution or something that is illicit that a congressman … shouldn't do is just simply factually incorrect." Santorum also said that since leaving Congress, he has defended his earmarks because he is proud of the money that he set aside "for things that were priorities in my state, instead of having bureaucrats do that." But, Santorum said, he now recognizes that Americans view earmarks as "a pox upon the Congress" and as president, he would oppose them. The same day, Santorum addressed Perry's "Bridge to Nowhere" charge specifically, according to a Des Moines Register news article. The story says Santorum, speaking to reporters while on the campaign trail in Iowa, acknowledged that some earmarks are controversial. "People say that I voted for the Bridge to Nowhere," Santorum said, according to the Register story. "I did. I went with the federalist argument, which is: 'Who am I in Pennsylvania to tell Alaska what their highway priorities should be?' You had a city that was separated from its airport and of course in Alaska, you have to travel by air, and you had to have a ferry. There were times when they couldn’t get across." Our ruling Perry said that as a senator, Santorum voted for the Bridge to Nowhere. Santorum did, a charge that he hasn't disputed. He voted for a giant spending bill that included money for the bridge project and then later voted to maintain federal funding for the project. On the Texas Truth-O-Meter, an accurate statement that could benefit from such clarification or additional material is considered Mostly True. And so it is.

pomt-00991	"There haven't been tax cuts for the rich" in Rhode Island.	false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/feb/08/nicholas-mattiello/house-speaker-nicholas-mattiello-says-rhode-island/	Taxes were one of the topics that WJAR-TV reporter Bill Rappleye raised when he interviewed House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello during the Jan. 18 edition of "10 News Conference." Rappleye referred to a report showing that poor people in Rhode Island pay more taxes per person than in other states. Then he asked Mattiello, " Is there a way to change that?" The speaker said the solution was to, "Lift up the middle class." "Our middle class revenue is just not what it should be," Mattiello said. "Let's lift everybody up and we'll be competitive with other states. So that's my approach for dealing with it, not changing rates and not charging our more successful folks more money. I think the middle class has been squeezed for a long time." "And the tax cuts for the rich don't contribute to that?" Rappleye said. "There haven't been tax cuts for the rich. I'm not sure when folks refer to that, I'm not sure what they're referring to. So if you can point to the tax cuts for the rich, I'll be happy to consider that," Mattiello said. "But, realistically, there's never been tax cuts for the rich." That sparked an immediate request from a few readers to have PolitiFact Rhode Island check his assertion. One reason: in 2010, the General Assembly, when Mattiello was House Majority Leader, lowered the top tax rate for the state's highest earners. That rate was 9.9 percent for income that exceeded $336,550 and in state-by-state rankings, it stood out like stink bomb at a flower show. So the legislature, with the blessing of then-Governor Donald Carcieri, brought the top rate down to 5.99 percent. Thus was born the idea that Rhode Island had given a big tax break for the rich, prompting calls by some legislators to bump the rate up to 7.99 percent for all earnings above $250,000. But, as in all things taxes, it's not that simple. We'll return to the 2010 changes. But first we should travel further back to 2006, a year before Mattiello joined the General Assembly and the year a tax overhaul passed that was designed to increasingly benefit the wealthy Instead of the top tax rate of 9.9 percent, the legislature and then-Governor Donald Carcieri gave taxpayers the option of paying a flat 8.0 percent of their adjusted gross income if they gave up taking credits and deductions. Each subsequent year, that tax cap dropped another 0.5 percentage points. It would have fallen to 5.5 percent if the General Assembly hadn't done its 2010 tax overhaul. When it was proposed, the 2006 change wasn't billed as just a tax cut for the rich. In announcing the plan, then-House Majority Leader Gordon Fox told the conservative Heartland Institute, "This will undoubtedly help the state's highest wage-earners. But I am proud that this tax package also helps low-income wage earners and the middle class." As Larry Berman, Fox's spokesman pointed out to Heartland at the time, the plan was designed to entice the well-to-do. "These are people making $250,000 and above, and when they want to create jobs, they look at Massachusetts and see a 5.3 percent income tax, Connecticut with a 5.0 percent tax, and Rhode Island with a 9.9 percent tax. They make a choice on where to move and create jobs, and that difference in tax rates is a big factor in the choice they make." So this was clearly an effort to entice the rich and bring them to -- or keep them in -- Rhode Island. In each succeeding year, as the percentage fell, more well-off taxpayers took advantage of it. So by the time the 2010 tax law lowering the top rate was passed, many of the rich weren't paying taxes at the 9.9 percent rate anyway. On the other side of the ledger, in 2009 the rich took a hit when the legislature approved another bill, one that taxed capital gains, which is the profit from the sale of stocks and other investments, as regular income. Capital gains had been taxed at a special reduced rate. Now back to the 2010 legislation, and the tax rates now in effect. Those tax changes did more than lower the top rate. It rejiggered the whole tax structure. Instead of the 9.9 percent rate kicking in for income that exceeded $336,550, the new 5.99 percent rate applied to all income above $135,000. Five levels of taxation were transformed into three. The standard deduction went up. So did the personal exemption. The legislation also phased out most credits and itemized deductions as a person's income rose, and shifted some of the tax burden to non-residents. When we asked Mattiello's office about the Speaker's claim, Berman sent us a projection from the state's Office of Revenue Analysis done when the changes were being considered. It used tax data from 2008 and compared what people would pay under the old and new systems. We also looked at a later analysis done at the end of 2010, after passage. Both showed the same pattern. Here are the December 2010 numbers: Adjusted gross income Change in average tax paid Number of returns $1 to $12,500 $13 decrease 109,181 $12,501 to $20,000 $29 decrease 61,217 $20,001 to $30,000 $35 decrease 68,407 $30,001 to $40,000 $21 decrease 55,383 $40,001 to $55,000 $24 decrease 62,776 $55,001 to $75,000 $64 decrease 63,230 $75,001 to $110,000 $91 decrease 70,347 $110,001 to $175,000 $350 decrease 48,206 $175,001 to $250,000 $113 increase 14,322 $250,001 to $500,000 $152 increase 9,791 $500,001 to $1 million $955 increase 3,561 $1 million to $5 million $2,276 increase 2,276 $5 million to $10 million $5,159 increase 269 Over $10 million $9,562 increase 340 So compared to what the average tax bill would have been without the changes, higher-income taxpayers -- those with adjusted gross incomes of over $175,000 -- actually paid more. The average filer in that group (representing about 8 percent of filers) paid $574 extra compared to what they would have paid under the previous system. So the rich did not get a big tax break from this law. Finally, there was a major change in the estate tax that passed in 2014. Under the old system, if an estate was worth $921,655 or less, no estate tax was assessed. But if the value was even a dollar higher, the full value of the estate was taxed. Under the 2014 change, the tax only kicks in when the estate is valued at more than $1.5 million. More importantly, the all-or-nothing provision, sometimes called "the cliff," was eliminated and only the portion in excess of $1.5 million is subject to the tax. In addition, the limit is now tied to inflation. The change translates into a collective tax savings of $64,400 to the heirs of someone whose estate is worth more than $1.5 million. The degree to which this change benefited the rich is a matter of debate. If you believe, to paraphrase Mitt Romney, "Estates are people too," than this was a big tax break for the wealthy, saving them up to $64,400 in taxes per estate. In addition, supporters of the proposal said it was designed to prevent wealthy people from leaving the state before they die. Wealth tends to run in families, and not a lot of poor people were lobbying for this tax break. But just because someone's a millionaire doesn't mean that their heirs are rich, and the heirs are the ones who get extra inheritance, thanks to the new law. "The middle income got the best break because they got rid of the cliff," said John Simmons, executive director of the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council. "I think the old system was hurting a lot of lower income people," said Patricia Thompson, former chairwoman of the federal and state taxation committee of the Rhode Island Society of Certified Public Accountants. "The wealthy will get a break because the exemption is raised to $1.5 million just as everyone else would, but I wouldn't say it was geared to them at all." Thompson and other people we interviewed suggested that the best source of information on this would come from Paul Dion, chief of the Office of Revenue Analysis for the Rhode Island Department of Revenue. But Gov. Gina Raimondo's office refused to make Dion available for an interview. Our ruling House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello said, "There haven't been tax cuts for the rich" in Rhode Island. He later specified a time frame: Never. The 2010 tax changes -- which dropped the top tax rate by four percentage points -- is often regarded as a tax cut for the rich, but the wealthy actually paid more. They also paid more after the 2009 change, which called for taxing capital gains as ordinary income. But we only had to go back to 2006 to find tax legislation that argues against his point. Although no longer in effect, it imposed an ever-lower cap on state taxes that benefitted more and more rich people as the tax cap dropped lower and lower. And the 2014 change in the estate tax meant that wealthier estates weren't taxed as heavily. Overall, we believe the rich disproportionately benefit from this change even though all heirs, paupers and princes alike, get the same break. On balance, the PolitiFact Rhode Island judges rate his statement False. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.) (Corrections: Gordon Fox was House Majority Leader when he talked to the Heartland Institute about the 2006 tax changes.

pomt-06176	"The Obama administration just issued instructions that terrorism training should not involve any reference to Islam."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/14/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-obama-administration-issued-ins/	Republicans on the presidential campaign trail regularly suggest that President Barack Obama is soft on terrorism and too tolerant of what they say is an enduring threat from Islamic radicals. Obama batted away such appeasement charges at a Dec. 8, 2011, news conference, but the insinuation arose again during a two-person foreign policy debate on Dec. 12, 2011, between former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr. at St. Anselm College in New Hampshire. Gingrich said American efforts to combat terrorism under Obama had no coherent theme, unlike the Cold War-era theory of "supporting everybody who is not a communist." In fact, Gingrich said, "The Obama administration just issued instructions that terrorism training should not involve any reference to Islam. Well, that would be like talking about the Cold War and not mentioning communism. How do you describe ‘radical Islamist’ if you're not allowed to say ‘radical Islamist?’ It's a willful denial of reality on a scale that is breathtaking." Could Gingrich be right on this one? His campaign spokesman, R.C. Hammond, referred PolitiFact to several documents Hammond said were germane. Most critically, Hammond cited a speech by Deputy Attorney General James Cole on Oct. 19, 2011, at a "Conference on Post-9/11 Discrimination," which followed revelations by Wired that training material used by the FBI unfairly stereotyped Muslims. One of the documents, for example, referred to the Prophet Mohammad as a "cult leader," and said jihad and "Just War" traditions were part of the "strategic themes and drivers" in Islamic law. "The strategic themes animating these Islamic values are not fringe; they are main stream," the document stated. The report of the loaded language about Islam drew criticism from the Arab American Institute and other groups, and Cole’s speech appeared to be a response. Cole warned of "stereotyping" and said, "All of us must reject any suggestion that every Muslim is a terrorist or that every terrorist is a Muslim. As we have seen time and again – from the Oklahoma City bombing to the recent attacks in Oslo, Norway – no religion or ethnicity has a monopoly on terror." Even more to the point, Cole said, "We also are working comprehensively to ensure that every aspect of the Department’s work reflects sensitivity and respect for all peoples and faiths. As just one example, to that end, I recently directed all components of the Department of Justice to re-evaluate their training efforts in a range of areas, from community outreach to national security, to make sure they reflect that sensitivity." While the speech did not ban "any reference to Islam," Hammond, Gingrich’s spokesman, also referred to a report on Cole’s speech in the right-leaning The Daily Caller, which said the "Obama administration was pulling back all training materials used for the law enforcement and national security communities, in order to eliminate all references to Islam that some Muslim groups have claimed are offensive." In a phone interview the day after Gingrich made his claim, Justice Department spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa said Cole’s speech never did what Gingrich asserted it had. "No one has ever said we are barring the word ‘Islam’ from training materials," she said. And James Zogby, the founder and president of the Arab American Institute, who had raised concerns about the FBI material, also said Gingrich was overstating what had taken place. "There’s been no order, no banning. No decision has been made, other than let’s evaluate and see whether (the training materials) are helping or hurting," said Zogby, who said he discussed the matter with someone in the Justice Department’s Civil Rights division after being contacted by PolitiFact. "An evaluation does not constitute a banning." Asked whether he believed a discussion of Islam was appropriate in the counter-terror training, Zogby, a Catholic with a Ph.D. in Islamic studies, said yes, because "it’s a misunderstood religion, we need to know more about it … Should law enforcement be studying the religion? Of course they should, but they should be studying it as it is and not as bigots imagine it." While the Justice Department denial certainly calls into question Gingrich's statement, Hammond, his spokesman, also cited a Talking Points Memo story on the training material controversy that focused on Dwight Holton, the former U.S. attorney in Oregon. Holton, who was in office when Mohamed Osman Mohamud was arrested in November 2010, after allegedly trying to detonate what he believed was a car bomb at a Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Portland, Ore., told TPM, "I want to be perfectly clear about this: training materials that portray Islam as a religion of violence or with a tendency towards violence are wrong, they are offensive, and they are contrary to everything that this president, this attorney general and the Department of Justice stands for." The Gingrich camp highlighted a portion of that story that said the 37-page complaint against Mohamud, a Somali-American, did not state that he was a Muslim. Holton said what was "relevant is the violence," not his religion. Some other evidence to consider: a 12-page document released by the White House in August 2011, "Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States," wades into the complicated challenge authorities face in dealing with potential efforts to radicalize Americans. "Groups and individuals supporting al-Qaida's vision are attempting to lure Americans to terrorism in order to create support networks and facilitate attack planning, but this also has potential to create a backlash against Muslim Americans. Such a backlash would feed al-Qaida’s propaganda that our country is anti-Muslim and at war against Islam, handing our enemies a strategic victory by turning our communities against one another; eroding our shared sense of identity as Americans; feeding terrorist recruitment abroad; and threatening our fundamental values of religious freedom and pluralism," the August document stated. Also, a 23-page White House document issued in December 2011, "Strategic Implementation Plan for Empowering Local Partners to Prevent Violent Extremism in the United States," mentions Islam only once, though it does refer more often to the threat from al-Qaida. "As President Obama emphasized, when discussing Muslim Americans in the context of al-Qaida's attempts to divide us, 'we don't differentiate between them and us. It's just us,'" the document states. More often, the December plan issued by the White House uses language like "community resilience programming" and the importance of "enhancing engagement with and support to local communities that may be targeted by violent extremists," without explicitly saying that many of those communities are, in fact, Muslim-American. The Ruling There is no question that the Obama administration has tried to address Islam carefully and to avoid blaming a religion with an estimated 1.6 billion adherents for terrorism. But we find Gingrich has greatly exaggerated what the Obama administration has done. Although the Justice Department clearly has yanked some questionable material related to Islam, and the recent White House document refers almost obliquely to Muslim Americans, it has not banned a discussion of al-Qaida or Islam in terrorism training.

pomt-14561	"I'm self-funding my own campaign."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/10/donald-trump/donald-trump-self-funding-his-campaign-sort/	President Donald Trump wouldn’t be beholden to special interests, he says. Why? Because billionaires aren’t paying for his campaign. "You know a lot of times you see these really dumb deals," he said of current political leaders at an Iowa rally Feb. 1. "And you'll say that's dumb. It doesn't make sense. But then when you think, it does make sense because these politicians are representing interests, whether it's a country or a company, where doing the stupid deals actually makes sense only for that politician and for that company or country." In contrast, Trump said, "I'm self-funding my own campaign. It's my money." Trump talks about self-funding his own campaign almost every day, it seems, so it’s about time we put it on the Truth-O-Meter. The fact is, Trump’s campaign isn’t 100 percent self-funded. He receives a significant amount of individual donations. But he does have a point that he puts up a lot of his own money, especially compared with other candidates (and that big-money donors are largely staying away). Contributions Trump’s campaign brought in about $19.4 million by the end of 2015. Trump contributed nearly $13 million of that himself. Most of the remainder comes from individual contributions, which federal law caps at $2,700 per candidate per election. Trump is contributing much, much more of his personal wealth than any other presidential contender. The only other candidates contributing to their own campaigns are: retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has so far reported contributing $25,000; former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton at $368,147; and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at $388,720. Although a significant portion of his campaign funds, about 34 percent, come from individual contributions, Trump doesn’t appear to be actively soliciting these donations with high-profile fundraising events. The Sunlight Foundation, which advocates for transparency in money in politics, tracks political fundraisers with its Political Party Time tool. It has no record of any events to benefit Trump. In contrast, Political Party Time has recorded more than 280 fundraisers for Clinton and more than 150 for Bush since the start of 2015. There is, though, a "donate" button on Trump’s website. Trump also has minimal political action committee support compared with his opponents. PACs have raised just $1.8 million on Trump’s behalf, which is the lowest among all candidates still in the race, with the exception of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, and Republican former Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore, whose PAC fundraising for both candidates remains at $0. Trump seems to be friendly with at least one PAC created in his honor. He attended a New York fundraiser hosted by the Make America Great Again PAC in July and said he’s grateful for their support, reported Politico. The group also received a $100,000 donation from the in-laws of Trump’s daughter Ivanka. The PAC shut down in October following allegations that it coordinated with Trump’s campaign. Big asterisks It’s worth noting a couple more caveats. First, Trump’s self-financing only really picked up in the last three months of 2015. From the start of his campaign in April through October last year, individual contributions made up about 67 percent of total money raised for his campaign. Other media outlets who looked at this claim before the most recent FEC filings concluded that Trump’s claim was inaccurate because, at the time, most of his funding was coming from individual contributions. But in the last quarter, Trump gave his campaign a $10.8 million loan, turning that balance around. That brings us to the second caveat: The vast majority of Trump’s contributions to his own campaign — about $12.6 million — are loans rather than donations. This means he could expect to eventually recoup these funds. Further, of the approximately $12 million Trump’s campaign spent in 2015, about $2.7 million went toward reimbursing Trump-affiliated companies for services provided to the campaign, such as traveling in his own plane and helicopter, according to a New York Times analysis. On whether Trump should describe his campaign as self-funded, given these caveats, it’s "sort of a judgment call," said Viveca Novak, editorial and communications director at the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks money in politics. "To me, it would be more accurate to say he was ‘partially self-funding,’ " Novak added. Trump’s claim is accurate in part, but it needs a big asterisk, said Richard Skinner, a policy analyst at the Sunlight Foundation. He added that all self-funders take at least some individual contributions, noting in particular former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney’s 2008 primary run. Romney provided about 44 percent of his campaign’s total funds raised, while about 56 percent came from individual donations. Rick Hasen, an expert in election and campaign finance law at the University of California Irvine, disagrees. "I don't think it is fair to say that a person is self-funding if a significant share of those contributions come from someone other than the candidate," he said. "Nor do I think a candidate who loans money to his campaign, but who expects to be paid back by the campaign, is fairly characterized as self-funding." It’s possible that Trump’s intent to self-fund his campaign could result in a president that feels less indebted to billionaires' special interests, as Trump claims, Skinner noted. But even if he isn’t taking their money, they still might have influence on Trump. "One critique of fundraising, it makes you spend a lot of time around very rich people, and Trump clearly already does that," Skinner said. Our ruling Trump said, "I'm self-funding my own campaign." As of the end of 2015, Trump’s own contributions account for more than half of all money the campaign has taken in. He’s contributed far more of his own money than any other candidate this cycle. However, a significant portion of his money comes from individual contributions. For several months last year, the campaign received far more dollars from potential voters than they did from Trump.

pomt-11186	"Thanks to the strong charter school reforms put in place while I was Senate President" the online charter school ECOT "was caught and is out of business."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2018/may/17/keith-faber/ohio-auditor-candidate-misleads-about-his-role-onl/	Investigations into the now-shuttered Electronic Classroom of Tomorrow, called ECOT, have roiled statewide elections in Ohio. The Columbus public online school launched in 2000, founded by software executive William Lager. By the end, nearly two decades later, the school received $1 billion from the state, and Lager, who once had financial problems, became a millionaire. Now politicians on both sides are spinning answers to key questions: Who is to blame for the online school bilking state taxpayers? Who gets credit for the school’s demise? The Ohio Department of Education is seeking to recoup $80 million from the school, while State Auditor Dave Yost referred his findings to state and federal prosecutors for potential criminal prosecution. State Rep. Keith Faber, the Republican candidate for state auditor, took some credit for the school shutting down. "Thanks to the strong charter school reforms put in place while I was Senate President and the diligent work of Auditor Yost and his staff, ECOT was caught and is out of business," he said in a May 11 statement to the press. Democrats pounced on Faber for taking credit. Faber’s Democratic opponent Zack Space tweeted: "Keith Faber’s complicity in this — perhaps the largest political scandal in Ohio history — should disqualify him from serving as Auditor, the top taxpayer watchdog in the State." Time for PolitiFact to weigh in: Is Faber accurate in claiming credit for ECOT shutting down? We found that when Faber was Senate president, the Legislature voted for a bill that included attendance rules for online schools in 2015. But the main reason the school shut down was a change in the type of student participation data that the state education department sought. And the department began seeking the data before the 2015 legislation passed. Faber points to House Bill 2 Faber’s spokeswoman Allison Dumski pointed to his role as Senate president in passing HB 2, a charter schools bill. The final version passed the Senate unanimously and the House overwhelmingly in October 2015. A provision added in the Senate required online schools to keep "an accurate record of each individual student's participation in learning opportunities each day." The bill said that the records must be kept in a manner that could easily be submitted to state officials. "ECOT was unable to provide these attendance records or comply with Ohio Department of Education's student count, requiring them to repay the state, which ultimately put them in financial distress and caused them to close," Dumski said. The passage of the bill drew praise from newspaper editorial boards and education advocates. But the bill essentially codified what the education department had already started. The wheels were already in motion for the state to seek millions from the school. Online school faced problems from the beginning For years, news reports showed the online charter school had problems with poor record keeping, high student turnover, suspicious attendance reports, poor performance outcomes and graduation rates, and inflated enrollment. State audits showed problems as early as 2001. While the school racked up troubling headlines, Lager (the school's founder) gave campaign donations, largely to Republicans. The Columbus Dispatch reported that Lager and other executives made $2.1 million in donations. The FBI is examining whether the company reimbursed employees for donations, the Dispatch found. (Faber announced in May that he would donate the approximately $36,000 he received to other schools.) By 2015, the state began to suspect that some schools were inflating their participation numbers. So it began to request actual log-in data for students. For ECOT, that meant trouble. The department found that for the 2015-16 school year, the online school could only account for 6,300 of its 15,300 claimed students. That eventually led the state to demand that the school repay $60 million, and later an additional $20 million for the next school year. The school argued that the department illegally changed its rules for counting students. But the courts have sided with the state. The school continues to appeal. In 2017, the state started withholding $2.5 million per month from the school. In January, the school’s sponsor, The Educational Service Center of Lake Erie West, cut off ties. Charter schools must have a sponsor to operate. About 12,000 students had to find new schools. Our ruling Faber said, "Thanks to the strong charter school reforms put in place while I was Senate President" the online charter school ECOT "was caught and is out of business." Faber was referring to House Bill 2, which passed in 2015 and required online schools to keep accurate and accessible attendance records. But Faber is overstating credit by hanging the demise of the school on that bill. The key change that led to the school shutting down was when the education department decided to require e-schools to provide student log-in data. This showed that that the school couldn’t account for many of its supposed students, leading the state to conclude the school owed $80 million. Faber doesn’t get credit for that. The only kernel of truth here is that the bill that passed under his leadership was another affirmation by the state that e-schools had to provide attendance data. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-13594	On the Iran nuclear deal	half flip	/florida/statements/2016/aug/17/tim-canova/did-debbie-wasserman-schultzs-opponent-tim-canova-/	The Iran nuclear deal has been a hot topic in the Democratic primary battle between U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and challenger Tim Canova. The South Florida district is heavily Jewish, and Israel has been skeptical of the deal. In a mailer, Canova sided with three Jewish members of Congress who voted against the deal. "In challenging times Israel needs true friends in Congress. When called on to protect Israel, some legislators step up," states the mailer, showing photos of U.S. Reps. Ted Deutch and Lois Frankel of Palm Beach County and Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York. "Others don’t. Debbie Wasserman Schultz waffled back and forth before voting for the Iran nuclear deal, choosing party and personal political ambition over principle." But how would Canova have voted on the deal? His answers haven’t been clear. In a debate on CBS4, host Jim DeFede asked Canova to clarify his position. We decided to look at Canova’s statements about the Iran deal and put them on our Flip-O-Meter, which examines a candidate’s record on a topic without casting a value judgment on any changes. We found that Canova hasn’t really changed position, but he hasn’t always provided full answers, either. (Canova isn’t Jewish, but his stepfather is Jewish, and Canova said he has spent time in Israel including living on a kibbutz, a communal living area. Wasserman Schultz was the first Jewish woman from Florida elected to Congress.) Canova’s statements about Iran nuclear deal In 2015, Iran and five other world powers reached a deal. The agreement aims to extend the time it would take for Iran to make a nuclear bomb, subjects some of Iran’s major nuclear facilities to constant monitoring and creates conditions for lifting economic sanctions against Iran. Wasserman Schultz announced she would support the deal, saying that it wasn’t perfect but that it "promotes the national security interests of the United States and our allies and merits." On his website, Canova doesn’t say how he would have voted; however, he says that he would not support scrapping it. "While I have criticized several deficiencies in the Iran nuclear deal (no international agreement is ever perfect), now that it has been entered into, I support its full implementation," he wrote. Canova has repeatedly outlined his criticisms of the deal, including that Iran "can simply mothball rather than destroy the centrifuges, thereby allowing them to restart a nuclear program for military use in the future." He also criticizes the inspection protocols and the relief of sanctions. Canova’s most complete statements about his position on the Iran deal stem came in an interview with the Sun Sentinel editorial board in August 2016. "I expressed reservations and criticism about the Iran agreement," Canova said. "Now that it has been adopted, I am for strict implementation." When interviewed by Sentinel reporter Anthony Man, Canova acknowledged that he had made some conflicting statements. Man: "You earlier this year said that you would have voted for it." Canova: "Oh, I’ve been quoted both ways." Man: "You told me you would have voted for it. Is that accurate?" Canova: "I’m not so sure that’s accurate. Look, I’m not going to sort of play that game. I don’t know exactly how I would have voted because I wasn’t sitting in the seat, but I do know I criticized some aspects of it." Man: "In January, you said the deal wasn’t perfect, but you would have voted for it under the circumstances. You don’t believe that anymore?" Canova: "I don’t know if I would have voted for it. ... In a conversation when you called me at home you caught me off guard, I was a candidate for about a week. Did I say that? Maybe. I honestly don’t know how I would have voted for it." Editorial page editor Rosemary O’Hara asked Canova, if the deal was on the table today, how he would have voted. Canova: "I don’t know. ... I’m not a member of Congress, I didn’t have any kind of briefings the way Debbie Wasserman Schultz did, so I don’t think it's fair for me to say I would have voted for it, (or) I would have voted against it. I don’t know." In a debate on CBS4’s Facing South Florida on Aug. 14, host Jim DeFede asked Canova if he would have voted for or against the agreement. "When the question is asked as a hypothetical -- would I have seen classified information -- that’s when I have said who knows," Canova said. "But quite frankly I can say right here that was not a good agreement for a couple reasons. First of all, Iran is the biggest funder of Hezbollah and Hamas, (and) to release $100 billion in assets (to Iran) right away without doing it incrementally is what I found to be dangerous and unsettling. And quite frankly, my position is the same as dozens of other Democrats who voted against the agreement." We looked for other statements Canova made about his own position on the Iran deal. "She voted for the Iran deal, and I’m against the agreement," he told The Forward in July. Richard Bell, Canova’s campaign manager, told PolitiFact Florida that The Forward doesn’t fully explain his position. On Aug. 1, according to the Times of Israel, Canova told the Sunny Isles Beach Democratic Club: "I was critical of the Iran agreement. How would I have voted? I can’t tell you, I wasn’t a member of Congress." Bell told PolitiFact Florida that Canova’s position on the Iran nuclear agreement has been consistent. "He is critical of specific aspects of the Iran deal," Bell said. "Now that it’s been adopted, he is for its full and strict implementation." We agree that Canova has been consistent in his criticisms and in bashing Wasserman Schultz for supporting the deal. Our ruling Canova has acknowledged that he has "been quoted both ways" on how he would have voted the Iran deal. He said in January that he would have voted for it, but later in the campaign said multiple times that he didn’t know how he would have voted. He sent a mailer that didn’t say how he would have voted but sided with opponents. He has been consistent in criticizing the specifics of the deal and in criticizing Wasserman Schultz for her support for it. Because Canova’s position on the Iran deal has been unclear at different times, we give him a Half Flip. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2064790e-a998-485a-b7a8-3c25ab8b2d22	None	Tim Canova	None	None	None	2016-08-17T10:00:00	2016-08-11	['Iran']

Here's what it says: "The policy of Arkansas is to protect the life of every unborn child from conception until birth, to the extent permitted by the federal Constitution." Huckabee's statement that the amendment says "everything in the world possible" must be done to protect the unborn is pretty sharply limited by the phrase "to the extent permitted by the federal Constitution." At the moment, the Roe v. Wade decision means the federal Constitution permits abortion. It also is a slight overstatement to say the Arkansas amendment declares a belief that life begins at conception, though that certainly is implied. We also would note that he got the amendment number wrong. It is Amendment 68 that deals with abortion. Amendment 65 deals with revenue bonds.

pomt-09167	"We now actually import more oil than we did before 9/11."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/07/john-kerry/kerry-says-us-imports-more-oil-now-911/	During a June 6, 2010, appearance on ABC's This Week, Sen. John Kerry -- who is sponsoring a comprehensive energy bill -- discussed the nation's energy future against the backdrop of the ongoing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. During an interview with host Jake Tapper, Kerry said, "Here's what's important -- not to be throwing the blame around, but to put America on the course to true energy independence and self-reliance and to begin to wean ourselves from our addiction to oil. ... The United States is losing a major economic transformational moment. Until we begin to do something -- you know, since 9/11, we now actually import more oil than we did before 9/11. It's insulting to common sense." We decided to check whether Kerry was correct about whether the United States imports more oil today than it did before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. The answer is complicated, because there are at least three possible ways to measure it. • The number of barrels of crude oil imported. The U.S. imported 3.32 billion barrels of crude oil in 2000 and 3.40 billion barrels in 2001. Both figures were higher than the number imported in 2009 -- 3.31 billion barrels. By this measure, Kerry is incorrect, although just slightly. • Imported crude oil compared to domestic production. We wondered whether imported crude oil was still increasing as a percentage of all oil in the U.S., even as it dropped in absolute amounts. In fact, that's exactly what happened. In 2000, oil imports accounted for 61 percent of the total of imports and domestic production, and in 2001, imports accounted for 62 percent. In 2009, the percentage of imports was 63 percent -- slightly higher than it was in either of those years. The underlying cause was that domestic oil production declined between the start of the decade and the end. By this measure, Kerry is correct, though once again, the difference is modest. • Imported crude oil plus imported unfinished oils. William Brown, who analyzes energy data for the federal government's Energy Information Administration, told PolitiFact that in recent years, there's been a rise in imports of unfinished oils, which are partially refined, taking the place of pure crude oil imports. So he sent us data that combined those two sets of imports. In 2000, the combination of crude oil and unfinished oils accounted for 9.54 million barrels per day, and in 2001, they accounted for 9.71 million barrels per day. In 2009, that figure was 9.86 million barrels per day. Adding in unfinished oils to the previous measure of crude oil turns an incorrect statement into a correct one. Bottom line: There are three ways to analyze the question, and with two of them, Kerry is right that imports have grown. Using the other statistic, he's wrong -- imports have declined. So we rate Kerry's statement Mostly True.	None	John Kerry	None	None	None	2010-06-07T15:00:50	2010-06-06	['None']
pomt-10980	"The servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC" are "missing."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/16/donald-trump/missing-servers-donald-trump-vladimir-putin/	Standing beside Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump answered reporters' questions about Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and if he believed Putin’s denials over his own intelligence community’s findings. Instead of answering the question directly, Trump began discussing servers. "You have groups that are wondering why the FBI never took the server -- haven't they taken the server. Why was the FBI told to leave the office of the Democratic National Committee? I've been wondering that, I've been asking that for months and months and I've been tweeting it out and calling it out on social media. Where is the server? I want to know where is the server and what is the server saying? "With that being said, all I can do is ask the question. My people came to me, Dan Coats came to me and some others, they said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin; he just said it's not Russia. I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be. But I really do want to see the server." Moments later, Trump added, "What happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC? Where are those servers? They're missing; where are they?" Trump's rhetorical question gets the details wrong. You could take Trump's words to mean a DNC server has gone missing, but that's not true. And as for the "Pakistani gentleman," Trump is referring to a House IT staffer who did not work for the DNC and who government investigators concluded did not steal or leak computer data. The DNC server On July 13, the Justice Department charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Hillary Clinton campaign staffers. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s indictment confirms previous findings from the U.S. intelligence community. In April 2016, Russian intelligence officials installed spying software on the computer network of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect members of the U.S. House of Representatives. The hack in turn allowed them access to 33 Democratic National Committee computers. The emails obtained through the hack were pushed out on social media beginning in June 2016, and Wikileaks soon joined that effort. At some point, the FBI and DNC started working together to fight the hack and investigate how it happened, but DNC was slow to react to the FBI’s initial warning that their server had been compromised. During former FBI director James Comey’s testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, Comey was asked whether the FBI had ever received the DNC’s hacked hardware. He said they did not, but obtained access from a review of the system performed by CrowdStrike, a third-party cybersecurity firm. "We got the forensics from the pros that they hired which -- again, best practice is always to get access to the machines themselves, but this, my folks tell me, was an appropriate substitute," Comey said. DNC spokeswoman Adrienne Watson told PolitiFact that the DNC cooperated with the FBI’s requests, which resulted in the DNC providing a copy of their server. "An image of a server is the best thing to use in an investigation so that your exploration of the server does not change the evidence (just like you don’t want investigators leaving their own DNA around a physical crime scene) and so that the bad actors cannot make changes to the evidence while you are looking at it," Watson said. "Any suggestion that they were denied access to what they wanted for their investigation is completely incorrect." We found no indication that the FBI had renewed their request to gain access to the actual server, or that investigating the server copy would have prevented the FBI from tracking down the culprits. (The FBI declined to comment.) Imran Awan Trump said, "What happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC?" Trump was likely referring to Imran Awan who worked in information technology for dozens of Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives, including U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former chair of the Democratic National Committee. Trump previously referred to Awan as the "Pakistani mystery man." Trump is wrong, though, that Awan "worked on the DNC." The national committee is a separate group from the House members. Awan’s lawyer Christopher Gowen, as well as the DNC spokeswoman, told PolitiFact that Awan never worked for the DNC. Awan, who emigrated from Pakistan as a youth, has been a U.S. citizen since 2004. "The government that Donald Trump is the president of has had the server from the very, very beginning of the investigation," Gowen said, referring to the server maintained by Awan and accessed by House Democrats, and a server all together different than the one hacked into atthe DNC. Gowen said the server was a portal that Democratic members could access when working remotely. He said it has been in possession of the FBI and the Capitol Police since the first allegations were made in the case and has nothing to do with the DNC. Awan was arrested for bank fraud in July after he identified on a home loan application that a property was a primary residence when in fact it was a rental property. Trump was parroting news reports led by the Daily Caller about Awan. Conservative media accounts suggested that Awan might have played a role in the election hacking of the DNC, although the U.S. intelligence community has concluded that the Russian government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations. Ultimately, Awan was charged with a minor offense unrelated to his job. In a July 3 plea agreement, Awan agreed to plead guilty to making a false statement on a loan application. The government engaged in a "thorough investigation" that included taking custody of the House Democratic server and found no evidence of wrongdoing related to his House IT job, the government stated in the plea agreement signed by U.S Attorney’s Office. "The government has found no evidence that your client illegally removed House data from the House network or from House Members' offices, stole the House Democratic Caucus Server, stole or destroyed House information technology equipment, or improperly accessed or transferred government information, including classified or sensitive information," said the plea agreement signed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Awan will be sentenced Aug. 21. Sentencing guidelines call for zero to six months in jail, but prosecutors agreed not to oppose a sentence of only probation. Our ruling Trump said, "The servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC" are "missing." The DNC servers were never missing. The DNC provided the FBI with a copy of their server, rather than the original hardware, but Comey testified that the evidence was an appropriate substitute. Awan, the "Pakistani gentleman" in the news, never worked for the DNC. Conservative news outlets suggested he had stolen a House Democratic server, but the U.S. Attorney’s Office found no evidence of such theft. We rate this statement False.

pomt-14943	"German citizens were disarmed by their government in the late 1930s," which allowed the Nazis to "carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/26/ben-carson/fact-checking-ben-carson-nazi-guns/	Republican Ben Carson has been criticized for suggesting that gun control enabled the rise of the Nazis and led to the extermination of 6 million Jews during the Holocaust. But does he have a point? In his book, A More Perfect Union, Carson wrote that "German citizens were disarmed by their government in the late 1930s, and by the mid-1940s Hitler's regime had mercilessly slaughtered six million Jews and numerous others whom they considered inferior. "Through a combination of removing guns and disseminating deceitful propaganda, the Nazis were able to carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance," he wrote. Carson reiterated that argument at least twice -- in an Oct. 8, 2015, interview with CNN host Wolf Blitzer, and then again in a speech at the National Press Club. "You know, mid- to late-30s, they started a program to disarm the people and by mid- to late 40's, look what had happened," he said at the Press Club. PolitiFact decided to analyze Carson’s claim on its Truth-O-Meter. German gun laws As the Nazi Party rose to power in Germany, it inherited a 1928 gun registration law that had replaced a total ban on gun ownership imposed on a defeated Germany after World War I. The 1928 law created a permit system to own and sell firearms and ammunition. "But this order was followed quite rarely, so that largely, only newly bought weapons became registered," said Dagmar Ellerbrock, an expert on German gun policies at the Dresden Technical University. "At that time, most men, and many women, still owned the weapons they acquired before or during the first World War." When they came to power, the Nazis used whatever gun records they had to seize weapons from their enemies, but Ellerbock told us the files included very few of the firearms in circulation. "In my records, I found many Jews who well into the late 1930s possessed guns," Ellerbock told us. The Nazis adopted a new gun law in 1938. According to an analysis by Bernard Harcourt, a professor at Columbia University School of Law, it loosened gun ownership rules in several ways. It deregulated the buying and selling of rifles, shotguns and ammunition. It made handguns easier to own by allowing anyone with a hunting license to buy, sell or carry one at any time. (You didn’t need to be hunting.) It also extended the permit period from one year to three and gave local officials more discretion in letting people under 18 get a gun. The regulations to implement this law, rather than the law itself, did impose new limits on one group: Jews. On Nov. 11, 1938, the German minister of the interior issued "Regulations Against Jews Possession of Weapons." Not only were Jews forbidden to own guns and ammunition, they couldn’t own "truncheons or stabbing weapons." In addition to the restrictions, Ellerbrock said the Nazis had already been raiding Jewish homes and seizing weapons. "The gun policy of the Nazis can hardly be compared to the democratic procedures of gun regulations by law," Ellerbrock told us. "It was a kind of special administrative practice (Sonderrecht), which treated people in different ways according to their political opinion or according to ‘racial identity’ in Nazi terms." The power of a police state In short, Nazi-era Germany imposed greater gun restrictions for Jews (and other perceived enemies) at the same time it loosened gun restrictions for other groups. But that’s not what Carson said. He made a more sweeping claim about Nazis disarming German citizens. Carson then goes on to say that the lack of guns allowed the Nazis to "carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance." But a key turning point in the Nazi path to power illustrates that the availability of guns was not a pivotal issue. Paramilitary organizations were part of the Nazi operation from its earliest days in the mid 1920s. The Sturmabteilung, or Brownshirts, was a founding Nazi street fighting organization. Another outfit, the Schutzstaffel, or SS, provided protection to Nazi officials as they moved about the country. After Hitler won office, the SS under Heinrich Himmler became part of Hitler's inner circle, and Himmler felt the Sturmabteilung was too difficult to control. He and his collaborators concocted a rumor that the Sturmabteilung was plotting a coup. In 1934, in a span of three days, Himmler’s SS units killed between 85 and 200 Sturmabteilung leaders and other perceived enemies. Hitler himself oversaw the arrest of one of his oldest comrades, Ernst Roehm, the head of the Sturmabteilung. In the middle of that arrest, a truckload of armed Sturmabteilung troops rolled up, but not a shot was fired. Roehm was executed days later. The staff at the German Historical Institute wrote that with this operation, Hitler had managed to "legitimize outright murder on a large scale – without any legal proceedings whatsoever – and that the country largely accepted the Nazi propaganda that presented this strike as necessary." Our ruling Carson said that under the Nazis, "German citizens were disarmed by their government in the late 1930s," which allowed the Nazis to "carry out their evil intentions with relatively little resistance." This is a misreading of history on two levels. First, German citizens as a whole were not disarmed by the Nazis. Jews and other supposed enemies of the state were subject to having their weapons seized. But for most German citizens, the Nazi period was one in which gun regulations were loosened, not tightened. Second, a lack of guns was not the issue. If the majority of Germans had wanted to use these guns to fight the Nazis, they could have. But they didn’t. Carson ignores that the Nazis enjoyed significant popular support, or at least, broad acquiescence. We rate this claim False.	None	Ben Carson	None	None	None	2015-10-26T12:39:42	2015-10-09	['Germany']
pomt-09299	Says he said last year there's "absolutely no reason" for Texas to secede.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2010/apr/22/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-recaps-his-comment-texas-seceding-u/	Last week marked the anniversary of Gov. Rick Perry’s oft-quoted Texas-can-secede comments after a tea-party rally outside Austin’s city hall. Coincidentally, the Texas Tribune and Newsweek interviewed Perry in his Capitol office on April 15 and the opening back and forth between editor Evan Smith and Perry touched on what the governor said about secession the year before. "I always like to try to clear that up," Perry tells Smith. "It was asked as a, you know, what do you think about the people who shout out the word 'secede.' And I say that we live in an incredibly wonderful country and I see absolutely no reason for that to ever happen…" We wondered if Perry accurately recaptured his 2009 remarks. Perry's office didn't respond to our inquiry. Next, we turned to the original exchange as recorded by Kelley Shannon, Austin correspondent for the Associated Press. She spoke to him shortly after Perry spoke at the rally. (The audio and a transcript are fetchable from the "About this statement" section of this article, to the right.) According to the recording, Shannon initially asked if he thought the gathering reflected a national movement. Perry answered that it could be and that people feel strangled by spending and taxation; they want help. Shannon then asked Perry about some associating him with the idea of secession or sovereignty for Texas. Perry gave a 40-second reply, which we transcribed and provide here. "Oh, I think there’s a lot of different scenarios," Perry said. "Texas is a unique place. When we came in the union in 1845, one of the issues was that we would be able to leave if we decided to do that. "You know, my hope is that America and Washington in particular pays attention. We’ve got a great union. There is absolutely no reason to dissolve it. But if Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people, you know, who knows what may come out of that? So. But Texas is a very unique place and we’re a pretty independent lot to boot." Perry next fielded a question from someone else about whether Texas might now be considered a natural terorrist state — no, Perry said — and the less than three-minute question-and-answer period ended. At the time, Perry’s comments were widely interpreted as indicating the Republican governor believed secession could legally occur; he subsequently did not back down from that conclusion. However, a constitutional expert advised at the time that the Civil War long ago vanquished secession as a legal option. Sanford Levinson, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said within the Texas Constitution, the U.S. Constitution and the Joint Resolution Annexing Texas to the United States of 1845, there is no explicit right for the state to return to its days as a Republic. Levinson said there is "no possibility whatsoever that the United States or any court would recognize a 'right' to secede." Levinson noted that the 1845 resolution allows for Texas to break into five new states, and it doesn’t specify whether that would require congressional approval. But, he said, that's distinct from secession. In looking back at his 2009 comments, Perry told Smith that at the time he was focusing on economics -- "people’s concern and anger about what this administration is doing from an economic standpoint in particular and the long-term debt that was being created for not only them but for future generations." All in all, does Perry accurately revisit his original comments on secession that day? For the most part, yes. However Perry doesn't get to his assertion that Texas has the right to secede or his speculation about "who knows what may come" from people angry about actions in Washington. We rate Perry’s statement as Mostly True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2010-04-22T11:36:12	2010-04-15	['Texas']
pomt-11316	"Here are the facts: there is no massive wave of migrants pouring into California. Overall immigrant apprehensions on the border last year were as low as they’ve been in nearly 50 years (and 85 percent of the apprehensions occurred outside of California)."	true	/california/statements/2018/apr/13/jerry-brown/jerry-brown-says-theres-no-massive-wave-migrants-p/	Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown recently agreed to President Donald Trump’s request to deploy California National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, though with several caveats. Brown, for example, said state troops "will not be enforcing federal immigration laws," but will instead support operations targeting transnational criminal gangs and human traffickers. The governor said he’ll accept federal money for 400 troops, some of which would be sent to the border. Trump made the request as part of his stated effort to "seal up" the border and prevent illegal crossings. "I will not rest until we have secured our borders and restored the rule of law!" the president tweeted on April 9, 2018. White House officials have called recent border crossing figures "alarming." But in a letter to the Trump administration two days later, Brown attempted to set the record straight about what he says is really happening along California’s border with Mexico. "Here are the facts: there is no massive wave of migrants pouring into California. Overall immigrant apprehensions on the border last year were as low as they’ve been in nearly 50 years (and 85 percent of the apprehensions occurred outside of California)." With claims about border crossings boomeranging from Sacramento to Washington D.C., we decided to scrutinize the governor’s statement in a fact check. In this Sept. 15, 2015, file photo, a farmer passes along a borer fence that divides his property, Tuesday, in Mission, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) Our research To support it, the governor’s spokesman cited U.S. Border Patrol figures for apprehensions across California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. The data is from 1960 through 2017. For 2017, they show 303,916 arrests across the entire Southern border. The previous low was 263,991 in 1971, 46 years ago. So, Brown’s claim that apprehensions in 2017 were "as low as they’ve been in nearly 50 years" is on the mark. He’s also right that 85 percent of these took place "outside California." About 68 percent of the arrests took place in Texas and New Mexico, while Arizona accounted for 17 percent and California about 15 percent, according to a review of the border patrol figures. "He is absolutely correct," said Ev Meade, director of the Trans Border Institute at the University of San Diego. "Even as we’re at an historic low borderwide, it’s particularly low in California. We’re not receiving large numbers of migrants. Those migrants who are coming are largely crossing the Rio Grande and are apprehended at border patrol stations in Texas." Meade said the overall trend on the Southern border shows a dramatic decrease in apprehensions. "In the year 2000, the border patrol apprehended 1.6 million people (borderwide). For 2017, it was down to 300,000. It’s a tiny fraction," he said. Just along California’s border, nearly 390,000 people were arrested in 2000. By 2017, that number had dropped to less than 45,000, border patrol figures show. SOURCE: Trans Border Institute, University of San Diego Wave of migrants? While the governor’s numbers are right, do they prove the first part of his claim: "There is no massive wave of migrants pouring into California?" Given the context of the letter, Brown is clearly referring to migrants crossing into the state across the border with Mexico. But what about the other ways people enter the state? Joseph Hayes, a research associate at the Public Policy Institute of California, pointed out that border arrests aren’t necessarily the best metric to evaluate migration to California. Much of the nation’s and state’s undocumented population results from individuals overstaying visas. In a 2017 report, the Center For Migration Studies found that two-thirds of those who arrived in the United States in 2014 and later would be counted as undocumented were admitted on temporary visas "and then overstayed their period of admission or otherwise violated the terms of their visas." Still, Hayes said, the overall number of people living illegally in California has declined since before the Great Recession. The state was home to approximately 3 million undocumented residents in 2007, a figure that’s dropped to as low as 2.35 million, according to estimates reviewed by PPIC. The decline in the state’s undocumented population reinforces Brown’s contention there’s "no massive wave of migrants pouring into California." Historically, Meade added, thousands of seasonal migrant farmworkers have come to California through the border with Mexico. He said that seasonal migration has largely "dried up" in recent years and many undocumented farmworkers now stay in the state year-round, rather than crossing back into Mexico. "International migration has become more difficult," he said, citing greater border enforcement. 2018 spike in crossings Brown cited figures from 2017. But what about the 200 percent spike in apprehensions borderwide in March 2018 compared with the same month a year ago, as cited this week by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen? Meade, of the Trans Border Institute, said the 2018 increase should be considered in context. It follows the historically low number of 2017 arrests, which has been attributed, in part, to fewer people trying to illegally cross the border due to Trump’s election and hard-line immigration stance. Immigration experts have also cited the Obama administration’s aggressive deportation efforts and greater economic opportunities in Mexico for recent declines in border crossings. Meade also noted the 2018 increase took place during spring, the high-point of migration season. He said it doesn’t represent a long-term trend. Nor does it show California is experiencing a disproportionate share of the 2018 increase, he said. "Unless this were to continue for months and months and months and break the seasonal pattern, I don’t think there’s any real way to claim (the early part of 2018) is a crisis." Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown claimed in a recent letter to the Trump administration: "there is no massive wave of migrants pouring into California. Overall immigrant apprehensions on the border last year were as low as they’ve been in nearly 50 years (and 85 percent of the apprehensions occurred outside of California)." U.S. Border Patrol data show Brown got his arrest figures right. Researchers point out that illegal border crossings account for only one portion of the migrants that arrive in California. Others come to the state legally on visas which they later overstay. But given the context of Brown’s letter, it’s clear the governor was referring to the lack of a wave of migrants coming illegally across the Southern border. That part of the claim is also backed up by the border patrol data and two immigration experts. We rate Brown’s claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

pomt-15247	Caution: Kissing and cuddling chickens can be hazardous to your health.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/aug/04/centers-disease-control/cdc-kissing-and-cuddling-backyard-chickens-linked-/	Raising backyard chickens has been satisfying some foodies’ affection for the uber-local egg and lower-fat meat in urban areas, including metro Atlanta, for about a decade. Now the Centers for Disease Control is warning of a downside to the popular trend: salmonella outbreaks traced to some backyard owners kissing and cuddling their flocks. The CDC findings drew some media attention last month, and a PolitiFact reader who heard the health alert on NPR’s "Morning Edition" on July 16 asked us to dig deeper. We went directly to the source, the CDC, which is headquartered in Atlanta and has been investigating four recent Salmonella outbreaks that, as of July 29, had infected 218 people in 41 states. Five of them were in Georgia, 19 were in Alabama, 5 were in North Carolina, 11 were in South Carolina and 6 were in Tennessee. Fifty of the 218 people have required hospitalization for Salmonella, the major symptoms of which are usually diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain. No deaths have been reported, CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said. So how exactly do CDC officials know that some of these cases are due to backyard breeders kissing and cuddling live poultry? Dr. Megin Nichols, a veterinarian with the CDC, told PolitiFact the agency has been tracking upward trends in both the number of outbreaks and people infected in the past five years and has been working to trace their causes. "We’ve been trying to interview these people to find out how they are getting sick," Nichols said. "We are finding a certain proportion that are due to very close contact -- something that surprised us here at the CDC." Salmonella is a germ that lives naturally in the intestine of chickens, ducks and many other animals. It doesn’t typically make the birds sick, but they can transmit the germs in their droppings and on their feet, feathers and beaks, even when they look clean and healthy, the CDC says. The germs also can get on their cages, coops, feed, water dishes, hay, plants and the area where they live and roam. In addition, the bacteria can rest on the hands, shoes and clothes of those who work around the birds or play with them. And Nichols told us that among the people who became ill between 2008 and 2014 due to baby poultry exposure, 49 percent, or 196 out of 400, reported snuggling and holding baby birds. Another 13 percent, or about 53, reported kissing baby birds, she said. Those people, many of whom were young children, became sick through fecal oral contact, Nichols said. Those same interviews also showed that about 46 percent of backyard breeders are keeping live poultry in their homes, she said. Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback findings have linked the most recent four outbreaks of human Salmonella infections to contact with chicks, ducklings, and other live poultry from multiple hatcheries. Interviews have been conducted with 140 of those who were recently ill and, 117, or 84 percent, reported contact with live poultry in the week before their illness began, according to the CDC website. Additional interviews to determine whether that contact included snuggling and kissing have yet to be conducted, Nichols said. An increasing number of people around the country are choosing to keep live poultry - mostly chickens, ducks, turkeys and geese as part of a greener, healthier lifestyle. Local governments, including several in metro Atlanta, have changed their zoning ordinances in recent years to accommodate the trend, and groups of backyard poultry buffs meet regularly in the region to talk chicken. Backyard owners have told reporters at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the benefits include fresh eggs and meat, a built-in source of fertilizer for their gardens and ready-made bug-killers. Some say they give their chickens names, the freedom to roam the house and yard and cuddle and coddle them like family pets. The larger problem According to the CDC, salmonella, named for an American scientist who discovered the bacteria, is estimated to cause a million illnesses in the United States a year, with 19,000 hospitalizations and 380 deaths. Most people develop diarrhea and the other conditions within 12 to 72 hour after infection and recover without treatment in four to seven days. It has the potential to turn deadly if it spreads from the intestines to the bloodstream, and then to other body sites. Prompt treatment with antibiotics is critical, and the elderly, infants, and people with impaired immune systems are more likely to have a severe illness. In the largest recent outbreak, which occurred between March 2013 and July 2014, more than 600 people in 29 states and Puerto Rico were infected with seven outbreak strains. The outbreak was associated with one brand of chicken, which led to a company recall of more than 40,000 pounds of chicken products, according to the CDC. To prevent salmonella infections related to backyard farming, the CDC’s Nichols encourages several common-sense rules. These include thorough handwashing after contact with the chicken, keeping live poultry out of the home, and avoiding snuggling, close contact with the birds’ beaks or other close exposure that would allow ingestion of bacteria. She will be one of the experts featured in a webinar on the topic of practicing backyard bird biosecurity at 7p.m. Thursday. Our conclusion The CDC has issued a warning against kissing or snuggling backyard chickens. It follows four recent Salmonella outbreaks that, as of July 29, had infected 218 people in 41 states. Five of them were in Georgia. Interviews have been conducted with 140 of the ill and 117, or 84 percent, reported contact with live poultry in the week before their illness began, according to the CDC website. The CDC also has evidence from outbreaks between 2008 to 2014. In that period, they found that of the people who became infected with salmonella due to baby poultry exposure, 49 percent, or 196 out of 400 people, reported snuggling and holding baby birds. Another 13 percent, or about 53, reported kissing baby birds.. That’s cause to sound the alarm. We rate the CDC warning True.

pomt-09542	Some Republicans who voted against the stimulus "have been all too happy to claim credit for Recovery Act projects and the jobs those projects have produced. They come to the ribbon cuttings."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/05/barack-obama/obama-criticizes-republicans-who-opposed-stimulus-/	Twice recently, President Barack Obama has slammed congressional Republicans for voting against his economic stimulus bill in February 2009 but later touting provisions of the bill that benefited their own constituents. During his Jan. 29, 2010, question-and-answer session with House Republican lawmakers in Baltimore, Obama brought up the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, as the stimulus is officially known: "There was an interesting headline in CNN today: 'Americans disapprove of stimulus, but like every policy in it.' And there was a poll that showed that if you broke it down into its component parts, 80 percent approved of the tax cuts, 80 percent approved of the infrastructure, 80 percent approved of the assistance to the unemployed. Well, that's what the Recovery Act was. And let's face it, some of you have been at the ribbon-cuttings for some of these important projects in your communities." Then, on Feb. 2, 2010, Obama riffed on the same theme during a town hall event in New Hampshire: "I have to point out, though, that some of the very same folks in Congress who opposed the Recovery Act -- and claim that it hasn’t worked -- have been all too happy to claim credit for Recovery Act projects and the jobs those projects have produced. (Applause.) They come to the ribbon-cuttings and ... (laughter). They found a way to have their cake and vote against it, too. (Laughter.)" We decided that a claim that bold, repeated in two high-profile events within a week's time, was worth a fact-check. As it turns out, we found several cases in which lawmakers voted against the measure but later claimed credit for provisions or projects stemming from the stimulus bill. -- Rep. Don Young of Alaska. Young, who has served in Congress since 1973, sent out two press releases on Feb. 13, 2009, the day the House passed the final version of the stimulus bill. One was headlined, "Rep. Young Votes NO On Democrats’ Massive Spending Bill." It quotes Young saying, "This bill was not a stimulus bill, it was a vehicle for pet projects, and that’s wrong." Young's second release of the day was headlined, "Rep. Young Wins Victory For Alaska Small Business." It explains how Young, after lobbying by the Alaska Federation of Natives, targeted a provision from the stimulus bill that would have required competitive bidding for stimulus grants and contracts. The Alaska Natives group said the provision could have hurt its members' ability to benefit from Small Business Administration programs. Young, the release said, "worked with Members on the other side of the aisle to make the case for these programs, and was able to get the provision pulled from the bill." In the release, Young said that “no matter if I supported this bill or not, I would make sure [Alaska Natives] were not hurt by it." -- Rep. Geoff Davis of Kentucky. Davis, a three-term congressman, issued a news release on Jan. 28, 2009, the day of the first House vote on the stimulus, in which he was quoted saying that "this so-called ‘stimulus’ legislation is full of pet spending projects that will do very little to restore confidence in our economy or create jobs." But 11 months later, on Dec. 16, 2009, Davis sent out a release announcing the awarding of a $1 million-plus grant for the Carroll County School District. "Congressman Geoff Davis is pleased to announce that the Carroll County School District has been awarded $1,044,140 in funding through the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA) Early Head Start Expansion Program," the release stated. It goes on to say, "In these difficult economic times, it is critical to ensure that vulnerable populations in Kentucky have access to important support services like those provided by the Early Head Start program. This important grant will allow Carroll County School District to expand their ability to provide needed assistance to local low-income families and children. I am very proud of the work that the Carroll County School District is doing to strengthen their community, and I am pleased that our office was able to assist them in obtaining these funds.” As it happened, on the very same day, Davis sent out a separate release in which he referred to the "failed trillion-dollar 'stimulus' bill." -- Rep. Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania. Shuster, elected in 2001, is a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee. During the stimulus debate, he advocated for targeting the measure more directly toward infrastructure spending. A Jan. 28, 2009, news release from his office said that "President Obama told the American people that he would stimulate our economy by rejuvenating our infrastructure. As a longtime advocate of improving our nation’s infrastructure, Shuster was encouraged by this announcement. Unfortunately, the Democrats in Congress, led by Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi, squandered this historic opportunity to create jobs and strengthen the backbone of our economy in order to fund 40 years of pent-up liberal pet projects." In November, the Blairsville (Pa.) Dispatch reported that Shuster attended a ceremonial groundbreaking for a new facility at a sewage treatment plant in Blairsville. According to the newspaper, the $12.1 million project was funded in part by federal stimulus money. -- Rep. Phil Gingrey of Georgia. In a Feb. 13, 2009, news release, Gingrey, a four-term congressman, explained his vote by saying that "this ‘stimulus’ bill only perpetuates the dangerous myth that government spending will fix this economy. ... The truth is government spending will only bury future generations in more debt." In October, a photograph in the Cedartown (Ga.) Standard showed Gingrey handing over a giant, ceremonial check for $625,000 in stimulus money to municipal leaders. The money was to pay for "new sidewalks, landscaping and other improvements to the downtown area," according to the newspaper. A Gingrey spokeswoman told the Standard that because the project qualified for federal stimulus funds as "shovel-ready," Gingrey "presented the proposal at the federal level." City commissioner Scott Tillery described Gingrey to the newspaper as "our point man when we need action from the federal government. His staff is always interested and involved in local concerns, and the congressman will use his influence to make a case for his constituents." -- Sen. Richard Burr of North Carolina. Burr voted against the stimulus yet appeared in person to present a $2 million-plus stimulus grant to help build a fire station to house the Bethlehem Community Volunteer Fire Department. "This is a great thing for this county," Burr said, according to the Hickory (N.C.) Daily Record. "We're not accustomed to federal dollars in that magnitude finding their way to North Carolina." A spokesman for Burr told the Associated Press in October that he wasn't taking credit for the money. "Sen. Burr was invited to the grant presentation by the Alexander County commissioners and was happy to be there to recognize the community and the fire department for their work in securing this highly competitive grant,'' the spokesman said. In an interview with Politico, Burr added, “Just because I voted against the stimulus doesn’t mean I shouldn’t recognize the merit achievement of an entity.” None of the four House members cited above responded to a query from PolitiFact. But the spokesman for one senior Republican lawmaker -- House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia -- did return our call. He argued that the Democratic criticism is overblown. Cantor, a leading stimulus opponent, has taken heat from Democrats for organizing a job fair whose participating employers benefited from stimulus funding, as well as for helping local officials lobby for stimulus money to support a high-speed rail link between Washington, D.C., and Richmond, Va. Brad Dayspring, Cantor's spokesman, defended both efforts, saying that, in the first case, the congressman was simply trying to help his unemployed constituents get back to work, and, in the second case, he was continuing his longstanding efforts to boost high-speed rail. Cantor's advocacy on the rail issue dates back a decade, to his tenure in the Virginia legislature. On the broader question of why Cantor opted not to support the bill, Dayspring said that the congressman made his decision based on his opposition to the vast majority of the bill's provisions. "The bill was so flawed, he voted against it despite his overwhelming support" for the rail provision, Dayspring said. "If you support 1 percent of a bill and oppose 99 percent, are you expected to vote for it?" Let's return to Obama's claim. The president said that Republicans who voted against the stimulus "have been all too happy to claim credit for Recovery Act projects and the jobs those projects have produced." We found at least two lawmakers -- Young and Davis -- who aggressively criticized the stimulus bill yet sent out a news release touting their own role in helping constituents benefit from the bill. In the meantime, Obama also said that some opponents of the stimulus have "come to the ribbon cuttings" for projects funded by the bill. Shuster, Gingrey and Burr clearly attended such ceremonies. To us, five clear cases are enough to validate the president's assertion that some stimulus opponents have "found a way to have their cake and vote against it, too." We rate Obama's statement True.

pomt-06998	By the end of his first term, President Obama will have added as much debt as all the prior 43 presidents combined.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/10/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-will-add-more-debt-4/	At a roundtable of small business leaders in Salem, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney was asked what he would do about the corporate tax rate, whether he would cut government spending or raise taxes and whether it was possible to do both. Romney said he had a plan to lower the corporate tax rate but noted the nation's huge debt. "What I would like to do is bring the tax rate down and eliminate some of the special breaks that go to the big businesses that have found ways to take advantage of loopholes," Romney said. "So, I’d take that corporate tax rate down at least from 35 down to 25 percent. Then we can talk about where we can go from there. I’d like to get it a lot lower, but what I don’t want to do is add to the deficit. I don’t want to come back with a tax rate so low that we end up seeing our deficit go shooting up, because what we don’t want to have happen is the circumstance where we have larger and larger deficits. "I mean, this president is on track to have added so much debt to this country, that by the end of his first term, he will have added as much debt as all the prior presidents of this country combined. Think of that. I don’t want to do what he’s done, but I do believe we need to bring the corporate tax rate down, close special deals and loopholes to help finance that and encourage investment and growth by virtue of doing so." Really? More debt than all 43 presidents before President Obama? First we had to determine which "debt" Romney was referring to in his statement. There are actually two main ways of tabulating the debt. One is public debt, which includes all debt borrowed by the federal government and held by investors through Treasury notes and other securities. The other is gross federal debt, which includes public debt plus debt held by the government. The most notable forms of debt held by the government are the trust funds for Social Security and Medicare, money which is owed to beneficiaries in the future. Romney spokesman Ryan Williams said the candidate was referring to debt held by the public. We then needed to determine the start and end points for calculating how much of the debt can be categorized as falling within Obama’s first term. Obama took office on January 20, 2009, but who "owns" the debt recorded for fiscal year 2009 is unclear. Obama signed off on the budget that year, but it was assembled during Bush’s term, and it does not really bear Obama’s imprint. Similarly, it’s possible to say that either the fiscal year 2012 budget or the fiscal year 2013 budget is Obama’s last from his first term. So we decided to analyze Romney’s claim by using three possible date ranges for our calculations. -- October 1, 2008 (the start of fiscal 2009) to Oct. 1, 2012 (the end of fiscal 2012) -- January 20, 2009 (the day of Obama’s inauguration) to Oct. 1, 2013 (the end of fiscal 2013) -- October 1, 2009 (the start of fiscal 2010, Obama's first full budget year) to Oct. 1, 2013 (the end of fiscal 2013) We’re offering several options because each of these measurements have shortcomings for the purpose of measuring the debt accumulated under Obama. We’re able to calculate the debt figures for the earlier dates using the U.S. Department of Treasury’s "Debt to the Penny" calculator. The future debt amounts come from Office of Management and Budget projections. Because they are projections, they’re subject to change as economic circumstances change, but they are are widely cited among experts. (OMB doesn’t project future debt to specific dates, only to the end of future fiscal years, so that’s why our ending dates are only at the end of fiscal years.) Here are the debt totals accumulated during the three periods we listed above: * End of fiscal year 2008, when the accrued debt under the 43 presidents was $5.851 trillion, to the end of fiscal 2012, when the debt is projected to reach $11.881 trillion. Yes, more than the previous 43 presidents. * Obama inauguration, when the accrued debt was $6.307 trillion, to the end of fiscal year 2013, when the debt is projected to reach $12.784 trillion. Yes, more than the previous 43 presidents. * End of fiscal year 2009, when the accrued debt was $7.506 trillion, to end of fiscal year 2013, when the debt is projected to reach $12.784 trillion. No, not as much as the previous 43 presidents. Over the first two scenarios above, the debt more than doubled from the starting point (which reflects the debt under the prior 43 presidents) to the ending point. So in these two scenarios, Romney is right -- Obama accumulated more debt than the previous 43 presidents combined. But for the third scenario, the debt didn't double, so Romney would be wrong. This exercise is a testament to the fact that small changes in assumptions can produce big differences in outcomes. Of course, there’s no guarantee that Obama’s administration will actually preside over as much publicly held debt as predicted, since new budgets and projections will change debt outcomes every year. And the current negotiations over raising the debt ceiling could significantly change the forecasts. Still, this is what we can conclude given the data when Romney made his statement. Now let’s throw in a further complication. In an interview, Romney’s staff backed up the candidate’s statement in part by citing a prior ruling by PolitiFact. Williams, Romney’s spokesman, cited PolitiFact "True" ruling on a claim by Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va. In a letter to the editor of the Richmond Times-Dispatch in October 2010, Cantor wrote that "the budget submitted by Obama will add more to the debt than the outstanding debt of the previous 43 presidents combined." PolitiFact rated the statement True, and that was good enough for Romney’s campaign. "We actually pulled it right off the (Politifact) website," Williams said in an interview.

pomt-03612	Says "The idea of one casino per tribe is a false one."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2013/may/09/ken-tanner/idea-one-casino-tribe-false-one/	The Coquille Indian Tribe wants to turn a bowling alley in Medford into a casino with 600 video gambling machines, adding to another casino it operates in North Bend. Coquille Tribal Chief Ken Tanner told a reporter that the tribe has the right to build a second casino. "The idea of one casino per tribe is a false one. Evidence of that is that the governor signed our compact which allows us a second casino," he said in a radio report that aired April 24, 2013, on Oregon Public Broadcasting. Tanner’s claim was news to PolitiFact Oregon. Is the "one casino per tribe" idea a false one, not grounded in reality? We always thought the policy was the norm in Oregon. Federal law calls for a tribe and state to negotiate a compact agreement before a casino can be sited. The compact spells out location, security and size. There is no federal or state law that limits tribes to one casino each. It is a policy of Gov. John Kitzhaber, who served two four-year terms from 1995 to 2003 and was elected to a third term that began in 2011. Gov. Ted Kulongoski, who served in-between, also adhered to this policy. Each of Oregon’s nine federally recognized tribes has a current compact with the state that identifies one casino location: The Grand Ronde has Spirit Mountain Casinoand the Siletz has Chinook Winds Casino. The Warm Springs opened Indian Head Casino in 2012, and in doing so, closed its casino at Kah-Nee-Ta Resort and Spa. Coquille We spoke with Ray Doering, spokesman for the Coquille Economic Development Corporation, which operates the Mill Casino in North Bend. (Tanner later followed up with an e-mail to PolitiFact Oregon, saying that he stood by his statement.) Doering made two points: One, the proposed venture is a different type of casino, one that does not need to go through the compact process. Two, he said, the tribe never agreed to Kitzhaber’s policy, even if it signed a compact in 2000 for the Mill Casino. Doering said it doesn’t matter what other tribes say they agreed to because the Coquille did not. "There was no agreement to keep it at one facility. What it says in this contract, we agreed to not seek an additional compact for a period of five years and that (provision) ended eight years ago," Doering said. Indeed, the 52-page agreement signed in 2000 specifies that the Coquille waives any right for a period of five years to even think about negotiating an agreement for another casino unless another tribe is allowed to operate more than one casino. Doering points to the compact language as evidence that the tribe could negotiate for a second casino after five years. Kitzhaber’s legal counsel says the language does not entitle the tribe to a second casino. The Burns Paiute, Klamath, Siletz and Umatilla tribes have similar five-year language in their compacts, said a spokesman for the governor. The compacts for Cow Creek, Warm Springs and Grand Ronde are more explicit, and the tribes waive any rights they may have to pursue a second casino, regardless of time frame. Governor, others The Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians, which operates the Seven Feathers Casino Resort in Canyonville, is at risk of losing money to a 600-machine casino in Medford and opposes the proposed second casino. Cow Creek leaders say Kitzhaber’s one casino, one tribe policy was agreed to by Oregon’s tribes and preserves the balance of casino gambling in the state. "We see it as an agreement made in good faith. The governor’s office calls it a policy; we would call it an agreement," said Susan Ferris, spokeswoman for Cow Creek. There’s another aspect we need to address: Types of casinos. The governor has authority to negotiate compacts for the large-scale tribal casinos currently in Oregon, called Class III. He has no authority over Class II casinos, which the National Indian Gaming Commission defines as casinos offering bingo and "when played in the same location as bingo - pull tabs, lotto, punch boards, tip jars, instant bingo, other games similar to bingo." The proposed casino would fall into this category. The ruling: Tanner is correct that the idea of one casino per tribe is a malleable one. This is Kitzhaber’s policy, and one that might fail in a legal challenge. Also, a future governor could decide on no limits at all. And the governor has no authority over any proliferation of bingo-oriented casinos. But it’s not entirely accurate to say that the idea of one casino per tribe is "a false one," or that the idea is non-existent. Kitzhaber, in a letter this week urging the Bureau of Indian Affairs to reject the Coquille proposal, wrote, "My ‘one casino per tribe’ policy direction and the gaming compacts entered into between the State and the tribes provide support for the notion that, as a State, we have consistently attempted to strike a balance between tribal pursuit of economic enterprise and a check on the expansion of gambling in our State." In the eyes of Coquille leaders, the policy does not apply because they did not agree to it. But a policy does exist, in the governor’s stated words and in the compacts of other tribes in Oregon. The Warm Springs closed one casino in order to open another. The Cow Creek believe it to be an agreement made by the tribes.

pomt-14042	"The Nordic countries are some of the few countries" that meet development aid goals.	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/may/26/barack-obama/us-v-nordic-block-how-they-compare-foreign-aid/	President Barack Obama recently hosted a meeting with the leaders of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Finland and Iceland. The president had nothing but good things to say about his visitors from the Nordic block, remarking that, "There have been times where I’ve said, ‘Why don’t we just put all these small countries in charge for a while, and they could clean things up.’ " Small but potent was a recurring theme. "They are, individually, not large countries in terms of population, but in terms of effectiveness, contributions, ideas, energy, they are enormously important players on the international stage," Obama said as they wrapped up their meeting on May 13, 2016. "The Nordic countries are some of the few countries -- and, by the way, the United States doesn’t fall into this category -- of meeting the goals that had been set with respect to foreign aid and humanitarian assistance." Obama was specifically thinking about a United Nations benchmark that says that 0.7 percent of a country’s Gross National Income should go to official development assistance. It’s an aspirational target that dates back to 1970 and is entirely voluntary. (Gross National Income is a slightly less common way to measure the size of country’s economy.) The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development keeps track of that spending. The money has to go to developing countries and military aid doesn’t count. Since about 1980, four countries have met or shot well beyond the 0.7 percent mark. They are Sweden, Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands. You will notice that Finland and Iceland are missing from that group. Finland has come close, approaching 0.6 percent since 2010, and once -- in 1991 -- hitting 0.8 percent. But that’s not 0.7 percent. Iceland’s high-water mark was .47 in 2008, but its banks bet heavily on risky housing securities and the nation’s economy crashed hard in the Great Recession. Today, it puts .24 percent toward foreign development aid. Here’s how the 29 member countries of the OECD Development Assistance Committee stack up. (The United States is listed in orange; Nordic countries are in blue.) The United States is in the middle of the pack with 0.17 percent of GNI. That is just one way of measuring aid, however. The American economy is huge, so in terms of raw dollars, its spending stands way above all others. In 2015, the total was nearly $31 billion, or about a fifth of all the development aid tracked by the OECD. Of note: Great Britain and Luxembourg have been doing a good job of hitting the 0.7 percent target. In a purely technical sense and for just a couple of years, so has the United Arab Emirates. In 2014 and 2015, it gave more than 1 percent of its GNI in aid. But virtually all of that went to Egypt to support the military after it toppled the government led by parties aligned with the Muslim Brotherhood. Our ruling Obama said that the Nordic countries are among the few that have met foreign development aid goals. He was referring to the voluntary target of 0.7 percent of Gross National Income that wealthier nations agreed to in 1970. For the largest Nordic nations of Denmark, Sweden and Norway, Obama is correct. All of them have met or exceeded the 0.7 percent mark for many years. But if you put Finland and Iceland into the mix, the statement’s accuracy slips. Finland is close but not quite at the mark, and Iceland lies further from it. We’ll say the statement is three-fifths correct.

pomt-10356	"If you have an investment for your child's education or own a mutual fund or a stock in a retirement plan, (Obama) is going to raise your taxes."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/09/john-mccain/mccains-argument-tangential-at-best/	As political attacks go, this one is about as well-worn as they get. I, the Republican, will cut your taxes. He, the Democrat, will raise your taxes. Such was the gist of a speech Sen. John McCain made in a town hall meeting in Denver on July 7. "If you have an investment for your child's education or own a mutual fund or a stock in a retirement plan, he (Obama) is going to raise your taxes." This statement is based on Obama's plan to raise the long-term capital gains tax from the current rate of 15 percent to as high as 28 percent (Obama has not been specific about the rate he'll seek). It's part of Obama's strategy to shift more of the tax burden to wealthy people. But according to the McCain campaign, Obama's plan would hit the middle class. What's interesting about McCain's statement is that it's so specific; retirement plans, investments for education. For most people, those investments are made in tax sheltered plans, such as 401Ks or 529 plans for college funds. The McCain explanation is that Obama's tax plan would have a broad effect on investing, essentially taxing everything. "Obama has pledged to raise capital taxes - on capital gains and dividends - potentially impacting tens of millions of Americans," said Brian Rogers, a spokesman for the McCain campaign. "All investors would face the impact of higher capital taxes on the valuation of their investments. While those in non-tax preferred accounts may not immediately be affected by capital gains and dividend tax hikes, funds ultimately withdrawn from tax-deferred accounts are subject to taxation as ordinary income -- on which Senator Obama has also pledged to raise the top marginal rate." To support the argument, the McCain campaign points to some statistics: That 52% of American adults own stocks, and that in 2006, 8.5 million of them paid a capital gains tax. McCain's campaign also notes an Investment Company Institute survey that concluded 88 million people invested in the stock market through mutual funds. Lastly, they point to a report from the Joint Committee On Taxation that found in 2005, about 20 percent of the taxpayers who were expected to report capital gains income - and 24 percent of those expected to report dividend income - earned less than $50,000 annually. These statistics ignore a very important caveat Obama has included in his tax plan, his unequivocal pledge that he will not raise capital gains taxes (or any other taxes) for families making less than $250,000 a year. "A lot of what (McCain campaign people) are saying is noise," said Eric Toder, a tax policy expert with the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C. Those statistics on the large percentages of Americans who hold stocks and pay capital gains taxes are accurate, Toder said, they just aren't relevant to the argument. Yes, he said, there are 88 million people who have invested money in the stock market but "not too many of them are making $250,000 a year." So the higher rates in Obama's plan wouldn't apply to them. "I would say this stuff is, at best, misleading," Toder said. Toder also said that if McCain is talking about traditional college savings plans, like a 529, then he's "just wrong." The Obama campaign argues that not only is McCain wrong, they say that Obama is proposing some tax relief on those very fronts. Obama's plan calls for a fully refundable $4,000 college tax credit; and a 50% match of the first $1,000 of retirement savings you do each year. There is another school of thought on this issue, in support of the McCain campaign's argument, that raising capital gains and dividend tax rates will harm the value of stocks in general, and discourage investing in the long term. That may not translate to a direct tax on an individual, said Patrick Fleenor, chief economist for the Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group, but the effect is the same. Any stock portfolio, whether it's earmarked for a child's education expenses or retirement, or anything, is going to suffer, he said. "The underlying value of the fund would be lower," Fleenor said. "To economists, there's no difference." Even if you agree with this argument, that's not what McCain said. He said if you have an investment for your child's education, or own a mutual fund or stock in a retirement plan "he (Obama) is going to raise your taxes." The fact is the capital gains tax would have absolutely no direct effect on savings in a traditional college savings plan. As for retirement savings through stocks or a mutual funds, people who cash out would not face higher tax rates unless you make more than $250,000. That doesn't apply to most Americans.

pomt-08752	"(I) helped to invent a system that saved over a billion dollars on welfare."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/aug/29/kenneth-block/block-says-system-he-helped-create-detect-welfare-/	In a television commercial, Kenneth Block, the Moderate Party candidate for governor, tries to appeal to voters by suggesting that he is business savvy, concerned about the environment, and knows how to save taxpayer money. "I built a successful high-tech business, created green jobs, and helped to invent a system that saved over a billion dollars on welfare," he says in the commercial, which is also available on his website. We decided to focus on the welfare claim and the savings Block says he helped to generate. First, Block isn't talking about Rhode Island. He said he is talking about software he helped develop for Texas, which in 1995 adopted a statewide debit card system for food stamp and welfare recipients. It computerized every transaction, eliminating, for example, the need for paper food stamps, which can be stolen or misused. He's been more specific on his website blog: "As a small business owner, Ken helped to invent a system that saved Texas over a billion dollars on welfare. He did this by eliminating waste and fraud in the system . . . " Second, the $1 billion savings estimate comes from food stamps, not from welfare, which people often lump together because both are forms of public assistance. Block's campaign encouraged us to focus on the food stamp program because, they said, it would be easier to quantify the savings. How did Block's efforts help save this money? He said one technique is "data mining," in which large amounts of information are analyzed to look for improprieties, such as a small grocery that reports the food sales numbers of a huge supermarket. He said sham storefronts were paying food stamp recipients 50 cents on the dollar for their stamps and then billing the state for the full amount when no food was actually sold. Such information helped direct investigators to crooked vendors and recipients, he said. So there are two key questions: Did Block help create the fraud detection system and did it save $1 billion? Geoffrey Wool, a spokesman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, said Block was an employee of GTECH when Texas contracted with the Rhode Island gambling company in the early 1990s to develop the EBT system. Wool said the Texas commission currently gets services from Simpatico Software Systems, the company Block started after he left GTECH. Block also referred us to Curtis Ermer, one of his GTECH colleagues on the EBT project. "Ken's role was large in terms of the design. Ken could sit down in a short period of time and optimize that code," said Ermer, who has since left GTECH. He said an anti-fraud component "was a purpose of the whole EBT system. The counterfeiting of stamps, the multiple addresses people would use, was supposed to be reduced." Thus, it appears Block played a significant role in establishing the EBT system, so his "helped to invent" claim is True. What about the second key question: Did that system save more than $1 billion? We were unable to locate any official report showing how much waste or fraud was eliminated by adoption of the EBT program. Block's campaign then directed us to several news reports from 1998 suggesting that the savings were large, although they widely disagreed on the amount saved: * In an opinion piece in The Houston Chronicle, Joe Williams, president of the Gulf Coast Retailers Association, said the number of Texas households receiving food stamps and welfare benefits plummeted from 1.4 million in 1994 to 850,000 in 1998 due to the EBT card system, saving taxpayers more than $1.2 billion a year. * A Dallas Morning News story quoted then-Texas Comptroller John Sharp as saying there had been a 250,000-person decline in food stamp rolls. At the time, a typical recipient was receiving about $70 in food stamps per month, according to a federal report we located independently. That would translate to a savings of $206 million per year. *A San Antonio Express-News story quoted Sharp's office as reporting that the decline in food stamp enrollment saved $67.3 million a month. That would total more than $800 million in just one year. The Block campaign also directed us to a March 1996 state newsletter, quoting Sharp as saying that when EBT went on-line in Houston in February 1995, 30,000 recipients immediately dropped off the food stamp rolls, including some who had been receiving food stamps at two or three different addresses. It also reported that "between January and October 1995, Texas' food stamp rolls shrank by nearly 200,000 recipients." At $70 per month per person, the statewide savings would surpass $1 billion after six years and one month -- sooner if you factor in inflation. All of this suggests that the EBT system indeed saved a lot of money in Texas. But there were some dissenting voices. We talked to Celia Hagert, a senior policy analyst for the Center for Public Policy Priorities, an Austin-based nonprofit think tank devoted to improving the economic and social conditions of low- and moderate-income Texans. She agreed that the card system eliminated fraud on the part of retailers, but said enrollment was declining before the card system went into effect and "there weren't hordes and hordes of people fraudulently receiving food stamps." And two officials at the Texas Health and Human Services Commission insisted that GTECH, Block and his company have had no direct role in fraud detection. "There is no fraud detection mechanism in the product GTECH delivered," said Wool, the commission's spokesman. Instead, Wool said, the system simply sends data to Texas' Office of Inspector General, which developed its own fraud detection software. Block responded by showing us two emails from Douglas B. Walker, of Austin, who was a system analyst for the Texas Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) system, retiring in 2007. The messages asked Block to look into some cases of suspected fraud. So we asked Wool to put us in touch with someone higher. He arranged an interview with Michael Garbarino, director of policy and outreach affairs for the inspector general's office, who expressed surprise at the Walker emails, saying he had talked to others to confirm that making such checks was not an assigned function. "None of these contracts, none of the vendors, nor any of the subcontractors ever had within the scope of the contract fraud detection responsibilities," he said. "The automation that runs that data through algorithms to arrive at questionable transactions was entirely created by state staff and never was in the scope of any vendor contract." In the end, Block did help develop the EBT system and the system likely saved -- directly or indirectly -- more than $1 billion in waste and fraud since its implementation 15 years ago. We rate his claim as True. The candidate, in interviews and on his blog, insists that he played a key role in fraud detection. He maintains that he continues helping with that task today. But Block is now aware, through our contacts with his office, that two Texas officials consistently and adamantly dispute that.

pomt-02860	"Under President (George W.) Bush, prosecution of gun crimes was 30 percent higher than it is under President Obama."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/15/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-gun-prosecutions-down-under-obama/	After leading the charge for a government shutdown to defund President Barack Obama’s health care law, freshman Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, hasn’t shied away from the spotlight. On Nov. 8, 2013, Cruz was a guest on the Tonight Show with Jay Leno. Long before he got to the obligatory joke about reading Green Eggs & Ham during a lengthy Senate speech, he addressed gun policy. "Do you target violent criminals, or do you try to take away the constitutional rights of law-abiding citizens?" Cruz said. After the senator criticized Obama for focusing on the latter at the expense of the former, he praised predecessor George W. Bush’s efforts. "Under President Bush, prosecution of gun crimes was 30 percent higher than it is under President Obama," Cruz said. "They’re not targeting bad guys." We decided to see how the numbers differed under the two presidents. Ways to read the data Let’s break down the number of federal prosecutions by year. We’ll start with fiscal year 2002, since that represents Bush’s first full year in office. Fiscal year 2012 is the most recent year we have data for. There are two different sets of statistics we can look at. Cruz’s spokeswoman referred us to the Transitional Records Access Clearinghouse, a Syracuse University data-gathering organization. This data tracks federal gun prosecutions by the lead, or most serious, charge. On the other hand, the Department of Justice’s United States Attorney’s Office tracks all charges, a more inclusive category of prosecutions. Their data set includes everyone who was charged with a gun crime. The lead charge category only includes people whose most serious offense was gun-related, a distinction that omits thousands of charges each year. Lead charges All charges 2002 7,948 10,634 2003 10,432 13,037 2004 11,015 12,962 2005 10,219 13,062 2006 9,652 12,479 2007 8,919 12,087 2008 8,484 11,974 2009 8,188 11,722 2010 7,614 11,421 2011 7,465 11,811 2012 7,774 11,728 Cruz’s spokeswoman also told us that Cruz’s claim didn’t take into account numbers for Bush’s entire term: He used 2004, the high-water mark for lead gun prosecutions during the time period, as his starting point. We’re left with four ways to calculate the percent change: • Lead charges from 2002 to 2012, which gives us a 2.2 percent decrease • Lead charges from 2004 to 2012, which gives us a 29.4 percent decrease • All charges from 2002 to 2012, which gives us a 10.3 percent increase • All charges from 2005 (the high-water mark of this data set) to 2012, which gives us a 10.2 percent decrease This makes clear how Cruz got his 30 percent decrease. However, that’s not the only, or necessarily the best, approach. None other than TRAC’s co-director, Susan Long, told PolitiFact that her organization’s use of lead charges isn’t as comprehensive as using all charges. She also called Cruz’s 2004 start date misleading, since it amounts to cherry-picking. The most reliable number may be the 10.3 percent increase in gun prosecutions between fiscal years 2002 and 2012. This rate actually indicates the trend moving in the opposite direction from what Cruz asserted. Who’s responsible? In addition to highlighting a numerical difference in federal gun crime prosecutions, Cruz specifically suggested that Obama’s policies are responsible for the decrease. But how much influence does the president really have on the issue? Experts say: not much. "The Bush administration was all over the map," Long said. "Those trends really are being driven by something other than presidential policy," since the peaks and valleys don’t coincide with presidential terms, she said. As we’ve noted in a previous fact check, the president, as the head of the executive branch, can order changes to prosecutorial priorities. For instance, following the Newtown, Conn. school shooting in December 2012, Obama did call for the need to "maximize enforcement efforts to prevent gun violence and prosecute gun crime." We don’t yet have data that reflects prosecutions in the aftermath of Newtown. But it’s important to note that Obama’s priorities are not the only factors at play in these decisions. Any presidential shift in policy must filter down to the attorney general, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives field offices, and front-line attorneys, said Ronald Frandsen, grants administrator for the Regional Justice Information Service. U.S. attorneys can decline to prosecute gun cases for a variety of reasons, as outlined by TRAC. So Obama is responsible for setting the broad policy approach to gun prosecutions, but he isn’t micromanaging individual cases. Much of the decision-making occurs at a lower level. Our ruling Cruz said prosecution of gun crimes under the Bush administration was 30 percent higher than it is under Obama. It’s possible to get a decline that big by cherry-picking the data, but the most inclusive method actually produces an increase. Cruz also overstates the role of the president in determining prosecution rates. We rate Cruz’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-05829	Says in his years as a Texas legislator, "we passed three pay increases for teachers and provided them with health insurance."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/feb/17/paul-sadler/paul-sadler-says-he-and-others-gave-texas-teachers/	Facebook was but a gleam in a Harvard student’s eye the last time Paul Sadler held public office. But the former Democratic state legislator embraced the social networking site’s political potential after he declared his candidacy to succeed the retiring U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison late last year. And on Jan. 27, 2012, Sadler posted this Facebook update: "In the time I worked on education issues, we passed 3 pay increases for teachers and provided them with health insurance." Teachers got all that in Sadler’s legislative era? We wondered. Sadler, a lawyer who works with the Wind Coalition energy advocacy group, won election to the Texas House on Nov. 6, 1990. For 12 years, he represented the East Texas district around Henderson, and for eight years he chaired the House Public Education Committee. Also, in 1997 and 2001, he headed committees on taxes and public school financing. During his legislative tenure, he also served on and chaired committees on health insurance for teachers and other education subcommittees. In response to our inquiry, Sadler campaign spokesman Jeff Rotkoff told us that in 1995, Sadler helped lead an overhaul of state education laws that tied teacher pay hikes to increases in state education aid, which brought raises in 1997 and 1998. And in 1999, Rotkoff said, Sadler sponsored a $3,000-a-year pay raise for teachers. In 2001, Rotkoff said, Sadler wrote a proposal that created a health insurance program for school employees. Separately, we confirmed that: Sadler sponsored the House version of Senate Bill 1 in 1995. The proposal, authored by Sen. Bill Ratliff, R-Mount Pleasant, revised the state’s public education laws across the board; it was approved by the Senate in March 1995 and the House about two months later and then signed into law May 30, 1995. Brock Gregg, governmental relations director for the Association of Texas Professional Educators told us in an interview that the overhaul changed the schedule of teacher pay raises; as a result, he said, most teachers saw pay increases in 1995-96. Gregg said lawmakers also added a salary "escalator" to the state’s education code. That provision said that whenever state funding to a school district increased, the district’s salary schedule must also increase. After the 1997 Legislature wrote a budget drawing on a revenue surplus, Gregg said, all Texas teachers fielded pay raises thanks to the established escalator clause. He said one raise of 5.5 percent occurred in 1997-98 and another, of 1 percent, kicked in during 1998-99. These figures match those sent to us by the Texas Education Agency. In a telephone interview, Sadler said that the "escalator" sprang from an idea he floated and Ratliff fleshed out, which then became law. Gregg said that although the original "escalator" was scrapped in 1999, lawmakers later made other efforts to ensure teachers got pay raises when districts fielded additional state aid. Another raise arose after the 1999 Legislature advanced Senate Bill 4, which was authored by Sen. Teel Bivins, R-Amarillo, carried in the House by Sadler and took effect Sept. 1, 1999. The Austin American-Statesman reported May 31, 1999, that the measure gave Texas teachers "their biggest pay raise ever" as part of the "largest public school spending increase in state history." From a total $2.1 billion for public schools, $1.7 billion went to pay raises, the story said, with teachers getting at least $3,000 more that year. So, multiple raises accounted for. And what about Sadler’s claim about "providing" teacher health insurance? In 2001, Sadler authored House Bill 3343, the "Texas School Employees Uniform Group Health Coverage Act" (that’s TSEUGHCA, if you speak Gaelic), which was signed into law June 15, 2001. It created the TRS-ActiveCare program, a state-managed insurance pool. At the time, most districts offered insurance plans to their employees, including teachers, according to an August 2000 TRS study. Texas Education Agency data show teachers made up about half of school employees in 2000. The TRS study says, though, that only 38 percent of about 535,000 Texas public school employees had coverage comparable to that of state employees. Some 50 percent had insurance that did not compare favorably to state coverage, and 12 percent of employees did not sign up for district-offered coverage, the study says. Only 350 employees in 17 of the state’s 1,000-plus districts were offered no coverage at all, the study says. Sadler told us his 2001 proposal was intended both to extend coverage to all school employees and to raise the quality of coverage so that all employees had access to comparable insurance. According to a 2001 report by the nonpartisan House Research Organization, the 1991 Legislature had directed school districts to give employees coverage equivalent to that of state workers, but the law lacked enforcement provisions. Gregg told us in interviews that the 2001 TRS-ActiveCare program was created to acquire and administer group insurance from a third party, and the law also gave all teachers $1,000 per year toward its cost. Association of Texas Professional Educators lobbyist Josh Sanderson told us via email that the $1,000 stipend was intended to be an annual payment but was cut to $500 in 2003 for full-time teachers and then, in a 2006 special session, rolled into a $2,500 raise in educators’ pay. According to a May 2002 guide to the law produced by the Legislative Budget Board, after the first sign-up deadline of Sept. 30, 2001, small districts and other entities employing a total 147,000 people had joined TRS-ActiveCare. Larger districts were added later, though not all chose to participate. Currently, Texas State Teachers Association spokesman Clay Robison told us by email, all Texas teachers have access to insurance comparable to state employees’. ActiveCare covers more than 445,000 employees and dependents, he said, and 89 percent of eligible districts and similar education entities participate in the program. Austin and Houston are examples of large districts that have their own health plans, he said. Sadler said that although nearly 40 percent of school employees had comparable coverage before 2001, he believes such accounting doesn’t give an accurate picture of the 2001 law’s impact. He said he didn’t remember the 1991 mandate that districts offer comparable coverage, but it obviously had little effect. Of his work on teacher pay raises and insurance, Sadler said, "I know it changed the landscape." Teacher lobby groups have hailed Sadler’s advocacy. In a Dec. 2, 2001, Statesman news story, TSTA director of governmental relations Jay Levin credits Sadler with helping to bring about the 1999 raise of $3,000 and the health insurance program for teachers. Robison told us it’s fair for Sadler to claim credit for the pay raises and insurance initiative because he chaired the public education panel through those years. Gregg likewise said Sadler merits a goodly share of the credit. "Sadler was the leading proponent for pay increases and later health insurance for educators," Gregg said. Our ruling Sadler played a pivotal role in ensuring several teacher pay raises and also was key to lawmakers giving school workers including teachers access to insurance benefits equal to those accorded state employees. However, contrary to Sadler’s Facebook wording, the latter development did not provide teachers with insurance. Nearly every Texas teacher had access to some kind of coverage before the 2001 action. Still, the Sadler-authored change gave every school employee access to insurance equivalent to state workers’ coverage. We rate Sadler’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-03006	The federal government "has $3 trillion in cash flow, so we can pay our bills" and won’t default.	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/oct/16/roger-williams/roger-willliams-correct-government-could-cover-pro/	In an interview, first-term U.S. Rep. Roger Williams vowed not to vote for raising the federal debt ceiling. "I just won’t do it," the Austin Republican was quoted as saying in an Oct. 11, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news story. Besides, Williams said, even if the debt ceiling isn’t raised, "we are not going to default. We have $3 trillion in cash flow, so we can pay our bills." We wondered about that, mindful that the U.S. Treasury secretary has speculated about the risks of the government not having enough cash on hand. Treasury secretary's warning The debt ceiling, now nearly $16.7 trillion, constrains how much the government can borrow to meet obligations. And in October 2013, the Treasury secretary, Jack Lew, told a Senate panel that unless Congress raised the ceiling, "extraordinary measures" taken since the spring would be exhausted no later than Oct. 17 "at which point the federal government will have run out of borrowing authority. At that point, we will be left to meet our country’s commitments with only the cash on hand and any incoming revenues, placing our economy in a dangerous position. "If we have insufficient cash on hand," Lew said, "it would be impossible for the United States of America to meet all of its obligations, including Social Security and Medicare benefits, payments to our military and veterans and contracts with private suppliers for the first time in our history. At the same time," he said, "we’re relying on investors from all over the world to continue to hold U.S. bonds. Every week we roll over approximately $100 billion in U.S. (Treasury) bills. If U.S. bond-holders decided that they wanted to be repaid rather than continuing to roll over their investments, we could unexpectedly dissipate our entire cash balance." Williams' backup cites projected interest costs We asked Williams how he reached his conclusion. By email, Williams’ spokeswoman Haley Graves provided a transcript of the Statesman’s question to Williams, who has long owned automobile dealerships, and his response. Statesman: "Do you think the warnings about what a failure to enact a debt ceiling increase, the effect on the economy, is overblown or is that real?" Williams: "We’re not going to default because we do have $3 trillion of cash flow coming in to America. Alright? Now the cash flow doesn’t flow evenly – it’s like your business. You have receivable, this and that, but you do have $3 trillion in cash. That’s more cash flow than we’ve ever had coming in to the government than ever. And so we can pay our bills. We can pay our debt service. We can pay our military. We’re not going to default." Graves said Williams based his $3 trillion reference on a May 2013 projection by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that the government would collect $3.042 trillion in revenues through the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, 2013. Asked if Williams was referring to the government paying all its bills, Graves said Williams has said "all along" that the government will not default because its cash flow would be enough to pay bond holders and to fulfill interest payments. What's default? Observers of the debt-ceiling debate diverge on how to define a government default, though they agree it’s not happened before. By telephone, economist Chris Edwards of the Cato Institute, a limited-government think tank, said Williams’ main point is supported by the CBO’s projection of $237 billion in net interest costs through the same fiscal year. Everyone agrees not paying such interest would hurt financial markets, Edwards said, but his sense is that if interest costs are paid on time, the government can avoid default, though that course could prove "ugly," he said, because the Treasury would need to pick and choose which other obligations--ranging from Social Security checks to Pentagon contracts--to pay in full and on time. "It would make people very mad," Edwards said, "but it wouldn’t be a default." Edwards also noted an Oct. 2, 2013, Yahoo Finance interview with David Stockman. Stockman, who headed the Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan, said that if the debt ceiling isn’t raised, the government could easily tap incoming revenue to make its interest payments while also covering regular payments to Social Security retirees, the armed services and Medicare reimbursements. "It is a complete red herring to say there will be a default," Stockman said. "There will never be a time in which there is not enough cash to pay the interest." Then again, Edwards told us, a counter-argument he attributed to liberals and Democrats is that it would be very hard for the Treasury to make the described alternative spending choices. A Brookings Institution economist, Gary Burtless, said by email that it’s conceivable the Treasury could prevent default on government-backed securities by keeping up with interest payments, though he said he lacked the expertise to judge whether the Treasury could legally implement a choose-the-bill-to-pay strategy. Realistically, Burtless said, if the government runs short of the revenue required to pay non-interest costs, that would seem like a default to any affected creditors. "If a business makes timely payments on its secured and unsecured bank debt but does not make promised payment to its suppliers (for supplies already delivered), workers (for hours of work already supplied), and pensioners (for pensions promised under the company pension plan)," he said, "most observers would say the company has defaulted on its obligations to some of its creditors. Suppliers, workers, and pensioners are creditors of the company just as certainly as banks that have extended the company a loan." Also responding to our inquiry, economist Jared Bernstein of the liberal-leaning Center on Budget Policy Priorities pointed out by email that the CBO-projected $3 trillion in revenue stands to be outpaced by predicted expenditures of $3.6 trillion in the fiscal year. This leads to a key question, Bernstein said, as to whether there will be days when cash flow undershoots what must be paid. Bernstein noted that a September 2013 report by the Bipartisan Policy Center said this will occur with, for instance, revenue a few weeks after mid-October 2013 running behind spending demands by more than $100 billion. The report also said that if the government exhausted its ability to pay all its bills by Oct. 18, 2013, the Treasury would run about $106 billion short of meeting obligations over the next 20 business days. "Approximately 32% of the funds owed for the period would go unpaid," the report said, with the reality proving "chaotic." Uncertainty at Treasury We did not find any indication that the Treasury has aired a strategy to pick and choose which bills it pays in the event of cash-flow slowing. A Sept. 19, 2013, report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service floated opposite speculations. In 2012, the report said, a Treasury official said the agency lacked congressional guidance on prioritization and hence only had a system to pay bills as they came in, one after the other. In contrast, according to the report, the Government Accountability Office said in a 1985 letter to the then-chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, Bob Packwood, that the Treasury was "free to liquidate obligations in any order it finds will best serve the interests of the United States." Burtless said that his understanding is the Treasury cannot prioritize its payments to contractors, Social Security pensioners, Medicare payees (doctors and hospitals that have provided services to the Medicare-insured population), non-furloughed civilian workers, members of the uniformed military, etc. If a supplier, a pensioner, a non-furloughed worker, military serviceperson, doctor or hospital does not receive timely payment, does that constitute a ‘default’?" An Oct. 13, 2013, PolitiFact story listing questions and answers about the debt ceiling said that if the ceiling is not raised, the government isn’t expected to have sufficient cash to meet all obligations in a timely manner past the beginning of November 2013, at latest. "So what happens then?" PolitiFact wrote. "The most obvious solution (beyond simply doing nothing) is to prioritize payments. Bondholders would likely be paid off first, since a missed or delayed payment on a financial instrument would entail the most severe peril for the government. Outraging senior citizens by delaying or missing a Social Security check is bad enough, the thinking goes, but if investors decide en masse to abandon U.S. bonds in the future, it would put the entire stability of the federal government’s finances (and ultimately, the U.S. economy) at risk. And according to experts, prioritization has problems. "For one thing, the federal government’s computer systems are not set up to do this, meaning it might not be a practical option (and could result in costly errors)," PolitiFact said. "In addition, the Treasury says it’s not clear it would have the legal authority to make those sorts of decisions. And it could cost more, since the law requires the government to pay interest on top of any payments that are delayed. It’s also not clear whether prioritizing bondholder payments would keep the United States from a ‘default.’ "It all depends on how you define the word ‘default.’ Some lawmakers who downplay the consequences of hitting the debt ceiling argue that a default only happens if interest on securities isn’t paid. A missed payment to a federal contractor or a Social Security recipient, according to this argument, doesn’t trigger a default." The story noted that the CRS has "acknowledged that there’s no clear answer to this question, but it does note that Black’s Law Dictionary defines the term ‘default’ as ‘the failure to make a payment when due’ — a definition that does not restrict a default to a missed interest payment. Ultimately, CRS notes, ‘financial markets’ perceptions of what constitutes a default, or a real threat of default, may be more relevant when assessing the potential impacts of not raising the debt limit.’" Our ruling Williams said the government "has $3 trillion in cash flow, so we can pay our bills" and won’t default. In the 12 months through September 2014, the government is projected to raise $3 trillion in revenue, far more than enough to cover some $237 billion in its projected interest costs. In this way, perhaps, default could be avoided. Still, Williams made a broader reference to paying "our bills," and on that front, there’s debate over whether the government could meet all its obligations or have the authority to pick and choose what to pay.

pomt-01249	Amendment 2 on medical marijuana won a higher percentage of the vote than the last six Florida governors, including Jeb Bush’s 2002 landslide.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/nov/13/united-care/medical-marijuana-amendment-was-more-popular-winni/	Floridians turned down a state constitutional amendment for medical marijuana, but it’s clear a majority of voters were all for the idea. Amendment 2, which would have changed the state’s Constitution to allow the sale of cannabis for "certain medical conditions" such as cancer and Parkinson’s disease, rang up 57.6 percent of the vote. Unfortunately for the measure’s supporters, amendments require at least 60 percent of the vote to pass. That close margin means that medical marijuana will continue to be debated, and not just in Florida. Two dozen states have medical marijuana laws, and Oregon and the District of Columbia voted to decriminalize recreational pot in the same general election. Ben Pollara, the campaign manager for the group behind the amendment, United for Care, tweeted two days after the election that the drug proved more popular than Florida’s governors. The tweet read: "#YesOn2 got a higher % of the vote than the last 6 #flgov including @JebBush in his 2002 landslide #tallyorbust #2016." We know the last couple of elections Gov. Rick Scott hasn’t even had to break 50 percent of the total votes in order to win, but is Pollara right about the last six Florida governors not garnering as much as 57.6 percent? The voting rolls The Twitter shorthand "#flgov" generally refers to the gubernatorial campaign, but has been used interchangeably to denote any tweet about a governor, too. We reached out to Pollara to ask him to clarify whether he meant the last six governors or the last six gubernatorial elections, because there’s a difference. Pollara told us he meant the last six gubernatorial elections, going back to Lawton Chiles’ victory over Jeb Bush in 1994. But because of the tweet’s wording, we looked at the last six governors elected, some of whom served two terms, going back to the 1978 campaign. Keep in mind, we’re looking for governors who won 57.6 percent of the vote or higher. Election year Governor Winning votes Total votes Percentage 1978 Bob Graham 1,406,580 2,530,468 55.6% 1982 Bob Graham 1,739,553 2,688,566 64.7% 1986 Bob Martinez 1,847,525 3,386,171 54.6% 1990 Lawton Chiles 1,995,206 3,530,871 56.5% 1994 Lawton Chiles 2,135,008 4,206,659 50.8% 1998 Jeb Bush 2,191,105 3,964,441 55.3% 2002 Jeb Bush 2,856,845 5,100,581 56.0% 2006 Charlie Crist 2,519,845 4,829,270 52.2% 2010 Rick Scott 2,619,335 5,359,735 48.9% 2014 Rick Scott 2,865,075 5,950,867 48.2% Source: Florida Department of State, Division of Elections If we were to look only at the last six elections, Pollara could be correct, because the highest margin of victory going back to 1994 was Bush’s 56 percent in 2002 against Bill McBride. As Pollara noted when we contacted him, if you’re counting that way, it could be the last eight elections. But if we’re going by individuals elected governor, there’s one obvious outlier: Graham, who was immensely popular and beat Republican state legislator Skip Bafalis with 64.7 percent of the vote in 1982. For comparison, Amendment 2 garnered 3,370,323 out of 5,849,118 votes cast for the measure to get that 57.6 percent. That’s more individual votes than any winning candidate has ever received. Our ruling Pollara said Amendment 2 won a higher percentage of the vote than the last six Florida governors, including Bush’s 2002 landslide. He’s right about the 2002 contest, and when you look back at the last six elections (eight, really) as Pollara intended, that’s true, too. But there’s a glaring outlier when you look at the last six people elected governor -- Graham’s 1982 win, when he garnered 64.7 percent of the vote. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-05111	"Over the last few decades, the income of the top 1 percent grew by more than 275 percent -- to an average of $1.3 million a year."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/jun/28/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-income-top-earners-275-percent-1/	While campaigning this month in Cleveland, President Barack Obama reframed his general election fight with Mitt Romney as a battle between the haves and the have-nots. Casting himself as a champion for the latter, Obama argued that his Republican opponent embraced fiscal policies that helped steer the country into recession. The election, he said, will be "a make-or-break moment for America’s middle class." The address at Cuyahoga Community College followed remarks that same afternoon from Romney in Cincinnati. Combined, the events offered a preview of how each will spend the coming months positioning himself as the candidate who can steer an economic recovery. The dueling speeches were considered far and wide to represent a key moment, given that it was the first time Obama and Romney had campaigned in the same state on the same day. Leaving aside the rhetoric, PolitiFact Ohio decided to look closer at the numbers the president used to make his case. In particular, two figures Obama shared at Tri-C caught our attention. "Over the last few decades," Obama said early in his 53-minute speech, "the income of the top 1 percent grew by more than 275 percent -- to an average of $1.3 million a year." The president had painted a picture of inequality. But was it an accurate one? Let’s start with the first half of the statement. Data released last October by the independent Congressional Budget Office shows that, on average, those Americans among the richest 1 percent saw their after-tax household income rise 275 percent between 1979 and 2007. Those not quite as prosperous but nonetheless among the top 20 percent saw income grow by 65 percent over that period. Middle-class incomes grew roughly 40 percent. And among the bottom 20 percent, income was about 18 percent higher in 2007 than in 1979. So while income increased across the board, the top 1 percent easily outpaced the pack. "As a result of that uneven income growth, the distribution of after-tax household income in the United States was substantially more unequal in 2007 than in 1979," the CBO reported. "In fact, between 2005 and 2007, the after-tax income received by the 20 percent of the population with the highest income exceeded the after-tax income of the remaining 80 percent." The second half of Obama’s statement can be traced to a report from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 developed countries that sets international standards on a wide range of topics. The report, released in December and titled "Divided We Stand: Why Inequality Keeps Rising," found that, on average, the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans earned $1.3 million a year after taxes. Though Obama didn’t mention it in his speech, that figure dwarfs the average $17,700 made by the poorest 20 percent, according to the OECD. Before we get to the Truth-O-Meter, there are three points worth raising. First, while Obama said that growth for the richest 1 percent was more than 275 percent, the CBO study adds no such quantifier. The president indulged in some hyperbole, but not so much that it created a false impression that the disparity is measurably larger than it is. Second, Obama time-pegged his assertion to "the last few decades." Obama’s speech focused singularly on the policies of his Republican predecessor, George W. Bush. Also in the White House during those decades were two Democrats: Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton. The third point comes via the Washington Post. When fact-checking Obama’s Tri-C speech, the Post’s Glenn Kessler noted that while it’s accurate that the average income among the top 1 percent is $1.3 million, describing top earners that way is "an interesting sleight of hand." According to the CBO, you’re in the top 1 percent if your household income exceeds $352,000. "By using an average," Kessler wrote, "Obama is able to cite a much higher figure."

pomt-08364	Says "Scott Walker wants to make abortion illegal, even in cases of rape, incest or to protect the life of the mother."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/26/tom-barrett/tom-barrett-says-scott-walker-wants-ban-abortion-e/	In a gubernatorial campaign largely centered on jobs and the job performance of the candidates, Democrat Tom Barrett has injected abortion into the debate, using a stark TV ad to take aim at his opponent, Republican Scott Walker. A couple identified as Lana and Mike appear on the screen. Mike says their teenage daughter was brutally raped. "You can’t imagine what she went through," he says. "That’s why politicians like Scott Walker make me so mad." The screen goes black. Then as Mike continues, the words he says also appear on the screen: "Scott Walker wants to make abortion illegal, even in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother." Mike concludes: "Who is Scott Walker to play God with our family?" and -- repeating a common theme from Barrett and the Democratic side -- says he feels Walker is "too extreme for Wisconsin." As voters weigh their choices in the Nov. 2, 2010, election, there is no dispute that Barrett is pro-choice and Walker is pro-life. But Barrett’s claim, which may be new to many viewers of the ad, is that Walker wants to outlaw abortion under any circumstances. It is worth noting that many voters who consider themselves pro-life support make an exception for abortion being available in cases of rape, incest or to protect the life of the mother. A May 2009 Gallup poll, however, found that 23 percent of Americans -- up from 17 percent a year earlier -- said abortion should be illegal under all circumstances. For his part, Walker has said repeatedly he opposes abortion, even in cases of rape and incest. He declares himself "100 percent pro-life." And to Pro-Life Wisconsin, an organization that opposes abortion without exception, Walker pledged to seek a complete abortion ban. We asked Jill Bader, Walker’s campaign spokeswoman, about Barrett’s ad and she said it accurately states Walker’s position. (We would note that as a member of the state Assembly, Walker backed an effort to bar government employees from performing abortions and a bill outlawing "partial-birth abortion"; both measures included an exception for when the life of the mother is at stake.) This is one item we can assess quickly. In the race for governor, Democrat Tom Barrett said his opponent, Republican Scott Walker, "wants to make abortion illegal, even in cases of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother." Walker acknowledges that is his position. We rate Barrett’s claim True.	None	Tom Barrett	None	None	None	2010-10-26T09:00:00	2010-10-21	['None']

pomt-01787	Says Rick Scott cut "Bright Futures scholarships in half."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/jul/25/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-rick-scott-cut-bright-futures-h/	Former Gov. Charlie Crist continued his attacks on Gov. Rick Scott’s education funding record in a TV ad set at St. Petersburg High School, Crist’s alma mater. "This isn’t just a doorway to a school. It was my doorway as a public school kid to opportunity. And I want to make sure every child has that same chance for a better life," Crist says in the ad. "But Rick Scott's education cuts are closing that door on Florida's kids, spending almost $200 less per student than when I was governor and cutting Bright Futures scholarships in half." Here we will fact-check whether Scott cut Bright Futures scholarships in half. Bright Futures funding and scholarships Launched in 1997, Bright Futures is the higher education scholarship program funded by the Lottery and designed to keep high-achieving students at Florida schools. The program’s costs spiraled up from an initial price tag of $70 million in 1997 to $437 million in 2011. Those rising costs led the Legislature to rein in the program. In 2010, Crist’s last year as governor, the Legislature reduced Bright Futures scholarships by $1 dollar for every credit hour. The law also raised SAT/ACT requirements incrementally over a few years, which was expected to lead to a drop in the number of students who would qualify. For example, the Legislature raised the minimum SAT requirement for Florida Medallion Scholars -- one subset of Bright Futures -- from 970 in 2010-11 to 1050 in 2013-14. So that means that the Legislature and Crist reduced the number of eligible students in the future, after Scott took over as governor. When Scott took over, he and the Legislature continued on that same path -- but made it even harder for students to qualify. In 2011, Scott’s first year as governor, the Legislature decided to further raise test scores for 2013-14 graduates. For example, those Medallion Scholars would now have to score 1170 on their SAT by 2013-14. When Crist says that under Scott the scholarships were cut in "half," it’s possible for viewers to mistakenly believe that refers to total dollars spent, or the amount of individual scholarships. Instead, what the ad is referring to is the number of scholarships distributed. The text on the screen shows that it refers to a May 2014 Sun-Sentinel editorial criticizing Bright Futures cuts, and this is what the Crist campaign pointed us to regarding the ad. As the requirements rose, not surprisingly the number of students who obtained the scholarship has dropped. Due to the tougher standards, "the number of new Bright Futures scholarship students will be cut almost in half – from 41,107 last fall to 21,340 this fall," the editorial board wrote. That number for this fall is based on an estimate from the state regarding how many students will qualify. After schools verify that scholarship recipients enrolled in eligible courses, the schools submit for reimbursement to the state -- and that’s when we learn the actual number of scholarships that were used. Here are recent years’ numbers on Bright Futures. The spending picture is not settled for the current and future fiscal years, so we have included an estimate for 2013-14 and 2014-15. Budget Year Initial students disbursed Total number of students served Amount of money disbursed Average award per student 2007-08 50,499 159,170 $379.8 million $2,387 2008-09 52,497 169,366 $429 million $2,533 2009-10 53,520 177,612 $423.5 million $2,385 2010-11 53,800 179,076 $423.3 million $2,364 2011-12 51,751 174,047 $333.8 million $1,918 2012-13 44,846 162,980 $312.1 million $1,915 2013-14 estimated 41,107 154,160 $309.4 million $2,007 2014-15 estimated 21,340 127,573 $266.2 million $2,087 Source: Florida Department of Education We think there are three main issues with the accuracy of the ad: • The ad could create the false impression that the amount of money per scholarship (or total money) was cut in half, when it’s actually referring to the number of scholarships. • The number of scholarships dropping by a half is based on the state’s estimate of how many will qualify this fall. But we don’t yet know the final number. • Though the ad points the finger at Scott, Crist also oversaw changes to Bright Futures that reduced the number of eligible students during Scott’s administration. Our ruling A Crist TV ad says Scott cut Bright Futures scholarships "in half." Viewers could mistakenly think that Scott cut the dollar amount of scholarships in half -- but he didn’t. Instead, Crist’s campaign zeroed in on the number of scholarships that were distributed last year compared to an estimate for the upcoming school year. While the ad blames Scott, under Crist the Legislature also raised the standards to reduce the number of scholarships awarded. Scott and the Legislature later raised the standards again, which is projected to reduce the number more. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-06870	Says U.S. Rep. Ron Kind’s "stimulus cost taxpayers $278,000 per job."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/01/national-republican-congressional-committee/stimulus-jobs-cost-taxpayers-gop-committee-says-in/	Finding a Republican who likes President Barack Obama’s stimulus plan might be harder than finding a hair comb-over that’s truly convincing. There almost certainly are no stimulus fans at the National Republican Congressional Committee, which is devoted to electing Republicans to the U.S. House of Representatives. In January 2009, the NRCC criticized the stimulus allotment of $335 million for sexually transmitted disease prevention programs. Our colleagues at PolitiFact National rated that claim Mostly True. In an October 2010 claim against then-U.S. Rep. Steve Kagen, D-Wis., the NRCC said the stimulus cost Wisconsin "77,000 jobs lost." We rated that one Pants on Fire. And the attacks have continued. In a July 5, 2011, news release, the committee singled out U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., saying "Kind’s stimulus cost taxpayers $278,000 per job." Although the stimulus wasn’t his plan, Kind voted for it. Eleven House Democrats and all House Republicans voted against it. As we noted in our NRCC item about Kagen, critics say the $830 billion cost of the stimulus has bought too few jobs, and unemployment has grown generally worse since Obama signed the measure into law in February 2009. But the claim that the stimulus spent $278,000 for every job it created is striking. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Ohio and PolitiFact Texas already have examined it. PolitiFact Ohio found that the statistic originated in a blog posting on the website of The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine. The posting by Jeffrey H. Anderson attributes the $278,000-per-job cost to "Obama’s economists." But to come up with that amount, Anderson did his own math with figures from a status report on the stimulus by Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers. Citing the report, Anderson said the stimulus had added or saved just under 2.4 million jobs at a cost to date of $666 billion. He divided the $666 billion by 2.4 million jobs to come up with a rounded-up figure of $278,000 per job. Here’s how our colleagues sized up two reiterations of the claim: House Speaker John Boehner PolitiFact Ohio weighed in after Boehner, an Ohio Republican, tweeted about the blog post. Our colleagues rated Boehner’s echoing of the $278,000 cost as False, pointing out that it lumps all of the various types of stimulus spending together. Stimulus spending, as the Associated Press noted in a fact check of a similar GOP claim, pays not only for the worker but for material, supplies and that worker's output -- a portion of a road paved, for example. Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst Dewhurst, a Republican, also tweeted about the blog posting. PolitiFact Texas found that of the $666 billion stimulus spending to date, 43 percent was spent on tax cuts for individuals and businesses; 19 percent went to state governments, primarily for education and Medicaid; 13 percent paid for government benefits to individuals such as unemployment and food stamps; and the remaining roughly 24 percent was spent on projects such as infrastructure improvement. That underscores how stimulus money was spent on many things in addition to creating jobs. Our Texas colleagues rated Dewhurst’s claim False. That’s two False ratings on the same claim. We asked the NRCC if it had any evidence beyond the blog post cited by Boehner and Dewhurst to back up its version of the statement -- that "Kind’s stimulus cost taxpayers $278,000 per job." Spokeswoman Andrea Bozek cited various reports critical of the stimulus, but nothing to establish that the $278,000 figure is correct. To review: The National Republican Congressional Committee, like Boehner and Dewhurst, claimed that the federal stimulus cost $278,000 per job. The NRCC called it "Kind’s stimulus" because U.S. Rep. Ron Kind, D-Wis., voted for it. Our PolitiFact colleagues have twice ruled the claim False and the NRCC offered us no new evidence to consider. We rate its claim False, as well.

pomt-14597	"We've cut taxes 50 times and look what has happened to our revenues. They've grown."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/feb/04/rick-scott/scott-credits-tax-cuts-floridas-growing-tax-revenu/	Gov. Rick Scott’s $1 billion tax-cut request is giving the Florida Legislature plenty to chew on, especially after state economists warned that revenues won’t be as high as once thought. Scott wants a range of cuts, including a reduction in the sales tax on commercial rents and a $770 million break for manufacturers and retailers by getting rid of their corporate income tax. Despite concerns over how the size of his request will affect the budget, Scott was confident the math makes it an easy decision for lawmakers. "We have plenty of money to be able to do tax cuts," Scott said Jan. 20, 2016, after state economists warned tax revenues would be less than previously estimated. "Let's look at history. We've cut taxes 50 times and look what has happened to our revenues. They've grown." Scott has used this line repeatedly in recent weeks. We wondered whether revenues have continued to grow even as Tallahassee has passed tax changes over recent years. Revenue roundup Scott’s line about 50 tax cuts is a talking point that just keeps on growing. We have rated claims about him cutting 24 tax cuts, 40 tax cuts, and more than 40 tax cuts, Half True, because Scott counted many small tax changes for specific industries as overall tax cuts. What’s new this time around, in a nutshell, are 16 provisions passed in 2015, most of which were part of a $429 million tax-cut package. The full list is largely comprised of esoteric tax credits (mostly for businesses), changes in unemployment compensation and sales tax holidays. There also was a rate reduction on the Communications Services Tax on cellphone and cable service that amounts to about $21 per $100 on a bill and a $60,000 cap on taxes for boat repairs. Several of those may help businesses, but really don’t often do much for everyday Floridians, especially if they needed to collect unemployment. Many times, local governments may raise taxes to make up for their own lost revenue. In short, it’s arguable whether all of those qualify as tax cuts, but they did have an impact on how many tax dollars the state brought in. Economists told us, however, that while you can project how much year-over-year revenues may be changed from cuts, it’s tough to attribute any concrete economic growth to those changes. Because of overall economic growth, tax revenues have been rising since Scott became governor as the state was climbing out of the Great Recession. We surveyed several years of general revenue, which is funded by taxes and fees and can be used by the Legislature for any purpose, alongside the state's rate of economic growth. Fiscal year General revenue Growth rate 2008-09 $21 billion -12.8 percent 2009-10 $21.5 billion 2.4 percent 2010-11 $22.55 billion 4.8 percent 2011-12* $23.6 billion 4.7 percent 2012-13 $25.3 billion 7.2 percent 2013-14 $26.2 billion 3.5 percent 2014-15 $27.7 billion 5.7 percent 2015-16 $28.4 billion 2.1 percent (*Scott’s first full fiscal year in office) Source: Florida Office of Economic & Demographic Research State economist Amy Baker noted that even with Florida’s economy growing, that growth rate is currently below the state’s historical average, and the cumulative effects of prior tax changes are eating into revenues more than expected. State budget forecasters have announced that tax revenues will come in at $400 million less than previously expected. Scott’s office has rejected those figures in pursuit of his biggest round of tax cuts, saying the Legislature has plenty of money to play with. But while it’s apparent that revenues have gone up even as Scott’s tax changes have been implemented, experts said it’s tough to directly link them. They said there are three main reasons Florida’s revenues have grown during the nationwide recovery: Population growth, rising property values and overall inflation. More than 1 million people have moved to Florida since 2010, property values are recovering from the housing bust, and inflation makes tax collections go up as costs go up. Basically, more people are paying more taxes on things that cost more. Norton Francis, senior research associate with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said that despite being the third-largest state, the growth rate for Florida’s tax revenues has started to lag behind the national average. "What you need to look at is, are (tax revenues) growing more than they used to?" Norton asked. "It could be that it’s come back as a whole, but it’s hard to pin that to a tax cut." Our ruling Scott said, "We've cut taxes 50 times and look what has happened to our revenues. They've grown." Scott has a debatable definition of tax cuts, but the state’s tax revenues have increased since he took office. Economists told us it would be difficult to attribute growth specifically to tax changes. The national economic recovery, population growth, higher property values and inflation are the major factors for the state’s growth. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2016-02-04T17:36:51	2016-01-20	['None']
pomt-03004	"Neville Chamberlain told the British people: ‘Accept the Nazis. Yes, they will dominate the continent of Europe, but that is not our problem. Let's appease them. Why? Because it can't be done. We cannot possibly stand against them.’"	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/oct/16/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-airs-popular-and-flawed-impression-britis/	In his September 2013 day-night-and-day U.S. Senate floor speech challenging the Obamacare law, Ted Cruz of Texas suggested that anyone saying the 2010 law could not be defunded was, well, being un-American. Brave colonists rebelled against the British, the Houston Republican said, when pundits of the age said it could not be done. Unionists later fought to preserve the nation, he said, even though "a lot of voices" said it could not be done. Cruz continued: "If we go to the 1940s, Nazi Germany — look, we saw it in Britain," Cruz said, as transcribed by the Hill, a Capitol Hill newspaper. "Neville Chamberlain told the British people: ‘Accept the Nazis. Yes, they will dominate the continent of Europe, but that is not our problem. Let's appease them. Why? Because it can't be done. We cannot possibly stand against them.’ "In America," Cruz said, "there were voices who listened to that, I suspect the same pundits who said it couldn't be done. If this had happened in the 1940s, we would have been listening to them. Even then they would have made television. They would have gotten beyond the carrier pigeons and letters and they would have been on TV saying: ‘You cannot defeat the Germans.’" Did Chamberlain declare his country should give way in Europe because it couldn’t withstand or defeat the Germans? We wondered. Senator's statement initially resonates Cruz offered no backup when we asked how he reached his characterization, which initially resonated because Chamberlain was unequivocally disinclined to war with Germany; he spent more than a year hoping diplomacy combined with rearmament would head off a showdown. Historians have written that he was hewing to a strategy of "appeasement," a concept subsequently disparaged along with Chamberlain, who has been characterized as a failed leader who nearly let the Nazis overrun his country. A Chamberlain biographical web page from the BBC touches on the basics: "Like many in Britain who had lived through World War One, Chamberlain was determined to avert another war. His policy of appeasement towards Adolf Hitler culminated in the Munich Agreement in which Britain and France accepted that the Czech region of the Sudetenland should be ceded to Germany. Chamberlain left Munich believing that by appeasing Hitler he had assured 'peace for our time'. However, in March 1939 Hitler annexed the rest of the Czech lands of Bohemia and Moravia, with Slovakia becoming a puppet state of Germany. Five months later in September 1939 Hitler's forces invaded Poland. Chamberlain responded with a British declaration of war on Germany. Historians say it didn't happen Still, four historians (including three based in England) uniformly told us Cruz’s claim was inaccurate in that it’s not correct that Chamberlain told the British people to accept Nazi domination of the continent because Britain couldn’t possibly stand against them. Cruz’s statement is "skewed," William Roger Louis, a University of Texas history professor whose specialties include the history and politics of 20th century Britain, said by telephone. "It’s a very distorted view." On Chamberlain’s embrace of "appeasement," Louis said: "What Chamberlain meant was a reasoned solution to the problem… In retrospect," the term "has come to mean a kind of defeatist view. That wasn’t the case at the time." By email, Chamberlain biographer Nick Smart, who teaches at England’s Plymouth University, said Chamberlain did not say anything about giving in to the Nazis "to anyone, let alone ‘the British people.’ There’s nothing like it in his diaries, speeches, or in any of the biographical treatments I have read." British historian and journalist Andrew Roberts said by email: "Of course" Chamberlain "didn't say that… He guaranteed" the protection of "Poland in 1939 and we were allied to France, so of course he didn't say Europe was not our problem. He declared wa(r) in Sept. 1939 sooner than have the Nazis in Poland and under Chamberlain we put troops into Belgium." Checking Chamberlain biographies Next, we dipped into books on Chamberlain for indications of what he told the British people about letting the Nazis control the continent across the English Channel. Chamberlain became prime minister in May 1937 amid national wariness of another international conflict less than two decades after World War I, what was then called the Great War. Italy’s Mussolini and Germany’s Hitler both showed signs of bellicosity. Chamberlain was mindful, too, that British forces needed time to rebuild, making it necessary for him to exploit diplomacy toward slowing or stopping aggressive moves by the other countries, Smart wrote in his 2010 book, "Neville Chamberlain." Chamberlain, Smart wrote, agreed that Britain "could not hope to meet simultaneously the threats of Germany, Japan and… Italy. It would therefore be necessary, as he saw it, to seek to confine and even isolate the German threat by using diplomacy to keep on friendly terms with Italy and Japan, whatever the provocation." Meantime, Smart wrote, the prime minister accelerated rearmament. Chamberlain’s approach: Hoping for the best and preparing for the worst. Chamberlain also said the country should "show our determination not to be bullied," Smart wrote. As noted by biographer Robert Self, Chamberlain said to the House of Commons in 1938: "It is perfectly evident surely now that force is the only argument Germany understands," going on to stress the import of showing a "visible force of overwhelming strength backed by the determination to use it." Chamberlain acceded on taking of Sudetenland Still, Britain did not object when Hitler occupied German-speaking parts of Czechoslovakia, the Sudetenland, that had been carved by treaty after World War I from what had been the Austro-Hungarian Empire. But later, when Hitler pushed beyond the Sudetenland to Prague, Britain delivered a "guarantee" of Polish independence, followed by similar vows to protect Greece, Romania and Turkey, Smart wrote. Thrice, Chamberlain personally conferred with Hitler, most famously (or infamously) in Munich in September 1938, after which he told the British people to acclaim that he believed he had secured "peace in our time." This was before Hitler pushed farther into Czechoslovakia and, through the summer of 1939, built up forces along Germany’s border with Poland. By email, Chamberlain biographer David Dutton, a professor at the University of Liverpool, told us "Chamberlain did not think the Nazis could be left to get on with what they wanted to do in continental Europe. If this had been the case, he would never have got involved in the 1938 Czechoslovakian crisis in the first place." Dutton also wrote: "What Chamberlain did understand was that Britain was in no position to resist Germany in the 1930s, not least because we could not look to reliable allies," including the isolationist United States. "He justly feared war, especially from the air… but he knew that it might eventually come and that Britain had to prepare for it as best she could," Dutton said. Generally, Dutton called Cruz’s claim "superficial and misleading." Chamberlain in charge when war was declared In the end, Chamberlain was prime minister when Great Britain and France declared war on Germany on Sept. 3, 1939, two days after he told the House of Commons that the British government had made it "crystal clear" to Germany that if it invaded Poland, "we were resolved to oppose them by force." He added that the responsibility belonged to Germany’s leader, Adolf Hitler, "who has not hesitated to plunge the world into misery in order to serve his own senseless ambitions." Noting that German troops had crossed into Poland and bombs were landing on defenseless towns, Chamberlain said: "In these circumstances there is only one course open to us." Chamberlain that day did not indicate the British couldn’t defeat the Nazis. Rather, he said British armed forces were better prepared than they had been for World War I. Chamberlain also indicated he had lost his patience with Germany in Europe. "It now only remains for us to set our teeth and to enter upon this struggle, which we ourselves earnestly endeavored to avoid, with determination to see it through to the end," he said. Otherwise, he said, "we shall merely pass from one crisis to another, and see one country after another attacked by methods which have now become familiar to us in their sickening technique. We are resolved that these methods must come to an end." Our ruling Cruz said Chamberlain "told the British people: ‘Accept the Nazis. Yes, they will dominate the continent of Europe, but that is not our problem. Let's appease them. Why? Because it can't be done. We cannot possibly stand against them.’ " We see an element of truth in this claim; Chamberlain invested repeatedly in diplomacy in hopes of heading off war and he bowed to some German objectives on the continent. But he simultaneously committed to British rearmament and also made it clear, publicly, that his nation would not sit back should Germany invade Poland. We rate this statement as Mostly False.

pomt-13542	Says "Donald Trump himself contributed $100,000" to the Clinton Foundation.	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2016/aug/28/david-plouffe/yes-donald-trump-donated-100000-clinton-foundation/	As Donald Trump amps up attacks on the Clinton Foundation, Democrats are pointing out that Trump himself has given to the nonprofit he now calls a pay-to-play operation. Recently released emails between Hillary Clinton’s aides when she was secretary of state and officials at the Clinton Foundation have demonstrated that some foundation donors did get access to Clinton, though there’s no evidence of direct favors. Addressing the topic on NBC’s Meet the Press, Barack Obama’s former campaign manager David Plouffe noted the Clinton Foundation’s work on HIV/AIDS and malaria and Trump’s own ties to the charity. "The Clinton Foundation, I think it’s a universal agreement, has done remarkable work around the world. I think Donald Trump himself contributed $100,000 to the foundation," he said. Plouffe is right that Trump gave at least $100,000 to the foundation, a fact that Trump and his campaign readily admit. One caveat: It appears that the money came through Trump’s own foundation, not directly from Trump. The Clinton Foundation lists Donald J. Trump as a contributor with a cumulative lifetime donation amount between $100,001 to $250,000. It’s not clear if Trump himself made a personal contribution, but tax forms show that the Donald J. Trump Foundation (which Trump controls) donated $100,000 to the foundation in 2009 and reserved a table at the Clinton Foundation gala for $10,000 in 2010. Trump’s daughter Ivanka is also listed as a donor who gave between $5,001 and $10,000 and her father-in-law, Charles Kushner, gave between $250,001 and $500,000. Trump’s gift amount places him in the top 0.2 percent of the foundation’s donors. Most of its 300,000 donors (85.5 percent) gave less than $250. Breaking it down by dollar amount, however, Trump’s total contribution isn’t that big. We estimated that the foundation has received at least $800 million in donations, over 70 percent of which came from gifts of $1 million or more. In 2009, the Trump Foundation gave $926,750 to some 40 organizations (page 18). The Clinton Foundation received one of the largest gifts that year, matched or surpassed only by the Arnold Palmer Medical Center Foundation ($100,000), the New York Presbyterian Hospital ($125,000) and the Police Athletic League ($156,000). Altogether, the Trump Foundation has donated $5.5 million to 298 charities between 2009 and 2013 according to the nonprofit’s tax forms, Forbes found. Trump did not make any personal contributions to his foundations during this time. (Money for the Trump Foundation in these years came from others and from investment income.) Trump doesn’t deny that he donated to the Clinton Foundation that he now calls a criminal enterprise. During the first GOP primary debate in August 2015, Trump voluntarily brought up his giving to the Clinton Foundation when asked about his previous donations to Hillary Clinton. "When they call, I give. And you know what? When I need something from them two years later, three years later, I call them, they are there for me," Trump said. "With Hillary Clinton, I said be at my wedding, and she came to my wedding. You know why? She didn’t have a choice, because I gave. I gave to a foundation that, frankly, that foundation is supposed to do good. I didn’t know her money would be used on private jets going all over the world." For the record, the Clintons did attend Trump’s third wedding to Melania Knauss, but that occurred in 2005, four years before the $100,000 donation. A few months later, Trump gave pretty similar answers when he was asked to explain the Forbes article on his charitable giving record in late January. "I did give to the Clinton Foundation. What I didn't know is they'd be using it for private aircraft and things like that. The Clinton Foundation was helping with Haiti and with lots of other things and I thought it was going to do some good work. So, it didn't make any difference to me," he said on Jan. 31’s Fox News Sunday. "Again, I was a businessman and it was my obligation to get along with everybody, including the Clintons, including Democrats and liberals and Republicans and conservatives." Our ruling Plouffe said, "Donald Trump himself gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation." Tax records show the Donald J. Trump Foundation gave $100,000 to the Clinton Foundation in 2009, and spent an additional $10,000 for a table at a Clinton Foundation gala the following year. The Clinton Foundation also lists Donald J. Trump (as well his daughter Ivanka and Ivanka’s father-in-law) as a contributor. It’s important to note that Trump made the donation through his foundation, not out of his personal income. But Trump himself acknowledges the donation.

pomt-14501	Says he cured Charlie Sheen and the island of Comoros of HIV with "milk from goats, which had arthritis."	pants on fire!	/global-news/statements/2016/feb/23/samir-chachoua/no-arthritic-goat-milk-cannot-cure-hiv/	An Australian doctor says he cured Charlie Sheen and the island nation of Comoros of HIV with a curious treatment — specifically, arthritic goat’s milk. Samir Chachoua first made headlines in January, when he became the subject of a Dr. Oz intervention. Sheen told Oz that he stopped taking conventional HIV medication for about a month after Chachoua’s treatment made HIV "undetectable" in his blood. Oz pointed out that Chachoua was not licensed to practice medicine in the United States and his method of convincing Sheen — by injecting himself with Sheen’s blood — was not only unorthodox, but highly inappropriate. Sheen agreed to take his medicine again. It gets weirder. A few weeks later, Chachoua expressed his disappointment in Sheen and touted his treatment on Jan. 29’s Real Time with Bill Maher. "I found a place in Mexico with all these IV drug users, prostitutes, all the high profile things that are necessary for AIDS but I didn’t find AIDS," he said. "What I found was, their people were drinking milk from goats, which had arthritis. These goats have a virus called CAEV, and this virus destroys HIV and protects people who drink it for life." This treatment, says Chachoua, not only cured Sheen but helped eradicate HIV in Comoros, an island nation in the Indian Ocean, in 2006. Let’s state off the bat that Chachoua has been, as Maher noted, "called a quack a million times." His claims that he eradicated HIV in Comoros in 2006 and cured Sheen are profoundly untrue. "We have no cure for AIDS and it’s certainly not going to be anything related to goat’s milk," said Jeffrey Laurence, the senior scientific consultant for programs at amfAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research. The facts on CAEV As its name suggests, the caprine arthritis encephalitis virus or CAEV — which is part of the same genus of viruses as HIV — causes arthritis and encephalitis in goats. Some research shows that infected goats may develop antibodies that will "cross react" with HIV. What does this mean? If you remember the lock-and-key model from your biology textbook, you’ll know that your body produces antibodies that are specific to an antigen. Some CAEV antibodies, in addition to flagging CAEV, can also identify HIV. Simply put, they recognize HIV as an antigen. That’s it. There is no evidence these antibodies "destroy" or protect against HIV, said Brian Murphy, a professor of pathology at the University of California Davis’ School of Veterinary Medicine, who’s studied CAEV. Scientists have actually known about this cross-reactivity for decades, but in the grand scheme of AIDS research, it’s meaningless, according to Laurence of amfAR. "It wouldn’t make my list of 100 things to consider in the search for a cure," he said. "There are so many more interesting things to look into without having to look into cross-reactions with goats." Nonetheless, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases did support research into CAEV’s vaccine potential in the 2000s before determining that it wasn’t viable. Currently, there’s a team of scientists at Joseph Fourier University in Grenoble, France, working on a CAEV-based HIV vaccine. Yahia Chebloune, one of the immunologists on the team, explained the concept to us. The team’s vaccine prototype combines CAEV with HIV and SIV (simian immunodeficiency virus). Unlike HIV, CAEV doesn’t destroy T helper cells — the white blood cells essential to the immune system — nor does it replicate as aggressively and indefinitely or create an AIDS-like disease in goats. So when the vaccine was tested on mice, macaques and llamas, their T helper cells weren’t destroyed and the animals could produce antibodies, suggesting that the vaccine was effective in stopping the HIV strains from replicating. Got goat milk None of this suggests that Chachoua has successfully cured Sheen or the 780,000 inhabitants of Comoros against HIV. Simply "drinking milk from goats with arthritis" cannot protect anyone from the virus. CAEV is not transmittable to humans, so Charlie Sheen couldn’t have developed CAEV antibodies — even if they did "destroy" HIV (again, they don't). "This is the craziest story I’ve ever heard," said Chebloune. "The claims of Dr. Sam Chachoua are not scientifically serious." Is it possible that Chachoua inoculated Sheen with a homemade CAEV-based vaccine like Chebloune’s? Our multiple requests for comment went unanswered so we’ll never know for sure. But the one CAEV vaccine prototype we found triggered an immune response in animals and has yet to be tested on humans. What’s more, as Lawrence of amfAR noted, vaccinating someone against a disease is not the same thing as curing it. Then there’s the most damning evidence against Chachou: Sheen is still HIV-positive, while there were 7,900 HIV cases in Comoros in 2012. "I’m not cured, no," Sheen said on Feb. 11’s Dr. Oz. Salvator Niyonzima, who directs the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS in Comoros, told Oz that he and his colleagues "have never heard of Dr. Samir Chachoua." Our ruling Chachoua said he cured Charlie Sheen and Comoros of HIV with "milk from goats which had arthritis." Chachoua is taking a nugget of science and twisting into an absurd claim. There is no proof that CAEV — a relative of HIV that’s studied for its vaccine potential — neutralizes HIV. Sheen and people on the island of Comoros both have HIV.

pomt-03133	Newark is "now home to one-third of all commercial and multi-family development."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/sep/15/cory-booker/cory-booker-claims-newark-represents-third-real-es/	Editor’s Note: On March 14, 2013, PolitiFact New Jersey rated as Mostly True a statement by Newark Mayor Cory Booker that "More than 30 percent of all commercial and multifamily development in the entire state is happening in Newark." We based that ruling on building permit and square footage data provided by the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs, a real-estate development firm that compiled numbers for the Booker administration and experts in the real-estate development industry. Booker, now a candidate in an Oct. 16 special election for the late Frank Lautenberg’s U.S. Senate seat, made the claim again in a form e-mail campaign letter distributed last week. In reanalyzing the claim, we realized that our first ruling didn’t take fully into account how Newark compares statewide in terms of building permits and value of new construction. This fact-check adds that analysis and consequently changes the ruling to Half True. With about a month to go before a special election for a vacant U.S. Senate seat, Democrat Cory Booker is using a Newark statistic to bolster support for his campaign. Booker, Newark’s mayor, cited the Brick City’s real estate growth in a Senate campaign form e-mail received last week by PolitiFact.com. Newark is "now home to one-third of all commercial and multi-family development," said Booker, whose challenger in the Oct. 16 special election is Republican Steve Lonegan, a former mayor of Bogota. That’s quite a claim to make, considering New Jersey has 21 counties and 566 municipalities. But after analyzing this claim, it’s clear the statistic only holds up when measured a particular way. First, let’s explain how real estate growth is measured before we delve into Newark’s numbers. Generally speaking, experts have told PolitiFact New Jersey that the real estate industry standard is to measure residential growth in building permits issued and commercial development in square footage. Why? The barometer for growth in residential real estate is number of units, which is tracked by building permits. That shows demand for households, said Rosemary Scanlon, divisional dean at the New York University Schack Institute of Real Estate and a former chief economist for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. But size matters more in commercial real estate because space can be made to fit the needs of firms moving in, and it’s also an economic indicator of business activity in the community, said Ken Danter, CEO of the Danter Company, a real estate research and consulting firm based in Columbus, Ohio. New Jersey’s Department of Community Affairs, however, tracks data by building permits because permits show "the beginning of the process," said John Lago, the DCA’s housing research manager. "If you’re mixing standards, it’s like mixing centigrade and fahrenheit," Lago said. There’s nothing technically wrong with using one measure for all real estate growth, but it’s not exactly conventional, Scanlon explained. Danter said he wouldn’t mix the two. So it’s clear that there are differing opinions about mixing building permits with square footage to measure growth. Now let’s look at Newark’s numbers. Booker’s city administration shared with us numbers crunched for the mayor by real estate development firm Jones Lang LaSalle, which used a database known as CoStar. Adam Zipkin, Booker’s deputy mayor for economic development, said those developments were measured in square footage. For 2012, New Jersey had projects under construction totaling 3,306,551 square feet. Of that, Newark was responsible for projects totaling 1,168,793 square feet – or 35.3 percent of the state real estate development total, according to the data. So based strictly on square footage, Booker is correct that Newark represents 30 percent of the real estate development going on statewide. But the number is significantly different if we look at building permits and the value of new construction for every municipality in the state. In that case, Newark ranked second for 2012, at $276,225,281, according to DCA data. Jersey City ranked first, at $391,016,932. The total value of new construction statewide in 2012, including state buildings, was $10,941,709,996. By that measure, Newark accounted for just 3 percent of the value of new construction statewide. Our ruling Booker said in a campaign e-mail, Newark is "now home to one-third of all commercial and multi-family development." Data from a real estate development firm compiling statistics for Booker showed that in terms of square footage, Newark accounted for 35 percent – or a bit more than a third -- of the residential and commercial real estate growth last year in New Jersey. So he’s right on that point. But in terms of building permits and value of new construction, Newark can claim just 3 percent of that total. Given that point, the ruling is Half True.

pomt-01157	The federal budget bill "reauthorizes the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which provides taxpayer dollars so that the Four Seasons hotel can build a resort in Turkey."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/dec/15/michael-needham/cromnibus-includes-taxpayer-funding-four-seasons-h/	Saturday night, Congress approved a $1.1 trillion spending bill to fund the government through September. It passed with bipartisan support, but not without criticism from both Democrats and Republicans. On Fox News Sunday Dec. 14, Michael Needham, CEO of conservative activist group Heritage Action, said he was disappointed that Congress approved such a massive spending bill, with what he sees as irresponsible provisions. "They put forth one of the worst pieces of legislation," Needham said. "A $1.1 trillion spending bill that has a carve out for Blue Cross Blue Shield, has a carve out for Wall Street. Reauthorizes something called the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, which provides taxpayer-backed loans so that the Four Seasons Hotel can build a resort in Turkey." We were curious about the last part of Needham’s claim -- that the Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC), a government institution, financed a Four Seasons hotel in Turkey. When we reached out to Needham, his communications team told us that he misspoke -- he meant to say Ritz-Carlton, not the Four Seasons. We consider that to be a minor error that doesn’t distort Needham’s point because both are luxury hotels. That flub aside, we found that Needham’s claim is on target. It is, however, a narrow portrayal of what OPIC does. The hotel in Istanbul (not Constantinople) What’s OPIC? It’s a finance institution run by the federal government. Like a bank, it finances loans with interest and offers political risk insurance. What separates OPIC from other finance institutions, though, is that it helps American businesses break into developing economies -- places where a business might struggle to find private investment locally. For example, OPIC likely wouldn’t back a project in a wealthy country like Austria, where there is plenty of capital available. They would be much more likely to back a project in sub-Saharan Africa. In 2013, OPIC lent $3.75 billion, according to a press release. For 37 consecutive years, the agency has generated a net income for the United States Treasury by collecting interest off its loans and insurance premiums. Supporters say OPIC fosters economic growth in developing nations and benefits American businesses. Opponents, such as Needham, see OPIC as corporate welfare and misuse of tax dollars. In 2000, OPIC gave the Ritz-Carlton Hotel Company a $50 million loan to open a hotel in Turkey, which is the project Needham was talking about. (The Four Seasons, we should note, does have a luxury hotel in Istanbul, but OPIC did not finance it.) According to annual reports, OPIC regularly finances hotels and tourism -- in addition to an array of other industries such as manufacturing, renewable energy and agriculture. In 2013, OPIC financed construction of a hotel in South Sudan, as well as hotel expansions in Armenia and the nation of Georgia. Since 2000, the organization has also financed hotels in Iraq, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Liberia, Guatemala, South Africa and more. OPIC spokesman Charles Stadtlander told PolitiFact that the Ritz-Carlton in Turkey is "well on its way to paying its loan back with interest." Stadtlander said, though, that Needham mischaracterized the hotel by calling it a "resort." He said it is a business-oriented hotel that was built with the idea in mind of bringing CEOs, foreign ministers and investors to Turkey, keeping with OPIC’s economic development mission. The hotel is an "essential piece of business infrastructure," Stadtlander said. Our ruling Needham said OPIC "provides taxpayer-backed loans so that the Four Seasons hotel can build a resort in Turkey." The Ritz-Carlton, not the Four Seasons, received a $50 million OPIC loan to build a hotel in Istanbul in 2000. While Needham got the name of the hotel chain wrong, we think most people would forgive mixing up two high-end hoteliers. That said, talking about building hotels overseas doesn’t give the full picture of what OPIC does. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-06069	"We haven't had any legislation which took away one gun in the past 20 years from anybody in this country--not one."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/09/bill-pascrell/bill-pascrell-claims-no-legislation-has-taken-guns/	There’s another gun battle heating up in Congress that not only divides politicians on the right to bear arms, but to carry them across state lines without penalty. And New Jersey Rep. Bill Pascrell (D-8th Dist.) doesn’t want that to happen. During a Nov. 16 House hearing, Pascrell spoke against the proposed National Right-To-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011. If H.R. 822 becomes law, states that allow people to carry concealed weapons would be required to recognize other states’ valid concealed carry permits. At least 40 states already have some form of reciprocity for out-of-state concealed carry permits. The bill has been referred in the Senate to the Committee on the Judiciary. In opposing the bill, Pascrell said, "We haven't had any legislation which took away one gun in the past 20 years from anybody in this country -- not one." Pascrell’s spokesman, Paul Brubaker said the congressman was specifically referring to federal legislation, noting that his "point would have beeen clearer had he specified that he was referring to nonviolent, law-abiding gun owners." PolitiFact New Jersey found Pascrell’s argument somewhat on target. But two gun-rights organizations we spoke with say two laws do take guns from people. Larry Pratt, executive director of Virginia-based Gun Owners of America, and Joe Waldron, legislative director for the Washington state-based Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, both said a provision of The Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 banned semiautomatic weapons with detachable devices. That, in effect, takes a weapon away from someone who wants it, they said. Brubaker disagreed. "The 1994 federal assault weapons ban prohibited for 10 years the possession, transfer, and manufacturing of semiautomatic assault weapons and large-capacity ammunition feeding devices," Brubaker said in an email. "However, there was a grandfather clause in the bill, and semiautomatic assault weapons that were legally-owned before the ban went into effect were NOT restricted. Those weapons could be transferred and sold within the confines of federal and state laws. … Neither the assault weapons ban, nor any federal prohibition of particular guns from being imported, resulted in the federal government taking legally-owned guns away from Americans." Waldron also pointed to The Domestic Violence Gun Ban, more commonly called the Lautenberg Amendment for its author, Sen. Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ). The amendment to the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act of 1997 bans anyone convicted of a misdemeanor domestic violence offense from owning or possessing a firearm, even if the person had it before the conviction. The law requires that person to immediately surrender the weapon – but not necessarily to law enforcement. That person’s gun and ammunition should be transferred to a "third party who may lawfully receive and possess them, such as their attorney, a local police agency, or a federal firearms dealer. In addition, such firearms and ammunition are subject to seizure and forfeiture," according to the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives website. The result of the Lautenberg Amendment "is that people have been disarmed of weapons within the past 20 years and they’ve been sent to prison when they’ve been caught in possession," Waldron said. The consequences of one’s actions are central to the issue, according to ATF spokesperson Ginger Colbrun. As an example, she said that if a gun owner is convicted of misdemeanor domestic violence, the person’s actions are to blame for him no longer being allowed to possess a weapon -- not the law. "It really is semantics when you look at it," she said. But the person still has to give up the gun and to some, that's taking it away. Our ruling Pascrell said there hasn’t been any legislation in the past 20 years that took a gun from anyone in the United States. Gun advocates disagree, pointing to the federal crime bill and the Lautenberg Amendment as examples. But the facts are a gun can't be taken from someone who never had it, and having to surrender a gun because of a misdemeanor domestic violence conviction can be construed as it being taken away.

pomt-05639	The RESTORE Act started as an "effort to dedicate as much BP fine money as possible towards Gulf Coast restoration" but now "could steer money to places like the Great Lakes and West Coast."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/mar/22/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-oil-spill-fine-money-great-lakes/	A year after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Florida’s two senators -- Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Bill Nelson -- joined forces to support the RESTORE Act, a bipartisan effort to direct money from BP fines to Florida and other Gulf states affected by the 2010 oil spill. But when the bill reached the Senate floor March 8 for a key vote, Rubio voted "no." Why the change of heart? Rubio said the bill that passed the Senate was "far different" than the one he supported in July. "What started as a genuine bipartisan effort to dedicate as much BP fine money as possible towards Gulf Coast restoration has now turned into a raw deal that increases taxes, creates a new environmental bureaucracy, and could steer money to places like the Great Lakes and West Coast that had nothing to do with the oil spill," Rubio said. "This is no longer a Gulf Coast restoration bill, it’s a federal power grab that exploits the BP spill to pay for special interest projects driven by the usual 'what's in it for me' Washington mentality," he said. "I will not support raising taxes to pay for BP’s mess or to pay for new spending projects across the country that have nothing to do with Gulf Coast restoration." Rubio’s vote attracted attention because he was the only Gulf Coast senator to oppose the bill, and because a poll showed the vast majority of Floridians -- including Republicans and tea party supporters -- were in favor of the RESTORE Act. Was Rubio correct to imply that states such as Michigan or California could get money related to the oil spill across the country? We decided to check it out. The RESTORE Act The RESTORE Act stands for the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourism Opportunities and Revived Economies. It was introduced in July 2011 by Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., and was cosponsored by Rubio, Nelson and other senators. The legislation directs 80 percent of the fines in connection with the Deepwater Horizon explosion to go to Gulf Coast projects, and the remainder to the U.S. Treasury. In the Gulf, the money could be used for mitigating damage to wildlife, monitoring fisheries, promoting tourism and job creation. The fines could hit $20 billion. On Sept. 21, the Senate’s committee on Environment and Public Works agreed to add an amendment that would create the National Endowment for the Oceans, a separate project which had stalled after being proposed in July 2010. Rubio is not a member of that committee. As the title suggests, the endowment is a national program with money available for coastal areas including -- you guessed it -- the Great Lakes and West Coast among other places. Environmentalists applauded that addition. "We had the largest ecosystem damaging disaster we ever had," said Brian Moore, legislative director at National Audubon. "Wouldn’t it be a good idea to divert a small portion of that to study the health of all our oceans and large bodies of water?" That "small portion" for the ocean endowment refers to half of the interest from the oil spill fine, not the fine itself. It’s impossible to predict what portion could go to the Great Lakes or West Coast, said Emily Woglom, director of government relations at the Ocean Conservancy. "It will be driven by merits of proposals, and regardless, we are likely talking about millions of dollars for ocean endowment as compared to billions of dollars for the gulf restoration fund," she said. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the RESTORE Act could fund an endowment of $138 million by 2021 for both the ocean endowment and the Gulf of Mexico. On Feb. 15, 2012, Nelson submitted an amendment to the transportation bill in the Senate that included the version of the RESTORE Act with the oceans provision. Rubio was a cosponsor. On March 7, Nelson submitted the amendment again, but Rubio was no longer a cosponsor. On March 8, the Senate passed the amendment 76-22, prompting Rubio’s protest. The Senate passed the full transportation bill March 14 again by 76-22 with Rubio again voting "no." Rubio’s "no" vote on the RESTORE Act puzzled some its supporters: Why didn’t he speak up publicly earlier? Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said that on the original bill that "we made clear on a staff level that Sen. Rubio wouldn’t support the National Endowment for Oceans. … We were hoping the final bill would not include that and (Rubio would) be able to support it." The ocean endowment wasn’t the only part that bothered Rubio. He explained his vote in more detail in an editorial, and he included criticism of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, an existing fund that uses fees from oil and gas leasing in federal waters to purchase and protect land. Language was added to the RESTORE Act to allow the conservation fund to get a boost in money. Woglom of the Ocean Conservancy said that technically the conservation fund isn’t getting BP fine money, but that the RESTORE Act and the Conservation Fund are sharing an offset to cover the increase in spending. Under pay-go budget rules, any change has to be accounted as new spending even if it comes from fines, and therefore needs an offset. The offset comes out of money generated by a delay in an interest rate adjustment for business investment. Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist called that a tax increase. Rubio signed Norquist’s tax pledge in 2009, and if Rubio had voted for the RESTORE Act, Norquist could make the case that Rubio had violated his pledge. Moore, who favors the Land and Conservation Fund, said that isn’t a tax increase -- it extends an existing statute that makes businesses that make a profit overseas continue to pay a tax. RESTORE had not made it into law as of March 20, 2012, because the House had not passed a full transportation bill. The House version of RESTORE doesn’t include the oceans endowment, so the two chambers will need to resolve their differences. Our ruling Rubio said the RESTORE Act started as an "effort to dedicate as much BP fine money as possible towards Gulf Coast restoration" but now "could steer money to places like the Great Lakes and West Coast." It's not the fine money itself that could go to other bodies of water, but interest from the fines. Half the interest could go to an ocean endowment for coastal regions nationwide, including the Great Lakes and West Coast. The bulk of the fines themselves will still go to the Gulf Coast. The small amount was set aside to attract votes from non-Gulf senators. And in fact, the legislation passed the Senate by a wide enough margin to guarantee that Rubio’s home state will get the money and still allow him to say he voted against tax increases. Publicly, Rubio was quiet about the provision to protect other bodies of water for months, though we are rating him here on the truthfulness of his words, not the timing of his protest. Some money from the RESTORE Act could go to the Great Lakes and the West Coast, but the bulk of the money -- particularly the fines themselves -- would still go to the Gulf Coast. We rate his claim Half True.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2012-03-22T18:04:30	2012-03-08	['Gulf_Coast_of_the_United_States', 'BP']
pomt-07484	A Republican proposal changes Medicare for those under age 55 so that they will "participate in the same kind of health plan that members of Congress do."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/13/mike-pence/mike-pence-said-republican-medicare-proposal-will-/	Correction: This item was originally published at about noon on April 13, 2011, based on ABC's transcript of "This Week With Christiane Amanpour." Shortly afterward, Pence's press office notified us that the transcript text was wrong -- leaving out the words "kind of." Listening to the exchange on video, we confirmed the error in our original ruling. As a result, we are republishing this item at about 6 p.m. on April 13 with the correct quote from Pence and have upgraded the ruling from False to Barely True. Republicans have better proposals than Democrats to rein in future federal spending, said Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind., in an appearance on ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour. "House Republicans under Paul Ryan's leadership have offered a vision to put America back on a pathway toward a balanced budget," Pence said. "It deals with issues in entitlements. It reduces the national debt. For Americans 55 or older, we're not proposing a single change in Medicare... What we want to do for Americans under the age of 55 is make sure they can participate in the same kind of health plan that members of Congress do." Pence’s final claim about Medicare drew a response from Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., who was also on the show. "That is not accurate," Van Hollen said. "Members of Congress have what is called a fair-share deal. We do not bear the entire risk of increased costs. They are asking seniors to bear risks (that) they are not asking themselves." Pence replied, "Members of Congress have the same premium support system, Chris knows that." We decided to see who was right by fact-checking Pence’s statement that future Medicare beneficiaries will be able to "participate in the same kind of health plan that members of Congress do." The Medicare proposal Pence and Van Hollen mentioned comes from Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chair of the House Budget Committee. His 2012 budget proposal, called The Path to Prosperity: Restoring America’s Promise, lays out many ways to reduce federal spending, including changes to entitlement programs including Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for Americans 65 or older. Right now, Medicare is a single-payer plan: The government pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care Medicare beneficiaries receive. (Beneficiaries contribute premiums, and active workers contribute payroll taxes.) Under Ryan’s plan, people who are not yet 55 would not receive traditional Medicare, but would instead qualify for government "premium support" to help them buy health insurance from a private company starting in 2022. (Ryan’s plan specifically says this is not a "voucher" program, since the government will pay the insurance companies directly.) Premium supports would be higher for people who require more health care. Here’s how Ryan’s plan explains it: "When younger workers become eligible for Medicare, they will be able to choose from a list of guaranteed coverage options, enjoying the same kind of choices in their plans that members of Congress enjoy today. Medicare would then provide a payment to subsidize the cost of the plan. In addition, Medicare will provide increased assistance for lower-income beneficiaries and those with greater health risks." Ryan’s proposal requires the private insurance companies to accept all comers and to charge the same rate for people who are the same age. The plans would have to comply with a standard for benefits set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which is how members of Congress buy their insurance. Additionally, Ryan’s plan gradually raises the Medicare eligibility age to 67, and it provides smaller premium supports to high earners. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzed Ryan’s proposal and found that it will save the government money. But it does so by asking future Medicare beneficiaries to pay more to buy insurance. "A private health insurance plan covering the standardized benefit would, CBO estimates, be more expensive currently than traditional Medicare. Both administrative costs (including profits) and payment rates to providers are higher for private plans than for Medicare," the CBO concluded. Now let’s look at how whether proposal looks like what members of Congress can buy. • How the plan is like what members of Congress get. We contacted Pence’s office to ask about how the Ryan proposal is like what members of Congress get, and they pointed us to the fact that Medicare plans from private insurers will be required to comply with a benefits standard set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, as do plans that cover members of Congress. We should also note that seniors would be able to compare different plans and select from different insurance options, as members of Congress do. The government would pay part of premiums, as it does for members of Congress. • How the plan is not like what members of Congress get. First, the plans would be created specifically for Medicare beneficiaries on newly created Medicare health insurance exchanges. (Exchanges are virtual marketplaces where people can shop for insurance.) Second, as Van Hollen pointed out, members of Congress are protected somewhat when health insurance companies raise their rates, through a formula he mentioned known as "Fair Share." Generally speaking, the government pays for 75 percent of the average of the health insurance plans it offers. If the overall plans increase in price, the government still pays 75 percent. Federal support for premiums in Ryan’s plan, though, would not keep pace with medical inflation. Premium support instead would be pegged to the consumer price index, which historically lags health care costs. Our final point on how the plans differ may seem obvious to some, but we feel it’s important to mention: Members of Congress receive employer-based insurance. By definition, that means they receive a salary to help pay for their insurance. The base pay for members of Congress is currently $174,000. Medicare beneficiaries, on the other hand, tend to make a lot less money, because most of them are retired. The median income for Medicare beneficiaries was $20,644 in 2010. And only 5 percent had incomes exceeding $82,695, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. "As policymakers consider options for decreasing federal Medicare spending and addressing the federal debt and deficit, this analysis raises questions about the extent to which the next generation of Medicare beneficiaries will be able to bear a larger share of costs," the foundation concluded in an April 2011 report. Our ruling We should emphasize that Ryan’s Medicare proposal is only a broad outline right now, and there are many unanswered questions about it. But what we do know about it strikes us as fundamentally different from the kind of employer-provided health insurance that members of Congress receive. At a minimum, the premium supports will not keep pace with the historic record of rapidly increasing health care costs. Additionally, seniors make significantly less income than members of Congress and will likely not have the same options to buy more expensive plans. And, finally, they will not the same protection against rising costs that "Fair Share" provides members of Congress. We rate Pence’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.

pomt-07284	The U.S. has "over $62 trillion in unfunded liabilities."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/may/23/frank-wolf/rep-frank-wolf-says-us-has-over-62-trillion-unfund/	Weeks ago, when credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s downgraded its outlook for U.S. debt from "stable" to "negative," Rep. Frank R. Wolf, R-10th, was not surprised. "The warning flags are flying as we move closer and closer to the edge of the financial cliff," Wolf said in a statement on his website, pointing to his own previous alerts that the the nation’s mighty Triple-A credit rating was in jeopardy. Wolf called the downgrade a "predictable warning," adding: "I've been sounding a similar one for almost five years as I've tried to get the attention of Congress and the past and present administrations that America cannot continue on its current debt and deficit track, with over $14 trillion of debt, over $62 trillion in unfunded liabilities, and over one trillion dollar deficits projected for years to come," Wolf added. There’s one number in there that failed to ring a bell. We know the national debt is more than $14 trillion; in fact, we recently reached the debt limit of $14.3 trillion. It’s also true that future deficit projections -- under the current budget plan -- exceed $1 trillion annually. But is it true that the U.S. has more than $62 trillion in unfunded liabilities? We thought it was worth a look. For a source, Wolf’s office pointed to a 2010 report from the Peter G. Peterson Foundation, an organization devoted to public awareness of fiscal issues. The study contains a table entitled "Major Fiscal Exposure." A sum of $61.9 trillion is calculated for 2009, adding "explicit liabilities" (public debt, pensions, etc.) "commitments and contingencies" and "social insurance promises" (future social security benefits and future Medicare benefits). Predictably, the biggest driver of the staggering total is social insurance promises, which accounts for $45.8 trillion -- $38.2 trillion of which is future Medicare benefits. Social Security benefits account for the rest. As noted in fine print, the projections come from the Social Security and Medicare Trustees reports dated Jan. 1, 2009, and estimate benefits over the next 75 years. The rest of the data comes from the U.S. Treasury’s 2009 report. First, there’s an issue of terminology. "Technically, Mr. Wolf is in error because he calls the shortfalls in Social Security and Medicare ‘unfunded liabilities’" said J.D. Foster, an economist with the right-leaning Heritage Foundation. "Legally, they are not liabilities. They can be referred to accurately as promises or obligations." Foster said the benefits do not qualify as liabilities because "Congress can at any time reduce or alter them. In contrast, state pension plans are contractual labor arrangements that are liabilities because they are legally enforceable." Gary Burtless, an economist with the left-leaning Brookings Institution, agreed, calling the idea that the government "owes" trillions of dollars to future citizens from a variety of programs under rules that are currently in effect "ridiculous." "The Supreme Court has ruled that the U.S.A. does not have a contractual obligation to pay Social Security and Medicare under rules that Congress has no power to change," Burtless said in an email. "No citizen can expect to win a lawsuit that demands that benefits be paid that are as generous as the benefits that were ‘promised’ under some old, presumably more generous set of rules." Nevertheless, we’ll limit the Truth-O-Meter point reductions on this point because the Peterson Foundation report and media reports we found refer to the future Social Security and Medicare benefits as "liabilities" rather than "obligations." The next problem is less debatable: the information is outdated. According to the latest Medicare and Social Security trustees reports, the numbers have changed significantly since 2009. Promised Medicare benefits for the next 75 years now total $24.6 trillion, according to 2011 numbers, and Social Security benefits have increased to $9.2 trillion. So Medicare obligations are now $13.6 trillion less than the data upon which Wolf based his claim , largely due to the health care reform act passed last year. Social Security obligations are $1.5 trillion trillion more. The net effect of those changes is that projections for future obligations are $12 trillion less than the 2009 data Wolf uses. But the trustees reports for this year hadn’t been released when Wolf made his claim, so we must look at the 2010 reports. Last year’s projections showed Medicare obligations to be $22.78 trillion over the 75 years and Social Security at $7.95 trillion for a total of $30.73 trillion. Using that comparison, Wolf’s off by even more, $15 trillion. And of course the debt has also changed. In the report Wolf cites, the publicly-held debt -- U.S. bonds held by individuals, institutions and foreign nations -- is listed as $7.6 trillion. On the day he issued his statement, it was $9.7 trillion. So add $2.1 trillion back and he’s off by almost $13 trillion. Other numbers have changed, too, but you get the point: The 2009 estimate was not a safe number in April 2011. Others argue that estimating unfunded obligations 75 years into the future is never safe. "One can certainly come up with all kinds of scary – but essentially meaningless – estimates of the ‘unfunded liability’ of the federal government’s programs," Burtless, the Brookings economist, said. "As a general rule of thumb, the bigger the estimate, the more meaningless it is." Burtless noted that the numbers change wildly based on annual policy decisions and a 75-year measure was is arbitrary because obligation don’t end then. "It is impossible to predict 25 years into the future with much accuracy, let alone 75 years or all of eternity," he said. So let’s review. Wolf claims that the U.S. faces "over $62 trillion in unfunded liabilities." First, he and many others misuse the term "unfunded liabilities" to describe the future costs of government promises. Unlike a home mortgage, the U.S. is not locked into paying a certain amount based on existing terms. In fact, Congress changes the terms all the time. Secondly, the numbers Wolf based his claim on are badly outdated. In fact, using the 75-year estimates he cites, the figure would be significantly lower than $62 trillion based on 2011 figures. So, while Wolf’s claim is based on an actual figure, it’s an old one that was shaky to begin with given the distant projection and likelihood of change. We rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04827	Says Paul Ryan "wants to cut Pell Grant scholarships for nearly 10 million students."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/16/eva-longoria/desperate-housewives-actress-obama-activist-says-p/	On the day Mitt Romney named U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate, actress Eva Longoria fired off a series of Twitter attacks on the presumptive Republican presidential ticket. The Aug. 11, 2012 tweets by Longoria, who describes herself as an activist as well as an actress, included this one: "Today Mitt Romney picked Paul Ryan, who wants to cut Pell Grant scholarships for nearly 10 million students!" Longoria is no politician, but she is political, serving as a national co-chair of President Barack Obama’s 2012 re-election campaign. Known for her role as Gabrielle Solis on the TV series "Desperate Housewives," Longoria has appeared at Obama campaign events since being chosen to one of the 35 largely ceremonial co-chair posts. At a Denver rally in July 2012, she told Obama supporters: "We have to get out there and tell (others) ‘If you’re a woman, there is no way you can vote Republican.’" But what about financially needy college students? How would Ryan’s plan affect them? Longoria’s evidence Longoria’s tweet about Ryan and student aid included a link to a page on Obama’s campaign website focused on Romney and Ryan. (So did a tweet nearly identical to Longoria’s made the same day by actress Ashley Judd.) The page slams a budget proposal Ryan made as chairman of the House Budget Committee. "To pay for tax cuts for the wealthiest," the Ryan plan would, among other things, cut "Pell Grant scholarships for nearly 10 million students," the Obama campaign says. So, we know where Longoria got the information for her tweet. But the site doesn’t provide any evidence that would back the claim. Fortunately, our colleagues at PolitiFact National evaluated a similar statement made by Obama himself in April 2012, a few days after the GOP-controlled House approved Ryan’s budget resolution. (The plan didn't pass in the Democratic-controlled Senate.) Obama said that if spending reductions in the resolution "were to be spread out evenly," nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each. The White House told our colleagues the president was referring to the Pell Grant program. So, Ryan's plan does not specify cuts to Pell Grants. Obama is simply applying the total spending cuts in the plan evenly across the overall budget to derive a Pell Grant number. Dissecting Obama’s claim Let’s look at what PolitiFact National found in evaluating Obama’s statement: Federal Pell Grants provide the largest source of grant funding for needy college students (although Ryan contends the grants should be targeted more to lower-income students). More than 9.7 million students are expected to get grants in 2013, according to the U.S. Education Department. By the president’s calculation, applying the Ryan budget cuts evenly would reduce the maximum Pell grant -- $5,500 for the 2011-2012 school year -- to $4,595, leaving some students with nothing at all and cutting grants for nearly 10 million students by an average of more than $1,000 per student. Budget experts said that because the Ryan spending cuts lacked detail, it was fair for Obama to assume the cuts would be applied evenly. But Obama himself acknowledged that Republicans hadn’t specified the Pell cuts themselves and that they might apply cuts in ways other than he assumed. Indeed, the Ryan plan budget resolution -- which is a guidance document, not a line-by-line budget -- doesn’t mention Pell grant funding; and any funding cuts would be made by House committees. Moreover, a House Budget Committee report accompanying Ryan’s budget resolution suggested the maximum Pell grant remain at $5,500, contradictory to Obama’s claim. Our colleagues concluded that Obama’s statement was accurate using his set of assumptions, but his assumptions ignored what House Republicans said was a preference that Pell grant maximums not be reduced. Obama’s claim was rated Half True. FactCheck.org also looked at Pell Grants and Ryan’s plan. The University of Pennsylvania-based fact checkers concluded"it is certainly true that Ryan’s budget would require deep spending cuts," but "it is hard to know what impact Ryan’s budget would have on specific programs because the plan contains so few details." We also sought input from Gillian Morris, spokeswoman for Obama’s campaign in Wisconsin, and Kevin Seifert, campaign manager for Ryan, who remains on the November 2012 ballot for his House seat. Obama’s campaign cited an April 2012 opinion column by The New York Times’ Paul Krugman, which claims without evidence that 1 million students would lose Pell grants altogether. But that wasn’t Obama’s or Longoria’s claim. The campaign also provided a March 2012 blog post by Obama’s Office of Management and Budget director, but it uses the same assumptions the president did in his claim. Ryan’s plan would make fewer students eligible for Pell money, according to an article in the conservative National Review cited by Ryan’s spokesman. But while bringing Pell spending "under control," the budget would nevertheless maintain the maximum Pell grant at $5,500, Ryan wrote in response to criticism of his plan. Our rating Longoria said Ryan "wants to cut Pell Grant scholarships for nearly 10 million students." Her claim is slightly different than one made by Obama, who arrived at his 10 million figure by assuming spending cuts called for in Ryan's budget plan would be made uniformly across federal programs. Nevertheless, she uses Obama's methodology in making her claim. We’re giving Longoria the same rating Obama got for making a claim that is partially accurate but leaves out important details -- Half True.

pomt-00001	"Nearly 200,000 Florida voters may not be citizens."	false	/florida/statements/2018/nov/13/donald-trump-jr/donald-trump-jrs-misleading-tweet-about-noncitizen/	As President Donald Trump floated baseless claims about fraud in the counting of ballots in Florida, his son chimed in on Twitter to imply that the state had a huge number of noncitizen voters. "Amazing, but not shocking at all anymore. Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens https://www.nbcmiami.com/news/local/Nearly-200000-Florida-Voters-May-Not-Be-Citizens-151212725.html … via @nbc6," Donald Trump Jr. tweeted on Nov. 12. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The tweet drew more than 28,000 likes in less than 24 hours. But it isn't accurate. It is based on a cherry-picked number from a headline that didn’t tell the full story back in 2012. At the outset of the state’s effort to purge noncitizens from the voter rolls, state officials came up with the list of about 182,000 names. But Trump Jr. omits that the final number of noncitizens purged was a tiny speck of that original number. When examined in the context of all the registered voters — or even ballots cast — in Florida or the nation, proven voter fraud by noncitizens is rare. History of noncitizen purge Florida engaged in a controversial attempt to search for noncitizen voters leading up to the 2012 election. The search was rife with errors, and was ultimately dropped after few were found. Shortly after Republican Gov. Rick Scott took office in 2011, he asked his top election official at the time to look into removing noncitizens from the voter rolls. By 2012, the Division of Elections put together a list of potential noncitizens based on driver’s license data. Trump cited a headline from early in that process. He linked to a May 2012 story on NBC Miami’s website headlined: "2012Election: Nearly 200,000 Florida Voters May Not Be Citizens." The story was written by the Associated Press. Why was the president’s son sharing a six-year-old story? Matthew Gertz of the liberal Media Matters website noted that before Trump Jr.’s tweet, conservative pundits publicized the 2012 story. David Wohl, the father of conspiracy theorist Jacob Wohl, tweeted a link to the story on Nov. 10, as did Harlan Hill and Charlie Kirk. On Nov. 12 before Trump Jr.’s tweet, NBC Miami included an editor’s note on top of the original story. First, it reminded readers that the story was published in 2012. Then, it went over the history lesson of how the state’s list contained errors: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The AP had reported that the initial list turned up nearly 182,000 people who may not be U.S. citizens, based on the driver’s license data. Of that group, the state sent an initial list of more than 2,600 voters’ names to county election supervisors. As we have reported and the NBC editor’s note points out, the state ultimately whitted the list and removed 85 voters because they were "not a U.S. citizen." Supervisors had noted all sorts of errors and later used words such as "sloppy" and "embarrassing" to describe the state initiative, PolitiFact found. One of the problems was that the driver’s license data doesn’t get updated when a legal resident later becomes a citizen. By September 2012, when the Division of Elections produced a new list of about 200 ineligible voters, supervisors were fed up, and the effort appeared to fizzle as the presidential election drew near. The state said it would launch yet another effort to purge noncitizens from the voter rolls almost a year later, but scrapped it. We were unable to find any other sort of comprehensive data on noncitizen voters removed in Florida. We reached out to the state Division of Elections but did not hear back by deadline. Jason Snead tracks proven instances of election fraud in the U.S. for the conservative Heritage Foundation, which includes cases that resulted in criminal convictions, fines or an official finding of fraud. He said the database shows 13 entries from Florida involving a noncitizen who successfully registered and/or voted in an election. These cases were from 2003-06. A May 2017 report by New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice found that election officials in 42 jurisdictions referred an estimated 30 incidents of suspected noncitizen voting for further investigation or prosecution out of more than 23 million votes. "The kind of instances in which an individual voter tries to pretend to be somebody else or votes when he or she isn’t eligible are not the statistically meaningful events that we need to be worried about," Myrna Pérez, director of the center’s Voting Rights and Elections project and co-author of the study, said to the Austin American-Statesman. Our ruling As Florida underwent a recount of three key races, Trump Jr. tweeted a headline that said "nearly 200,000 Florida voters may not be citizens." He said it was "amazing, but not shocking at all anymore." It’s actually not true, and years old. The story itself provides a more complete picture — and an editor’s note with clarifications that Trump overlooked. The state’s 2012 voter purge started with a list of potentially 182,000 noncitizens on the voter rolls. State officials whittled that list to more than 2,600 names sent to county election supervisors. Ultimately 85 noncitizens were removed. We rate this claim False.

pomt-06689	Says the federal government is "the largest energy user in the country."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/07/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-us-government-nations-largest/	Ohio's Sen. Rob Portman is co-sponsor of the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, introduced in May, which aims to promote energy savings in residential and commercial buildings and industry through the use of energy-efficient technology, building codes and financial incentives. Portman says the bipartisan measure will help the economy, among other benefits, by increasing productivity and creating jobs. In an article written for the Toledo Blade, the first-term Republican said the legislation will also save millions of tax dollars because "it will require the federal government — the largest energy user in the country — to adopt energy-saving techniques." That stirred the curiosity of PolitiFact Ohio, if not our skepticism. Is the federal government really the country's biggest energy user? And -- drum roll -- how big is it? We asked Portman's office for background. Highlighting the bill's bipartisan support, they reached across the aisle and down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House. President Obama, they noted, announced last year that the federal government would reduce its greenhouse gas pollution 28 percent by 2020, to "lead by example in building the clean energy economy." "As the largest energy consumer in the United States," the president said, "we have a responsibility to American citizens to reduce our energy use and become more efficient. Our goal is to lower costs, reduce pollution, and shift Federal energy expenses away from oil and towards local, clean energy." Showing how large a consumer it is, the White House said the government spent more than $24.5 billion on electricity and fuel in 2008 alone. Keep in mind, that does not pay simply for heating and cooling buildings in Washington. It includes the costs of fueling military jets, ships and vehicles. The Defense Department is the single biggest energy user in government. Kateri Callahan, president of the Alliance to Save Energy -- a coalition of business, government, environmental, and consumer leaders -- gave testimony to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in support of Portman's bill in June. "Without the energy efficiency improvements we’ve made since 1973, we would need about 50 percent more energy to power today’s economy than we are currently using," she said, citing earlier federal efforts to reduce energy use and pollution. "As the nation's largest energy consumer," Callahan said, "it is critically important that the federal government lead by example." How large is largest? Callahan said the government accounted for 1.6 quadrillion BTUs of energy use in fiscal 2008, costing $24.5 billion. That use represented about 1.6 percent of the nation's energy consumption for the year, she said. The Alliance to Save Energy told us her source was the Federal Energy Management Program's annual report to Congress in January 2010. Portman's office provided the same report, which is based on data submitted by federal agencies to the Department of Energy. Its website has figures dating back to 1949. On the Truth-O-Meter, Portman’s statement rates as True.	None	Rob Portman	None	None	None	2011-09-07T06:00:00	2011-08-28	['None']
pomt-08147	"In 2009, Jim Doyle and the Democrats rushed through a budget repair bill with billions in tax increases and held no public hearings."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/05/jeff-fitzgerald/jeff-fitzgerald-says-gov-jim-doyle-and-democrats-r/	One of the Republican leaders at the new-look Wisconsin statehouse thinks he knows exactly why voters ushered Democrats out the door in November -- they operated in secret and were careless with your tax dollars. So says state Rep. Jeff Fitzgerald (R-Horicon), the incoming Assembly speaker. In a Nov. 29, 2010 news release under the headline "Democrats continue closed-door deals," Fitzgerald warned against a possible December special session to approve labor deals with state employee unions before Republicans take control in January. He then reached back a year to portray a pattern of bad conduct: "In 2009, (Gov.) Jim Doyle and the Democrats rushed through a budget repair bill with billions in tax increases and held no public hearings." As devoted Madison watchers, that raised a few obvious questions: Were there really no hearings, not a one? And "billions" of tax hikes slipped into a bill meant to fix a mid-budget shortfall? In short: Is Fitzgerald rewriting history? When we asked Fitzgerald spokesman Jim Bender about the tax figure, he told us he erred in using "billions." Oops. The Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the official scorekeeper, estimated the repair bill would raise $290 million from tax changes. The main source was "combined reporting," in which lawmakers closed what some viewed as a loophole that allowed corporations to shuffle profits to subsidiaries in states that don’t tax them. If a new fee on hospital revenue was included, the new revenue total was $1.2 billion over three years, according to the fiscal bureau. That element features its own mini debate: The fiscal bureau calls the hospital assessment a fee. Media reports commonly referred to it as a tax. Hospitals backed the fee because it allowed the state to tap a large new stream of federal money that boosts Medicaid reimbursement to hospitals; Republicans derided it as a "sick tax" that would raise costs to patients. Bender told us he counted the hospital fees as a tax -- but mistakenly used "billions." "Normally, I use specifics, but in this instance generalized," he said. So, the underlying math in the statement is off -- by either $800 million or $1.71 billion, depending on how you view the hospital fee. But what about the way the bill was passed? It was pushed through the Legislature at warp speed -- two days -- when compared with four previous repair bills dating to 2002. The range on those was from 21 to 150 days. The speed was partly a function of the Democrats controlling both houses and the governor’s office. As for the lack of public hearings, Fitzgerald is right -- there were none. But a look into the past shows a spotty record on such hearings when it comes to budget repair bills -- with Republicans and Democrats both on the hook for blame or credit. We looked back at four such bills -- one in 2002 offered by Republican Gov. Scott McCallum -- and three earlier fixes under Doyle, a Democrat. Budget repair bills have become much more common in recent years as the economy sagged. On the earlier Doyle bills, the Legislature twice held public hearings. In one case, Republicans controlled both chambers; the parties shared control in the other. But in 2007, another year with split control, no public hearing accompanied the action. Under McCallum in 2002, lawmakers convened two such hearings on a highly contentious plan. The two parties split control at that time as well. Let’s consign this discussion to the dustbin of history. No matter how you add it up, Fitzgerald misfired badly on the tax figure he used in his news release slamming Democrats. His own aide admitted it. He is correct on the rushed nature of the 2009 budget fix. On the question of public hearings, Fitzgerald is right there were none -- but his rhetoric skipped past the fact such hearings have not always been held. Indeed, both parties have had a hand in that fact. We rate his claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Jeff Fitzgerald	None	None	None	2010-12-05T09:00:00	2010-11-29	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Jim_Doyle']
pomt-13430	Says that Republican Darryl Glenn has described Democrats as "evil" and has said he's "tired of hearing about Republicans reaching across the aisle."	true	/colorado/statements/2016/sep/19/michael-bennet/bennet-glenn-said-democrats-are-evil-and-hes-tired/	During a U.S. Senate debate in Colorado, Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet said his Republican opponent, Darryl Glenn, has said that Democrats are "evil" and he's "tired of hearing about Republicans reaching across the aisle." The confrontation happened at the end of a Sept. 10 debate at the Club 20 forum in Grand Junction, where three opponents -- Bennett, Glenn and Libertarian candidate Lily Tang Williams -- were allowed to question opponents for three minutes. Bennet, who went last, saved his fire for Glenn, an El Paso County commissioner. "Over the course of this campaign you said, 'I don't know any elected Democrats I get along with.’ You said, 'I'm running against Democrats, I'm running against evil.’ And you said you're 'tired of hearing about Republicans reaching across the aisle,'" Bennet told Glenn. "Your policies and views, like privatizing the V.A. and calling for the elimination and defunding of all agencies like the Department of Education and also EPA and Energy, are far to the right of many Colorado Republicans. "How exactly would you get anything done (in Congress) and live up to your own standards?" Bennet asked. Glenn didn’t answer the question. Instead he countered that Bennet’s "idea of reaching across the aisle is supporting the Iran nuclear deal. His idea of reaching across the aisle is having Republicans support the Affordable Care Act when we already know the devastating impact that's happening to people. His idea of reaching across the aisle is supporting EPA standards that are going to result in over 1,200 jobs that are being lost here." (Watch the exchange at 01:07:00 in the video) In his rebuttal, Bennet said Glenn was wrong and highlighted his bipartisan collaboration on the No Child Left Behind education law and the 2013 immigration bill. In this fact-check, we examine Bennet’s claim that Glenn has described his fight against Democrats as "running against evil" and complained about fellow Republicans "reaching across the aisle." While Colorado -- like the rest of country -- has passionate political divisions, voters also want their elected leaders to work together for the betterment of the Centennial State. There are more registered independent voters in the state than Republicans or Democrats. Yet, with little money and a shoe-string campaign, Glenn won a surprise upset in a crowded Republican primary. Glenn has repeatedly said that Republicans and Democrats working together is what’s wrong with Congress. The Denver Post reported that a growing number of Republican strategists are concerned about Glenn's campaign strategy against Bennet and his apparent inability to reach beyond Republican voters. PolitiFact confirmed that Glenn made all the comments quoted by Bennet at the debate -- often repeating his disdain for Republicans who work with Democrats. The Bennet campaign turned a montage of Glenn’s edgy remarks into a video ad called, "Across the Aisle." Here's a sampling: "I'm running against the Democrats. I'm running against evil" -- Glenn at a North JeffCo Tea Party event, April 16, 2015. "I don't know any elected Democrats that I get along with" -- Glenn during a Republican U.S. Senate candidates debate on KUSA-TV, April 5, 2016. "I'm tired of Republicans complaining. I'm tired of Republicans wanting to just reach across the aisle. We need to stand up and lead" -- Glenn on KLZ-560 AM on April 11, 2016. Listen to his comments at 2:20 in the interview During a May 25 Republican Senate candidate primary debate on Colorado Public Television, Glenn rebuked a moderator who asked how he'd "work across party lines and try to find some consensus and some compromise" and "get something done" in a polarized Congress. "I think your question exemplifies what’s wrong with America and the frustration that's out there. You don't get it," Glenn replied. "The bottom line is it’s not about reaching across the aisle. The bottom line is...leadership. You need to actually have a leader to stand up there and represent the values of what's going on in this country." (Watch the exchange at 44:30 in this debate video.) We asked the Glenn campaign if he disputed the accuracy of the quotes cited by Bennet. They did not respond. Our ruling Bennet said that Republican Darryl Glenn has described Democrats as "evil" and has said he's "tired of hearing about Republicans reaching across the aisle." Glenn doesn't back away from his disdain for bipartisanship. He told a debate moderator who asked how he’d worked with Democrats to get something done in the Senate that "your question exemplifies what’s wrong with America."

pomt-14196	"Pennsylvania has lost 35 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001" and "Harrisburg has lost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001."	mostly true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/apr/22/donald-trump/donald-trump-and-number-manufacturing-jobs-pennsyl/	Donald Trump focused a campaign rally in Harrisburg Thursday on bringing back manufacturing jobs to a state that’s lost more than many others in the past decade. The presidential frontrunner bolstered his point by telling thousands of supporters at the Pennsylvania Farm Show Complex: "Pennsylvania has lost 35 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001" and later added that Harrisburg, the state capital, "has lost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001." That seemed like a large percentage of jobs lost. So we decided to check the claim. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, Pennsylvania lost nearly 300,000 manufacturing jobs since January 2001, decreasing from 856,200 to 564,900 in the span of 15 years. That correlates with a 34 percent decrease in jobs lost -- quite close to Trump’s 35 percent claim. However, the job loss in Harrisburg is off. The Bureau of Labor Statistics shows the Harrisburg metropolitan area had 30,500 manufacturing jobs in January 2001 and now is home to 21,400. That’s a decrease of 30 percent, not 40 percent as Trump claimed Thursday. His campaign didn’t respond to a request for comment. Trump was right when he told supporters in Harrisburg that Pennsylvania has been among the hardest hit in the country by a loss in manufacturing jobs. The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank based in Washington, D.C., reported last year that eight states lost more than 200,000 manufacturing jobs since 1998 -- Pennsylvania came in seventh behind California, Ohio, North Carolina, New York, Michigan and Illinois. That job loss is significant for a state that, in 2013, employed 10 percent of its job force in the manufacturing sector and made 12 percent of its gross domestic product from the industry. Major hubs of manufacturing the state were, at one point, steel mills in western Pennsylvania, Bethlehem, and the shipyard in South Philadelphia. The size of those industries has largely decreased since their heyday. Kevin L. Kearns, president of the United States Business and Industry Council, a Washington, D.C.-based organization that represents mid-sized manufacturing companies, said manufacturing job loss since 2001 can be chalked up to globalization and the proliferation of the use of robotics in manufacturing. He said thousands of jobs were lost in the manufacturing sector to technology. But the companies his organization represented that shut down in the last decade didn’t do so because of technology -- they did it because other companies in their supply chain had outsourced to other countries. Kearns said the impact of manufacturing job loss has an impact on every corner of the Pennsylvania economy, as people who were once middle class are now either jobless or in other industries that may not pay as well, causing them to spend less in other ways. "In a generalized way, it means that people in Pennsylvania are earning less money," he said. "It has a massive footprint and a massive ripple effect." Our ruling In an attempt to show Pennsylvanians he would work to bring back jobs, Trump said "Pennsylvania has lost 35 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001" and "Harrisburg has lost 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001." The figure about the statewide manufacturing job loss checks out, but his claim about Harrisburg losing 40 percent of its manufacturing jobs since 2001 is off by about 10 percent.

abbc-00260	Liberal MP Craig Kelly has claimed that poorly heated homes cause more deaths in Australia than in Sweden, despite our milder winters.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-09/fact-check-australia-sweden-winter-fatalities-heating/8780588	Mr Kelly's claim is overstated. The evidence supports the claim that more Australians than Swedes die in cold temperatures, and these deaths relate to moderate – rather than extreme – cold. But while temperature is a factor, lifestyle and general health risks also play a role, making it hard to attribute winter deaths to moderate cold alone. Deaths peak every winter in Australia, with cardiovascular disease contributing significantly to the rise. And although winter increases the risks associated with circulatory diseases, this could be due to the cold or alternatively, to infections. Cold temperatures can raise blood pressure and increase cardiovascular strain, so people living in cold houses are at added risk. This would appear to support Mr Kelly's claim. But it is a stretch to say deaths are "simply" the result of inadequate heating. Our habits also play a part in keeping warm. Experts are split on the best way to address the effect of indoor cold on winter mortality. We could improve indoor temperatures through insulating or heating homes, or we could address the health problems exacerbated by the cold.

pomt-10565	"I'm the only Republican who has gotten endorsements in this presidential race from major labor unions..."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/08/mike-huckabee/unions-gave-huck-their-gop-nod/	It's not often that we hear a Republican presidential candidate crowing about support from unions. "I'm the only Republican who has gotten endorsements in this presidential race from major labor unions, the international painters union as well as the machinists and aerospace workers — first time in over 100 years from either union," Huckabee said in a TV interview the day after Super Tuesday. Huckabee is correct on a few points here. Unions don't usually endorse Republican candidates, and they support Democratic candidates with contributions by margins of roughly 9 to 1, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. But this year, two unions decided to endorse candidates in the primaries for both parties: The International Union of Painters and Allied Trades with 160,000 members, and the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers with 720,000 members. In the Democratic race, both unions endorsed Sen. Hillary Clinton, and in the Republican race, both endorsed Mike Huckabee. We called both unions and they confirmed the "100 years" statement because it's the first time they've endorsed Republican candidates since they formed more than 100 years ago. James Williams, head of the International Painters, said the union decided to endorse Republicans this year as a way of reflecting the sentiments of their Republican members, who make up about 30 percent of the union. The painters mailed out a ballot to more than 160,000 members and asked them to vote in each race and Huckabee was the GOP choice. Add to that the fact that some members live in heavily Republican areas and are represented by Republican elected officials, he said. The endorsement is a way of reaching out beyond the unions' usual Democratic allies. "The reality is that we have to work across the aisle with both Democrats and Republicans," Williams said. "It hasn't been done in the last seven years. But hopefully whoever is elected next will realize we can't have this polarization." Huckabee may have won the endorsements because he actively campaigned for them. He was the only Republican to attend the national convention of the machinists' union in August 2007. He also speaks regularly on the need for fair trade agreements and the problems of working men and women. Critics and supporters alike have described him as an "economic populist." Not that Huckabee's union record is flawless: Unions have criticized him for crossing picket lines of the Writers Guild of America to appear on late-night television shows, among other things. We searched for major union endorsements of any other Republican candidates and were unable to find one. A spokesperson with the AFL-CIO said the Huckabee endorsements were the only ones they knew of. There are a lot of unusual things about Huckabee, a bass guitar-playing, Chuck Norris-approved preacher. Add Republican and union-endorsed to that list. We find his statement True.

pomt-04110	Says if you are on your bike in a crosswalk, all you have to do is dip your wheel into the road and cars must legally stop.	true	/oregon/statements/2013/jan/11/bikeportlandorg/must-cars-stop-if-cyclist-dips-wheel-crosswalk/	During the 2011 legislative session, lawmakers were hard at work passing a law they said would make Oregon streets safer -- by changing crosswalk rules. Legislators decided to make it clear in Oregon law that a pedestrian was crossing the street -- and that cars should safely stop -- when any part of the pedestrian moved into a crosswalk with an intent to cross. That rule became law in summer 2011. Jonathan Maus, who runs the blog BikePortland.org, announced recently on Twitter that the new law applied to cyclists as well. After some research he concluded that, "If on your bike on sidewalk, all u have to do is dip wheel into road and cars must legally stop." Maus was specifically referring to crosswalks -- not just anywhere in the road. That becomes clear as you review his tweets and a blog post he wrote on the subject. "I was super confused," he said about the law when we called to ask about the tweets. "It's hard to tease out exactly ... especially on a bike. It's like a mutant vehicle." We wondered if that was an accurate reading of the relatively new law, so we called Sheila Lyons, the Oregon Department of Transportation’s Bicycle and Pedestrian Program manager. She pointed us toward ORS 811.028, the section affected by the new law. Specifically: "For the purposes of this section, a pedestrian is crossing the roadway in a crosswalk when any part or extension of the pedestrian, including but not limited to any part of the pedestrians [sic] body, wheelchair, cane, crutch or bicycle, moves onto the roadway in a crosswalk with the intent to proceed." Based on that, Maus seemed to be right, but we weren’t completely sold. We wondered whether it was legal for a bicyclist to ride a bike through a crosswalk. It seemed to us that they’d probably have to walk it. We asked Lyons about that, too. The answer was, it turned out, that cyclists can bike on sidewalks and in crosswalks. But there are caveats. Some urban cores prohibit cyclists from riding on sidewalks, so it’s important to note local rules. Perhaps more importantly, ORS 814.410says mounted cyclists are operating a bicycle unsafely on a sidewalk if they are moving "at a speed greater than an ordinary walk when approaching or entering a crosswalk." Basically, cyclists can ride in a crosswalk so long as they’re not moving faster than an ordinary walker. And yes, dipping a wheel into the crosswalk is enough for a person riding a bike to signal intent to cross. We called Ray Thomas, a Portland personal injury attorney who specializes in bike laws, to make sure we had this right. He said our reading of the laws was exactly as he understood them. He called the recent change "the Oregon pedestrian revolution" in that, legally speaking, pedestrians no longer need to enter the roadway completely to get a car to stop. Finally, we also talked to Oregon Sens. Jackie Dingfelder and Ginny Burdick, both of whom helped pass the crosswalk law. The Portland legislators confirmed that it was always their intent that the new law apply to slow-moving cyclists as well as pedestrians. Maus tweeted that the new law meant a cyclist could dip a tire into a crosswalk and cars would legally have to stop to permit crossing. We checked the laws ourselves, spoke with a lawyer and the legislators involved and found that Maus is correct. We rate this statement True.

pomt-05414	Says the stimulus bill sent tax credits overseas, such as "$1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/02/americans-prosperity/ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-solar-company-/	A TV ad running in eight states blames President Barack Obama for sending stimulus money overseas while Americans are out of work. "Tell President Obama, American tax dollars should help American taxpayers," the narrator says. Instead, $2.3 billion in tax credits funded jobs in Mexico, Finland and China, the ad claims. We checked all three examples — and found the ad incorrectly describes them all. (We've also checked many other exaggerations about the stimulus.) Americans for Prosperity, a group dedicated to "educating citizens about economic policy" that works closely with tea party activists and has been funded by the conservative Koch family, released the ad April 26, 2012. Here’s the string of claims, starting with an image of the president signing a bill: Washington promised to create American jobs. We passed their stimulus. But that's not what happened. Fact: Billions of taxpayer dollars spent on green energy went to jobs in foreign countries. The Obama administration admitted the truth, that $2.3 billion of tax credits went overseas, while millions of Americans can't find a job. $1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico. Half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland. And tens of millions of dollars to build traffic lights in China. Sounds like a scandal and an outrage. Is that what happened? For this fact-check, we’re focusing on whether "tax credits" that "went overseas" included "$1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico." (In other fact-checks, we found the Finland claim False, and the China claim Mostly False.) The ad listed two sources for its Mexico claim, the Energy Department and PV Magazine. We tracked those down, then chatted with the companies involved. Two programs, two projects We’ll start with what’s true: An American solar company, SunPower, was approved for federal stimulus money. It also opened a solar panel plant in Mexico. (Or, rather, it moved its Mexican manufacturing from Chihuahua to a building it’s leasing in Mexicali, said company spokeswoman Natalie Wymer.) That’s where the claim’s relationship to the truth ends. • The company didn’t get tax credits, but a $1.2 billion loan guarantee. What’s the difference? The Energy Department expects the loan to be paid back — with interest. • That loan guarantee wasn’t for the Mexico plant — a separate project with its own funding — but to build the California Valley Solar Ranch in San Luis Obispo, Calif. Construction on the California project has already started, with the Energy Department projecting 350 construction jobs and 15 permanent ones. Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the state’s largest utility, will ultimately buy the power. • Most of the solar panels for the California project will come from SunPower’s California manufacturing facility in Milpitas, though given the size of the project, they’ll also come from the company’s plants in Mexico and Asia, Wymer said. • SunPower no longer owns the California Valley Solar Ranch project. The solar project — and the loan guarantee — belong to New Jersey company NRG Energy. That’s the company that will get the federal loan money, and be responsible for repaying taxpayers. Our ruling A TV ad from Americans for Prosperity says billions of tax dollars spent on green energy went to jobs in foreign countries. It claims that stimulus bill tax credits went overseas, such as "$1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico." The ad even cites sources for its claim. But those same sources, plus a few phone calls, quickly bring down the ad’s house of cards. Sure, taxpayer money was originally approved for a California solar company that also happened to open a plant in Mexico. But that loan — not tax credits, as the ad claims — will go to a New Jersey company for a solar project in California, employing construction workers in the state, using mostly California-built solar panels, to create solar power that’ll be purchased by a California utility. That’s a completely different story. The ad strings together alarming-sounding tidbits about actual stimulus projects to create the impression of something else entirely — in a way that’s ultimately ridiculous. And that earns our lowest rating, Pants on Fire.	None	Americans for Prosperity	None	None	None	2012-05-02T11:31:30	2012-04-26	['Mexico']

pomt-11691	"Julia Roberts claims ‘Michelle Obama isn’t fit to clean Melania’s toilet’ "	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/28/usa-daily-portal/fake-news-julia/	A phony story on Facebook says American actress Julia Roberts insulted former first lady Michelle Obama after a visit to Roberts’ New York film production studio. "Julia Roberts claims ‘Michelle Obama isn’t fit to clean Melania’s toilet,’ " stated a Dec. 14 headline on USA Daily Portal, which linked to the full story on yet another website, brightstars.me. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The story is the same as one on yournewswire.com and was previously debunked by Snopes. These articles are fake news and appear to be a riff on a USA Today editorial that criticized Trump after his tweet Dec. 12 calling U.S. Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand "a lightweight senator ... who would come to my office ‘begging’ for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them." Some interpreted Trump’s tweet as veiled language that Gillibrand would trade sexual favors for campaign cash, although White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders dismissed that characterization because she said he used similar language about men. USA Today’s editorial board reacted to Trump’s tweet: "A president who’d all but call a senator a whore is unfit to clean toilets in Obama’s presidential library or to shine George W. Bush’s shoes." The fake news story about Roberts and Michelle Obama mimicked the toilet cleaning theme. USA Daily Portal stated that after Obama left the set of Roberts’ film, Roberts commented about the differences between America’s most recent first ladies. The post accuses Roberts of saying Melania Trump has been "looked down upon and disrespected by sneering liberals across the country" while "doing a brilliant job," and Michelle Obama "isn’t fit to clean to clean her toilet." The statements followed a fictitious pattern, with more made-up quotes from Roberts attacking singer Celine Dion for criticizing Trump. We found no evidence Roberts made any of those statements about the Obamas, Melania Trump or Celine Dion. In fact, Roberts has supported national Democrats in recent years including Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. In October 2016, Roberts was one of several Hollywood and Broadway stars to team up to hold a fundraiser for Clinton at the St. James Theatre in New York. Wearing a "Hill Yeah" t-shirt, Roberts read from the play Red Hot Patriot: The Kick-Ass Wit of Molly Ivins. Roberts also appeared at Democratic fundraisers hosted by Obama, including a Santa Monica fundraiser on in April 2016 and one at Gwyneth Paltrow’s home in 2014. We were unable to find contact information for the USA Daily Portal website. We sent an email to the Your News Wire website that previously posted the article and did not get a reply. A fake news story stated that Roberts claimed "‘Michelle Obama isn’t fit to clean Melania’s toilet." We rate this headline Pants on Fire. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Correction: An earlier version of this fact-check stated that Roberts read one of Molly Ivins’ columns. Allison Engel, co-author of the play Red Hot Patriot: The Kick-Ass Wit of Molly Ivins, contacted PolitiFact after our fact-check published to tell us that the excerpt that Roberts read was from the play. Engel said she supplied the text to the producer of the fundraiser.	None	USA Daily Portal	None	None	None	2017-12-28T09:40:09	2017-12-14	['Julia_Roberts', 'Michelle_Obama']

pomt-14832	The federal government is "making the decision, whether we like it or not, to send 425 refugees to our state" from Syria.	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/nov/20/rick-scott/do-federal-officials-plan-send-425-syrian-refugees/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott has joined dozens of governors who say they don’t want to take Syrian refugees following the terrorist attacks in Paris. He criticized the federal government’s plans to take 10,000 Syrian refugees during an interview with Fox News’ Stuart Varney on Nov. 17. "This is something that they are making the decision, whether we like it or not, to send 425 refugees to our state without giving us any information." Is Scott right that the feds have decided to send 425 Syrian refugees to Florida with no input from the state? We decided to check it out. Do the feds decide on the number of refugees for Florida? Americans have zeroed in on Syrian refugees following the Nov. 13 Paris attacks, because a supposed Syrian passport was found near the body of one of the terrorists.We should note that is not confirmed; the passport may have been fake, and investigations are underway. The six Paris attackers identified so far were French and Belgian nationals. For the most recent year ending in September, Florida took in 48,816 refugees, with the largest group from Cuba. That number included 104 people from Syria, which has been in a civil war since 2011. Most of the Syrians settled in Duval, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade and Pinellas counties. (We explained the process of extensive background checks in our PolitiFact Sheet.) President Barack Obama announced in September that the federal government would accept an additional 10,000 refugees from Syria for the next year, for a total of 85,000 refugees from all countries. So who decides how many come to Florida? Scott said that the federal government made the decision to send 425. While the federal government is in charge of resettlement, the actual number comes from agencies within local communities in Florida. (Politico also noted this in a report on Scott's comments.) At the beginning of each federal fiscal year, the State Department works with nine national volunteer agencies to allocate the number of refugees per agency. They take into account factors such as whether the refugees have family members in certain states, their employment and educational backgrounds, and if they have any health concerns, according to Mark Hetfield, the president and CEO of HIAS, formerly known as the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society. In Florida, there are 25 local affiliates that are a part of those national groups. The local affiliates in Miami, Tampa, Clearwater and other cities inform the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) and the U.S. State Department how many refugees from across the globe the affiliates can handle for the fiscal year. For the current year, the total added up to 3,942, according to DCF. And that’s the number that the federal government signed off on for Florida. Recently, the government asked states if they could accept more refugees. On Nov. 9, Lawrence Bartlett, a State Department official, wrote a letter to DCF noting that Obama increased the maximum number of Syrian refugees and would ask the nonprofit groups how many additional refugees they could take. Local affiliates told state and federal officials they could take an additional 425 refugees. Technically, those 425 aren’t all guaranteed to be Syrians, according to DCF, but the Syrian crisis is what prompted the request. So far, federal officials haven’t approved any particular number for Florida. "We don’t know how many Syrians will be resettled into any one state or city at this point," Mark Toner, a State Department spokesman, told PolitiFact Florida. "Regarding the local agencies' letter saying they can take an additional 425 refugees, it is likely that we can expect there will be a similar letter approving that number as well. Those 425 refugees will come from all over the world." That means that officially, the federal government hasn’t decided yet to send 425 refugees to Florida, but it appears possible that that will end up being the number -- although they may not all be Syrians. When we asked Scott’s office about his media appearances quoting the 425 figures, it pointed us to more cautious wording that Scott used in a Nov. 16 letter to House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell asking them to cut off funding for the resettlement: "Please be aware that several organizations have requested that our state Department of Children and Families support the relocation of possible 425 Syrian refugees to Florida, as they receive federal funding to house those refugees in our state." Scott spokeswoman Jackie Schutz told PolitiFact Florida that "in his letter he was very clear to say ‘possible 425.’ ... The governor is very concerned -- it could be 425. All we know is it is possibly 425." Scott has a point when he says the refugees get sent to the states "whether we like it or not." The Refugee Act of 1980 says the federal government is expected "to the maximum extent possible" to take states’ concerns into account, but there are no legal consequences if federal officials ignore governors such as Scott. State officials don’t have veto power, because the federal government has the sole authority over immigration decisions, including refugees. Our ruling Rick Scott says the federal government is "making the decision, whether we like it or not, to send 425 refugees to our state" from Syria. Scott’s statement makes it sound like federal officials came up with a number of refugees and dictated that Florida must take them in. That’s misleading, because the number came from local resettlement agencies, which reported to the federal government how many additional refugees they could handle within the next year. Those refugees might or might not all be Syrians, though it seems likely they would be. Scott has a point that the power to resettle refugees lies with the federal government, and he can’t halt the refugees from coming to Florida. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-04759	Says Paul Ryan "tried to change the whole game" for Social Security	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/aug/28/barack-obama/radio-ad-barack-obama-says-paul-ryan-tried-change-/	A radio ad from the Barack Obama campaign attacks vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan by bringing up Ryan’s record of attempting to reform entitlement programs. In the ad, a man and a woman are heard talking about how the GOP candidates would replace Medicare with a voucher program and increase healthcare costs. But it also implicates past ideas Ryan has proposed to reform Social Security. "Now Mitt Romney picks a vice presidential candidate like Paul Ryan, who tried to change the whole game when it comes to Medicare and Social Security," the woman in the ad says. We’ve checked many claims on Republican plans for Medicare, but what’s Ryan’s record on Social Security reform? Did he really try to change the whole game? Ryan’s first attempts at Social Security legislation Five years after being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives, Ryan proposed the Social Security Personal Savings Guarantee and Prosperity Act of 2004. It was the first of essentially three different plans Ryan has advanced in the last eight years. Ryan’s plan was a response to projected shortfalls in the Social Security program. In 2033 or so, payouts would drop to about 75 percent of current benefits if nothing if changed. (Interestingly, Ryan is himself has received Social Security: He received two years of survivor’s benefits after his father’s death when Ryan was 16.) His plan suggested revamping the Social Security Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program by allowing workers younger than 55 to divert some of their contributions from Social Security to voluntary personal savings accounts. The money in the accounts would be invested, overseen by the government, instead of paying for current retiree benefits. The plan allowed workers to invest about half of their payroll taxes in their personal accounts, based on a progressive formula. At retirement, the account would convert into an annuity that paid benefits at least equal to Social Security, and potentially more, depending on how the investments performed. Workers who never invested in a personal savings account would be provided current-level benefits, but the proposal assumed everyone would switch, since the personal accounts would give the same benefits with no risk of a reduction in payouts. The selling point of this plan was that current benefits could be maintained through 2077 without raising taxes. But the plan required more than $2 trillion for the first 10 years of transitional funding. With people moving contributions out of the traditional Social Security program, shortfalls in traditional Social Security payouts would have to be made up by borrowing from general revenue, which is collected through income taxes. The government would also have to make up for ups and downs in the stock market, which could affect how much the investment accounts were able to pay. This plan died in committee in 2004. Ryan reintroduced it in 2005, but it failed to move forward again. That same year, President George W. Bush introduced a similar plan that used personal savings accounts, but the Bush proposal also proved largely unpopular both with the public and on Capitol Hill. Ryan became ranking member of the House Budget Committee in 2007, and tried again the next year. The new plan made a number of changes to lower the costs to the government, raising retirement ages and cutting benefits for middle- and high-income workers, but protecting payments to low-wage workers. It also made employer contributions to health insurance policies taxable as a source of revenue for the program. The 2008 plan, known as the Roadmap to America’s Future, also recommended switching Medicare to a premium support plan, giving states control of Medicaid and scaling back the amount of payroll taxes that could be invested in the accounts from one-half to one-third. It met the same fate as its predecessors, and died in committee, as it did after being reintroduced in 2010. Ryan’s plans with a Republican majority Ryan became chairman of the House Budget Committee in 2011. His current Path to Prosperity budget resolution, which was introduced in 2011 and again in 2012, jettisons all mention of potential privatization, choosing instead to focus on overhauling Medicare and cutting taxes and expenditures. He has said subsequently this was to minimize political grandstanding on the part of Democrats. "If we put a Social Security plan out there it’d be too tempting for Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi to demagogue it just like they’re doing on Medicare, running all these ‘Mediscare’ campaigns," Ryan said at a discussion during the Peter G. Peterson Foundation 2011 fiscal summit. "We figured they would do that on Social Security and make it harder to get a Social Security agreement." The resolution suggests only that "in the event that the Social Security program is not sustainable, the President, in conjunction with the Board of Trustees, must submit a plan for restoring balance to the fund." This would also require the U.S. House and Senate to provide ideas for potential solutions, as well. The House passed the non-binding budget resolution for fiscal year 2012, but it was voted down in the Democrat-controlled Senate. The current fiscal year 2013 plan, which aims to further reduce the deficit and take down Obamacare, also passed the House but not the Senate, and now serves as one of the flashpoints of the presidential campaign. The Romney-Ryan plan for Social Security So now that he’s a vice presidential candidate, what would a potential Romney-Ryan administration do about Social Security? Romney has previously endorsed the Path to Prosperity, but when PolitiFact asked Romney spokesman Ryan Williams about the candidate’s plan for Social Security, he directed us to Romney’s website, which contained two points: "First, for future generations of seniors, Mitt believes that the retirement age should be slowly increased to account for increases in longevity. "Second, for future generations of seniors, Mitt believes that benefits should continue to grow but that the growth rate should be lower for those with higher incomes." The site also noted it plans "no change in benefits for those at or near retirement." Romney mentions private savings accounts in his 2010 book, No Apology: The Case For American Greatness, but notes the Great Recession likely has shelved that idea for now. "Given the volatility of investment values that we have just experienced, I would prefer that individual accounts were added to Social Security, not diverted from it, and that they were voluntary," he wrote. The add-on accounts Romney mentions are a key difference from Ryan’s plan. Romney wrote he wanted the accounts to be in addition to current benefits, while Ryan has stated he wanted the accounts, which were always slated to be voluntary, to replace drawing benefits from the current Social Security Trust Fund. Now, neither Republican candidate seems to be addressing them in the campaign at all. The ruling So are the Democrats correct that Paul Ryan tried to "change the whole game" of Social Security? It depends on how you’re scoring. He did indeed propose a sweeping change to Social Security in 2004 and several times since. But we find it’s not quite true that he "changed the whole game." Even at its most ambitious, his plan did not affect people who were older than 55 and, for younger workers, the plans were voluntary and allowed workers to stay within the traditional Social Security system. At no time has he proposed ending Social Security altogether, but that’s not exactly what the radio ad is alleging. His most recent plan is limited to a demand that the White House and Congress fix it at some unspecified point in the future. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-06797	"The weight of the evidence (on global warming) is that most of it, maybe all of it, is because of natural causes ... it’s fair to say the science is in dispute."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/14/tim-pawlenty/do-scientists-disagree-about-global-warming/	Climate change has become a touchy subject in the Republican primary. Though some candidates once supported plans to reduce carbon emissions, such strategies have fallen out of favor with Republicans in recent years. Even acknowledging that human beings are causing climate change can be politically problematic for some Republicans. Our colleagues at the Miami Herald asked Republican presidential candidate and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty about his views on climate change in an interview on Aug. 3, 2011. His response piqued our interest: "Well, there’s definitely climate change. The more interesting question is how much is a result of natural causes and how much, if any, is attributable to human behavior. And that’s what the scientific dispute is about," said Pawlenty. "It’s something we have to look to the science on. The weight of the evidence is that most of it, maybe all of it, is because of natural causes... There’s lots of layers to it. But at least as to any potential man-made contribution to it, it’s fair to say the science is in dispute." We divided Pawlenty’s answer into his two essential claims: • Evidence points toward climate change being primarily a natural, rather than man-made, phenomenon. • The science about the causes of global climate change is in dispute. To check the first claim, we turned to the most recent report by the U.N. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), a scientific body considered the leading international organization on climate science. "Most of the observed increase in global average temperatures since the mid-20th century is very likely due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentrations," the 2007 report states. "The observed widespread warming of the atmosphere and ocean, together with ice mass loss, support the conclusion that it is extremely unlikely that global climate change of the past 50 years can be explained without external forcing, and very likely that it is not due to known natural causes alone." (External forcing refers to anything that changes the climate that is outside of the normal climate system.) In the United States, the U.S. Global Change Research Program coordinates and integrates federal research on climate. Its 2009 report mirrored the IPCC’s conclusions: "Observations show that warming of the climate is unequivocal. The global warming observed over the past 50 years is due primarily to human-induced emissions of heat-trapping gases. These emissions come mainly from the burning of fossil fuels (coal, oil, and gas), with important contributions from the clearing of forests, agricultural practices, and other activities." The IPCC report states that the period from 1995 to 2006 contains 11 of the 12 warmest years on record since instrumental measurement began in 1850. It concluded that global surface temperature rose 0.76 degrees Celsius from the end of the 19th century (1850-1899) to the beginning of the 21st (2001-2005). The U.S. Global Change Research Program’s report similarly found that the average global temperature increase by 1.5 degrees Fahrenheit since 1900. While these temperature changes may sound small, keep in mind that these are averages. The rise in temperature, and its visible effects, are more pronounced in certain parts of the world than in others. The polar ice sheets are particularly vulnerable to temperature increases. Greenland lost 36 to 60 cubic miles of ice from 2002 to 2006 while Antarctica lost 36 cubic miles of ice during roughly the same time period. Brian Soden, a professor of meteorology and physical oceanography at the University of Miami, was one of the many scientific contributors to the 2007 IPCC report. "The rise in global mean temperature since the 19th century may seem small, and projections of global mean warming over the next century range from 2 to 5 degrees Celsius," Soden said. "One way to put these numbers into perspective is to realize that the current climate is now only about 5 degrees Celsius warmer than it was during the last ‘glacial maximum’ (approximately 20,000 years ago) when ice covered much of North America extending all the way down to St Louis." If you’ve been following the debate recently, you may remember that climate research on temperature was called into question in 2009 when stolen e-mails from the Climatic Research United at the University of East Anglia were released on the Internet. Global warming skeptics said the e-mails showed climate researchers were manipulating data. But several inquiries debunked those allegations, including those conducted by the British Parliament, the U.S. Department of Commerce, Pennsylvania State University, and the InterAcademy Council. The inquiries found that while the scientists had made rude remarks about people who questioned climate change, they were not falsifying data. A few reports recommended greater transparency and sharing of climatic data, but the independent investigations exonerated the researchers of falsifying data. We looked into the work of the most prominent and best credentialed people who have questioned the IPCC’s conclusions on global warming. Generally speaking, even these scientists do not claim that humans are making no contribution at all to rising temperatures. Rather, they tend to make more nuanced points. They question whether carbon emissions alone are driving up temperatures, or whether other human activities contribute as well. They question whether extreme weather events such as storms or floods can be conclusively linked to rising temperatures. And, they question whether significant changes to public policy are necessary as a means of coping with rising temperatures. For Pawlenty’s second claim -- that there is dispute about the causes of climate change -- we decided to look at the opinions of world scientists about the issue. Several studies have attempted to quantify how much agreement there is among scientists when it comes to climate change. A 2010 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences - the official publication of the United States National Academy of Sciences - found that out of 1,372 climate researchers surveyed, approximately 97 to 98 percent of those actively publishing in the field said they believe human beings are causing the climate change, which they term anthropogenic (i.e., man-made) climate change. It also concluded that "the relative climate expertise and scientiﬁc prominence" of the researchers unconvinced of man-made climate change are "substantially below that of the convinced researchers." An earlier survey published in the 2009 issue of Eos -- a publication of the American Geophysical Union -- surveyed scientists from a wide range of disciplines (approximately 3,146) and asked: "Do you think human activity is a significant contributing factor in changing mean global temperatures?" Approximately 82 percent of the surveyed scientists answered yes to this question. Of those climate change specialists surveyed, 97.4 percent answered yes to this question. Climate change skeptics have their own petition, commonly called the Oregon petition, that has been endorsed by 31,000 signers opposing restrictions on carbon emissions. But that petition has been criticized for not checking the credentials of its signatories or proving that the signatories exist. To be clear, we’re not saying that no scientists dispute man-made climate change. When we contacted the Pawlenty campaign, they pointed us to several published pieces, such as writings by John R. Christy, who was counted as a dissenting researcher as part of the 2010 study from the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. But these skeptics seem to be a small -- even tiny -- minority, in contrast to Pawlenty’s comments suggesting significant disagreement. Many of the skeptics agree that climate change is occurring and that human activities play a part. But they disagree with some of the conclusions formulated in mainstream climate science. To summarize: Based on our research, there is very little dispute in the scientific community, especially among climate specialists, on whether climate change is primarily caused by natural or man-made forces. The overwhelming majority of scientists polled feel that human activity is the primary driver of climate change. Also, based on scientific studies by the IPCC and others, global warming over the past 50 years has been primarily driven by human activity. Based upon the preponderance of evidence we conclude that Tim Pawlenty’s claims are both incorrect and misleading to the public, who may not be familiar with the science behind climate change. It is not "fair to say the science is in dispute," as if there are good arguments on both sides. Rather, there is significant scientific consensus that human beings are contributing to global warming. We rate his statement False. Editor's Note: Pawlenty announced he was dropping out of the presidential race on Aug. 14. Also, this report was changed to reflect a more expansive definition of external forcing.

pomt-03919	"New Jersey has lost over half of our pharmaceutical jobs to states you know, not low-tax states like in the South, but high-tax states like New York."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/feb/24/barbara-buono/barbara-buono-claims-new-jersey-has-lost-half-its-/	New Jersey’s pharmaceutical industry is suffering from some aches and pains. Thousands of industry jobs have disappeared from the Garden State, according to state Sen. Barbara Buono, who discussed the issue during her Jan. 28 appearance on NJTV’s NJToday. "New Jersey has lost over half of our pharmaceutical jobs to states you know, not low-tax states like in the South, but high-tax states like New York," said Buono (D-Middlesex), who also is running for governor. Buono’s claim is largely correct. Let’s look at what’s going on here before addressing where any jobs have gone. Buono spokesman David Turner said Buono’s statement refers to New Jersey’s percentage of pharma jobs nationwide lost since 1990. Accordingly, we reviewed U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data to compare state and national numbers from December 1990 to December 2012. New Jersey had 42,300 pharma jobs in December 1990. The nation had 210,400. So New Jersey’s share was 20.1 percent. In December 2012 New Jersey had 28,100 pharma jobs, compared with 275,100 nationally. That means the state’s share was 10.2 percent. So Buono is close to her claim that New Jersey lost "more than half" its pharma jobs. Next, let’s review where the lost New Jersey pharma jobs are going. James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, said New Jersey has lost life sceinces jobs largely because the industry has a new business model for a new type of research and drug development. "Pharma is putting its cutting edge facilities near university centers of excellence in the life sciences, such as Cambridge, Bay Area, San Diego, etc.," Hughes said in an e-mail. "They want to be in interactive environments, not in insulated suburban facilities. This is the new business model for bio-based drug development. NJ specialized in chemical based drug development. The environments that pharma now wants are all high tax and high cost environments. They are willing to pay any price to be near centers of research excellence, leading scientists, and the leading hospitals for clinical trials." Dean J. Paranicas, president and CEO of the HealthCare Institute of New Jersey, a trade association that represents the life sciences industry, said infrastructure, government support and high-tech capabilities at higher education institutions also are factors. "New Jersey is in competition with every state regardless of its tax structure because the life sciences industry is a highly coveted one," Paranicas said. Mergers among major pharma companies are another reason for the smaller workforce in life sciences. Within the past few years, Manhattan-based Pfizer bought Madison-based Wyeth; Merck merged with Schering-Plough and cut 15 percent of its workforce; and Roche has moved some jobs to both California and New York City. A 2011 report from the state Labor Department points out that the recession, cost-cutting measures and expiration of patents also factored into industry job losses. "Senator Buono attributes this trend to many factors including the Governor’s unwillingness to fully fund our education system and lack of leadership in creating research partnerships similar to other states," Turner said in an e-mail. "Pharmaceutical companies are moving to states with equally high taxes but provide more funding for research and development. In places such as California, Massachusetts, and New York, companies are clearly attracted to the concentration of well-regarded universities that have forged partnerships with private industry." Hughes and Paranicas said the merger of Rutgers, Rowan and the University of Medicine and Dentistry New Jersey is important for the industry’s needs in high-tech research. Our ruling Buono said during a recent appearance on NJToday that "New Jersey has lost over half of our pharmaceutical jobs to states you know, not low-tax states like in the South, but high-tax states like New York." She’s correct that New Jersey has lost pharma jobs, but it’s not the "more than half" that she claimed. Jobs have been lost for a variety of reasons, from the industry’s new business model to wanting to be near universities and hospitals of excellence, and more. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-05224	Says PolitiFact "listed Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin as the Governor who told the most lies" and "our own ‘untruthful’ Governor Chris Christie made it into Politifact's top five of ‘Lie - en Governors’."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/07/loretta-weinberg/loretta-weinberg-claims-politifact-listed-chris-ch/	Politicians take heed: when attacking your rivals for not telling the truth, make certain you have your facts straight. Senate Majority Leader Loretta Weinberg (D-Bergen) wrote a post on the liberal blog Blue Jersey on Monday criticizing Christie and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, both Republicans, for their lack of truthfulness. But in the process, she distorted some facts of her own. "Politifact listed Governor Scott Walker of Wisconsin as the Governor who told the most lies," Weinberg wrote. "Well not to be [outdone], our own ‘untruthful’ Governor Chris Christie made it into Politifact's top five of ‘Lie - en Governors.’ We’re so proud Mr. Christie. You should really put that accolade right under your ‘Jersey Comeback’ banner." This claim surprised us: PolitiFact New Jersey never compiled such a list -- and neither did any of our fact-checking colleagues. So what is Weinberg talking about? The state senator’s statement was based on a list posted on the liberal blog Uppity Wisconsin. The list ranked governors fact-checked at least five times by PolitiFact by the percentage of True and Mostly True ratings they received. Walker had the lowest combined percentage of those two rulings, according to the June 1 blog post. The post concluded that "Walker is the #1 most dishonest governor in America." Christie took fourth place among the "top five most dishonest governors in America" with 38 percent of his PolitiFact rulings earning True or Mostly True. The blog’s tally of percentages of True and Mostly True rulings for governors in its top five list was mostly accurate at the time, but there’s several problems with the conclusions made from that data. PolitiFact Editor Bill Adair called suggestions that a governor is "in the top five" for falsehoods "inaccurate -- and meaningless." Overall, PolitiFact has checked 22 sitting governors. Only 10 of those governors have faced the Truth-O-Meter at least five times. In a pool of 10, it’s not difficult to land a spot in the top five. "It's fine if people want to use our report cards to compare the records of people we fact-check. But it's important to be accurate about what those report cards say and what they don't," Adair said. "The report cards provide a tally of the claims we chose to check. But it's not accurate to say the report cards indicate who ‘told the most lies.’ We are journalists who choose our fact-checks based on what is newsworthy. We are not social scientists and are not using any kind of random sample to select statements to check." Jason Butkowski, a spokesman for the New Jersey Senate Democrats, acknowledged Weinberg erred in citing PolitiFact as the source of the ranking, but, he said in an e-mail, "that does not take away from the larger issue – that Governor Christie, who prides himself on his straight-talking Jersey guy demeanor, only scored truthful or mostly truthful an abysmal 38% of the time in the 37 statements analyzed by PolitiFact." Obviously, PolitiFact doesn’t track every statement, nor do they track every Governor on an even playing field, so issuing any kind of quantitative ranking of public officials based on PolitiFact’s information doesn’t work. However, the people of New Jersey can, and should, expect more from Governor Christie when it comes to leveling with them on the big issues that matter most to our State." Our ruling Weinberg claimed PolitiFact listed Walker as the governor "who told the most lies" and Christie made it into PolitiFact’s "top five of ‘Lie - en Governors’." Weinberg is wrong on both counts. PolitiFact never ranked governors by their falsehoods. Though PolitiFact breaks down ratings by percentages, those figures represent how an individual’s statements have fared on the Truth-O-Meter. They do not show who "told the most lies." We rate Weinberg’s claim False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Loretta Weinberg	None	None	None	2012-06-07T07:30:00	2012-06-04	['Chris_Christie', 'Wisconsin']

pomt-08537	The federal government can tell General Motors what to charge for its automobiles.	false	/georgia/statements/2010/oct/04/phil-gingrey/gingrey-says-gm-deal-sign-federal-overreach/	Congressman Phil Gingrey was recently on CNN arguing in favor of repealing the federal health care legislation passed earlier this year when he steered the conversation to another area of what he considered government overreach. The Marietta Republican used the federal government's bailout of General Motors as an example of Uncle Sam being too involved in the private sector. "We're concerned with a powerful government who is telling General Motors now, maybe, what they can charge for their automobiles," said Gingrey, a physician. "Indeed, if the government owns 61 percent, they can do that." Does the federal government have that type of influence? "It's false," GM spokesman Greg Martin said. So who's right here? Let's begin with some background about the federal government's role in the automaker's management. In December 2008, during the final days of the presidency of George W. Bush, the government approved a $17.4 billion loan to GM and Chrysler to keep the companies running. GM received $13.4 billion, but a few months later, the company said it needed more money. GM produced a survival plan that included cutting 47,000 jobs worldwide and closing five U.S. factories. In June 2009, President Barack Obama approved a bankruptcy deal that gave GM $30 billion. In exchange, the government took a 60 percent controlling stake in the company. As of late September, GM had repaid $6.7 billion. The remaining money was converted to a 61 percent ownership stake in GM plus $2.1 billion worth of preferred stock, The Associated Press reported. AJC PolitiFact Georgia looked at several contracts between the federal government and GM, and we didn't see any specific language that suggested Uncle Sam would have any influence over pricing. We spoke with Gingrey's office and discussed our review of the contracts. The congressman's spokeswoman, Meredith Griffanti, said the federal government's stake in GM gives it the power to have some say on pricing. "GM repaid the government $6.7 billion," Griffanti said in a statement. "The remaining money was converted to a 61 percent ownership stake in GM plus $2.1 billion worth of preferred stock. Based on that, the government does in fact have a 61 percent stake in GM. Clearly that number makes the federal government the majority stakeholder, which undoubtedly allows 'big government' enormous influence over the direction of the company." A Treasury Department spokesman forwarded us testimony in December from Assistant Secretary Herbert Allison, who said government involvement in the day-to-day management of GM is not its goal. "Government involvement in the day-to-day management of a company might actually reduce the value of these investments, impede the ability of the companies to return fully to being privately owned," Allison said. Obama has said "the United States government has no interest in running GM." Most members of the 12-member GM board of directors have been appointed since the bankruptcy agreement. The board includes former Coca-Cola Chairman E. Neville Isdell and University System of Georgia Chancellor Errol Davis Jr. Records show the board has control over executive compensation and has a public policy committee. Martin, the GM spokesman, said that committee looks at regulatory issues concerning energy, the environment, trade and taxes. It also reviews GM's philanthropic activities. The board, Martin said, does not deal with day-to-day activities and pricing. David Zaring, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, said "it's possible" for the federal government to have some influence over policy matters such as automobile pricing through its board appointments. However, Zaring said he has watched closely to see whether that has happened and, so far, it hasn't. "It's easy to overstate how overinterventionist the government is being," Zaring said. There's no written language in the GM contract with the federal government that states Uncle Sam has any control over vehicle pricing. The board has not gotten involved in such matters, according to GM and others who have paid attention. We found no evidence that the federal government could influence pricing, aside from Zaring's suggestion that "it's possible" that board members could involve themselves in such matters. Therefore, we rate Gingrey's statement that the federal government could tell GM what to charge for its automobiles as False.	None	Phil Gingrey	None	None	None	2010-10-04T06:00:00	2010-09-25	['None']

pomt-15166	Planned Parenthood is "not actually doing women’s health issues."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/26/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-planned-parenthood-isnt-involved-womens-h/	Planned Parenthood is not involved in women’s health issues, said Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush. At a town hall in Englewood, Colo., Aug. 25, an audience member asked Bush about his record on women’s health, as well as what he would do for women’s health, particularly for veterans, as president. "When I was governor, we expanded those programs through community-based organizations, and that’s something I think the federal government needs to continue to do," Bush said. "I, for one, don’t think Planned Parenthood ought to get a penny, though. And that’s the difference because they’re not actually doing women’s health issues. They're involved in something way different than that." Bush, who cut off state funding for Planned Parenthood as governor, then pivoted to talk about veterans affairs. Bush’s claim that the organization is not involved in women’s health caught our attention. Setting aside the issue of abortion, Planned Parenthood offers many other medical services -- most of which seem obviously related to women’s health. We reached out to Bush’s campaign, and it directed us to a tweet that Bush posted, after Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton criticized his Aug. 25 remarks. Bush’s tweet said, "PP (Planned Parenthood) treatment of unborn has been horrifying. Let's support quality women's health programs instead." The National Library of Medicine defines "women’s health" as "the branch of medicine that focuses on the treatment and diagnosis of diseases and conditions that affect a woman's physical and emotional well-being." While "women’s health" encompasses all health issues as they pertain to women, reproductive health in particular is Planned Parenthood’s primary focus. The organization offers contraception, sexually transmitted infection testing and treatment, pregnancy testing, prenatal services and cancer screenings, including breast exams. (No, Planned Parenthood does not provide mammograms, but it conducts breast exams and refers women to other clinics for mammograms.) In total, Planned Parenthood saw 2.7 million individual patients in 2013, and it provided nearly 11 million services, according to its most recent annual report. About 12 percent of patients received an abortion, (assuming one procedure per abortion patient), so the remaining 88 percent of patients received other health services. Here’s the section of the report breaking down services provided in 2013: Our friends at the Washington Post's Fact Checker also looked at Bush's claim and gave it four pinocchios, their lowest rating. Our ruling Bush said, Planned Parenthood is "not actually doing women’s health issues." It’s hard to reconcile Bush’s statement with the fact that -- setting abortion procedures aside -- Planned Parenthood offered more than 10 million services in 2013. Those services included contraception, breast exams, pregnancy tests, pap tests and STI testing and treatment. Bush is opposed to abortion, but it doesn’t make sense to say that Planned Parenthood isn’t addressing women’s health issues. We rate Bush’s claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-09972	Pay-as-you-go "is the principle that helped transform large deficits into surpluses in the 1990s."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/07/barack-obama/obama-exaggerates-role-pay-you-go-balancing-federa/	President Barack Obama has been singing the praises of "pay as you go," a budget approach that is supposed to force lawmakers to offset new spending with an equal amount of revenue or budget cuts. In his April 25, 2009, radio and video address, Obama said, "We need to adhere to the basic principle that new tax or entitlement policies should be paid for. This principle— known as PAYGO — helped transform large deficits into surpluses in the 1990s. Now, we must restore that sense of fiscal discipline." He repeated the claim on May 7, 2009, in a speech at the White House when he unveiled the details of 2010 budget. "One important step is restoring the "pay as you go" rule — and I've called on Congress to do exactly that," he said. "This rule says, very simply, that Congress can only spend a dollar if it saves a dollar elsewhere. This is the principle that guides responsible families managing a budget. This is the principle that helped transform large deficits into surpluses in the 1990s." We wondered if he was correct about PAYGO's role in balancing the federal budget in the 1990s. We found that Obama is correct that Congress operated under a PAYGO law that was in effect from 1990 until it expired in 2002. When the Democrats took control of Congress after the 2006 elections, they established a PAYGO rule, but it has been waived for some of the most expensive bills, such as the economic stimulus bill. Fiscal hawks are urging Congress to replace that rule with a new law that would have more impact and be more binding. Obama is also right, of course, that the federal budget was balanced by 1998 and ran four years of surpluses before plunging back into deficit. The question is how much to credit PAYGO for those surpluses. To find the answer, we interviewed budget analysts and examined reports on the deficit and the impact of PAYGO. We found a general consensus that PAYGO was a factor that reduced the deficit, but most said it was not as important as the two biggest forces that led to a balanced budget— the increase in tax receipts from the booming economy and defense cuts made possible by the end of the Cold War. Still, there was a range of opinion on how much the rule helped. Alice Rivlin, budget chief under President Bill Clinton, characterized PAYGO as a significant factor. She said in a recent interview on PBS's Frontline that PAYGO and other budget rules "made it easier for the Clinton administration to work on the budget deficit." She said the PAYGO rule provided discipline so policymakers could resist tempting but expensive programs. The rule "meant that the president could say no, and the Congress could say no to a lot of good-sounding ideas, including Medicare prescription drugs" that would have made it difficult to balance the budget. That's backed up by a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office that said, "Between 1991 and 1997, most new revenue and mandatory spending laws that were enacted were consistent with the PAYGO requirement to be deficit neutral; end-of-session balances on the PAYGO scorecard consistently showed zero or net reductions in the deficit." Josh Gordon, policy director for the Concord Coalition, a group that advocates fiscal responsibility and was founded in the midst of the PAYGO movement in 1992, said PAYGO provided some important discipline for members of Congress even if it was not as big a factor as the booming economy and the defense cuts. "There always needs to be a check on irresponsibility in Congress and PAYGO provides that," he said. But Brian Riedl, a budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation, said PAYGO's importance has been exaggerated. "There is this grand myth that we passed PAYGO and then we got this balanced budget. But we got the balanced budget because the Cold War ended and a bubble temporarily pushed revenues through the roof." He said that PAYGO didn't provide as much discipline as some claim because Congress repeatedly used gimmicks or took steps to ignore it. So back to Obama's claim. He said the PAYGO "is the principle that helped transform large deficits into surpluses in the 1990s." He is correct that it is a basic principle behind the effort to balance the budget, but his statement leaves the impression that it was the biggest factor. It wasn't. Yes, PAYGO rules provided some discipline that might have restrained Congress from adding more spending or new tax cuts, but the economy and the defense cuts were the biggest factors that led to the balanced budget. So we find his statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-05-07T16:32:40	2009-05-07	['None']
pomt-04587	James Langevin "has received almost $20 million from taxpayers and special interests to use at his own discretion to supposedly champion Rhode Island’s needs."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/sep/23/michael-riley/michael-riley-says-us-rep-jim-langevin-has-receive/	Michael Riley, the Republican businessman who wants to end Democrat U.S. Rep. James Langevin’s six-term run as congressman from Rhode Island’s 2nd District, unleashed new television and radio commercials last week, ripping into Langevin as a ravenous devourer of taxpayer money. The radio ad opens with the menacing music from the movie "Jaws" in the background, as the narrator says Langevin has "received almost $20 million from taxpayers and special interests while in office to use at his own discretion to supposedly champion Rhode Island’s needs. " The ad recites a list of problems, from high gas prices to unemployment, and claims Langevin has few policy accomplishments to show for the money he’s received. "Beware Rhode Island!" the narrator warns. "There’s a shark in the water, circling the Ocean State and looking to feast on your hard-earned tax dollars! That shark’s name is Jim Langevin." We’ll pass on the value of Langevin’s policy achievements; one party’s success is another’s crime against the Constitution. But there is an objective element of Riley’s claim that can be examined: Has Langevin gotten nearly $20 million "from taxpayers and special interests ... to use at his own discretion" in his congressional career? We called the Riley campaign for their backup. Spokesman Nicholas Tsimortos told us the number is the sum of three elements: The almost $2 million Langevin has been paid in salary during his 12 years in Congress. The more than $6 million that’s been donated to Langevin’s campaigns since he first ran in 2000. The $11 million spent to pay the staffers who have worked for him over those 12 years. Add them up and they come to more than $18 million, hence "almost $20 million." Step one is figuring out if Riley’s numbers are right. For Langevin’s campaign contribution totals, we went to Opensecrets.org, a campaign-finance database compiled by the nonprofit Center for Responsive Politics. According to its records, Langevin has raised $6,253,061 over his six previous campaigns and in his current one, through Aug. 22. So Riley’s campaign got that number right. How about the $2 million in cumulative salary? When Langevin took office in January 2001, U.S. representatives got $145,100 annually; it’s up to $174,000 now. Add up Langevin’s total salary over those years and it’s $1,965,700, close enough to call it almost "$2 million." Last, and not least, is the $11 million that Riley’s campaign says Langevin has spent on staff salaries. For that, we went to Legistorm.com, which tracks congressional office spending. According to that site, $11,021,686 was paid to the 63 people who have worked on Langevin’s federally financed staff over his congressional career. That’s in line with Tsimortos’ $11-million estimate. So the numbers add up. But accurate information can be put in a misleading context. And the context of Riley’s claim -- portraying the congressman as a shark devouring taxpayer dollars -- is highly misleading. The first course of this alleged fiscal buffet is Langevin’s nearly $2 million in congressional pay. Article I, Section 6 of the U.S. Constitution requires that representatives be paid. Langevin may have discretion on how he spends his salary, but there’s nothing sinister about his accepting the same compensation every other congressman receives -- and the same salary Riley would receive if he wins. What about the $6 million in campaign contributions? Riley’s campaign says all that money comes from "special interests." Even if we were to agree with that characterization -- and most independent analysts don’t -- federal law limits what candidates can do with contributions. They can be used for commercials, polling and campaign staff, for example, but not a candidate’s personal expenses. (According to his most recent filings, Riley has given $440,200 to his campaign and accepted $69,363 in contributions.) Finally, what about the $11 million Langevin’s office has spent in staff salaries? According to the U.S. House of Representatives’ House Administration Committee website, each congressman gets an annual allowance for office salaries and expenses. It fluctuates from year to year, but has hovered at about $1 million recently. Staffers spend much of their time helping constituents having problems with, say the Social Security Administration or the Veterans Administration. And they research issues, providing representatives with the information they need to decide how to vote. Maybe Langevin could have decided not to have a staff and saved the taxpayers $11 million, but it would have meant Rhode Island’s 2nd District constituents would be less efficiently represented. Our ruling Michael Riley’s campaign ad says Rep. James Langevin "has received almost $20 million from taxpayers and special interests to use at his own discretion to supposedly champion Rhode Island’s needs." When you add Langevin’s salary, his staff salaries and his campaign contributions, you do get nearly $20 million. But Riley’s claim -- and the ad’s portrayal of Langevin as a shark looking to "feast" on taxpayers’ dollars -- suggests he has a slush fund and has used it improperly. That’s a gross distortion of very common practices allowed by law and the U.S. Constitution. We rule his statement Mostly False.

pomt-08241	Says Fort Hood near Killeen, Texas, is "the largest military installation in the free world."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/nov/15/john-cornyn/sen-john-cornyn-says-fort-hood-largest-military-in/	Honoring those who died a year ago during a mass shooting at Fort Hood, U.S. Sen.

Cornyn spokesman Drew Brandewie sent us a November 2009 Reuters news story that says as much: "Occupying 339 square miles (878 square km) in Central Texas and home to more than 65,000 soldiers, civilian personnel and family members, Fort Hood ranks as the world's largest military installation. It is the largest single employer in Texas and the only military post in the United States capable of supporting two full armored divisions — 1st Calvary Division and the 4th Infantry Division." A quick Google search for "Fort Hood" and "largest military installation" turns up varying descriptions from other news organizations. ABC News dubbed it the largest military facility in the world, the Telegraph called it the largest U.S. military base in the world, and the Austin American-Statesman has referred to it as both the nation's largest military installation and one of the world's largest military installations. The Army's Fort Hood website says that "like the state of Texas, Fort Hood is big and boasts of being the largest active-duty armored post in the United States Armed Services." According to a fact sheet issued Aug. 19, 2009 by the Fort Hood Public Affairs Office: "Fort Hood is the largest single site employer in Texas, directly inserting nearly $3 billion annually into the Texas economy." And "the largest combat aviation training area in the free world, comprised of 15,900 square miles, begins on Fort Hood and continues west from Bell and Coryell counties to Runnels and Tom Green counties." Fort Hood spokeswoman Nancy Bourget told us that Fort Hood is the world's largest military post in the world at 214,895 acres. Approximately 52,000 soldiers are at Fort Hood, she said, but she said she didn't know whether that's the most soldiers stationed at a military installation in "the free world." Also, that number fluctuates: According to the August 2009 fact sheet, Fort Hood had 45,414 enlisted personnel and 8,909 civilian employees. Next, we contacted Wendy Synder, a spokeswoman at the U.S. Department of Defense, who advised caution when talking about the largest military installation in the world. "There are different installations that support various services, based on their mission and the number of people there," she said. "Are you looking at largest in terms of acreage, people assigned?" Snyder pointed us to a 2009 department report that sizes up military installations by different criteria. The Naval Station in Pearl Harbor would cost the most to replace. The Nellis Air Force Range in Nevada has the most acreage. Hawthorne Army Depot in Nevada has the most buildings. "But if you look at the size of the buildings, Fort Bragg (in North Carolina) has the largest square footage," said Snyder. We also called John Pike, director at GlobalSecurity.org, a nonpartisan Virginia-based company that specializes in information about defense and the military. His yardstick: The number of service members assigned to each installation. Pike pointed to California's Fort Irwin as an example of why you shouldn't gauge the size of an installation by acreage: it spans 642,000 acres, but functions primarily as a training ground for soldiers from elsewhere, he said. "They've only got a few thousand people stationed there, but the facility is gigantic because the brigades have to go and play army," he said. So we wondered which installation has the largest military population. Air Force spokesman Dan Elkins told us that Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio is the largest with 8,479 enlisted personnel and officers, followed by Ramstein Air Base in Germany (7,673) and Langley Air Force Base in Virginia (7,314). Lt. Gregory Wolf told us that Camp Lejeune in North Carolina and Camp Pendleton in California have the most Marine Corps personnel, with approximately 40,000-45,000 Marines and sailors stationed at each. A Navy lieutenant didn't respond to our query of the largest Naval station in the world as we were finishing this story, but according to GlobalSecurity.org Naval Station Norfolk in Virginia is the largest military station in the world "based on supported military population." The 2009 Department of Defense report shows that as of September 2008, Norfolk had 39,636 miltary personnel, though the report cautions that its personnel data "may not reflect the actual population at a particular site." Lt. Col. Alayne Conway, a spokeswoman with the Army, told us that Fort Bragg and Fort Hood are the Army's largest installations, but that their numbers fluctuate, meaning that one day Bragg could have more personnel than Hood, and another day, Hood more than Bragg. The Defense Department report shows that as of September 2008, Fort Bragg had 50,178 military personnel versus Fort Hood's 52,301. Tom McCollum, another spokesman at Fort Bragg, told us that the current population at Fort Bragg is about 55,000 soldiers. Count in civilian employees and families and the installation's population kicks up to about 99,000, he said. So, what about Fort Hood's bragging rights? In terms of its total acreage, Fort Hood isn't the largest military installation in the world. By a more meaningful gauge — the size of the military population stationed there — Fort Hood is currently second only to Fort Bragg. However, the exact number of soldiers at both posts is always fluctuating, and at times Fort Hood is the largest. We rate Cornyn's statement as Half True.

pomt-03321	"The Senate immigration bill is … filled with things like rewards for au pair agencies, Alaskan seafood processors and Vegas casinos."	true	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/26/karen-handel/immigration-bill-includes-several-nods-industries/	Congress still hasn’t passed a comprehensive overhaul of immigration policy, and the outlook does not look good for any timely action. Last month the U.S. Senate approved its immigration bill, but a plan from the House could be delayed until September. Georgia’s Capitol Hill crew of lawmakers has weighed in on the issue. And so have those running for office. Last week, Karen Handel, one of the major candidates seeking the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate, entered the fray. In an email and Twitter post, Handel denounced the legislation. "The Senate immigration bill is over 1,000 pages long; filled with things like: rewards for au pair agencies, Alaskan seafood processors and Vegas casinos; and does not even secure the border." Lawmakers are not known for their brevity, and we knew the final Senate bill was more than 1,000 pages. What piqued our interest was Handel’s claims about the rewards included for various industries. Those industries didn’t seem like key immigration components to us. We dug for more details. Handel further criticizes the Senate bill in a longer statement posted on her campaign website. "The bill is equivalent to the amnesty measures passed in the '80s that, in large part, got us into this mess in the first place," part of the message states. "It is heavy on rewarding illegal immigrants, light on border enforcement, and it's as loaded with pork as a rib cook off!" Handel spokesman Dan McLagan pointed us to several news reports of the provisions written into the Senate amendment. A USA Today article provided the most detail. These provisions, or "rewards" as Handel calls them, are part of a compromise amendment to the Senate bill. We’ll look at them individually: Au pair agencies This part of Handel’s claim centers on the J-1 cultural-exchange visitor visa program, which allows foreigners to enter the United States under a variety of categories ranging from camp counselors to professor and research scholars. About 350,000 people enter the U.S. under J-1 visas each year, including about 20,000 au pairs. The Senate bill initially included language eliminating fees that recruiters charge foreign students to work in the U.S. But au pair agencies -- and other employee recruiting and placement agencies -- say the fees were necessary to cover administrative and travel costs for the au pairs. A compromise included in the Senate amendment still allows the fees but requires them to be set and regulated by the State Department. (Sec. 3911 of the bill) Alaskan seafood processors The final bill also includes a provision that would help the seafood industry in Alaska by allowing processors to bring in seasonal seafood workers under the summer work travel visa program. The Obama administration banned this practice last year to protect foreign exchange students from jobs the government considered dangerous. The Senate bill also includes a provision designating seafood processing as a shortage occupation, thus making it eligible for longer-term guest workers under a new visa program. (Sec. 4408) Vegas casinos This item is included in a provision of the bill that effectively extends the Corporation for Travel Promotion forever. The CTP, which has been renamed Brand USA, is a federal program designed to promote U.S. tourism abroad. It is funded by a tax on international visitors and receives up to $100 million in federal funds to match funds raised from the private sector. That federal funding would have expired in 2015, but it was extended with no end date. (Sec. 1102) When the Travel Promotion Act was passed in 2009 establishing the tourism promotion program, the hotels along the Las Vegas strip, which would benefit from the extra visitors, thanked Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., for his help in getting the bill passed. We checked with immigration experts about the Senate bill and Handel’s statement. The general thrust of the statement is accurate, the experts said, but they noted that "rewards" is a subjective word choice. To sum up, Handel said that the Senate immigration bill contains "rewards" for au pair agencies, Alaskan seafood processors and Vegas casinos.The provisions cited for the three industries are included in the legislation, along with several others. The items were part of deals fought for by industry lobbyists and included to garner support for the bill. Whether that classifies them as "rewards" is a matter of opinion -- in this case, Handel’s opinion. Handel spokesman McLagan argued for a "super true," but we’re content with a True rating.

pomt-00189	"Washington Heidi supports sanctuary cities, where illegal immigrants can be released on our streets, like this criminal, who was let go and then sexually assaulted a child."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/19/senate-leadership-fund/heidi-heitkamps-record-immigration-sanctuary-citie/	An ad released by the Senate Leadership Fund in the North Dakota Senate race paints incumbent Heidi Heitkamp as two-faced when it comes to immigration. "There are two Heidi Heitkamps. One in North Dakota, the other siding with liberals in Washington. Washington Heidi supports sanctuary cities, where illegal immigrants can be released on our streets, like this criminal, who was let go and then sexually assaulted a child. The same Heidi who is funded by Washington liberals who want to abolish ICE," the voiceover says. Heitkamp has voted against bills that would defund sanctuary cities, but that’s not the same as voting to protect criminals, as the ad suggests. The Senate Leadership Fund declined to provide evidence for its ad. Heitkamp’s campaign said she opposed bills to punish sanctuary cities because they end up punishing law enforcement for a political decision made by a municipality. Her campaign highlighted her vote in favor of Kate’s Law, a bill that would have increased penalties for unauthorized immigrants, and her support of Trump’s 2018 immigration proposal, which included $25 billion for border security, tougher enforcement and new limits on legal immigration. Heitkamp has called the movement to abolish ICE, "crazy town," and said that criticizing law enforcement for doing their job does not "sit well" with her as a former attorney general. ‘Sanctuary cities’ A sanctuary city can be a town, county or other jurisdiction. There isn’t a federal law defining sanctuary locations, but the term is generally applied to places that have policies or ordinances limiting the assistance that local police provide to federal immigration authorities. "The one common theme to sanctuary areas is not that they release criminals onto the streets, but that they will not do the work that is the responsibility of the federal enforcement agencies," said Elizabeth Cohen, a political science professor at Syracuse University. There are no sanctuary cities in North Dakota, according to research by the Federation of American Immigration Reform, which favors reduced immigration. The Senate Leadership Fund cited four Heitkamp "nay" votes in the text of their ad. The bills sought to compel cities to honor ICE detainer requests on local law enforcement agencies by withholding federal grants. They gave local authorities legal immunity to do so. The idea behind limiting cooperation between local and federal authorities is to encourage crime reporting and witnesses from the immigrant community to come forward, according to Hiroshi Motomura, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. But sanctuary policies are not absolute, allowing cooperation when immigrants meet a certain threshold for criminal convictions. "Even San Francisco policies, which are probably the most liberal in the country, require the police to cooperate when the person has a serious criminal history," said Huyen Pham, a law professor at Texas A&M University. Sexual assault case So what happened in the sexual assault case the ad mentions? We tracked down the man in the mugshot through a reverse image search. He is Juan Ramon Vasquez, an undocumented immigrant who was charged with raping a 5-year-old family member following his 2014 release from a Philadelphia jail. (He previously used the name Ramon Aguirre-Ochoa.) He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to eight to 20 years in prison for the rape. President Donald Trump and other opponents of sanctuary cities have used his case as a rallying point. Vasquez was originally arrested for an unrelated aggravated assault, but was released when the prosecutors declined to pursue the charges. ICE requested that he be held for possible deportation proceedings. The city did not honor the detainer request. Philadelphia’s sanctuary city policy states that a person cannot be detained after their release unless they are convicted of a first- or second-degree felony involving violence, and that detainer is supported by a judicial warrant. There was no conviction or warrant in Vasquez’s case. The sanctuary city bills would have forced locales to honor detainers or lose federal funding for law enforcement and other programs. However, even that may not have ensured Vasquez stayed off the streets, as he would have had the chance to ask for bond in front of an immigration judge, according to Linus Chan, a law professor at the University of Minnesota. In other words, the bills Heitkamp voted against would not necessarily have prevented the case the ad calls attention to. Our ruling The Senate Leadership Fund said, "Washington Heidi supports sanctuary cities, where illegal immigrants can be released on our streets, like this criminal, who was let go and then sexually assaulted a child." Heitkamp voted against bills that blocked law enforcement grants for sanctuary cities, because she said she didn't want to punish law enforcement agencies. She also voted in favor of other bills that ramped up immigration law enforcement. The ad suggests that Heitkamp sympathizes with abolishing ICE, when she called the idea "crazy town." The ad also suggests sanctuary cities allow violent criminals to roam the streets, but that's a skewed interpretation. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-06149	Says President Obama "helped more than half a million veterans and military family members go to college through the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/19/michelle-obama/michelle-obama-credits-president-new-gi-bill/	To mark the end of combat in Iraq and the return of U.S. troops in time for the holidays, President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle Obama spoke at Fort Bragg, N.C., on Dec. 14, 2011. Michelle Obama thanked service members and their families for their sacrifices and touted her husband’s work in supporting returning veterans. She mentioned improved mental health care for veterans and tax cuts for businesses that hire veterans. She also said this of her husband: "He's helped more than half a million veterans and military family members go to college through the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill." That makes it sound like the G.I. Bill was a major initiative of President Obama. But it was actually signed into law by his predecessor. The new GI Bill The bill, officially called the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2008, was introduced by Sen. Jim Webb, a Democrat from Virginia and Vietnam War veteran. It paid for veterans who served at least three years after Sept. 11, 2001, to attend a public college or university for free for four years, provided a monthly housing stipend and covered up to $1,000 a year for books. Service members who agreed to serve four more years in the military had the option of transferring the benefit to their spouses or children. With the backing of numerous veterans groups, the bill was hailed as the most comprehensive educational benefits program since the original G.I. Bill was enacted in the World War II era. Obama, then a senator campaigning for president, supported the bill, along with most other members of Congress. It was opposed by President George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain, the Republican presidential candidate, who feared the generous education perk might hurt military retention. Obama voted for it when it came up in the Senate in May 2008, McCain was absent, and Bush ended up signing it into law. The benefits kicked in Aug. 1, 2009, after Obama had moved into the White House. As expected, tens of thousands of service members took advantage, and the Department of Veterans Affairs quickly fell behind in covering payments. Veterans reported having to take out loans to cover education costs while they waited for their checks from the government. According to news reports, the VA had mostly cleared the backlog by February of 2010. The expansion In December 2010, Congress passed another bill that enhanced the benefits of the new G.I. Bill. Dubbed "G.I. Bill 2.0," it expanded eligibility for reserve members and National Guard members who were activated after 9/11, allowed tuition benefits to be used beyond college campuses at vocational and on-the-job training programs and expanded the housing allowance to distance learners. The bill, the Post-9/11 Veterans Education Assistance Improvements Act of 2010, was signed by Obama on Jan. 4, 2011. When we contacted the White House for documentation of Michelle Obama’s statement, a spokesman provided us statistics on the 2008 law: * Approximately $15.02 billion in Post-9/11 GI Bill benefit payments. * 649,573 individuals have received benefits since August 1, 2009. * Fall enrollment is 428,870 individuals. Who gets the credit? Our key question about this claim is not whether veterans have been helped by the law, but whether Obama is the chief helper, as the First Lady's speech implied. We contacted veterans groups for their input. All agreed with the 500,000-plus figure Mrs. Obama mentioned. "In general, the numbers have gone up dramatically," said Robert Norton, a retired Army colonel and deputy director of government relations for the Military Officers Association of America. He noted that the legislation had broad bipartisan support in Congress and that Bush ended up supporting it because of the provision allowing benefits to be transferred to family members. But at that time, Obama was just one vote. Michael Dakduk, executive director of Student Veterans of America, said Obama "can take as much credit as every other politician in Congress in ‘07. (The new G.I. Bill) was supported by virtually everyone." He said it's a stretch to suggest Obama was the driving force. "It’s not appropriate. He doesn’t deserve that," Dakduk said. Tom Tarantino, senior legislative associate for Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America, focused on the 2011 law. He said "it is fair to say that the president has been supportive of expanding benefits." Tarantino also credited the Obama administration with helping clear the backlog at the VA that left veterans waiting for their money. "When VA checks were late in the first semester, it was the White House that pressured (or directed) the VA to provide advances to veterans waiting for their living stipend. The White House has also been a driving force behind modernizing the VA benefits process that has resulted in an automated NGIB process that has had little to no late payments this school year," Tarantino said. Our ruling Michelle Obama said her husband has "helped more than half a million veterans and military family members go to college through the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill." Michelle Obama made it sound like the bill was a major legislative priority for him, but it was signed by his predecessor. Senator Obama voted for the new G.I. Bill. (And he wasn’t exactly going out on a political limb by favoring a law that enhanced benefits for military service members in the midst of two wars.) However, Obama did sign another bill in 2011 expanding benefits. The two laws together have helped more than 600,000 men and women returning from war find their way toward new careers, according to the VA. Obama deserves some credit for that achievement, but he's just one of many. We rate Michelle Obama's statement Half True.

pomt-12392	President Donald Trump "announced that he would reinstate a national day of remembrance for fallen officers that the traitor before him had done away with."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/may/30/blog-posting/pants-fire-bloggers-claim-obama-canceled-trump-rev/	A fake news story is tricking people into thinking that President Barack Obama canceled a national day of remembrance for fallen police officers. "Obama didn’t want to offend anyone, so our country’s heroes were shut out. Not anymore," reads a post on theexaminer.site that we also found on guerilla.news. "President Trump made Barack Obama look like a complete fool this morning in front of more than 10,000 police veterans when he announced that he would reinstate a national day of remembrance for fallen officers that the traitor before him had done away with," the story continues. The story then allegedly quotes Trump as saying, "Police officers in this country will no longer be treated like criminals. Obama decided your fallen didn’t deserve to be honored. That changes today. Americans will remember those that keep our streets safe big time." However, the Trump quote is fabricated, as is the premise of the story. The national day of remembrance for police officers killed in the line of the duty currently falls on May 15 each year. It is called Peace Officers Memorial Day. Obama did not cancel the day, and Trump did not reinstate it. It was started in 1962 by President John F. Kennedy as part of "police week." It has been celebrated by presidents -- including Obama and Trump -- ever since. Obama made remarks at a memorial service in May 2013, honoring the death of Jupiter, Fla., motorcycle police officer Bruce St. Laurent, who was struck and killed as part of a presidential motorcade in September 2012. "I have the privilege of working with some of the nation’s finest law enforcement officers and professionals every day," Obama said. "And I’m perpetually mindful of the sacrifices they make for me and for my family, and for other leaders and visiting dignitaries, but never more so than when I was told that Officer St. Laurent was struck and killed by another vehicle while driving his motorcycle as part of my motorcade." Obama also spoke at a memorial service in May 2015. "We are here to honor heroes who lost their lives in the line of duty -- men and women who put themselves in the way of danger, so that the rest of us could live in safety," Obama said in 2015. "They were beat cops, deputies, detectives, correctional and forest service officers, federal agents and tribal police. But to many here today, they went by different titles: caring husband, loving wife, my son, my daughter, Mom, Dad. We also found electronic copies of the proclamations Obama signed designating "police week" in 2014, 2015 and 2016. Trump, like other presidents, continued the tradition in 2017. He spoke at a memorial service but did not mention Obama. "America as a nation must always have the clarity to know the difference between good and evil, between right and wrong, and between those who uphold our laws and those who so easily break them," Trump said. "We owe it to the fallen to act according to our best and highest ideals. We owe it to their memory to put truth before politics, justice before agendas, and to put the safety and security of the American people above everything else." Theexaminer.site, where we saw this fake news story appear, includes no "about us" page. The post includes a disclaimer at the bottom referencing a different website, "Note: We at uspostman cannot make any warranties about the completeness, reliability and accuracy of this information." Uspostman has been known to share fake news stories before, including a false tale of how Obama’s mother-in-law Marian Robinson was getting a $160,000 a year government pension.

pomt-07241	"If you look at the benefits and wages of recorded federal employees, they far outstrip the market rates of the private sector."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/may/31/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-benefits-and-salary-public-employ/	During a break from Congress last week, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor came home to hear from local business leaders. He got an earful, not all of it from the business community. As the forum wrapped up, Cantor was confronted by a few angry women, one of them shouting as she approached. They peppered Cantor with questions, and not liking the answers, one of them, a liberal activist with MoveOn.org, hurled insults. Another woman took a different tack. She explained to Cantor that a friend of hers had recently taken a government job in Washington and was receiving fuel subsidies for the commute. With the high price of gas, the woman asked why shouldn’t she be also receiving fuel subsidies. Cantor replied that there is an injustice between federal government and private sector employees that he is determined to correct. "If you look at the benefits and wages of recorded federal employees, they far outstrip the market rates of the private sector," he said. Do they? We thought it was worth a look. To substantiate the claim, Cantor’s office sent over a few sources including a widely referenced 2010 investigation of federal versus private pay from USA Today. The newspaper probe relied on 2009 data (still the most current available) from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. It showed that federal civil servants received average pay and benefits of $123,049 while private workers made $61,051 in total compensation. According to USA Today, federal civilian employees received an average salary of $81,258 and benefits worth $41,791. Private-sector workers got $50,462 in pay and $10,589 in benefits. Officials from public employee unions and some economists dismiss the compensation comparisons. They say the gap reflects the increasingly high level of skill and education required for most federal jobs and the government contracting out many lower-paying jobs to the private sector. Another report by USA Today focused on salaries alone. It compared the 2008 pay for 40 occupations that exist in both the federal government and private sector, as defined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Federal employees earned an average salary of $67,691 while private workers, in the same mix of jobs were paid an average $60,046. That’s a difference of $7,645. There are arguments on the other side when it comes to pay alone, however. Late last year, an annual report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to the Federal Salary Council concluded that federal civilian workers on average are paid 2.1 percent less than private workers. But as a piece from our friends at FactCheck.org pointed out late last year, experts say there are flaws in the methodology there that prevent a true apples-to-apples comparison. Howard Risher, the managing consultant on a detailed 1990 report on pay differences recently recently wrote in Government Executive magazine, there’s no way of truly knowing which sector receives higher salaries because "neither has detailed job-to-job comparisons to support their arguments." All of that is well and fine, but it still doesn’t put a dent in Cantor’s claim, which looks at wages and benefits together. All parties agree that federal benefits are far more generous than those in the private sector. Gary Burtless, a labor economist with the left-leaning Brookings Institution, says there are good reasons why federal employees are better compensated the private-sector workers. Federal employees typically to do more specialized work that requires more education and responsibility than their private-sector peers, he said. Federal workers also often have served longer in their positions than private employees, he added. "To be surprised that federal workers receive average higher compensation than average private-sector workers is like being surprised when informed that school teachers are paid more than McDonalds’ employees," Burtless said. Still, as the USA Today study found, federal pay was higher than private-sector pay in four out of every five job categories that existed in both sectors. These included accountants, nurses, chemists, public relations specialists, surveyors, cooks, clerks and janitors. And, as Chris Edwards, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute notes, federal pay has risen faster than private-sector pay in recent years, despite the recession. "BEA data show that average federal salaries rose 58 percent between 2000 and 2009, which was much faster than the 30 percent increase in the private sector," Edwards writes. So let’s look back. Cantor claims that the "benefits and wages" of federal employees far outstrips those of the private sector. On average, that’s true; total compensation for federal workers is nearly double the private sector average. Looking at salary alone narrows the divide a bit, and some argues private pay even exceeds federal pay, but Cantor played it safe by avoiding specific numbers and including benefits. As some suggest, there may be solid reasons for the disparity -- expertise, education requirements, responsibility, seniority -- but that doesn’t change the facts. We rate the claim True.

Seeking contributions to the Assembly Democratic Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to the Assembly, Barca blasted the work of the GOP-controlled Joint Finance Committee on the two-year tax-and-spending plan. In a June 5, 2013 email, the Kenosha Democrat decried the proposed creation of a private bail bond system and a $651 million income tax cut. Then he turned to a proposed expansion of the private school voucher program. Citing a figure from the state Department of Public Instruction, Barca said the budget included: "An expansion of taxpayer-funded, unaccountable private school vouchers across the state, which DPI estimated could cost nearly $2 billion annually." That’s a lot of money. The figure caught our attention because Barca’s email was on the 2013-15 budget; the $651 million income tax cut, for example, refers to how much income taxes will be reduced over the two-year period. On the school voucher expansion Barca criticized, the budget awaiting Gov. Scott Walker’s signature limits to 1,500 the number of students who could be added to the program during the two-year cycle. Could that expansion really cost taxpayers nearly $2 billion per year? Not even close. Barca’s evidence Long a subject of controversy, the voucher program, also known as school choice, was launched in 1990 in Milwaukee and was extended to the Racine area in 2011. It is intended to improve results for poor city children in public schools by allowing them to attend private or religious schools with publicly funded vouchers. Barca spokeswoman Melanie Conklin told us her boss based his nearly $2 billion claim on an email that state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers sent to school district superintendents and other educators six days before Barca's fund-raising email. Evers, who opposes the voucher expansion, wrote: "While the current proposal includes an initial enrollment cap, past history clearly demonstrates those are temporary at best. We estimate that vouchers on a statewide scale could ultimately cost up to $1.9 billion annually,further diverting scarce resources away from public schools and increasing local property taxes." To be clear, the $1.9 billion-per-year estimate applies to the total cost of the voucher program, not the limited expansion that would take place over the next two years with the new budget. Moreover, Evers' use of ultimately dooms Barca’s claim. While Barca's fund-raising email was about the 2013-15 budget, the $1.9 billion cost estimate is for some time in the future. Barca's spokeswoman also forwarded us another Evers email, which referenced a detailed DPI estimate. It says the voucher expansion cost could reach $1.9 billion per year if 20 percent of students statewide -- nearly 193,000 students -- enrolled in the voucher program. That's far more than the 25,000 voucher students currently in the program and the 1,500 that would be added in the next two years. DPI spokesman John Johnson told us that with the expansion provided for in the 2013-15 budget, the voucher program will cost about $385 million over the two years. That's an average of about $192.5 million per year. A far cry from what Barca led the recipients of his email to believe. A footnote before we close: A little noticed provision in the budget could potentially allow for expansion beyond the 1,500 students. But even if that expansion occurs, the additional cost is estimated at only $4 million in the 2013-15 budget, Johnson said. Moreover, the disclosure didn’t come until two weeks after Barca’s email. Our rating Criticizing a Republican-backed expansion of the school voucher program in the 2013-15 state budget, Barca said the state Department of Public Instruction estimated that the expansion "could cost nearly $2 billion annually." But the cost of the entire voucher program -- not just the expansion -- averages $192.5 million per year for the 2013-15 budget cycle. DPI's $1.9 billion-per-year estimate is not based on the 2013-15 expansion; it would only apply if the voucher program expands dramatically years down the road. The money exaggeration may make for good copy when it comes to raising money. But when it comes to math, it’s a major failure. We rate Barca's statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-08268	"I had five of my citizens that were killed last week" because of border security problems.	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/nov/10/rick-perry/gov-rick-perry-said-five-his-citizens-were-killed-/	Which has been Gov. Rick Perry's favorite fight — flicking off Democratic challenger Bill White or saving the states from Washington? He has talked more about states' rights lately, in part via a busy campaign to promote his new book, Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington. On Comedy Central's "The Daily Show" Monday night, host Jon Stewart wondered whether Perry would be "more comfortable with the United States under the Articles of the Confederation," a reference to the first constitution of the United States. Perry responded: "What I'm really comfortable with is Washington understanding that they're doing too much. I'd like for them to do their basic responsibilities like secure our border with Mexico. I had five of my citizens that were killed last week. I've asked two administrations to put the boots on the ground, to secure that border." Perry has often talked up his requests for more National Guard troops on the Texas border. In a February 2009 letter to Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, he asked for an "additional 1,000 Title 32 National Guard positions." And in April, we rated Half True Perry's claim that "we've got a 1,000 National Guard troop request that's been in front of this president for over a year and no response." But the governor's mention of slain Texans to bolster his calls for more border security was new to us, and we wondered which citizens Perry was citing. Responding to our request for elaboration, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier sent us a link to a Nov. 5 article on CNN.com naming six U.S. citizens who were killed last week on the Mexico side of the border near El Paso. CNN reported that Eder Diaz Sotero and Manuel Acosta, both American students at the University of Texas at El Paso, were killed in Ciudad Juarez on Nov. 2, according to the U.S. Consulate in that city. CNN reported that the two students were "gunned down in a hail of more than 30 bullets while driving in Chihuahua State." Four more U.S. citizens were shot to death in Ciudad Juarez (adjoining El Paso) the weekend of Oct. 29, according to CNN and other news reports: a woman who was shot inside a tortilla shop; a man and woman who were shot in a car near the Zaragoza International Bridge connecting Juarez to El Paso; and a man who died of multiple gunshot wounds outside a house. It was the deadliest weekend for Americans in Mexico since February, according to a Nov. 2 Associated Press story published in the Austin American-Statesman. Separately, we reviewed other news reports indicating that six U.S. citizens have been killed in Juarez since Oct. 30. The St. Petersburg Times reported that they were from El Paso. As we completed this article, Nicole Thompson, a spokeswoman at the U.S. Department of State, confirmed to us that six U.S. citizens have been killed recently in Juarez. Summing up: Perry was one short in recounting the six Americans from El Paso killed in Ciudad Juarez since little over a week ago — presumably missing the sixth because there was a delay before the U.S. Consulate confirmed the American identity of one of the slain students. But Perry made his claim in the context of arguing for tougher border security in the U.S. without mentioning that his citizens, as he put it, were killed in a foreign country, not the U.S. Nor did he say how securing the border on the U.S. side would prevent shootings in Mexico. Those are important details to omit. We rate his statement as Half True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2010-11-10T06:00:00	2010-11-08	['None']

pomt-11970	"Las Vegas shooting witnesses report multiple gunmen dressed as security guards."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/03/blog-posting/blog-peddles-fake-story-saying-security-guards-idd/	An online website that describes itself as "free independent news" is pushing a false story that a Las Vegas shooting victim saw multiple gunmen dressed as security guards at Mandalay Bay. One of the more pervasive conspiracy-minded claims spinning around the Internet is that the Las Vegas shooting was some type of staged attack or that there were multiple gunmen. As of this writing, there is no evidence any of that is true. However, the website Neon Nettle claimed that an eyewitness to the shooting reported "multiple gunmen dressed as security guards." "As the mainstream media in the US attempts to lock down the ‘crazy lone wolf gunman’ narrative for the devastating shooting attack in Las Vegas, the truth has started to seep through foreign news outlets who don't follow the same political agenda as the American MSM," the post, dated Oct. 3, 2017, reads. The post goes on to tell the story of Brian Hodge, an Australian who was reportedly staying on the 32nd floor of Mandalay Bay, the same floor as the shooter. The story talks about an Oct. 2 interview Hodge gave to the Courier Mail, an Australian tabloid. In that article, Hodge said he hid in the bushes outside the casino hotel until police arrived. "There were multiple people dead and multiple shooters. I was just hiding waiting for police to come get us," Hodge is quoted as saying. Later, Hodge said: "My floor is a crime scene. They killed a security guard on my floor." While there are some reports a security guard was shot, we are unable to confirm if that’s accurate. And while Hodge is quoted as saying shooters plural, there is no evidence he’d have any way of knowing. In fact, Hodge gave an interview to the Sydney Morning Herald in which he more fully describes what he saw. Hodge told that newspaper that he never made it to his room on the 32nd floor and after hearing the bullets he first went to a casino kitchen before hiding in a bush outside. "I was just laying on the ground. It was like a scene from a movie. The shooter was up above, we didn't know where they were... I didn't want anyone to know where I was, so I just curled up and hid. It was the most terrifying moment of my life." Hodge also posted on Facebook, "There is a live shooter with a gun in my hotel in Vegas right now, but I got outside safely and hiding in bushes." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com More importantly for this fact-check, it’s clear to us the Neon Nettle post puts words in Hodge’s mouth. Hodge never said in the Courier Mail article nor in any other article or social media post that the security guard was a shooter. And he also disputed saying shooters. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling An online blog claims, "Las Vegas shooting witnesses report multiple gunmen dressed as security guards." The story tracks back to real interviews given by a person who says he was at Mandalay Bay. But beyond that, this story doesn’t hold up. The witness didn’t say what the blog claims.

pomt-06639	Under President Barack Obama’s jobs bill, "you can sue if you are unemployed and don't get the job and think you weren't hired because you are unemployed."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/15/sean-hannity/sean-hannity-says-barack-obamas-jobs-bill-creates-/	During the Sept. 13, 2011, edition of Sean Hannity’s show on the Fox News Channel, Hannity said that President Barack Obama’s jobs bill included a new way for Americans to sue for discrimination. In a discussion with former Florida State University football coach Bobby Bowden and Tucker Carlson, the editor of the Daily Caller, a conservative website, Hannity said that, under the bill, unemployed people would be able to sue for discrimination if they felt their status had kept them from getting a job. "There is a class where they could sue the employer they've interviewed with because they were discriminated against, because they were unemployed," Hannity said. "If I'm an employer and they implement that, I'm not going to interview anybody." Carlson added, "There's a new category to the Civil Rights Act with race, ethnicity." Hannity continued, "You can sue if you are unemployed and don't get the job and think you weren't hired because you are unemployed." Carlson replied that such a provision was a "giveaway to the trial lawyers." "We've gone entitlement crazy," Bowden said. "We have," Hannity agreed. We were curious about whether Hannity described the proposal correctly. We began by turning to the bill itself. The provision in question follows news reports that some companies have rejected unemployed job applicants out of hand as a way of filtering the large numbers of job resumes they’re receiving. In some cases, companies even made it clear in advertisements that they would not consider applicants who were unemployed. Since unemployment levels have remained stuck for months at near post-Great Depression highs, such practices posed a challenge for an administration that desperately wants to boost employment. So the bill states the overarching position that "denial of employment opportunities to individuals because of their status as unemployed is discriminatory." Specifically, the bill prohibits employers from publishing help-wanted ads that disqualify people who are unemployed, and bars employers from failing to consider or hire an individual "because of the individual's status as unemployed." The bill places similar restrictions on employment agencies. As for enforcement of the new provision, the bill says that "a court of the United States shall have the same jurisdiction and powers as the court has to enforce ... Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964" -- the landmark provision that bans employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin. An individual who seeks redress through the courts, the bill says, "may be awarded, as appropriate" an order to employers to stop the prohibited practices, "reimbursement of costs expended as a result of the unlawful employment practice," damages up to $1,000 for each day of the violation, and "reasonable attorney’s fees." Lynne Bernabei, a Washington employment lawyer best known for representing whistleblowers, agreed that Hannity described the law accurately, though she said that individuals suing under the new provisions -- if they are ultimately enacted as written -- will still face a steep climb in the courts before they secure any compensation. "Any individual suing under this law has to prove that he was discriminated against because he was unemployed," Bernabei said. "Discrimination is always difficult to prove, and it wouldn't be any easier to prove in this context." But Hannity didn’t suggest that plaintiffs would somehow be assured of winning in court; he simply said that they would have the opportunity to sue. We rate Hannity’s statement True.

pomt-06989	Because of Democratic tax hikes, New Jersey ended a decade with fewer private sector jobs for the first time in recorded history.	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/12/steve-oroho/sen-steve-oroho-claims-democratic-tax-hikes-are-bl/	Amid the recent budget battle raging between Democratic legislators and Gov. Chris Christie, Republican Sen. Steve Oroho offered an interesting lesson in how New Jersey had already made history when it comes to private-sector job losses during the last decade. In a June 29 press release, Oroho criticized the fiscal year 2012 budget passed by the Democratic majority, but later scaled back by Christie and argued that Democratic tax hikes during the past 10 years contributed to those job losses. In fact, Oroho said the last decade was the "first time in recorded history" that the state had fewer private-sector jobs at the end than at the beginning of the decade. "Over the past 10 years, the Democrat majority have been intent on pushing through dramatic tax increases, and irresponsible budget gimmicks to fund an insatiable desire to spend taxpayer dollars," said Oroho, who represents Sussex County and parts of Hunterdon and Morris counties. Oroho added, "It is no coincidence that during this same period it was the first time in recorded history where the state had less private sector jobs at the end of the decade than we had at the beginning." PolitiFact New Jersey soon learned that Oroho’s statistic is accurate -- New Jersey had a net loss of private-sector jobs in a decade for the first time since payroll employment statistics were first collected. But the causes go beyond the tax increases imposed by Democrats, according to economic experts. First, let’s talk about where Oroho received his information. Oroho directed us to a May 3, 2010 article on NJ Spotlight written by James Hughes and Joseph Seneca of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. The article points to a net loss of 156,100 private-sector jobs between 2000 and 2010, marking the first such reduction for a decade since 1939. Hughes, dean of the Bloustein school, told us their analysis was based on state and federal employment data from December 1999 to December 2009. Following our own review of data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we reached a similar conclusion. For non-seasonally adjusted figures, New Jersey lost 152,700 private-sector jobs between December 1999 and December 2009, or about 4 percent, according to the federal data. Every other decade dating to 1939 saw private-sector job increases of between 8 percent and 26 percent, according to the federal data for non-seasonally adjusted figures. "We’ve never had a decade where we lost private-sector jobs before," Hughes said. So Oroho is right about that history lesson, but how much blame should be given to the tax hikes? After talking to experts and taking a closer look at the private-sector job numbers between December 1999 and December 2009, we found a major element missing from Oroho’s statement: the recession. According to federal data for non-seasonally adjusted figures, New Jersey saw private-sector job growth annually between 2003 and 2007. Then between 2008 and 2009 -- after the recession had hit -- the state lost 226,800 private-sector jobs, according to federal data. Bill Rodgers, chief economist at the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University, argued that the recession and the weak recovery preceding it had a greater impact on job losses. "The taxes are not the main contributor," Rodgers said. Oroho acknowledged that other factors contributed to the job losses, including the general downturn in the economy, but he said the tax increases turned away capital investment, leading to the private-sector job losses. Those tax hikes included increases in the income, sales and corporate business taxes, according to the senator. "Capital’s like water," Oroho said. "It follows the path of least resistance." Hughes agreed that the tax hikes increased the cost of doing business in New Jersey and affected job figures. He also noted the impact of corruption scandals, saying: "Corporations don’t want to be near controversy." Michael Riccards, executive director of Trenton-based The Hall Institute of Public Policy, argued that tax hikes were not a major cause behind the job losses. The global economy and poor business practices in certain industries contributed to the loss of jobs, Riccards said. Let’s review: Pointing to Democratic tax hikes, Oroho said the last decade marked the first time since 1939 that New Jersey ended a decade with fewer private-sector jobs than it started with. He’s right, based on research by Rutgers professors and our own analysis of federal data. But given the impact of the recession on job losses -- and as the senator acknowledges himself -- tax hikes are not the only factors involved. We rate his statement Barely True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-01667	Jason Carter backed three of Nathan Deal’s budgets but accuses the governor of "underfunding education."	true	/georgia/statements/2014/aug/20/john-padgett/gop-chair-correct-carter-voted-3-4-deal-budgets/	Education. It’s the single biggest expense in the state budget (This year alone, the cost of k-12 education is $7.9 billion, or 43.4 percent of the state’s $18.3 billion budget). And it’s one of the biggest issues in this year’s closely watched governor’s race. On Aug. 12, Republicans issued a statement attacking Jason Carter, the Democratic state senator who is hoping to wrestle the job of governor from Republican Nathan Deal. Sonny Perdue, Deal’s predecessor, in 2003 became Georgia’s first Republican governor since Reconstruction. The GOP now controls the Georgia House, Senate and all major statewide offices. Democrats see Carter, a two-term state senator from the Decatur area and former President Jimmy Carter’s grandson, as their best chance for regaining a foothold. "How can Carter criticize Gov. Deal for 'underfunding' education when he backed three of (Deal’s) budgets?" John Padgett, chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, said in the press release. The release goes on to accuse Carter, 39, of playing politics -- voting for Deal’s first three state budgets, but against Deal’s last budget after announcing as a candidate for governor. All four budgets included major, so-called austerity cuts to education. "He (Carter) thinks that with enough rhetoric he can hide the fact that he cares more about advancing his own career than improving the education system in Georgia," Padgett said in the statement. The party chair is parroting a claim that Deal’s campaign has been making. PolitiFact decided it was time to fact-check Carter’s voting record on the state budgets. Carter has voiced concerns about the state’s commitment to public education during most of his short Senate career. His criticism, specifically of Deal on education, has sharpened in recent months, with his campaign manager at one point calling Deal Georgia’s worst education governor. (See PolitiFact’s Pants On Fire ruling of that claim.) For our current fact check, we started at the General Assembly website, where the votes of lawmakers on all bills -- including state budgets -- are public. We confirmed that Carter voted "Yes" with the majority in the Senate for Deal’s fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014 budgets. Austerity cuts to education in each of those budgets exceeded $1 billion. In this year’s General Assembly session, only four out of 56 state senators voted against the 2015 budget. Gubernatorial candidate Carter cast one of those "No" votes. Austerity cuts were part of the 2015 budget. But at $747 million, they were the smallest since 2009 and, as such, viewed as largely positive by leaders in education. --------------------------------------------------- Austerity Cuts to K-12 education 2011-2015 2011 $1,089,521,696 2012 $1,147,859,436 2013 $1,143,762,797 2014 $1,061,127,407 2015 $746,769,852 Total 2003-2015 $8,436,724,814 Source: Allotment sheets, Georgia Department of Education Since 2003, governors and lawmakers haven’t fully funded schools based on the state’s education funding formula. These austerity cuts have totaled $8.4 billion, according to reports filed with the Georgia Department of Education. In combination with plummeting property tax collections -- fallout from the national housing market collapse -- the austerity cuts have thrown many of the state’s 180 school systems into a tailspin. As a result, there have been staff reductions, unpaid furlough days, larger class sizes and, in many cases, shorter school years. Carter has explained his decision to vote this year against Deal’s budget. At one of his back-to-back school tours last week, the Democrat said the 2015 funding boost was election-year politicking to mask the governor’s "dismantling" of public education. "The governor on average has underfunded our schools by $1 billion each year, and the claim that they have done enough is just not true," Carter said. "The $750 million shortfall into the education fund this year is not something I support." He would not comment about his three prior votes for Deal’s budget when contacted by PolitiFact. In an email, Bryan Thomas, Carter’s spokesman, reiterated many of the candidate’s past criticisms of Deal’s handling of k-12 education, as well as the popular HOPE scholarship program. "Governor Deal has shortchanged our schools by an average of $1 billion a year since taking office," Thomas said. "He likes to brag about his election-year budget, but he still missed the mark by more than $750 million." In November, Thomas said, voters can choose "between a governor who only seems to care about schools in an election year, or Jason, whose commitment to our schools has never wavered." (State education funding has increased during Deal's tenure, in part due to enrollment growth. Budget reports show K-12 spending has increased from $7.067 billion when he took office to $7.94 billion this year.) Carter, who was member of a special Senate task force on education in 2012, has said, if elected governor, he would push to create a separate education budget that would be tantamount to an untouchable trust fund for schools. In summary, John Padgett, GOP state chairman, was correct. Jason Carter voted in favor of three of Gov. Nathan Deal’s state budgets that each included $1 billion-plus in austerity cuts to education. Carter voted this year against a fourth, annual state budget proposed by Deal that included about $747 million in austerity cuts to K-12 education, the smallest cut since 2009.

pomt-05323	Says that President Obama promised that with the stimulus plan, "unemployment would never go above 8 percent. He even said it would be 6 percent by now."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/may/17/bob-latta/bob-latta-says-obama-promised-stimulus-plan-would-/	For almost three years, going back to mid-2009, a top talking point for Republicans has been that President Obama "promised" that the stimulus bill -- the two-year spending package he championed to revive the economy -- would keep unemployment below 8 percent. PolitiFact has examined the claim numerous times, and each time rated it Mostly False. But the claim still circulates. We heard it most recently from Rep. Bob Latta of Bowling Green, who represents Ohio's 5th District, with a new wrinkle. In a campaign statement endorsing Mitt Romney and criticizing the "broken promises" of Obama, Latta writes: "President Obama promised Americans that his stimulus plan would revitalize the economy and that unemployment would never go above 8 percent. He even said it would be 6 percent by now." The claim about current unemployment being 6 percent added something new. We asked Latta's office how he backed it up. As support for both the 6 percent and 8 percent figures, they pointed to a Jan. 9, 2009, report called "The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan" from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser. The report, which others also have cited, projected that the stimulus plan proposed by Obama would create 3 million to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009. The chart projects the current unemployment rate at about 6 percent with the stimulus, and about 6.5 percent without it. As Latta's staff rightly noted, the unemployment rate went higher. It peaked at just above 10 percent in early 2010 before falling to 8.1 percent in the most recent period. But what we saw from the administration in January 2009, before Obama took office, was a projection, not a promise. We could find no instance of anyone in the administration directly making a public promise. And the projection came with heavy disclaimers. "It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error," the report states. "There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." A footnote that goes with the chart states: "Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11 percent in the absence of action." The administration has acknowledged its projections were wrong. "None of us had a crystal ball back in December and January," Romer said in a July 2, 2009 interview on Fox. "I think almost every private forecaster realized that there were other things going on in the economy. It was worse than we anticipated." Indeed, in January 2009, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the unemployment rate would climb to 8.3 percent in 2009 and peak at 9 percent in 2010. By February, the prediction was even higher — 9 percent in 2009 without the stimulus, and 7.7 to 8.5 percent with a stimulus. In a White House news conference on June 8, 2009, Bernstein said the projections made in January were off because economic numbers for fourth-quarter 2008 weren't yet available. When they were released, they revealed the economy was in worse shape than economists realized. The baseline -- the prediction of what the economy would have done without the stimulus -- was far too optimistic The implication of Latta's statement is that rising unemployment rates prove the stimulus didn't work. Many economists don't agree -- and argue that without the stimulus, unemployment would have been worse -- but it's difficult to empirically prove one way or the other. There is an element of truth here: The incoming administration did predict that unemployment would peak at just under 8 percent if Congress approved the stimulus package and that it would be about 6 percent now. But Latta's statement suggests Obama was offering some sort of guarantee. The administration never characterized it that way and included plenty of disclaimers saying the predictions had "significant margins of error" and a higher degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is "unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity." It was an economic projection with warnings of a high margin for error, not a take-it-to-the-bank pledge of an upper limit on unemployment. Those are critical facts that Latta’s claim ignores. On the Truth-O-Meter, Latta’s claim rates Mostly False.	None	Bob Latta	None	None	None	2012-05-17T06:00:00	2012-05-05	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-13783	"Just 9 percent of Muslims in Pakistan view ISIS favorably. Unfortunately, that 9 percent is 16 million people. And that’s just one country."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/20/newt-gingrich/gingrich-9-pakistanis-support-isis/	Newt Gingrich wanted to make clear in his speech at the Republican National Convention that the majority of Muslims are peaceful. But, he said, it only takes a few bad apples ... If even a small percentage of the world’s billion Muslims support violence, "that is still a giant recruiting base," Gingrich said. "Pew Research finds that just 9 percent of Muslims in Pakistan view ISIS favorably," Gingrich said. "Unfortunately, that 9 percent is 16 million people. And that’s just one country." Gingrich has done his math well. A 2015 Pew report found that views of ISIS were "overwhelmingly negative" in a survey that included 10 Muslim majority nations. But Pakistan was an outlier. "One exception was Pakistan, where a majority offered no definite opinion of ISIS," the report said. "Only 28 percent in Pakistan had an unfavorable view of ISIS, and a majority of Pakistanis (62%) had no opinion on the extremist group." As this chart in the report showed, 9 percent of Pakistanis said they had a favorable view of ISIS. (The question was "Do you have a ____ opinion of the Islamic militant group in Iraq and Syria known as ISIS?) The population of Pakistan was about 199 million in 2015, according to the CIA. The country is 98 percent Muslim. Take 9 percent of the total and you get nearly 18 million people. One could say that just because they have a favorable view of ISIS, that doesn’t mean they would fight for ISIS. Their answers might have been different if they had been asked if they support ISIS, rather than think favorably of them. But Gingrich used the stat to show that the terrorist group enjoyed a large recruiting base. Even if a small fraction of the 9 percent were willing to take up arms or commit acts of terror, that would be a large number. Our ruling Gingrich said that just 9 percent of Muslims in Pakistan view ISIS favorably and that amounts to 16 million people. There are a some small issues with his statement. He got the numbers right but we don’t know how that might translate into a readiness to commit violence in the name of ISIS. Also, the survey was of all Pakistanis, not just Muslims. However, none of those details undermine Gingrich’s point. The data suggest there is large number of people who are inclined to respond to ISIS’ message. We rate this claim Mostly True. Correction, Sept. 12, 2016: This report has been changed to accurately reflect Gingrich’s quote. He said, "Pew Research finds that just 9 percent of Muslims in Pakistan view ISIS favorably," not "Pew Research finds that just 9 percent of Muslims in Pakistan support ISIS." The rating remains the same.	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2016-07-20T22:52:40	2016-07-20	['Pakistan']
pomt-09786	The Baucus bill "contains provisions that would send massive federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government-chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/21/national-right-life-committee/national-right-life-committee-says-baucus-bill-wou/	With the recent release of the Senate Finance Committee plan for health care reform, the abortion issue has re-emerged in the health care debate. And both sides are choosing their words carefully to score political points. We are examining two seemingly similar statements from the National Right to Life Committee that we think get to the heart of the rhetoric. One is that under the bill proposed by Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., federal funds (tax dollars) would subsidize abortions; and the other is that federal subsidies would go to insurance companies that offer abortion coverage. They sound similar, but we ended up with rulings at opposite ends of our Truth-O-Meter. We take a look at the first claim, that federal tax dollars would subsidize abortions, in a separate item and conclude the statement is False . In this item, we deal with a statement from NLRC legislative director Douglas Johnson that the Baucus bill "contains provisions that would send massive federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government-chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion." If you look carefully, the issue here is government involvement in plans that offer abortion. And that's a big deal. The 1976 Hyde Amendment prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions through Medicaid except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's health is in peril. So states that want to offer abortion coverage have to pay for it themselves. Similar restrictions on public funding for abortions applies to federal health care coverage extended to active and retired military and federal employees. Baucus said he attempted to "find language that just maintains the status quo" on abortion, because he didn't want the issue to be a distraction. "This is a health care bill, not an abortion bill," Baucus said. Maintaining the status quo, however, is a matter of perception. And that's because there are two competing realities. On the one hand, as President Barack Obama acknowledged in a July 21 interview, "We ... have a tradition of, in this town, historically, of not financing abortions as part of government-funded health care." In other words, the more than 250 private health plans that cover federal employees — because they are subsidized by the federal government — cannot offer full abortion services. On the other hand, many private plans (outside the government) currently offer abortion services. If the government starts providing health care subsidies but bans the participation of any plan that offers abortion services (as some legislators have suggested), abortion rights groups argue it would strip millions of women of benefits they currently get. According to a 2002 Guttmacher Institute study, 87 percent of employment-based insured health plans offered coverage for abortions (though not all companies select it for their employees). A 2003 Kaiser Family Foundation survey found that 46 percent of covered workers had coverage for abortions. The two surveys asked different questions, but the bottom line is that a significant percentage of women have health insurance that covers abortions. According to Baucus' chairman's mark, which provides a blueprint for the plan, abortion cannot be a mandated as part of any minimum benefits package except in cases of rape, incest or if the mother's life is in danger. However, health plans in the exchange or co-op would not be prohibited from providing abortion coverage. In fact, every state exchange would have to provide one plan that covers abortion and one that does not. The exchange is a virtual marketplace where people can comparison shop for an insurance plan. Baucus' alternative to a public option, a co-op, would be one alternative on the exchange (think of it as a credit union for health insurance). The plan provides federal dollars — through tax credits or cost-sharing credits — to subsidize the cost of insurance for people with modest incomes. So clearly, you'd have federal subsidies going to plans that cover abortions. But no more federal money would go to plans that offer abortion, so the added cost would presumably be passed on to consumers who choose plans that offer abortion, and efforts have been made to segregate funding so that only money from premiums — not tax dollars — would be used to pay for abortions. But if millions of uninsured people would now get insurance due to the health care plan, and some of the plans offer abortion coverage, we think it's fair to conclude the Baucus plan (or any other Democratic plan under consideration) would mean more women would have access to abortion services. That obviously doesn't sit well with National Right to Life and other antiabortion groups. Johnson said they'd like to see an amendment that would prohibit any insurer that gets federal subsidies from offering abortion services. Amendments to that effect failed in the House. The plan, as proposed, would lead to more abortion coverage, and therefore more abortions, Johnson said. The Hyde Amendment, he said, is "one of the most important abortion reduction policies adopted by Congress." Not only can't the federal government subsidize abortion, he said, it can’t subsidize plans that offer abortion. The Baucus bill, he said, is "a big departure from where we are now." Here's Planned Parenthood's take on the Baucus plan: "Planned Parenthood acknowledges that there are some compromises that need to be made to move health care reform forward, and we are willing to do so if it means more women can access affordable, quality health care from the provider of their choice. While we are concerned that the language in the Senate Finance Bill specifically singles out abortion, we understand it is necessary to move health care reform forward. "As it currently stands, it is a carefully crafted compromise which assures that access to abortion would neither be mandated nor prohibited — and that women would not lose health care benefits that they have had for decades, while also addressing concerns that no federal funds would be used for abortion." In the abortion debate, nothing is simple. And as we said, words are chosen carefully. Regarding Johnson's claim that the Baucus plan would result in "federal subsidies directly to both private insurance plans and government-chartered cooperatives that pay for elective abortion," we think he is on solid ground. One could argue whether or not this is a departure from making the bill "abortion neutral" — each side has its take on that — but the fact is the plan would allow insurers to offer abortion. And the plan includes federal subsidies to some who might choose to join such a plan. And so we rule Johnson's statement True.

pomt-03215	Says "your Legislative Assembly was within one vote of enacting each of those bills into Oregon law."	false	/oregon/statements/2013/aug/24/doug-whitsett/was-oregon-legislature-within-one-vote-enacting-fi/	If you think back, you might remember a time during the 2013 legislative session when there were talks about a slate of measures to help curb gun violence. But much like the gun control debate on the national stage, nothing came to pass and the issue was largely abandoned. In a recent opinion piece for conservative political blog Oregon Catalyst, Sen. Doug Whitsett, a Republican from Klamath Falls, says, if not for one vote, the whole gun control narrative could have been completely different. "More than a dozen bills relating to firearms were introduced during the recently concluded 77th Legislative Assembly," he wrote. "Most of those bills would have, in some way, impinged upon our second amendment right to own and bear firearms." He then listed seven of them and continued: "Your Legislative Assembly was within one vote of enacting each of those bills into Oregon law. It was within one vote of grossly impinging on our second amendment rights." That’s quite the statement. We decided to take a look. Whitsett argues that the Senate was deadlocked on this issue. There were 14 Republicans in the Senate, all of whom were opposed to the gun legislation. If the 16 Democrats had all voted in favor, the legislation would have passed. But, he notes, Sen. Betsy Johnson, a Democrat from Scappoose, was opposed. Hers was the vote that kept these bills from becoming law. That strikes us an oversimplification of the process. We looked at the measure history for each of these seven bills he’d mentioned by number. Two of the measures -- the only two he mentions that originated in the House -- never got hearings in their committees. It’s a stretch to say they were a single vote from becoming law when they never even made it out of committee, let alone to the Senate, where Johnson serves. One Senate bill was in a similar situation. Four other Senate bills he mentioned did get hearings and were all passed out of committees with recommendations that they be passed by the full Senate. However, Senate President Peter Courtney sent them all to the Rules Committee where they died a quiet death. By Whitsett’s account, the reason they were sent off to die in Rules was that Courtney knew they had no chance of passing, thanks to the Republicans -- plus Johnson. "It was my understanding that had we not had 15 ‘no’ votes in the Senate, they would have passed with flying colors," Whitsett said. Without Johnson "it would have been the typical 16-14 party line vote." He may be right on certain bills. Johnson definitely helped defeat Senate Bill 700, which would have expanded background checks for gun purchases, as The Oregonian’s Jeff Mapes reported. Even so, that bill and the others would have had to make it through the House. Whitsett said he was under the impression the House had the votes to pass the gun bills. We can’t know for sure. House Speaker Tina Kotek had made it clear that jobs and schools were her priorities, not guns. We chatted with Sen. Ginny Burdick, D-Portland, one of the most vocal supporters of the various gun-control bills. She said Whitsett was right that the unified Republican opposition certainly helped table the subject. Still, Burdick added, had those bills made it out of the Senate, there was no sure bet they’d make it through the House, too. "The background checks bill would have had a very good chance," she said, referring to Senate Bill 700. "The other ones would have had a little tougher time." Whitsett said that gun-control advocates were within "one vote of enacting each" of the seven bills into law. Had he focused on Senate Bill 700 specifically, we might be inclined to agree. But some of the other bills did not even receive a hearing and there is no guarantee that others would have passed in the Senate, let alone received the 31 votes needed in the House. We rate this claim False.	None	Doug Whitsett	None	None	None	2013-08-24T06:00:00	2013-08-16	['Oregon']

pomt-05546	Says in the governor’s proposed budget "the use of that, what is called one-shots, is a 500 percent increase over the last Corzine budget."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/09/john-burzichelli/john-burzichelli-claims-chris-christies-proposed-b/	New Jersey has for years patched its budget holes with one-time fixes, mending deficits with temporary tax increases or the use of surplus funds. Now, Gov. Chris Christie says he is weaning the state off such volatile resources, known as one-shots. But a Democratic lawmaker tells a different story. Assemblyman John Burzichelli, who represents parts of Cumberland, Gloucester and Salem counties and serves as deputy speaker, discussed the proposed fiscal year 2013 budget during a March 28 NJTV appearance. He said that "the use of one-shot monies, which means monies found that are only going to be available one time, are exceeding $600 million dollars in this budget and last year they were $96 million. "And that's a very dramatic change. So that tells you that the structural work that we're trying to do to keep the budget in balance is still struggling. And when you take advantage of income that is only coming one time the next year you have to find a way to replace that or you have to take other drastic steps," Burzichelli said, adding "that the use of that, what is called one-shots, is a 500 percent increase over the last Corzine budget." New Jersey Treasury Department documents show the state used $3.82 billion in one-shots in fiscal year 2010, the last budget former Gov. Jon Corzine signed. Christie’s 2013 budget proposal includes $1.64 billion in such revenues. That’s a decrease, not a 500 percent increase, as Burzichelli claims. So what gives? Let’s say a family spent less on groceries this year than last year, but spent more on cereal over the same time frame. Overall, the family spent less, even though they spent more on a particular type of food. That’s essentially how Burzichelli makes his claim. In total, Christie is using fewer one-shots than Corzine. But Christie’s reliance on a specific type of one-shots has increased. Christie is proposing to use $642.3 million in a type of one-shots called revenue-related initiatives, which includes transfers from funds dedicated for specific purposes, such as clean energy. That’s an increase of more than 490 percent from the $108.8 million used in fiscal 2010. In the current budget, Christie relied on $96.4 million in similar revenues. Burzichelli cites some of those figures in the television interview, but he doesn’t explain what they represent. A spokesman for the Assembly Democrats, Tom Hester, said Burzichelli was referring specifically to revenue-related initiatives. "It’s that simple. You can read it any way you want, but doing [so] ignores the irresponsible impact of these budget raids," he said. But by focusing only on some one-shots, Burzichelli ignores a larger context. In total, Corzine’s last spending plan relied on $3.82 billion in one-time revenue resources. In Christie’s proposal, one-time revenue totals $1.64 billion. Federal stimulus aid inflated the total use of one-time revenues in 2010. But John Sugden, a credit analyst with Standard & Poor’s who wrote a report in February critical of Christie’s proposed budget, said the federal aid is still a source of revenue that will have to be replaced the following fiscal year. Sugden said in an e-mail that "the use of non-recurring revenues (one-shots) to fund recurring expenditures, in our view, creates budgetary gaps or shortfalls in the following year regardless of what their source is." Our ruling Burzichelli said the reliance on one-time revenues in the governor’s proposed budget is a "500 percent increase over the last Corzine budget." That’s roughly correct for a particular type of one-shots that includes money diverted from dedicated funds. But the assemblyman doesn’t make that clear and the state relies on hundreds of millions of dollars in other one-time revenue-generating measures. And, in total, Christie is using less one-time revenue than Corzine. Burzichelli’s claim has a hint of truth but cherry-picks statistics and ignores critical context. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-09350	"Teachers will not be able to return to work after raising their children."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/apr/06/paula-dockery/dockery-says-sb-6-would-not-allow-teachers-return-/	One of the most contentious issues of the 2010 legislative session is a plan to overhaul teacher pay and tenure. Teachers statewide overwhelmingly oppose the legislation, known as SB 6, which has been buoyed by Republican leaders. Sen. Paula Dockery, a candidate for governor, was one of a few Republicans to vote against SB 6 when it passed the Senate last month. The House plans a vote soon. Dockery followed up her vote by writing an opinion column that ran in the Lakeland Ledger on April 3, 2010, and contained some explosive charges about what's wrong with the bill. Here's an excerpt: "SB 6 will destroy jobs. The bill makes it nearly impossible for someone not currently teaching to renew his or her teaching certificate. Teachers will not be able to return to work after raising their children. They will have their certifications threatened if they are activated for military duty, or otherwise unavailable to teach, for longer than one school year." (Read the whole column here.) It's a strong statement with broad implications. We chose to focus on the claim that "teachers will not be able to return to work after raising their children." Could that be true? First, some basics about SB 6. Among other things, the bill would make it easier to fire teachers and base their pay on test scores rather than the current schedule based on years of service and degrees. Supporters say it would reward high-performing teachers and make it easier to get rid of underperforming teachers, while detractors say it will deter teachers from the profession. Teachers hired on or after July 1, 2010, would be placed on a one-year probationary contract during which time they could be fired and then later would be placed on subsequent contracts. Teachers hired before July 1, 2010, keep their jobs as long as they can show "effective performance" in four of the five years leading up to renewal. We contacted Dockery's campaign and Senate office to ask how she reached the conclusion that parents who leave their teaching jobs for some length of time could not later return to work. Her Senate spokeswoman, Rachel Perrin Rogers, referred us to a portion of SB 6 that states: "Beginning with the 2014-2015 school year, the requirements for the renewal of a professional certificate shall include documentation of effective or highly effective performance as demonstrated under s. 1012.34 for at least 4 of the preceding 5 years before the renewal certification is sought." "This is saying you can't renew your certificate if you haven't done what is outlined in this chapter," Rogers said. "How can I renew it if I have taken time off?" But in the same section of the bill Rogers pointed us to, we found this: "The State Board of Education shall adopt rules to define the process for documenting effective performance under this subsection, including equivalent options for individuals who have not been evaluated under s. 1012.34," which relates to evaluating teachers. That part indicates there is an exception -- although not clearly spelled out -- for teachers who don't get evaluated because they are on leave. Thomas Butler, spokesman for the state Department of Education, explained it this way: "As currently written, the bill states that the State Board would have to adopt rules to define the process for documenting effective performance to meet renewal requirements, including for individuals who are not evaluated under 1012.34. As such, individuals who are on leave from the district and who would not have such an evaluation and, therefore, would be included in the rule." So the state Board of Education would develop the rule with public input after the bill becomes law. We asked Butler to clarify how the law would apply to a mother who takes time off from teaching to raise children. "When a mom takes time off she obviously won't be receiving evaluations," Butler told PolitiFact Florida. "She is not going to have evaluations so it's implied she will fall under the state board rule that hasn't been developed." Kathy Hebda, deputy chancellor for educator quality at the Department of Education, will oversee the rule writing. Hebda said the bill says the state board "shall" write the rule -- so it will definitely happen. "It's actually requiring the state board to adopt a rule to include an equivalent option for individuals who didn't get evaluated," she said. "There are going to be a lot of people in that scenario including persons who decide to leave the classroom for a couple of years and come back. The state board is going to have to have a process to bring that person back in and let them renew the certificate." That could include teachers who had worked at private schools or out of state, she said. Roberto Martinez, a member of the state board that will develop the rules, said he had not heard anything about this particular issue. However he said that if a rule needs to be written to address parents who want to return to teaching, that will be done. "I'm not about to penalize a mom. ... I would encourage women to work and raise a family." Critics of the bill say the language is not clear in terms of the effect on teachers who take leaves. State Rep. Marty Kiar, D-Davie, who has introduced amendments related to the bill, said in an interview that the issue of the effect on teachers who take leaves has not yet arisen in committee meetings. "I'm going to ask the questions on the floor tomorrow to the bill sponsor," he said on April 6. So, let's review. SB 6 clearly states that teachers must show "effective or highly effective" performance for four of the five preceeding years -- which clearly can't be done for teachers who want to return from a few years' leave. But the bill also directs the state Board of Education to adopt rules to document effective performance for teachers not evaluated. The state Department of Education says that clause means the state board will create a rule that will apply to teachers who have taken leave to take care of their children for example -- although SB 6 doesn't clearly spell out that scenario. Dockery said "teachers will not be able to return to work after raising their children." We find there is a provision in SB 6 to prevent this scenario, but because the rules won't be written until after the bill becomes law, we can't definitely say what will happen. We rule Dockery's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03423	The immigration bill includes free "Obamacars," motorcycles or scooters.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2013/jun/26/blog-posting/does-immigration-bill-include-free-obamacars-teens/	As chief defender on the right of the Senate immigration bill, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., has been churning out press releases debunking myths about the bill. "Remember the ‘Marcophone’ myth? Now we have the Obamacar myth," says a June 25 Rubio press release. Yep, you read that right: Rubio, a potential 2016 Republican presidential contender, issued a press release claiming that a conservative slam against the Democratic president is a myth. Rubio’s press release linked to a June 24 article on the conservative news site Breitbart with the headline "New Immigration bill has taxpayer subsidized Obamacars for youths." It featured a photo of a goofy-looking Obama climbing into a car. "Breitbart News has learned there is a provision included in the immigration bill that could be used to give free cars, motorcycles, scooters or other vehicles to young people around the country over a period of 15 months after the bill passes," the story said. "The new provision is a result of the latest addition to the Corker-Hoeven amendment, which is essentially an entirely new version of the bill." The claim was made multiple times on the Internet, including on Fox News on June 25. The commentators joked about the alleged car giveaway with contributor Laura Ingraham asking, "I want to know, are Segway scooters part of the deal?’ " PolitiFact previously examined a claim by bloggers that proposed immigration legislation would give away taxpayer-funded cell phones. We ruled that claim False. That referred to grants aimed at helping American ranchers and others in remote locations along the border get satellite phone service so they can be in touch with authorities. Are free "Obamacars" another rumor driven off track? The roots of the car rumor The Breitbart article related to an amendment filed in June by Sens. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and John Hoeven, R-N.D., to the Senate immigration bill. Their amendment would double the number of border patrol agents to 20,000, complete 700 miles of fencing, and add E-Verify for employment, among other requirements. Another amendment by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., was tacked on to the Corker-Hoeven amendment, and passed on a procedural vote, 67-27, on June 24. The Breitbart article credited another conservative publication, the Washington Examiner, for uncovering "the new Obama stimulus program" that was part of the Sanders amendment. The Examiner article stated that a version of the bill would provide $1.5 billion for jobs for American youth, and was a sweetener to get Sanders’ support. Sanders' intention was to help unemployed young people hit hard by the recession. In a June 21 press release, his office said it was "the least Congress should do in a bill that allows college students from around the world to take jobs that young Americans would otherwise perform." The Breitbart article relied on an anonymous GOP Senate aide to explain the amendment:"This appears to give states authority to buy, lease or rent motorcycles, cars and scooters or anything kids want to buy to get to and from a job," the GOP aide said. But the Examiner article and the Sanders press release didn’t mention cars, motorcycles, scooters -- heck, not even a tricycle. So we hit the virtual road in search of some sort of transportation connection. Sanders amendment would provide transportation ‘services’ A fact sheet about the amendment by Sanders stated that the money for the jobs program would include providing "important services such as transportation and child care, necessary to enable young Americans to participate in job opportunities." Neither the fact sheet nor the amendment defines transportation services. Rubio’s press release states that transportation services "means the program could provide a service, like a bus ride to a work site, but it cannot provide a car, scooter, motorcycle, or pair of rollerblades." Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told PolitiFact in an email that "...the key word in the legislation is ‘service.’ That qualifier means that they will be provided ‘services’ and not ‘goods’ as in ‘goods and services’ (a common term when referring to tangibles and intangibles). In practice, it means the program can gives kids a bus pass – but it’s not giving them a car." Breitbart published a new post in response to Rubio saying his "narrow reading of the bill is unlikely to be applied by the federal government." We asked Warren Gunnels, senior policy adviser to Sanders, who would decide what could qualify as a transportation service. If the law passed, the U.S. Labor Department would have 20 days to create regulations for the jobs program and states would have 30 days to respond. Gunnels said that local workforce boards would come up with proposals that would be vetted by states and then submitted to the Labor Department, which would have the final say. So to believe the Obamacar claim would mean, for example, that a workforce board in Miami would suggest that it would give away free cars or motorcycles, Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s administrators would give that the thumbs up, and the Labor Department would declare that engines go. To be fair, it’s not expressly spelled out in the amendment that car/scooter/rollerblade giveaways are a no-no and that bus passes are a cheaper idea, but there is also no proof that the government would give away vehicles. The transportation and childcare services language is similar to Obama’s American Jobs Act presented to Congress in 2011, which never became law. Sanders provided PolitiFact a response via his spokesman: "This amendment addresses a crisis in youth unemployment in this country. The unemployment rate for 16- to 19-year-olds is 24.5 percent and higher for Hispanics and African-Americans. What my amendment says, which is obvious, is that providing a job for a young person is meaningless if they don’t have transportation to be able to get to that job. So the program has the option of providing funding for bus fare or subway tickets or other means of transportation. It is only the wild imagination that we have come to expect from Fox TV that would come up with this preposterous idea that we are buying automobiles for young people." Our ruling An amendment by Sanders to the immigration bill would provide a youth jobs program that includes the possibility of transportation and child care services. That prompted conservative news outlets to make claims such as, "New Immigration bill has taxpayer subsidized Obamacars for youths." Sanders’ amendment doesn’t define in detail what the transportation services would entail. Ultimately if the bill passes, local workforce boards would propose jobs programs that would be signed off by the states and approved by the U.S. Labor Department. There is no proof to support the idea that the program would include free car, motorcycle or scooter giveaways. In fact, that such a process would end up allowing car giveaways seems laughable. We are putting the brakes on this rumor. Pants on Fire! See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2013-06-26T11:53:09	2013-06-25	['None']
pomt-09551	"Federal employees are making twice as much as their private counterparts."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/03/scott-brown/politifact-debut-brown-says-federal-jobs-pay-twice/	Only 12 days after his upset victory in Massachusetts, Republican Sen.-elect Scott Brown made his debut on the Sunday morning talk circuit. He talked about health care, the war in Afghanistan and deficit reduction in an interview with Barbara Walters on the Jan. 31, 2010 episode of This Week. Brown encouraged President Barack Obama to put a freeze on federal position hires and raises because, "as you know, federal employees are making twice as much as their private counterparts." Federal jobs don't exactly have a reputation for bringing in big bucks, so we were curious about Brown's claim. Before we get into his statement, it's useful to understand how the government sets salaries. Trade, craft and laboring workers are paid according to the Federal Wage System, which pegs pay to local prevailing rates. Salaries for white-collar employees are set under a separate pay system that determines salaries by comparing government positions to similar jobs in the private sector. Increasingly, some agencies and departments are using pay schemes that are more closely tied to performance rather than tenure, according to the Congressional Budget Office, and these workers are generally paid more. It turns out that Brown has talked about federal employee pay before. On Jan. 4, before he was elected, Brown called for a temporary pay freeze for federal workers. "I recognize that our federal workers do important work, but it’s not right that lesser-paid private sector workers suffering through a recession have to pay for expensive government salaries,” he said, citing numbers from the Cato Institute, a libertarian think-tank. In August 2009, Cato published an analysis of wage statistics from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a branch of the U.S. Commerce Department. According to those numbers, the average wage for 1.9 million federal civilian workers was $79,197, compared to $50,028 for the nation’s 108 million private-sector workers. (The analysis leaves out combat military personnel on the theory that there aren't equivalent jobs in the private sector.) Chris Edwards, the director of tax policy studies at Cato who wrote the analysis, later said it generated some controversy. Some critics said that the federal work force is generally more skilled than, say, people who work in the service industry. So naturally, the average would be higher. (Edwards acknowledged that was "an important factor to consider," but said the increase in federal wages has much steeper than the private sector. "Has the composition of the federal work force really changed that much in just eight years to justify such a big relative gain? I doubt it.") Secondly, some critics argued that an average is not especially useful when comparing private and public-sector salaries. John Palguta, vice president of public policy for the Partnership for Public Service, a group that urges people to work in government, told us that a more useful comparison is to look at specific jobs in the public and private sectors and see how they compare. For example, he said, federal doctors and nurses typically do not make as much as they could in private jobs. We checked a variety of sources for apples-to-apples comparisons and found a variety of results. One study came from the Federal Salary Council, an advisory group of labor relations experts and representatives of federal employee unions that helps the U.S. Office of Personnel Management set wage rates. It found that for comparable private and public jobs such as lawyers, public sector employees are paid on average 26 percent less than private sector counterparts. When we checked individual jobs using the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics employment data (from 2008), we found many federal salaries were indeed higher, but some were lower. Higher: A government-employed nurse makes about $74,460 on average, while someone in the same position working for the private sector makes about $65,130. A cashier working for the government makes on average $34,470 while a cashier working in a store only makes a mean of $18,880 annually. And a public-relations manager working for the government makes about $132,410 a year compared to $101,220 in the private sector. Lower: Petroleum engineers working for the government earn an average of $93,140; in the private sector, they make an average of $119,140. An editor working for the government only makes $42,210, compared to an average of $57,180 in the private sector. It's worth noting that the BLS's overall average for federal jobs is $68,740 compared to the private sector average of $42,270, so it reflects the Cato Institute findings. That brings us back to Brown's original statement, that federal employees make twice as much "as their private counterparts." First, even if you look at the average overall, he's exaggerating the difference. The numbers he cites from the Cato study are not twice as high. Secondly, it's important to understand that a big reason for the disparity is the different mix of jobs in the federal work force. It has more higher-paying white-collar jobs, experts told us, while there are more lower-paying, blue-collar jobs in the private sector that bring the average down. So it is not an apples-to-apples comparison. Finally, we found it's a mixed bag when comparing individual private and public sector occupations -- the "private counterparts" he spoke of. Some public jobs pay more, some pay less. And the public ones that pay more are not consistently double as he claimed. So he's wrong to say it's double and wrong to suggest that it's always the case when comparing specific jobs. We rate his claim False.

pomt-06858	"#Business formation is still on the rise in Ohio! So far in 2011 we’ve assisted w/ 44,443 new business filings."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/03/jon-husted/ohio-secretary-state-jon-husted-touts-rise-new-bus/	Ohio politicians have made job creation a top priority and talking point. Gov. John Kasich, for instance, runs nearly every policy proposal through the jobs filter and frequently cites his belief that the state must be more business friendly to spur job growth. Even Secretary of State Jon Husted wants the public to know that he is keeping a close eye on jobs, an issue that he and fellow Republicans successfully harnessed during the 2010 election, when they knocked Democrats from office in part by blaming them for the state’s job woes. Though Husted’s most visible duty is overseeing elections, he is responsible for keeping track of the paperwork filed by individuals and companies – both non profit and for-profit corporations -- that want to do business in Ohio. On July 18, 2011, a tweet by his office’s Twitter account, @OhioSOSHusted, noted that his office has processed more requests to set up companies through June of this year than the office processed during same period last year. "#Business formation is still on the rise in Ohio! So far in 2011 we’ve assisted w/ 44,443 new business filings." The tweet also included a link to a news release his office posted to the Internet. PolitiFact Ohio was intrigued by the tweet and specifically whether the increase in business filings is an indicator of an upswing in business as the message -- and its exclamation point -- suggests. The state handled 41,891 business filings through June 2010. That means the state processed 2,552 more business filings through the first six months of this year – or about 6 percent -- compared to last year, according to Husted’s office. "The number of new business selecting Ohio as a place to do business is heading in the right direction," Husted said in the news release. To get a better perspective on business filings, PolitiFact Ohio asked Matt McClellan from Husted’s office for the six-month and yearly totals of business filings dating back to at January 2005, nearly three years before the recession officially began in December 2007. McClellan offered these additional figures: 2005 (January through June) 42,919; (total for the year) 78,025 2006 (January through June) 41,664; (total for the year) 79,653 2007 (January through June) 41,401; (total for year) 77,582 2008 (January through June) 41,145; (total for year) 77,858 2009 (January through June) 39,691; (total for the year) 75,854 2010 (January through June) 41,891; (total for the year) 80,081 Broadly speaking, these figures show the total number of filings has bobbed up and down and currently trending upward slightly. Narrowing the focus, the January-through-June average total filings for the years leading up to the start of the recession is 41,994; the January-through-June average total filings during the recession is 40,909, or about a 2.5 percent fewer. So how does that compare to the 2011 January-through-June figure that inspired the tweet? It is nearly even with the pre-recession yearly six-month average; and slighlty ahead of the recession average. While the filings figures offer trend line, they tell us very little about the nature of the businesses, leaving to speculation whether they represent signs of real new businesses, future businesses, or just paperwork signaling legal and tax changes. Also, it’s impossible to calculate the number of new businesses without knowing what is happening to existing businesses. If, for instance, new filings increased by 5,000 but 6,000 businesses failed, the uptick in filings, by itself, would create a misleading sign of growth. Husted seems to acknowledge that these numbers provide an incomplete view, but he still sees these as a positive sign. "While recognizing these number can’t provide a complete picture of Ohio’s job climate, they are an important indicator of economic activity that Secretary Husted hopes will add to the discussion of how to improve the state’s overall climate for business," Husted’s news release states. It’s hard to ignore, however, a caveat at the bottom of Husted’s press release: "Filing as a business in Ohio does not guarantee the company will begin operations, be profitable or create jobs." So where does Husted’s tweet land on the Truth-0-Meter? The figure in of itself is correct and points to a slight post-recession upward trend. But the context around the tweet – the figure is worth boasting about because it’s a sign of economy recovery – seems overly optimistic, especially given the news release’s footnote that there’s no guarantee these filings mean more jobs will be created. Husted’s claim is accurate, but leaves out details that provide clarification. PolitiFact rates this claim Mostly True.	None	Jon Husted	None	None	None	2011-08-03T06:00:00	2011-07-18	['Ohio']
pomt-11572	"NFL lawyer, who claimed Super Bowl is ‘rigged’, found dead."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/02/eco-news/story-nfl-lawyer-said-super-bowl-rigged-and-was-mu/	Days before the Super Bowl, fake news articles circulating on Facebook claimed that a National Football League lawyer named Dan Goodes was shot dead in a "gangland-style execution" hours after blowing the whistle on the "rigged Super Bowl." "NFL lawyer, who claimed Super Bowl is ‘rigged,’ found dead," stated the Feb. 1 headline on Eco News, a website that claims it is on the frontline for "earth liberation." Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The story copies an earlier fake story by YourNewsWire, a website that publishes fake news. We sent messages to both websites and didn’t get a reply. We found no evidence that an NFL lawyer named Dan Goodes even exists, or that he was found dead in his BMW in Manhattan. NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy told PolitiFact that the NFL has no attorney named Dan Goodes. He called the story "ridiculous," "bogus" and "fake." The story said that Goodes had been representing the NFL in Minneapolis to promote the 2018 Super Bowl featuring the Philadelphia Eagles and New England Patriots when he went off script and claimed that the NFL rigged the game to earn maximum revenue for league. "According to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system," the article said. The article included a mock screenshot of a Jan. 28 New York Times article about the alleged shooting of the lawyer founded slumped over the wheel of his BMW. But the article doesn’t appear in Nexis. "Nothing about this is real, down to the URL," New York Times spokeswoman Eileen Murphy told PolitiFact. "It's a false reference to a non-existent NYT story." The Eco News story included a photo of two police officers at a crime scene. We searched Google images and found it matched an Associated Press photo of a crime scene near the site where a police officer was fatally shot in the Bronx in July. It also contained an alleged photo of NFL headquarters; however, a search of that photo in Google images resulted in a match to a picture on the South Park Studios website. Other conspiracy theories about Super Bowl rigging Readers should beware of other conspiracy theories about the Super Bowl. The Facebook page Satire Daily, which clearly identifies itself as satire, published a video seemingly documenting that the NFL had openly admitted to rigging games. Snopes debunked the claim in January. The video focused on a referee who congratulated the team’s quarterback Tom Brady after the Patriots beat the Jaguars. That actually happened. Referee Clete Blakeman did Brady a congratulatory pat on the chest, which fueled some conspiracy theories. NFL spokesman McCarthy told PolitiFact, "It's not uncommon for an official to congratulate a player after a game." Another situation that fueled conspiracy theories stemmed from an actual NFL ad on social media in January before the NFC Championship Game. The ad featured photos of the Patriots and Vikings quarterbacks and said, "When you donate to United Way, you could score 2 club-level seats to watch the Patriots vs. the Vikings battle it out for the coveted Super Bowl title!" The NFL apologized for the ads. "It was a regrettable mistake," an unnamed NFL spokesman told media. "The ads were mocked up using all the (possible) combinations, but weren’t supposed to go until Monday when the matchup is known. Obviously, someone jumped the gun." McCarthy also told PolitiFact the ad was a mistake. Our ruling In the world of real news, PolitiFact has fact-checked many claims related to past Super Bowls related to weather, records and spending as well as human trafficking and domestic violence and economic impact. But in this case, the claim that an "NFL lawyer, who claimed Super Bowl is ‘rigged’, found dead" is fake news. We rate this story Pants on Fire!

pomt-09447	George W. Bush was "the least popular president in modern history."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/mar/08/dana-milbank/milbank-says-bush-was-least-popular-president-mode/	It's become an article of faith for many Democrats that the presidency of George W. Bush was a failure. That kind of opinion is beyond the scope of the Truth-O-Meter, but we do feel comfortable assessing something more concrete: measuring how Bush fared in public opinion polls. In a March 7, 2010, opinion column, the Washington Post's Dana Milbank took a critical -- and in some cases, rather harsh -- look at the new memoir by Karl Rove called Courage and Consequence: My Life as a Conservative in the Fight. In his column, Milbank writes that before the former Bush adviser published his book, he had "2 1/2 years to reflect on what turned Bush into the least popular president in modern history." We thought it worth checking whether Milbank was correct that George W. Bush was "the least popular president in modern history." We will start by raising a caveat. Milbank's exact words were that Bush was "the least popular president in modern history." There's no direct scientific measurement of popularity, but the polling industry offers two barometers that come close: presidential approval ratings and presidential favorability. Approval ratings are based on how well poll respondents rate the job someone is doing as president ("Do you approve or disapprove of the job the president is doing?"). By contrast, favorability questions are more broad. They usually ask whether the respondent feels favorably or unfavorably toward the president. (Pollsters call the two numbers the "fave/unfave"). Favorability is not strictly about someone's job performance, though that certainly plays a role in most people's assessments; rather, it's about how they feel generally toward the person. The differences between these two measures are not trivial. President Bill Clinton famously recorded strong job-approval ratings even as his personal popularity sagged during the Monica Lewinsky scandal. The opposite seems to be happening with President Barack Obama, who has maintained relatively robust favorability rankings even as his job approval numbers have sunk. However you decide this question, most polling experts agree that Gallup offers the best source material to test Milbank's claim, since it offers both the longest-running data set (going as far back as Harry Truman for approval rating) and the most consistent wording. One drawback: Gallup only began asking regular favorability questions in 1992, the final year of George H.W. Bush's presidency. The company continued through the presidencies of Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama. Here's how Bush stacked up: Measured on favorability, Bush did indeed record the lowest numbers of the four presidents studied. His father George H.W. Bush never fell below 38 percent favorability, Clinton never fell below 42 percent, and Obama has not yet fallen below 55 percent. But George W. Bush recorded a low of 32 percent. That bolsters Milbank's point, but it's a narrow field. It only compares Bush against the full term of one other president -- Clinton -- and brief portions of two others. And besides, it's hard to argue that the "modern" presidential era, to use Milbank's term, began in 1992. Polling experts told us job approval is a better measure. That allows us to compare Bush against nine of his predecessors and Obama. But there are several ways to slice the data: • Average job-approval rating. On this one, George W. Bush ranks in the bottom half of the table, but well above the bottom. With an average job-approval rating of 49.4 percent, Bush ranked below John F. Kennedy (70.1 percent), Dwight Eisenhower (65.0), George H.W. Bush (60.9), Lyndon Johnson and Bill Clinton (tied at 55.1) and Ronald Reagan (52.8). But Bush ranked ahead of Richard Nixon (49.0), Gerald Ford (47.2), Jimmy Carter (45.5) and Truman (45.4). (We're not counting Obama in this category because of his short tenure.) So by this measure, Bush was not the least popular modern president. • Final job approval rating. Measured by final job-approval rating just before they left office, Bush ranks low, but -- once again -- not the lowest in the "modern era." He ranks behind Clinton (66 percent), Reagan (63), Eisenhower (59), Kennedy (58), George H.W. Bush (56), Ford (53) and Johnson (49). But Bush is tied with Carter at 34 percent, and ranks ahead of Truman at 32 percent and Nixon at 24 percent. (Here too, we won't count Obama because he's in the midst of his term.) By this measure, too, Bush was not the least popular modern president. • Lowest job approval rating at any point. By this measure, Bush -- who bottomed out at 25 percent approval -- comes close to ranking the lowest. His worst rating is lower than those of nine presidents (including Obama) and is narrowly ahead of two others. In descending order, the low scores run from a high of 56 percent (Kennedy), through Eisenhower (48), Obama (47), Ford and Clinton (37 each), Johnson (35), Reagan (35), George H.W. Bush (29) and Carter (28). Bush's score ranked slightly ahead of Nixon at 24 percent and Truman at 22 percent. We asked Gallup spokesman Eric Nielsen whether there was any practical difference between Bush's 25 percent, Nixon's 24 percent and Truman's 22 percent. He noted that most of these polls have an error margin of plus or minus 3 percent, which suggested to him that these three low scores are close enough to be statistically tied. So even though Bush's worst number isn't technically the lowest of the bunch, it's close enough that we can't say for sure that it's not the lowest. • Highest presidential disapproval ratings. Gallup doesn't post a summary of highest disapproval ratings on its Web site, but Charles Franklin, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin (Madison) and co-founder of the Web site Pollster.com, told PolitiFact that only four presidents have registered disapproval ratings north of 60 percent. George H.W. Bush peaked at 60 percent disapproval in Gallup's polls. Nixon peaked at 66 percent. Truman peaked at 67 percent. And George W. Bush peaked at ... 71 percent -- easily the highest on record. So measured by highest disapproval ratings, Milbank would be right. The results, then, are a mixed bag. We can't use the favorability rating because it only goes back to 1992. As for job approval, two of the three measures show that Bush was definitely not the least popular president. In the third, it was a statistical tie for the bottom spot. The only way Bush is the clearly the least popular is when measured by disapproval ratings. So we rate Milbank's claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14423	"If you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed. … African-American kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/10/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-statistic-black-hispanic-unemployme/	During the Univision-Washington Post Democratic presidential debate in Miami, Bernie Sanders highlighted the bleak economic prospects of minority youths. "One of the points that I've been making, and media does not seem to pick up on it, is that we have a real crisis not only with real unemployment in America being close to 10 percent, but youth unemployment in this country," Sanders said. "If you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed. … African-American kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent." We checked a nearly identical statement by Sanders back in July 2015, when Sanders mentioned it at a campaign event in Portland, Maine. We rated it Mostly True. Now, eight months later, we’ll revisit it. We’ll start by noting that the most commonly used unemployment-rate statistic is not as high for each group as Sanders indicated. The most readily available data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics covers the age range from 16 to 19, which isn’t identical but gives a quick approximation. For whites in that age range, the official unemployment rate in February 2016 was 13.9 percent, for Hispanics it was 15.6 percent and for African-Americans it was 23.3 percent. In other words, the official unemployment rate shows that African-American youth unemployment is significantly higher than white youth unemployment and, to a lesser extent, higher than Hispanic youth unemployment. Still, the levels for each group are lower than what Sanders said. So what’s going on? Sanders’ camp pointed us to research published in June 2015 by the Economic Policy Institute, a left-of-center think tank. The numbers in the report match what Sanders said at the debate. This data is different from the more familiar measurements for a few reasons. One, the institute didn’t just look at employment status for people between the ages of 17 and 20; it limited its reach to high school graduates who were not enrolled in further schooling. And two, EPI counted not only unemployed workers but also those who were working part-time due to the weakness of the economy and those who were "marginally attached to the labor force." The latter category includes people who did not meet the strict definition of being in the job market, but weren’t entirely out of the market, either. The statistic EPI used, known by the wonky shorthand U-6, is officially called a measure of "labor underutilization" rather than "unemployment." EPI itself used the term "underemployment" in its research. At the Miami debate, Sanders described this statistic accurately, referring to individuals who are "unemployed or underemployed." So his statement has merit. However, the data is getting a little stale, and since the employment picture has generally been improving since the middle of last year, that’s a potential problem for the accuracy of Sanders’ statement. The last month analyzed in the EPI study was March 2015. We don’t know exactly how much improvement there’s been for young, minority, high school graduates since then, because that specific slice of the data isn’t readily available on the Bureau of Labor Statistics website. But we can do a quick estimate based on the change in unemployment rates for 16-to-19-year-old Hispanics and African-Americans between March 2015 and February 2016. During that period -- since the EPI report came out -- the unemployment rate for young Hispanics fell from 20.9 percent to 15.6 percent, and for young African-Americans, it fell from 25.1 percent to 23.3 percent. In other words, it’s quite possible that the unemployment rates for young, minority, high-school grads is lower now than what Sanders stated. We should caution that the unemployment rate for subsets of the population, such as minority groups, tends to be volatile and has a larger margin of error than for the population as a whole. Still, the unemployment rates for these groups do seem to be lower in more recent months. During 2015, the black youth unemployment rate often reached or exceeded 30 percent, making the current rate of 23.3 percent particularly low -- the lowest since 2000, in fact. Similarly, in 2015, the Hispanic youth unemployment rate often reached or exceeded 20 percent, a level well above the current 15.6 percent rate. Our ruling Sanders said that "if you look at Latino kids between 17 and 20 who graduated high school, 36 percent of them are unemployed or underemployed. … African-American kids are unemployed or underemployed to the tune of 51 percent." As was the case when we first reviewed this claim last July, Sanders’ general point is correct -- that in an apples-to-apples comparison, African-American and Hispanic youth have significantly worse prospects in the job market than whites do. But while Sanders had support for this data when he first began using these numbers eight months ago, there’s reason to believe that the improving job market has lowered these rates, at least somewhat. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-03-10T00:27:48	2016-03-09	['None']

pomt-07404	"Texans spend $2.5 billion gambling in our neighboring states every year."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/apr/29/texans-economic-development/pro-gambling-group-says-texans-annually-gamble-25-/	An online banner ad on the Austin American-Statesman’s website April 19 made us eager to try our luck. "Thank you Texas," says a color postcard featuring slot machines and addressed to the state of Texas. The ad, sponsored by a group that seeks to legalize slot machines in Texas, features three messages -- New Mexico thanking Texas for "your" $27 million and Louisiana and Oklahoma each offering thanks for "your" $1 billion. Text below the postcards states: "Texans spend $2.5 billion gambling in our neighboring states every year." That’s a lot of quarters. Is it right? We asked Texans for Economic Development, the ad’s sponsor, for elaboration. The group, consisting of horse racing interests, wants Texas lawmakers to ask voters to permit slot machines at 13 in-state horse and greyhound tracks and three Indian reservations. Its spokesman, Mike Lavigne, passed along a July 7, 2010, report prepared for the group by TXP, an Austin economic policy consulting group, stating that in 2009, Texans spent $2.7 billion on gaming and related activities in nearby states. The report says Texans gambled most of that -- $2.57 billion -- immediate neighbors-with-casinos: Oklahoma, where the report says Texans threw down nearly $1.2 billion; Louisiana, about $1.1 billion; and New Mexico, $27 million. The state-by-state figures were based on various sources "including state gaming commissions, primary field research, convention and visitors bureaus ... and other academic studies," the report says. We wondered where those figures originated. Casinos would be ideal sources for how much Texans plunk down across state lines, but we found no evidence they talk about their customer base. Hence, Alan Meister, who analyzes gaming issues for an Arlington, Va., consulting firm, advised us that certain "assumptions have to be made" to estimate the dollars gambled by residents of various states. In an interview, Jon Hockenyos,TXP’s president, explained that the firm had to mesh different data "to get the right order of magnitude" for how much Texans were gambling. "It’s like making fruit salad," he said. The firm’s recipe, according to Hockenyos: --In Oklahoma, researchers counted Texas license plates at a range of tribal gambling venues, finding Texas plates accounted for 90 percent of the vehicles in a sampling from halls close to Texas; 47 percent of plates at a sampling of casinos farther away; and 6 percent of establishments farthest from Texas. Using the number of slot machines at each hall, TXP concluded that Texans accounted for 37 percent of the casinos’ total reported gaming revenue in 2009, which TXP estimated at $3.2 billion based on a national Indian gaming report. Hockenyos also noted a March 9 news article in The Tulsa World, quoting a study by Meister, that said tribal gaming revenue in Oklahoma for 2009 was $3.1 billion. The estimated piece of the Oklahoma gambling action credited to Texans: $1.18 billion. --For Louisiana, TXP zeroed in on a 2009-10 report by the state on the economic impact of Louisiana’s riverboat casino industry. It said 62 percent of the casinos’ visitors came from another state or more than 150 miles away. TXP, mindful that Texans accounted for 70 percent of the combined 2008 populations of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, extrapolated from those percentages to estimate the Texans’ share of the far-away visitors -- 43 percent -- and multiplied that percentage by the state-reported 2009 gambling revenue, about $2.5 billion. Wade Duty, executive director of the Louisiana Casino Association, forwarded what he described as a yet-to-be published January survey result indicating that 49 percent of riverboat casino customers hail from other states or more than 150 miles away. Informed of the lower figure, Texans for Economic Development reduced its estimate of the money Texans gamble in Louisiana from $1.1 billion to $869 million. Duty said he’s not sure about the assumption that Texans comprised 70 percent of those out-of-state and long-distance gamblers. The Harvey Canal, site of a New Orleans riverboat casino, may be beautiful, he said, but "people aren’t spending 16 hours in a car to come from Midland." Duty called TXP’s revised estimate for how much Texans’ gambled "more reasonable," but said: "I can’t say it’s correct." Duty said a better way of estimating Texans’ expenditures would start with interviews of gambling patrons to gauge where they came from, how long they’d stayed and what they’d gambled. --For New Mexico, TXP concluded that Texans over all accounted for about 8 percent of the money gambled in casinos and racinos, which are race tracks with slot machines. Hockenyos noted that nearly 4,000 slot machines -- a little less than one third of all the slot machines in the state -- are in southern New Mexico, near El Paso. El Paso’s population accounts for more than 65 percent of the residents of that southern sector, Hockenyos said, and Texans account for more than 20 percent of New Mexico’s annual visitors. TXP applied the Texans’ 8 percent to what it then believed to be relevant gaming spending of nearly $350 million, making the Texans’ share $27 million. However, Hockenyos said, he later realized he’d inappropriately folded in licensing fees and also under-counted the year’s gambling expenditures, which were $968 million, according to records posted online by the New Mexico Gaming Control Board. The revised Texans’ portion? About $77 million. So, with the firm’s latest tweaks, the three-state estimate is closer to $2.1 billion. Everyone aboard with that? Well, no. Stephen Reeves, a spokesman for the anti-gambling, Baptist-backed Christian Life Commission, said counting license plates is a poor way of gauging how much Texans spend in casinos. He followed up by email: "However, if doing so I would suggest that the frequency that a particular car shows up must be taken into account to determine how much money they are ‘spending.’" Our take: The fruit-salad methodology used by the consulting group was not perfect. Absent precise data, though, TXP’s estimate of how much money Texans gamble in neighboring states looks reasonable, though it’s a stretch to claim Texans gamble the same total amount every year.

pomt-07027	"You see a whole bunch of Korean cars here in the United States, and you don't see any American cars in Korea."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/04/barack-obama/barack-obama-said-you-dont-see-american-made-cars-/	President Barack Obama criticized Congress at a Wednesday press conference for not passing legislation that would help the economy. One example, he said, was that Congress needs to approve pending trade agreements. "I think these trade deals will be important because right now South Korea, frankly, has a better deal when it comes to our trading relationship than we do. Part of the reason I want to pass this trade deal is you see a whole bunch of Korean cars here in the United States, and you don't see any American cars in Korea. So let's re-balance that trading relationship. That's why we should get this passed," he said. We decided to fact-check Obama's statement about cars in the United States and Korea. Our first stop was to look at the statistics on auto imports and exports. We turned to numbers compiled by the U.S. Commerce Department. The numbers show that the United States exported 16,659 vehicles to Korea in 2010. Korea, meanwhile, exported 515,646 vehicles to the United States. That means that for every car we sent to Korea, the Koreans sent more than 30 to us. And we should note the 16,659 represented a six-year high; between 2005 and 2010 the number was even lower. It's true that South Korea has a smaller population than the United States, with about 48.8 million people there and 313.2 million people here. But that is an imbalance of about 1 to 6, significantly smaller than the disparity in auto sales. So Obama's larger point about a significant trade imbalance for cars is correct. Experts we spoke with also said he was largely correct that South Korea has "a better deal" when it comes to our trading relationship. Still, Obama's statement requires a few qualifications, they said. For one thing, there are not clear categories of American cars and Korean cars. Kia Motors, for example, has a large auto plant in Georgia, and Hyundai Motors has a plant in Alabama. It's possible that some of the cars the United States sold to Korea could be Korean-branded cars. Meanwhile, General Motors owns the Korean auto company Daewoo, which it purchased back in 2001. One estimate we saw said GM sold 90,000 Korean-made cars in Korea in 2008. This year, GM decided to end the Daewoo brand and operate as GM Korea. The Korean-made cars it now sells in the country carry typical American brands like Chevrolet. Additionally, the experts we spoke with presented a more nuanced picture of whether the trade agreement would actually help U.S. automakers sell more cars in Korea. Koreans tend to favor smaller, more fuel-efficient cars, and the government there maintains strict standards for fuel efficiency and other things that make it hard for American companies to compete, even if tariffs between the two countries are reduced. To look at it more optimistically, though, they said the proposed trade agreement would not make things worse for U.S. automakers. "I don't think we can get any worse," said Sean McAlinden, chief economist for the independent Center for Automotive Research. "The Koreans are doing all the damage they can do right now." Finally, we wanted to address the point of whether American made cars are rarely seen in Korea. David Straub, who leads the Korean Studies Program at Stanford University, lived in Seoul in 2007, so we asked him if he ever saw an American branded car while he was there. He said the statistics show that there are indeed some American cars are in South Korea. "But did I ever see an American car? I don't recall seeing one," he said. It's worth noting that Obama's press conference didn't do much to prod Congress to act on the trade agreement. The day after his remarks, Senate Republicans boycotted a hearing on the trade agreement, arguing that the trade agreement should not include $1 billion in additional spending to help workers who become unemployed as a result of international trade. Overall, though, we found little dispute that Obama's statement, "You see a whole bunch of Korean cars here in the United States, and you don't see any American cars in Korea," is largely correct, if you account for the complexity of international trade. Korean companies are building cars in America, while American companies build cars in Korea. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-03773	Says the president of the University of Texas has raised four-year student graduation rates to 75 percent.	false	/texas/statements/2013/apr/02/matt-mackowiak/matt-mackowiak-says-ut-president-has-raised-four-y/	Analyzing flashpoints of debate concerning the flagship University of Texas, Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak credited UT’s president with greatly driving up student graduation rates. Bill Powers, who has faced public questioning from members of the UT System Board of Regents, "has instituted reforms on his own," Mackowiak wrote in an opinion column published by the Austin American-Statesman on April 1, 2013. He added that UT System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa had recently said Powers raised UT-Austin’s "four-year graduation rate from 53 percent to 75 percent." We were unaware of such a spike since Powers took over as president in 2006. After emailing Mackowiak about his conclusion, we turned to news stories on campus graduation rates as well as research cupboarded by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. According to a June 7, 2012, American-Statesman article, Powers set a goal in 2011 of at least 70 percent of the fall 2012 entering class earning a degree within four years. In contrast, UT's graduation rate had lately ranged from about 46 percent in 2000 to nearly 53 percent in 2005, the story said, with the 51 percent rate for the class of 2011 proving to be the highest among the state's 38 public universities for that year. A Feb. 12, 2013, Statesman news story said UT efforts to meet the goal "include stepped-up freshman orientation to reshape a campus culture that has long tolerated a more leisurely trajectory to graduation; the appointment of a senior vice provost to champion the four-year graduation cause; and the allotment of $5 million to encourage students to finish on time, with some of that money earmarked for financial aid to those making steady academic progress." Next, we asked the coordinating board for its calculation of UT-Austin’s four-year graduation rates. Spokesman Dominic Chavez emailed us a spreadsheet indicating the rate has ranged from 52 percent in fiscal 2007, which began Sept. 1, 2006, about seven months into Powers’ tenure, to 53 percent in fiscal 2012, the year ending Aug. 31, 2012. Chavez said each board calculation reflects the share of full-time students who enrolled in the fall of the year four years before, meaning the 2012 rate would sweep in students who had first enrolled in fall 2008 and graduated by the end of August 2012. Chavez said the reported rates may differ from other calculations because the board credits an institution where a student began his education even if the student has transferred and ultimately graduated elsewhere. We also asked UT-Austin about its four-year graduation rates. Spokesman Gary Susswein emailed a spreadsheet indicating the four-year rate has improved from 51 to 52 percent through Powers’ presidency. As we gathered this information, Mackowiak said by email that he picked up the graduation statistic from remarks by Cigarroa during a public interview by the Texas Tribune. In the March 28, 2013, interview, Cigarroa credited Powers for saying "we will increase the four-year graduation rate from 53 percent to 75 percent. And he put his neck out on the line and he’s going to do it." On review, Mackowiak said, it’s clear the escalated four-year graduation rate is a goal. "It’s my mistake," he wrote. At Mackowiak's nudge, the American-Statesman published a correction of his column. Our ruling Mackowiak said UT-Austin’s president had driven four-year graduation rates to 75 percent. However, the latest four-year graduation rate on the campus was no greater than 53 percent, compared to rates the same or a bit lower in the other full years of Powers’ presidency. The institution's declared goal is a four-year rate of at least 70 percent. We rate the claim as False. UPDATE, April 9, 2013: This story was updated to reflect the American-Statesman publishing a correction of Mackowiak's oped column. This did not affect our rating of his claim.

pomt-15079	The Obama administration’s "own Environmental Protection Agency" has said its Clean Power Plan "will have a marginal impact on climate change."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/sep/21/scott-walker/even-epa-says-obamas-power-plan-will-have-only-mar/	When the second Republican presidential debate took up climate change, Gov. Scott Walker made a counterintuitive claim about President Barack Obama’s Clean Power Plan, which requires the nation’s power plans to reduce their carbon emissions by nearly a third. About midway into the Sept. 16, 2015 debate, held in California, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida was expressing concerns to moderator Jake Tapper about higher utility rates and fewer jobs. That's when Walker interjected and said: "A lot of those people, though, and I'm going to echo what Senator Rubio just said. This is an issue where, we're talking about my state, it's thousands of manufacturing jobs. Thousands of manufacturing jobs for a rule the Obama administration, (its) own EPA has said will have a marginal impact on climate change." Walker’s campaign confirmed to us that the governor was referring to the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan, and to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. There are differences of opinion, of course, over how much one plan in one country can affect the global climate. But to Walker’s claim: Did the EPA -- the agency administering the Clean Power Plan -- say the plan’s regulations would have only a marginal effect on climate change? The plan In August 2015, the Obama administration announced that its Clean Power Plan regulations would require power plants to reduce carbon emissions, from 2005 levels, by 32 percent by 2030. (A 2014 draft of the plan had sought a 30 percent reduction.) Advocates said the reduction would help attack global warming and provide reductions in other emissions that create soot and smog. But the announcement prompted Walker to add Wisconsin to states that are challenging the first-ever requirements in court. The reductions won't be uniform, because individual states rely on different mixes of coal, natural gas, nuclear energy, water, wind and the sun to provide power. Wisconsin, which has traditionally relied heavily on coal, faces having to reduce emissions 34 percent-- the sixth-highest rate in the country, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. EPA’s view As for the the EPA, it has described the Clean Power Plan as a necessary, though not sufficient, step in addressing climate change -- and as part of a larger strategy to spur other nations to reduce emissions. During a July 2015 congressional hearing, U.S. Rep. Lamar Smith, chairman of the House Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, challenged EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy on the impact on climate change. The Texas Republican quoted a former EPA assistant secretary under Obama as saying the plan would, at most, reduce the global temperature by 1/100 of a degree Celsius. McCarthy responded by saying that the value of the plan can’t be measured that way. She said that while the plan mandates carbon emission reductions in the United States, it also aims to prod other nations to reduce their emissions and to trigger investment in technological innovations that also will reduce emissions. The value of the plan is "in showing strong domestic action, which can actually trigger global action," McCarthy said. "(I’m) not disagreeing that this action in and of itself will not make all the difference we need to address climate action. But what I'm saying is if don't take action domestically, we will never get started." (Separately, EPA spokeswoman Liz Purchia told us the agency has said the Clean Power Plan "is only one component of our larger strategy," which includes measures for vehicle fuel efficiency and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.) During the same hearing, there were fears expressed that the plan will drive up the cost of electricity to consumers. And U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., expressed concern that China, India and Russia would not reduce the growth in their carbon emissions. So, the head of the EPA acknowledges that the Clean Power Plan -- since it applies only to the United States -- can have only a limited impact on global climate change. But besides reducing carbon emissions in the United States, the plan is aimed at getting other nations to do the same. Other views We interviewed two experts about the Clean Power Plan and the EPA’s take on it: Adele Morris of the Brookings Institution’s Climate and Energy Economics Project, and Chip Knappenberger of the Cato Institute’s Center for the Study of Science. Both agreed that the United States historically is a major emitter of carbons, but growing nations such as India and China will play a larger role in future emissions. And they agreed that a key part of the EPA’s strategy with the Clean Power Plan is that as a global leader, if the United States reduces emissions, other nations might be spurred to do so, as well. Other experts have made the same point. "This appears to be an intentionally obfuscating perspective," Dallas Burtraw, a senior fellow at Resources for the Future a think tank that tracks energy policy, said of Walker's claim. "Climate change is a global problem. The contribution of U.S. efforts are greater, in my mind, for the influence they have on the behavior of the other nations of the world than for the specific reductions that the U.S. achieves. The greater contribution is leadership in this case." In June 2015 -- five months before a United Nations summit meeting aimed at forging a global accord to cut climate-warming emissions -- China submitted a plan to the U.N. detailing how it plans to reduce fossil fuel emissions by 2030. The New York Times reported that climate policy experts cited the significance of China’s plan, given that the United States and China -- the world’s top greenhouse gas polluters -- have long been viewed as the biggest obstacles to reaching a meaningful global warming deal. Our rating In the debate, Walker said the Obama administration’s "own Environmental Protection Agency" has said its Clean Power Plan "will have a marginal impact on climate change." The EPA acknowledges that the plan can have only a limited effect on global climate change, given that they order reductions in carbon emission only in the United States. But a key aim of the plan is to spur other nations to reduce their emissions, as well, and to spur new technologies that will help reduce emissions. Walker’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2015-09-21T11:42:11	2015-09-16	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-08571	Says the U.S. Constitution provides for just compensation when land is taken under eminent domain.	true	/texas/statements/2010/sep/28/todd-staples/todd-staples-says-us-constitution-provides/	Republican Todd Staples, the state agriculture commissioner seeking re-election against Democrat Hank Gilbert, is no lawyer. But he kinda played one in a Sept. 16 interview on an Austin radio station. Staples, pitching for listeners to sign an online petition urging the 2011 Legislature to embrace "true eminent-domain reforms," told KVET-FM morning hosts Bob Cole and Bucky Godbolt: "What we're talking about is a basic constitutional right of property owners. Our United States Constitution says that if eminent domain has to be used, a property owner must be justly compensated, period." The Bill of Rights says pay up? Get out (that's just an expression). The actual language doesn't say "must," but the meaning aligns with Staples' comment. The Fifth Amendment to the Constitution says no private property shall "be taken for public use, without just compensation." Nationally, Staples is among figures to air frets about the power of government to "take" property for declared public purposes, in part reacting a 2005 U.S. Supreme Court decision, in Kelo v. City of New London, upholding a community's right to take property for an economic redevelopment project; the plaintiff had maintained the city's plan for her land did not constitute "public use" under the Fifth Amendment. According to an April 2009 article in the American Bar Association's Journal, 43 states enacted statutes or constitutional amendments restricting the use of eminent domain in the wake of the court ruling, while at least five state supreme courts issued rulings to "significantly impede government power to take private property." In Texas, the federal ruling contributed to the 2009 Legislature proposing a state constitutional amendment which voters adopted last year. The amendment prohibits the taking of private property for transfer to a private entity for the purpose of economic development or to increase tax revenues, according to the Texas Secretary of State's office. Gilbert has questioned Staples' bonafides for talking up laws against government taking private property without just compensation. In a Sept. 17 press release, the Democrat singles out measures Staples supported as a state senator to suggest he's not always aligned with private property owners. That sally may be valid; we're not judging it here. We rate Staples' statement to KVET as True.	None	Todd Staples	None	None	None	2010-09-28T06:00:00	2010-09-16	['None']
pomt-07771	A federal system that verifies employees are authorized to work in the U.S. is inaccurate "anywhere from 50 percent all the way up to in excess of 80" percent of the time.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/feb/23/david-raynor/Georgia-Chamber-E-Verify-accuracy-problems/	Backers of bills before the General Assembly argue that stopping illegal immigrants from working in Georgia can be as simple as pushing a few buttons. Just type a new employee’s name into the website of the federal program E-Verify, which confirms whether he or she can work legally in the U.S. Some employers already use it, but Georgia should make it mandatory, backers argue. Not so fast, critics say. "There are some inaccuracies that exist within pilot programs such as E-Verify," cautioned David Raynor, a lobbyist for the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, on Feb. 8 in a legislative committee meeting on one of the bills. How bad is the error rate? State Rep. Rich Golick, R-Smyrna, a co-sponsor of the bill, asked Raynor. "I don’t have it, Mr. Chairman, in front of me today. I know we’ve seen quotes from different reports that have shown anywhere from 50 percent all the way up to in excess of 80," Raynor replied. That same day, Gov. Nathan Deal noted "there are questions being raised" about E-Verify’s accuracy. Sounds bad, we thought. So, are there inaccuracies in E-Verify? House Bill 87 and Senate Bill 40 would require many businesses to use E-Verify, which handled more than 16 million queries during fiscal year 2010, according to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. SB 40 exempts farmers and other employers who participate in federal programs that allow noncitizens to work here legally. An employer enters a new hire’s information, which E-Verify tries to match with records from the Social Security Administration and the DHS. If there’s a match and the worker is authorized, the employee stays. If there’s no match, the system issues a "tentative nonconfirmation," which the employee can contest. If that challenge is unsuccessful, E-Verify issues a "final nonconfirmation," and the employee can be fired. E-Verify, which was originally named the "Basic Pilot Program," is mandatory for federal contractors and employers in Arizona, Mississippi, South Carolina and Utah. In Georgia, public agencies and employers with public contracts must use it. Now, on to our analysis. A chamber spokeswoman referred us to Kim Thompson, an Atlanta labor attorney who advises the chamber on E-Verify. "I wouldn’t say the problems are necessarily significant, but there are problems," Thompson said. She said she has handled cases in which E-Verify failed to confirm legal workers, but the program’s accuracy has recently improved. Thompson referred PolitiFact Georgia to the federal Government Accountability Office, which issued a report on the program in December, plus an audit of the program by independent contractor Westat, a research company. Indeed, the GAO and experts for and against making E-Verify mandatory agree that the program has improved. It’s overwhelmingly accurate for authorized workers, but it fails to catch a large percentage of illegal ones. The most current data says that overall, it was inaccurate between 2.3 and 5.7 percent of the time, according to Westat. For legal workers, its error rate was between 0.6 percent and 1 percent, Westat found. But of the workers it thought may be unauthorized, 22 percent were actually legal. E-Verify mistook legal, foreign-born workers for illegal ones 20 percent more often than it did for their U.S.-born counterparts, according to Westat. The system especially struggled with workers with Hispanic and Arab surnames, which means "increased potential exists for an adverse impact on individuals’ civil rights and civil liberties," the GAO warned. Los Angeles County, which used the program, had a harder time with E-Verify. There, it was wrong 2 percent of the time, and 95 percent of the people it thought may be illegal workers turned out to be legal, according to the Migration Policy Institute, an immigration think tank that thinks mandating E-Verify may do more harm than good. E-Verify’s biggest shortcoming was catching illegal workers. It cleared them to work an estimated 37 to 64 percent of the time. Illegal workers and shady employers often use fraudulent documents that E-Verify can’t detect, the GAO said. Whether E-Verify is accurate enough to be mandated is up for debate. "I would say that if it’s not ready now, it’s on the cusp of being ready," said Janice Kephart, an expert with the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for lower immigration levels. Marc Rosenblum, an immigration expert with the Migration Policy Institute, told PolitiFact Georgia that E-Verify does little for employers since it fails to catch so many unauthorized workers. He concluded in a report this month that "E-Verify remains vulnerable to identity fraud and employer misuse, and offers no ability to detect off-the-books employment." To sum up: E-Verify is overwhelmingly accurate with legal workers but fails to identify a large percentage of illegal ones. Indeed, as Raynor said, "there are some inaccuracies that exist" in E-Verify. But his suggestion the error rate ranges between 50 and 80 percent was too high. E-Verify’s worst error rate -- for illegal workers -- is high, but it’s still well below what Raynor suggested. For all workers, it shrinks to 2.3 to 5.7 percent. While Raynor’s main point was correct, he was wrong on important details about E-Verify’s overall accuracy. We therefore rule his statement Half True.

pomt-10978	"The Electoral College is much more advantageous for Democrats."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/17/donald-trump/donald-trumps-questionable-claim-electoral-college/	It may be more than a year and a half since the presidential election, but time and again, President Donald Trump has brought up his Electoral College victory in 2016 — even at unexpected moments, such as the joint press conference he held with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on July 16, 2018. At one point, Trump said, "The Democrats lost an election which, frankly, they should have been able to win, because the Electoral College is much more advantageous for Democrats, as you know, than it is to Republicans." When we checked with political experts, they expressed skepticism that the Electoral College is "much more advantageous to the Democrats," particularly today. The myth of the "blue wall" During the 2016 campaign, there was a widespread belief among the public that there was a "blue wall" of solidly Democratic states protecting Clinton. It’s human nature to assume what has happened previously will continue into the future. So after Barack Obama, a Democrat, won the 2008 and 2012 elections, some assumed that the Democrats would have a leg up in 2016 as well. To take just one example, in 2014, a column in the conservative Washington Examiner was headlined, "How the Electoral College favors Democrats and why Republicans must change it." The column argued that the Democrats start with a base of 242 electoral votes, compared with just 170 for the Republicans. Under that scenario, the Democrats would need just 28 more electoral votes to clinch the presidency; the Republicans would have a much tougher road to winning. But there’s a catch: To get to that 242 number, the column lumped in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — with a collective 46 electoral votes — with those Democratic base states. There was some logic to that decision, as each of the three states had voted for the Democratic nominee in the previous six presidential elections. And in the case of Michigan and Wisconsin at least, Hillary Clinton’s campaign effectively agreed, largely skipping appearances in those states as Election Day neared. But there are two problems with using this argument as support for Trump’s assertion. First, the notion that Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin are bedrock Democratic states was shattered by Trump himself. And his victory undermines his assertion in Helsinki -- in the present tense -- that the Electoral College favors Democrats. Any Democratic candidate in the future isn’t going to make the same mistake Clinton did. They will consider each of these three to be battleground states. Second, contrary to the "media narrative," professional election handicappers never considered Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to be Democratic locks. While the Democrats had won them for six elections running, independent analysts typically considered them battleground states. The following chart summarizes the ratings that several nonpartisan handicappers gave to Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in the 2008, 2012, and 2016 elections, where accessible online. The handicappers are the Cook Political Report, Inside Elections, Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball, and this author (for Stateline.org in 2008, and for Governing magazine in 2012 and 2016). These analysts use first-hand reporting, past history, and polls to produce a subjective assessment of each state; they are not mathematical models based only on poll results. The ratings "lean Democratic" and "toss-up" mean that a state is considered competitive. "Likely Democratic" is not considered to be competitive, but is less safe than the most solid category, "safe Democratic." The ratings shown are for each group’s final handicapping before Election Day. State Cook 2008 Cook 2012 Cook 2016 I.E. 2016 Sabato 2012 Sabato 2016 Stateline 2008 Govering 2012 Governing 2016 Mich. Lean D Lean D Lean D Lean D Likely D Lean D Likely D Lean D Lean D Pa. Lean D Lean D Lean D Lean D Lean D Lean D Lean D Lean D Lean D Wis. Lean D Lean D Lean D Tossup Lean D Likely D Likely D Tossup Lean D In every analysis, Pennsylvania was considered a lean Democratic state — that is, the Democrats had an edge, but the contest was competitive and hardly in the bag. Wisconsin was considered a toss-up state (the most competitive category of all) or a lean Democratic state a clear majority of the time. And Michigan was considered a lean Democratic state a clear majority of the time. So while the popular perception was that, since the Democrats had won six straight elections in each of those states they were bound to win again, professional handicappers had a more nuanced view of the Democrats’ chances in those states. This caveat didn’t always get picked up in the larger discussion. In reality, a reasonable breakdown of "base" states for each party — particularly after the 2016 results have added another data point — would give Republicans at least 179 electoral votes that are pretty safe in today’s environment. They are: Alabama (9 electoral votes), Alaska (3), Arkansas (6), Georgia (16), Idaho (4), Indiana (11), Kansas (6), Kentucky (8), Louisiana (8), Mississippi (6), Missouri (10), Montana (3), Nebraska (4 of 5 electoral votes), North Dakota (3), Oklahoma (7), South Carolina (9), South Dakota (3), Tennessee (11), Texas (38), Utah (6), West Virginia (5) and Wyoming (3). For their part, the Democrats can rely pretty solidly on states worth 187 electoral votes: California (55), Connecticut (7), Delaware (3), District of Columbia (3), Hawaii (4), Illinois (20), Maryland (10), Massachusetts (11), New Jersey (14), New York (29), New Mexico (5), Oregon (7), Rhode Island (4), Vermont (3) and Washington state (12). This leaves the following states in the battleground category and assigned to neither party, with a combined 172 electoral votes: Arizona (11), Colorado (9), Florida (29), Iowa (6), Maine (4), Michigan (16), Minnesota (10), Nebraska (1 of 5 electoral votes), Nevada (6), New Hampshire (4), North Carolina (15), Ohio (18), Pennsylvania (20), Virginia (13), and Wisconsin (10). Is this breakdown subject to disagreement? Absolutely; this list has a relatively generous threshold for counting a state as a battleground. Reasonable people will disagree. But if it’s in the ballpark, then the breakdown is 187 electoral votes to start for the Democrats, 179 to start for the Republicans, and 172 up for grabs. It’s hard to call that "much more advantageous for the Democrats." Could Republicans actually be the ones who benefit? Contrary to Trump’s assertion, there’s evidence that the Republicans may actually benefit from the Electoral College system. In the five most-recent elections starting with 2000, the Republicans have twice lost the popular vote but won the presidency thanks to the Electoral College. In 2000, Democrat Al Gore defeated Republican George W. Bush by more than 547,000 votes nationally. In 2016, Clinton defeated Trump by an even larger margin — almost 2.9 million votes. Neither of the popular vote winners became president. "That certainly doesn’t suggest the Electoral College has a Democratic bias. In fact, it indicates the opposite," said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Two factors explain why today’s political environment, if anything, gives Republican states a leg up in the electoral college. First, smaller states get a disproportionately large impact in the Electoral College, because each state (plus the District of Columbia) gets a guaranteed two electoral votes before the rest of the electoral votes are allotted based on House seats (and thus, indirectly, on population). While there are some smaller blue states, the smallest states are disproportionately Republican-leaning. For instance, deep-red Wyoming gets one electoral vote for roughly 193,000 people, while deep-blue California gets one for every 719,000. An even bigger impact today may stem from the demographic makeup of the battleground states that shifted from Obama to Trump. Whites without college degrees — a key base of Trump’s support — "are overrepresented in swing states as compared to the country as a whole," Nate Silver of fivethirtyeight.com has written. "Sure, there were some exceptions, such as Virginia. But in the average swing state … whites without college degrees make up an average of 45.3 percent of the electorate, higher than their 41.6 percent share nationwide. That’s a big part of why Clinton won the popular vote while losing the Electoral College." Kondik said that as of today, "the Electoral College has a Trump lean because of his white, non-college coalition being an above-average share of the electorate in the key swing states of the Frost Belt. I say ‘Trump lean’ because that advantage might not be apparent for other Republicans with different coalitions in the future." Kondik’s point about changing coalitions making a difference brings up another issue: There doesn’t appear to be a permanent bias for either party, since electorates and demographics change over time. "I don't believe either party has had a long-lasting lean in the Electoral College," said David Wasserman, an analyst for the Cook Political Report. Our ruling Trump said that "the Electoral College is much more advantageous for Democrats." There may have been a popular misperception prior to the 2016 election that Democrats had a large number of solidly blue states that made it much easier for them to reach 270 than the Republicans. But professional handicappers never considered states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin to be solid for the Democrats, even in the 2008 and 2012 elections — and any notion that they continue to be solidly Democratic going forward was exploded by Trump’s wins in those states, making his use of the present tense dubious. There may even be a modest Republican lean to the Electoral College in this political moment, but we couldn’t find evidence of a permanent bias either way. We rate the statement False.

pomt-12187	"I’m one of two members of Congress out of 535 that takes no corporate cash, no political action committee money."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/jul/27/beto-orourke/beto-orourke-claims-near-uniqueness-not-taking-cor/	U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke, the punk rocker turned Democratic politician from El Paso, vowed to go against "politics as usual" in Washington while spreading the word about his quest to challenge Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas in the 2018 elections. O’Rourke, addressing Dallas supporters at a March 2017 campaign kickoff event, provided some detail as to what that means to him. Toward the end of his remarks, he asked for personal campaign donations, adding to cheers and applause: "I’m one of two members of Congress out of 535 that takes no corporate cash, no political action committee money. I don’t want you worried that when I’m taking a vote, making a decision, writing a bill, looking at an amendment, that I’m listening to anyone but you, the people that I want to serve and that I want to represent." Nobody seeking federal office can legally accept direct corporate or union donations, the Federal Election Commission notes. Yet political action committees--open to anyone’s contributions or founded and run by individuals working for corporations or affiliated with labor unions, membership organizations or trade associations--routinely fuel campaigns. In the 2016 elections, PACs gave $472.7 million to congressional candidates, according to the campaign finance tracking website OpenSecrets.org run by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. According to the site, PAC donations accounted for 35 percent of campaign funds for House Democrats, 39 percent for House Republicans, 15 percent for Senate Democrats and 27 percent for Senate Republicans. O’Rourke amends We inquired into the basis of O’Rourke’s claim to near-uniqueness for not taking PAC money. By email, O’Rourke replied that he’d revise what he says going forward. "What I should have said," O’Rourke said, "is that there are only two members of Congress who do not take PAC money and who also do not have a leadership PAC (which gives PAC contributions to other members), myself and Ro Khanna," a California Democrat. In a March 2017 press release, Khanna said he and O’Rourke had introduced legislation barring members of Congress and aspirants from accepting PAC donations. That release grouped Khanna and O’Rourke among six House members who didn’t accept PAC donations in the run-up to the 2016 elections. That count was based, the release said, on a December 2016 breakdown of candidate finance filings posted by Colorado-based CleanSlateNow, which focuses on changing how campaigns are funded. O’Rourke’s reply to us included a different count attributed to information on the OpenSecrets site. O’Rourke wrote: "There are four members of Congress (based on the Open Secrets website) who did not take PAC money in the last cycle (either to their Congressional campaign or to their leadership PAC if they had one) -- myself, Ro Khanna, John Sarbanes and Francis Rooney. Both Sarbanes and Rooney have PACs themselves that make PAC contributions to other candidates." Reviewing web posts and records Information on the OpenSecrets site indicates that into May 2017, Cruz had raised more than $1.9 million from PACs with the contributions accounting for 2 percent of more than $117 million he’d raised starting from his 2012 election to the Senate. The comparable entry for O’Rourke doesn’t show a zero for his PAC donations. It indicates instead $297,969 in PAC contributions to O’Rourke campaigns, amounting to 5 percent of O’Rourke’s $6.3 million in contributions since 2011, the year before his initial election to the House. We asked O’Rourke’s campaign about the tallied PAC contributions. A senior adviser, David Wysong, said by phone that O’Rourke accepted such donations through his first couple of House elections but stopped doing so before seeking his third term in 2016. By email, Wysong provided a document he described as a February 2015 form letter from O’Rourke to possible PAC contributors after which, Wysong said, O’Rourke accepted no PAC donations. From O’Rourke’s letter: "Starting with this election cycle, I plan to no longer accept PAC contributions. I've made this decision in an effort to focus more of my campaign efforts on bringing new, smaller and local donors into the campaign." Wysong also emailed an example of O'Rourke turning back such such aid--an October 2016 letter from O’Rourke’s campaign manager, Brianna Carmen, returning a donation from the Treasury Employees PAC. Wysong noted too that according to an FEC summary page about O’Rourke’s Senate finance report filed in July 2017, the candidate raised more than $2 million from April through June 2017, none of that from PACs. Banana peels With help from the center’s research director, Sarah Bryner, we confirmed from the OpenSecrets site and FEC filings that O’Rourke did not bank any PAC contributions as he sought re-election in 2016 or in the first months of his Senate bid. But this proved a slog to confirm because PAC names repeatedly appear in O’Rourke’s contribution reports. His July 2017 filing with the FEC separately shows $14,580 in contributions from other candidate committees. How unique? Our first focus was on gauging the accuracy of O’Rourke’s claim to being one of two members not accepting PAC aid. After identifying each current senator and House member on the U.S. Congress website, we checked the OpenSecrets site for PAC contributions to each member; the site provides a summary page for each member showing her or his contributions by cycle and over the years. Candidate contributions are further broken down by categories including individual contributions, PAC contributions and self-financing. Here’s the site’s entry for O’Rourke covering the 2016 election cycle: SOURCE: Summary for Beto O’Rourke, OpenSecrets.org (accessed May 10, 2017) From OpenSecrets posts, we identified five House members who did not get PAC contributions before the 2016 elections: O’Rourke; Khanna; Sarbanes, D-Md.; Jared Polis, D-Colo; Rooney, R-Fla--with Polis, Khanna and Rooney also fielding no PAC aid in their House careers. A conflict we didn't settle: CleanSlateNow previously identified Rep. Phil Roe, R-Tenn., as not getting PAC help in his 2016 re-election bid. In contrast, Roe’s OpenSecrets summary page for Roe indicates he got $6,000 in PAC donations before that election. Next, we eyeballed FEC-posted information, focusing on campaign filings by House members’ principal campaign committees for 2015-16. These records confirmed Khanna did not get PAC contributions that cycle. Otherwise, the records showed, Rooney received a $10,296 PAC contribution from Rooney Victory on Dec. 30, 2016; Sarbanes received donations from the VoteSANE PAC; and Polis logged contributions attributed to JStreetPAC, AmeriPAC and ActBlue. Similarly, our FEC search suggested that O’Rourke’s campaign in 2015-16 received $110,721 attributed to PACs (including ActBlue, JStreetPAC and the New Democrat Coalition PAC). Of this total, $74,400 in contributions were designated for the 2018 Democratic primary. So, candidates including O'Rourke took PAC aid? Not so, we found, in that the donations were almost uniformly made by individuals whose personal contribution were routed through supportive "conduit" PACs--a phrase we hadn’t heard before. It looked to us like the donation to Rooney came from a committee devoted to his candidacy. On the FEC site, the respective 2016 donations marked as "PAC" to Sarbanes, O’Rourke and Polis were each accompanied by a column describing the donations as a "conduit total," with a note stating the donation was "earmarked through this organization." We sought more information about ActBlue, the largest aggregator of individual contributions among the PACs linked to O’Rourke. The group says on its web site that it offers tools to help Democratic candidates but it’s not a traditional PAC that rounds up donations and obscures specific donors. ActBlue says it "acts as a conduit federally and in most states, which means we provide the infrastructure for campaigns and organizations to fundraise online, but we don’t fundraise on behalf of anyone. Unlike groups that spend large sums of cash from undisclosed sources, ActBlue offers grassroots donors a way to give fully disclosed donations to the candidates and causes they choose," the group says. CONDUIT PAC DONATIONS TO BETO O’ROURKE CAMPAIGN, 2016 CONDUIT PAC NAME INDIVIDUAL DONATIONS AGGREGATE TOTAL ActBlue 121 $77,294 ActBlue Technical Services 74 $14,070 JStreet PAC 21 $16,140 New Democrat Coalition 9 $4,501 SOURCE: Spreadsheet listing contributions to O’Rourke campaign, based on search of Federal Election Commission website, June 2016, PolitiFact Texas In July 2017, when we looked afresh at the OpenSecrets summary page for O’Rourke in 2017-18, it showed $29,160 in PAC contributions to O’Rourke’s Senate campaign. A few days later, the chart indicated $43,740 in PAC donations. Red flags? Negative, Bryner told us, saying the charts summarizing O’Rourke’s Senate contributions were erroneous and would be rectified. Significantly, Bryner also showed us how to query an FEC site that provides detailed files about all candidates, parties and other political committees. From the site, we fetched a July 23, 2017 commission list itemizing more than 45,000 PAC contributions to congressional candidates in the 2017-18 election cycle. That list showed no PAC contributions to O’Rourke. Experts concur We asked campaign finance experts to guide us to documentation distinguishing donations through conduit PACs from traditional PAC contributions. Judith Ingram, press officer at the FEC, showed us that in quarterly filings, ActBlue donations present an individual name as a line item below each listing of ActBlue as a donor, along with a text field that explains the individual donation is part of a conduit total. Ingram further confirmed that the JStreet PAC contributions reported by O’Rourke were made by individual donors employing the PAC as a conduit. Stephen Spaulding, chief of strategy at the nonpartisan watchdog group Common Cause, echoed Ingram’s comments--that groups such as ActBlue act as intermediaries by processing payments that "can be attributed to an actual donor, a human being." If a donation was a traditional PAC contribution, Spaulding explained, the listed contributor would be the PAC alone, and there wouldn’t be a specific individual’s name linked to it. Our ruling O’Rourke said: "I’m one of two members of Congress out of 535 that takes no corporate cash, no political action committee money." Unsaid: no candidate can take corporate cash; that’s illegal. Otherwise, we found, O’Rourke was one of at least five (not two) House incumbents to keep no PAC contributions in the run-up to the 2016 elections. He also hasn’t accepted PAC aid into 2017 though he drew on about $297,000 in PAC donations in his House bids of 2012 and 2014--actions not recapped in his Dallas call for contributions.

pomt-10533	"He (Obama) chairs the subcommittee on Europe. ... He's held not one substantive hearing to do oversight."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/27/hillary-clinton/dormant-while-obama-campaigns/	In one of the more pointed barbs in a Feb. 26, 2008, debate, Sen. Hillary Clinton charged that Sen. Barack Obama has been so busy running for president that he hasn't done much of anything as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on European Affairs. "I also have heard Senator Obama refer continually to Afghanistan, and he references being on the Foreign Relations Committee," Clinton said. "He chairs the Subcommittee on Europe. It has jurisdiction over NATO. NATO is critical to our mission in Afghanistan. He's held not one substantive hearing to do oversight, to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with NATO in Afghanistan." Obama responded: "Well, first of all, I became chairman of this committee at the beginning of this campaign, at the beginning of 2007. So it is true that we haven't had oversight hearings on Afghanistan." Although Obama acknowledges the point, we sought to confirm what the subcommittee has been doing. Congressional records show, and spokesmen for several subcommittee members confirm, the subcommittee has not held any policy hearings since Obama was appointed chair in early 2007. The subcommittee's jurisdiction includes "all matters, policies and problems concerning the continent of Europe, including the European member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." The chair sets the agenda for a subcommittee and Obama could have asked to hold a hearing on NATO and its role in Afghanistan. But Clinton's claim, while technically true, is unfair, said Andrew J. Fischer, a spokesman for Republican Sen. Richard Lugar. Lugar now serves as a minority member of the Foreign Relations Committee, but he was the chair, from 2003 to 2006, when Republicans controlled the Senate. He is the ranking Republican on the committee. Fischer, who is a minority staff member of the Foreign Relations Committee, said something as major as NATO's role in Afghanistan would typically be held before the full Foreign Relations Committee, rather than Obama's European subcommittee. In fact, the Foreign Relations Committee held a hearing on Afghanistan on Jan. 31, 2008, and NATO was a part of the discussion. Obama attended a Democratic debate in California that day. Clinton is not on the committee. The Clinton campaign put out a statement reiterating Clinton's comments to reinforce the theme that Obama is more about talk than action. "Given the opportunity to take the reins of leadership and shape two critical areas of U.S. foreign policy — Afghanistan and our alliances in Europe — Senator Obama has done next to nothing," the statement said. Obama's campaign did not respond to a request for comment. So let's look at Clinton's statement: "He chairs the subcommittee on Europe." Yep. "It has jurisdiction over NATO." Yep. "NATO is critical to our mission in Afghanistan. He's held not one substantive hearing to do oversight, to figure out what we can do to actually have a stronger presence with NATO in Afghanistan." Yep. Some may argue that the issue of NATO's role in Afghanistan typically and more appropriately would come before the full Foreign Relations Committee. But Clinton is right when she says Obama's subcommittee has been largely dormant while Obama has campaigned for president. We rate her comment True.

pomt-03379	Economic Development Commission Executive Director Keith Stokes "sent me a letter and he said the taxpayers will never be on the hook for these bonds" for 38 Studios.	true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jul/10/charlene-lima/rhode-island-rep-charlene-lima-said-economic-devel/	One of the hot-button issues of the 2013 General Assembly session was whether the state should repay the bonds sold to help finance 38 Studios, the now-bankrupt video-game company founded by former Boston Red Sox player Curt Schilling. One state representative who has argued against repayment is Charlene Lima, a Democrat from Cranston. She told the House on June 26 that, before the bonds were sold in November 2010, she had been promised by the executive director of the Rhode Island Economic Development Commission (RIEDC) that taxpayers would not have to foot the bill if the deal with 38 Studios didn't live up to its promise. "When I was complaining to the former director, Keith Stokes, he sent me a letter and he said the taxpayers will never be on the hook for these bonds, for this money," Lima said. "How was this properly vetted by these people if they were saying the taxpayers wouldn't be on the hook? And guess what. Today they ARE on the hook." We're not going to get into the merits of the state’s controversial decision to start paying the cost of the "moral obligation" bonds, but we wondered whether Stokes, who resigned after 38 Studios collapsed, really had made a specific pledge in writing. We called Lima and she quickly forwarded a copy of an Oct. 4, 2010 letter from Stokes in which he complained that Lima had offered an "inaccurate characterization of this investment and the RIEDC's degree of concern for Rhode Island taxpayers" in a news release she had authored. At the time, the bond sale had been approved and the bonds themselves were about to be sold. Stokes wrote, "In the unlikely event that the company is not able to meet its debt obligations," the state would have first crack at 38 Studio's assets. "These collateral assets, in addition to the debt repayment reserves, would be used to pay back the loan before the application of any public funds would be considered. "This ensures that under no circumstances would taxpayers be asked to repay $75 million." As Lima now notes, taxpayers are being asked to pay the money. (The $8.2-billion state budget, which the General Assembly passed and Governor Chafee signed, included $2.5 million for the first required taxpayer payment on the bonds. The total owed, with interest, is about $112.6 million.) To sum up, Lima said she received a letter in 2010 from then-RIEDC official Keith Stokes in which he insisted that Rhode Islanders would not be on the hook for the 38 Studios bonds. Lima earned a Pants on Fire last month for a comment she made about Rhode Island's failure to pass the Constitutional amendment authorizing the federal income tax. "If my pants were on fire," she said, "what is he? A towering inferno?" We don't have varying levels of conflagration. And in this case, we're simply judging the claim Lima made on the House floor. She has the evidence and we rate her statement True. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-14912	"Smog was invented in Los Angeles. It was. The name was invented. There was a fellow at Caltech and he came up with the idea and they called it smog."	half-true	/california/statements/2015/nov/03/jerry-brown/jerry-browns-hazy-claim-l-invents-smog/	LISTEN TO THIS STORY: Sunshine, Hollywood and freeway gridlock are all inextricably linked to Los Angeles, and so is smog. But was the City of Angels the first to create the noxious, eye-stinging, smudgy haze? Weren’t other industrial cities spewing thick black smoke and creating smog centuries ago? As it turns out, it depends on what you consider ‘smog.’ Gov. Jerry Brown, a warrior in the state’s air pollution battles, offered his California-centric version of smog’s history during a speech in Los Angeles in October. "Smog was invented in Los Angeles. It was," the governor told an audience at Griffith Observatory, with downtown Los Angeles cloaked in a brown haze several miles away, as shown in photos of the event. "The name was invented. There was a fellow at Caltech and he came up with the idea and they called it smog." The governor made the claim during a ceremony marking the signing of California’s landmark climate change bill, SB 350. It requires the state to get 50 percent of its electricity from air-friendly, renewable energy sources by 2030. We decided to fact-check Brown’s "smog was invented in Los Angeles" statement, to cut through what seemed like a dubious claim. Smog checking First, it’s clear L.A. has no ownership over the term smog. Brown sounds like he was having some fun with the "invented in Los Angeles" portion, from listening to him speak. Still, he was literally and blatantly wrong. News articles from as early as 1905 credit London doctor Harold Des Veaux with coining the word smog to describe natural fog contaminated by smoke, according to the Oxford English Dictionary. Great Britain’s affliction with foul air is referenced in Shakespeare’s Macbeth, written in 1606. But its soot-choked skies date as far back as the 12th century, when wood became scarce and residents turned to burning coal to keep warm, according to a history of the country’s air pollution by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It’s clear that other urban centers fought the effects of smog long before anyone imagined the metropolis we call Los Angeles. So, what kind of smoke was the governor blowing? "Jerry Brown -- brilliant as he is -- is confusing some facts," said Chip Jacobs, author of Smogtown: The Lung-Burning History of Pollution in Los Angeles. "We didn’t invent smog. Smog has been known to arise in many parts of the world well before he was born." We were headed for a False or Pants On Fire! Then, Jacobs added this comment: "Brown did have something right in his jumbled pronouncement -- the Caltech professor." Was there some truth behind the governor’s inartful statement? To get a better picture, we contacted the California Institute of Technology, based in Pasadena. School officials confirmed that Brown was referring to a 1940s-era Caltech professor named Arie Haagen-Smit. Haagen-Smit was the first to prove that automobile exhaust, when exposed to sunlight, creates what’s referred to as photochemical smog, or modern-day smog. It’s the same hazy brown gunk that’s polluted Los Angeles’ air for more than half a century. And it is different from the thick, black coal-driven smoke of London’s industrial era. "Professor Haagen-Smit did not invent (photochemical) smog, but he discovered the mechanism behind it. This has often been described as inventing smog," wrote Professor Richard Flagan, who teaches chemical engineering at Caltech, in an email. Another expert on air quality in Los Angeles said the governor’s claim is less murky than it appears. "The term smog was used earlier, but it meant something totally different. The definition totally morphed," said Sarah Elkind, a history professor at San Diego State University. "Los Angeles was the first city to deal with photo-chemical smog, which is part of the reason why I would judge Gov. Brown’s statement as mostly correct," added Elkind, author of the book How Local Politics Shape Federal Policy: Business, Power, and the Environment in Twentieth Century Los Angeles. A spokesman for the governor said in an email that Haagen-Smit "was the first one who coined the term for the modern air pollution produced by motor vehicles that we think of today." He also acknowledged that the term smog had been used to describe other types of pollution long before the 1940s. Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown said: "Smog was invented in Los Angeles. It was. The name was invented. There was a fellow at Caltech and he came up with the idea and they called it smog." A look at historical sources shows the term smog dates back more than a century. It was coined by a London doctor to refer to the smoky black air that fouled Great Britain during its industrial period. Brown’s statement ignores this history, viewing smog’s origin with only a California lens. But looking deeper, a gradual shift in the term’s meaning took place in the 1940s and 1950s as scientists, including Caltech professor Arie Haagen-Smit, studied the cause of Los Angeles’ persistent and foul brown haze. In his statement, the governor references Haagen-Smit, who is credited as the first to prove L.A.’s smog was caused by automobile exhaust, and who at least one current Caltech professor says is "often described as inventing smog." The governor’s statement, while fuzzy at first glance, is partially accurate. But it leaves out important details and takes information out of context. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-11087	Say a boy was 'caged' in a wire enclosure.	false	/texas/statements/2018/jun/15/tweets/tweeted-photo-inaccurately-indicates-boy-caged-fed/	A photo made us wonder if a small boy was placed in a cage with other youngsters as part of federal authorities cracking down on families trying to cross from Mexico into the U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced April 6, 2018 that Homeland Security would refer all illegal border crossings to the Justice Department for prosecution. Parents faced with criminal charges would hence go to detention centers, leaving their children unaccompanied and subject to being housed separately by the government. Toward the end of May 2018, The Washington Post reported that the government lately had custody of more than 10,700 children in shelters. That story didn’t mention any children getting held behind bars or inside cages. Also that month, President Donald Trump accurately said in a tweet that Democrats had just mistakenly depicted four-year-old photos of children behind bars as if the children were recently confined in such conditions. The photo that drew our attention appeared in a June 11, 2018, tweet showing the boy in a cage with what looks like three other children, his fingers gripping the enclosure’s wire frame, his face fretful. By the time we saw it, the debunkists at Snopes.com had concluded that the photo was "miscaptioned" because it was snapped at a protest staged in Texas, Snopes said. Tweet features photo The tweet showcasing the photo was posted by Jose Antonio Vargas, a journalist and filmmaker, and it doesn’t say where the photo was taken--whether at a protest or inside a facility. Vargas’s tweet otherwise says: "This is what happens when a government believes people are ‘illegal.’ Kids in cages." Vargas further said, in a tweet responding to his photo tweet, that he’d pulled the image from a friend’s Facebook page and hadn’t determined its precise origin. "I shared it," Vargas tweeted, because "when I was detained in McAllen in 2014, I was with boys who were locked up. It wasn’t okay then; it’s not okay now." Snopes.com specified that the photo was taken at a Texas protest June 10, 2018, though we saw that a string of protest photos posted on Facebook as noted by Snopes did not include the specific photo of the boy caged. Utah journalist identifies photographer Nothing we saw on Facebook from the organization credited by Snopes with posting the photo, the Texas chapter of the Brown Berets de Cemanahuac, presented the photo. But our online searches yielded a June 12, 2018, declaration directed at Vargas on Twitter. "This photo," the tweet at Vargas says, "was taken by Leroy Peña as part of a protest with the Brown Berets on June 10th, presumably in Texas." That nudge, which we spotted in a June 13, 2018, post about the photo on the Twitchy website, was attributed to Utah journalist-activist Kaz Weida. Yet by the time we saw Weida’s tweet, we noticed the web link Weida offered to the original photo didn’t lead to a live web page. We also didn’t spot the photo in scrolling through Peña’s public Facebook posts from what looked to us like the June 10, 2018, protest in Dallas that included children standing inside a four-sided open-topped enclosure erected outside a building. Next, we sought help from Weida, who suggested by email that we plug the link she’d tweeted into the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, which compiles and saves web posts. Following that guidance, we saw that the archive on June 12, 2018 saved what appeared to be a copy of Peña’s since-deleted 7:46 a.m. June 11, 2018 Facebook post featuring a message atop two versions of the photo showing the unhappy boy fenced in. Peña opened that Facebook post: "This was part of our protest yesterday, but this is actually going on right now, at this very moment, in child detention centers throughout this country." Dallas resident says he took photo Next, we connected with Peña, who responded to our Facebook message by giving an interview by phone in which he said he’d taken and posted the photos of the boy. At the moment he took the photo, Peña said, the boy had just followed his older brother through a gate into the enclosure set up for the protest outside City Hall in Dallas. Peña said that after getting behind the fencing, the boy spotted his mother outside the space--which explains his wrenched look. Peña, who said he lives in Dallas, said the boy’s mother quickly fetched him. "He was only in there 30 seconds," Peña said. We reached out about the tweeted photo to Homeland Security and the Administration for Children and Families within the Department of Health and Human Services, which has oversight of children transferred into government custody when adults are detained, and didn’t hear back. Our ruling A photo tweeted in opposition to federal authorities separating children from parents detained at the U.S.-Mexico border showed what looked like an unhappy boy in a cage. The photo wasn’t taken of a boy in custody, we found. Rather, the child was in an open-topped enclosure temporarily erected for a June 2018 Texas protest of the separation of children from parents.

pomt-10599	Says he was the only Republican candidate at a prior debate who said lower-income workers were being hurt by the economy.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/24/mike-huckabee/his-recollections-are-way-off/	At a debate in Boca Raton on Jan. 24, 2008, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee suggested that he was more in touch with how the economy was hurting working people than the other GOP candidates. He said he was the only candidate at a prior debate — the one on Oct. 9, 2007 — to point out that middle- and lower-income Americans were feeling economic pain. "A few months ago, when we were all in Dearborn, Mich., your network was the sponsor, with CNBC and MSNBC, and every one of us were asked, 'How's the economy doing?' " Huckabee said during the debate in Boca Raton. "Every one of my colleagues said, 'It's doing great.' And they gave all the numbers. ... The truth is I was the only guy on that stage who said, 'It may be doing great if you're at the top. It's different if you're on the bottom.' " We find Huckabee's recollections are way off the mark. He is correct that he indicated some sympathy for working people during the Oct. 9 debate. He plugged his proposal for a national sales tax to help the less fortunate regain their footing. "The people who handle the bags and make the beds at our hotels and serve the food, many of them are having to work two jobs, and that's barely paying the rent. And you know what else? They don't think that they can afford for their kids to go to college; they're pretty sure they're not going to be able to afford health insurance," he said. But he is wrong about the comments of his rivals. Huckabee might have been the biggest pessimist that night, but Ron Paul, John McCain, Mitt Romney and Fred Thompson each noted that Michigan residents were suffering as a result of their state's battered economy. Paul suggested it was because the nation was living beyond its means while McCain stated the United States was losing industrial jobs and not taking care of those who are left behind. Others qualified their statements, depicting Michigan as something of an anomaly in an otherwise strong economy. Romney said his birth state was "undergoing a one-state recession." And Thompson said while pockets of the economy were having difficulty, he had no reason to believe the country was heading for a recession. While Huckabee gets the award for tough-talking realist, he was hardly alone in acknowledging hard times. For that reason, we judge his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09422	St. Pete Beach's local version of Amendment 4 resulted in "seemingly endless lawsuits (that) decimated the city's legal budget and forced the city to raise the property tax rate."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/16/citizens-lower-taxes-and-stronger-economy/referendums-over-growth-issues-forced-city-raise-t/	In its campaign to discredit a ballot initiative giving voters more authority over land use, a statewide political action committee says voters only need to look at tiny St. Pete Beach and its problems since adopting a similar policy. Amendment 4, which will appear on ballots in November, essentially would give citizens veto power over major development proposals and land use changes. Opponents say a similar citizen initiative on growth and planning in St. Pete Beach has resulted in government run amok. "The seemingly endless lawsuits (as a result of the changes) decimated the city's legal budget and forced the city to raise the property tax rate. Now this idea threatens every town in Florida," a narrator states during a 2 minute, 15 second Web ad produced by a group called Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy. The group is an offshoot of Floridians for Smarter Growth, which is funded by developers, home builders, U.S. Sugar, and other business groups. We'll begin by noting that there is considerable debate between supporters and opponents of Amendment 4 if St. Pete Beach's experiences are truly analogous to the statewide ballot proposal. We plan to examine the analogy in a future Truth-O-Meter item. But because the advertisement is now on the Web, we'll still examine the individual claims. For this item, we need to go way back in time, back to the day that developers actually were interested in building condo high rises, back when developers wanted to cram as many units as they could onto a property, back when people actually could flip condos for substantial profits. Yep, way back to 2005. Back then, St. Pete Beach's five-member City Commission was considering changing the town's road map for growth, the Comprehensive Plan. The commission considered incentives to lure additional hotels that could increase the density of a development and change the allowed uses. The talk of change didn't sit well with many residents, who formed a group called Citizens for Responsible Growth. They collected enough petitions to get a proposal on the ballot that would require voter approval for height increases and other changes to land use plans. It got contentious. The city sued to stop the vote, and appeared to have won, but then lost on appeal. A developer also sued saying the petition process was costing him money. Voters narrowly approved most of the changes to the City Charter in November 2006, making St. Pete Beach the first town in Florida where residents directly controlled development decisions. Voters also elected two members of Citizens for Responsible Growth to the City Commission, giving them a majority. That prompted a pro-developer group -- Save Our Little Village -- to start its own petition drive to amend the city's comprehensive plan. The city's elected officials -- who had gone from being largely pro-development to anti-development -- tried to stop them. It got even more contentious. Save Our Little Village sued. The city's attorney resigned under pressure from the commission. Then, another election, another change of power and eventually, another referendum. This time, the pro-development side won. By December 2009, the city was involved in six different lawsuits prompted by the policy. Now there's another lawsuit and talk of another petition drive. Whew. Again, we're not ready to address the question of the similarity between the beach policy and Amendment 4. We're here to examine the policy's impact on the city's tax rate. And yes, in 2009, the city did increase its tax rate .107 mills (or $0.107 for every $1,000 of taxable value). The tax rate increase raised about $255,000 citywide, according to the city budget. During the Sept. 21, 2009, meeting where the tax rate increase was approved, there were two main reasons cited: Declining property values. City Manager Mike Bonfield said that property values have decreased more than 10 percent, and that as a result, the town would still be taking in $385,000 less in property tax collections -- even with a higher tax rate. The tax rate increase is needed "to fund a variety of services we provide in the city," Bonfield said. Legal fees. City Commissioner Jim Parent suggested the city might increase its legal budget from $200,000 to $250,000 to pay for potential litigation related to development issues and a possible lawsuit with Pinellas County over emergency medical services. The city already had budgeted an extra $100,000 for fiscal year 2010, according to budget documents. Parent said he was worried that after the city overshot its legal budget in 2008-2009 by about $100,000, that it would do so again. "Without additional budgeted funds, it could force us to reduce some other things," said Parent, who suggested the city's Fourth of July fireworks display could be impacted. But after discussion, and after consultation with City Attorney Michael Davis, commissioners decided to to leave the legal budget the same. After reviewing the discussion and interviewing Bonfield, we conclude that declining property values appeared to be the most significant factor, although the cost of legal fees was also discussed. "I guess you could attribute the extra legal fees as a reason why we needed to raise millage," Bonfield said. "But nobody said we need to raise this millage to put it in a fund for legal. I wouldn't say there's a direct correlation." In its ad, the group Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy says St. Pete Beach's local version of Amendment 4 resulted in "seemingly endless lawsuits (that) decimated the city's legal budget and forced the city to raise the property tax rate." Yes, there were lawsuits, but they weren't the only costs mentioned for the city legal department. Yes, the city slightly raised its rate in 2009 -- although the net result still was a decrease on most homeowners because of sharply falling property values. But the discussion at a town meeting indicates that the decision was motivated by several factors, most notably the decline in property values, as well as legal fees. So we find the claim Half True.

pomt-14696	"We have completely turned our economy around."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/jan/12/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-he-completely-turned-around-florid/	Gov. Rick Scott kicked off the 2016 legislative session by touting Florida’s growth under his guidance, which he said was an about-face from the direction the state was headed before he took office. "We have completely turned our economy around, and more families are thriving here today than five years ago," he said during his State of the State address in the Capitol on Jan. 12, 2016. The part about more thriving families (and there are more, with Florida last year officially becoming the country’s third-largest state) is too subjective to explore in detail. But what about the economy? We wanted to see if Scott was right about whether Florida’s economy had reversed direction from five years ago. Our look at the data shows the state has turned several economic corners, but the picture isn't so bright when you look at wages. Florida’s numbers In January 2011, Scott inherited an economy ravaged by the worst recession in decades, a housing market in the tank and a double-digit unemployment rate. There were signs the state was already climbing out of the doldrums before Scott took office (the national recession officially ended in mid 2009), but Florida’s recovery was good enough to win Scott a second term. When we asked Scott’s office for evidence, they sent us some selected statistics to support his statement, including reductions in state debt and environmental permitting times. We decided to compare some key indicators that economists said would best illustrate how the economy had changed in order to see where Florida is now. We compared from 2010, the year before Scott’s first term started, to the most recent numbers available. We learned the state has performed better under certain measures than others. Unemployment rate: In November 2015, the unemployment rate in Florida was 5 percent, the same as the national rate. That’s the lowest Florida’s rate has been since January 2008. November’s rate is still a preliminary figure, but it’s much lower than the 10.7 percent it was in December 2011. Payroll employment per month: It’s true the state has added jobs. The latest figures show that between December 2010 and November 2015, Florida added 1,011,800 private-sector jobs. But when you subtract the 27,300 government jobs that have been lost in that same span, the net change is 984,500 new jobs. Per capita personal income: This statistic refers to how much income was earned per person in the state. The U.S. Commerce Department Bureau of Economic Analysis, which measures income starting midyear, says that in 2009-10, income in Florida grew 2.2 percent. But then that growth slowed down each year. In the last fiscal year data available, 2012-13, that figure dropped by -0.1 percent. Per capita real GDP: This measures all of the inflation-adjusted economic activity per person in Florida. In 2009-10, per capita real GDP dropped by 1 percent. In 2013-14, the latest year available, it was growing by 1.2 percent. That amounts to $38,664 per person in 2014, about $300 more than it was in 2010. Last year Florida’s per capita real GDP lagged the national average by more than $10,000. Industrial production: The BLS maintains a national index that measures the value of manufacturing output, compared to a "base" rate of 100, but Moody’s Analytics maintains proprietary estimates for each state. In December 2010, this rate was 96.56 for Florida, and by November 2015 was 105.93, moving ahead but slightly behind the national average. The big takeaway: Florida’s employment picture has improved, but many of the newly created jobs aren’t necessarily paying very well. Can Scott take credit? There are other measures, of course, and they all can look at the picture from different angles. Florida’s poverty rate in 2010 was 16 percent, for example, but after dropping for two years, it was up to 16.7 percent in 2014, almost two points above the national average. The state’s median household income has been dropping over the years, and currently lags the national average by about $6,000. Economists told us that Florida is mirroring the United States in economic terms — the country is doing better, so Florida is doing better. The economy here also has a focus on service and hospitality jobs, which often are minimum wage and part time, so the quality of Florida’s figures can (and often do) lag behind national averages. On top of that, Scott’s claim doesn’t reflect that Florida still has a way to go to top the state’s previous historical growth. For example, the unemployment rate was as low as 3.1 percent in mid 2006. "Floridians are just recovering back to where they were before," said Tara Sinclair, chief economist at Indeed and economics professor at George Washington University. "I don’t think that’s the American Dream, to struggle to get back to how things were." Economists also noted there are issues with how to compare these indicators because of how they are calculated or the time frames they encompass. Furthermore, Scott is taking credit for things that are mostly out of his control. Experts reminded us states are often affected by factors like shifting demographics, national trends and the global economy more than the policies of any one official or the Legislature. "Like the quarterback of a football team, he gets too much credit when the economy does well and too much blame when the economy does poorly," Moody’s economist Chris Lafakis said. "Scott has benefitted from being governor at an advantageous time of the business cycle." Our ruling Scott said, "We have completely turned our economy around." Economic indicators show that some factors, like job growth and unemployment, have reversed losses from previous years. But while there is more economic activity than before, incomes are down and remain below national averages. Experts agree Scott and lawmakers can’t take much credit for changes either way.

pomt-15351	"In a majority of states, you can now marry freely, but can still be fired for who you love."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/09/mark-pocan/mark-pocan-says-most-states-dont-have-workplace-pr/	After the U.S. Supreme Court announced its decision making same-sex marriage the law of the land, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan called for additional rights to be recognized for gay Americans. Pocan, a Democrat from Madison, has long been an advocate of government allowing same-sex marriage. Years after Pocan married his partner in Canada, he made headlines in 2013 when his husband was issued an ID given only to spouses of members of Congress. Pocan issued a statement on June 26, 2015 praising the high court’s landmark ruling, but also to argue the fight for gay rights is not over. "Today, the Supreme Court has reaffirmed what a majority of Americans already know: all couples should have the right to marry, regardless of who they love. "As we celebrate this victory, we must also recognize that we still have work to do to ensure all Americans are treated fairly under the law, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity." The next step in the gay rights movement: "In a majority of states you can now marry freely," Pocan said, "but can still be fired because of who you love." The first part of Pocan's claim refers back to the Supreme Court ruling. And after the ruling, Pocan is obviously on point -- not only is same sex marriage permitted in a majority of states, it is allowed everywhere. But what about the second half of the claim, which focuses on workplace discrimination. Can someone be legally terminated in most states because of their sexual orientation? Let’s take a look. The legal landscape The Civil Rights Act of 1964 protects workers from discrimination at the federal level. Title VII of the law prohibits employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin. Title VII's definitions of "because of sex" and "on the basis of sex" do not mention sexual orientation. So, there is no federal law that explicitly forbids employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. Legislation has been proposed and failed in nearly every Congress since 1974 that would prohibit employment discrimination because of sexual orientation or gender identity. In the 1989 Supreme Court case Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins, the court ruled sex stereotyping is a form of discrimination protected against under Title VII. Some extend this ruling to protect gay workers who do not conform to gender norms. Gwendolyn Leachman, an assistant professor at the University of Wisconsin Law School, said evidence showing the employee was discriminated against for failure to conform to gender stereotypes is necessary. "If the employer can show that the harassment or other adverse action was motivated ‘purely’ by sexual orientation, then the employee is out of luck," Leachman said. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, the agency tasked with enforcing the Title VII, has interpreted Title VII protections to include sexual orientation. Some courts follow the EEOC interpretation. In Terveer v. Billington, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia ruled in March 2014 that the discrimination based on someone's status as homosexual was based on gender stereotypes and was covered under Title VII. But not all courts agree. In fact, Terveer v. Billington is an outlier. And the Supreme Court has yet to hear a case on this matter. For a worker to have legal protection from discrimination based on sexual orientation, the worker would need to live in a state -- or a city -- that prohibits it. With protections in place, a worker could file a wrongful termination lawsuit on that basis. Nearly every state has adopted an anti-discrimination law similar to the federal Civil Rights Act. Indeed, many of the state laws provide additional protection for sexual orientation. In a June 2014 fact check of another statement made by Pocan, we learned Wisconsin was the first state to enact a law banning discrimination because of sexual orientation. So how many states followed suit? Pocan's team sent a map from the Human Rights Campaign, an LGBT civil rights advocacy group, to support his claim. The map showed that 22 states have explicit laws protecting workers from discrimination based on sexual orientation. That means 28 states -- a majority -- do not have explicit laws protecting workers from discrimination based on sexual orientation. Our rating Pocan said, "in a majority of states you can now marry freely, but can still be fired for who you love." Federal law does not explicitly protect against this discrimination, though the agency tasked with enforcing the law has interpreted federal protections to include sexual orientation. Meanwhile, 28 out of 50 states do not have such laws. We rate Pocan’s claim Mostly True.	None	Mark Pocan	None	None	None	2015-07-09T10:45:00	2015-06-26	['None']
pomt-12585	House Bill 991 "could lead to the opening of as many as 2,000 new liquor stores."	true	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/apr/07/wendell-young/wait-there-could-be-how-many-new-liquor-stores-pa/	Could a bill moving through the statehouse bring 2,000 new liquor stores to Pennsylvania? United Food and Commercial Workers Local 1776 President Wendell Young estimated that figure in an op-ed for PennLive, opposing two pieces of proposed legislation that would expand liquor sales outside of state stores. He noted that a bill sponsored by State Rep. Adam Harris, a Republican from Juniata County, might yield that increase. "The Harris bill (HB991) would allow some existing retailers to operate a ‘franchise store,’ which is a liquor store operating inside of an existing retail shop," Young wrote last week. "Just think of a mini liquor store next to the potato chips at your corner grocery store. The bill could lead to the opening of as many as 2,000 new liquor stores." Last summer, the state legislature passed a bill that made it legal to buy wine in (select) grocery stores for the first time since Prohibition. Pro-privatization advocates argue that loosening the Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board’s grip on sales could lead to an economic boon, while providing more options for consumers, particularly rural ones. Advocates against expanding private retail, like Young, contend that a cash-strapped state can’t afford the loss in revenue. "Pennsylvania has a very successful wine and spirits system... that benefits all taxpayers whether they drink or not," said Young. "You don’t have to be a genius to figure it out, if you dilute Pennsylvania’s market, you’re going to cannibalize sales." The Liquor Control Board currently administers 608 state stores. Harris’ bill, which dropped "franchise store" for "retail store" in its current language, would indeed allow for a dramatic spike. Per the bill itself, "Licenses may be issued at a ratio of one per every 6,000 residents within a county, with a minimum of 15 licenses granted to a county." But the bill would place some limits within those margins: Stores wouldn’t be licensed in dry towns or "within 1,200 yards of a Pennsylvania Liquor Store or retail store in an urbanized area, or within two miles of a Pennsylvania Liquor Store or retail store in a rural area." The bill, which passed in committee on Monday, would require that licensed retailers purchase their stock through the Liquor Control Board. The Census estimated the state’s population to be 12,784,227 residents for 2016. Divided by 6,000, that would make way for roughly 2,130 stores before distance stipulations came into play. But since the bill notes that licenses would be granted by county, the union went further in its analysis. Chris Naylor, legislative and political director for UFCW Local 1776, provided this outline of how they devised their estimate: "Philadelphia at 1,548,647 people would be divided by 6,000, which would result in 258 potential licenses in the city of Philadelphia alone. For the surrounding counties, Montgomery would be at approx 134 potential licenses, Bucks at 104 licenses, Delco at 93 licenses and Chester at 84 licenses. Do this math over every county in the state, and you will have over 2,000 potential licenses as a result of HB 991. You also have to take into account that the legislation calls for a minimum of 15 licenses granted to a county; so the counties that fall below 90,000 residents (6,000 residents multiplied by the minimum of 15 retail outlets per county) would also appear to have 15 potential licenses per county. There are over 30 counties in the state that fall into this category, also increasing the potential number of outlets." (Note: Naylor’s Census population figures appear to be based on 2013 estimates. Philly, Montco and Chesco would each have a couple more stores, based on 2016 numbers.) Harris doesn’t dispute Young’s figure, but doesn’t believe that this many issued licenses would be likely. He’s also open to amendments. "This is sort of a starting point," he told PolitiFact Pennsylvania. "I’ve heard from members in Philadelphia, where there is stop-and-go problem. I’d be willing to pull that number back if that makes people more comfortable." He emphasized that the legislation is seeking to provide better options for rural shoppers. "As you venture out into the country, you either don’t have a store close, or don’t have [large] store," he said. "We want to fill those voids in rural counties. I’m from Juanita— We have one liquor store." The population of Juniata County is roughly 25,000. "We might lower the maximum per county (regardless of population) to something lower than 15. I am open to discussing this possibility with my colleagues and the Governor," Harris hinted later in an email. "The ‘fencing’ language (how far a retail outlet has to be from a current LCB store) could be amended to provide for a greater buffer area… If we expand the fencing this could impact how many retail licenses ultimately come into existence." Our ruling Wendell Young, president of Local 1776, wrote in an op-ed that HB 991 "could lead to the opening of as many as 2,000 new liquor stores." Even though the bill sponsor doesn’t think the legislation would create that many new locations, Young’s estimate was indisputably fair here. We rate the claim True.

pomt-11535	"There’s a large number of schools in Texas that don’t even offer sex education."	half-true	/texas/statements/2018/feb/14/andrew-white/andrew-white-texas-schools-not-offer-sex-education/	Houston businessman Andrew White, a Democratic aspirant for governor, said that when he’s elected, he’ll step up sex education in schools. White, speaking in January 2018 to David Martin Davies of Texas Public Radio, declared: "There is a large number of schools in Texas that don’t even offer sex education. Now that, to me, it’s bizarre. So we have to make these investments. If you really are serious about reducing the demand for abortion, there are some really simple ways to do that -- sex education and access to contraceptives." We wondered if a large number of Texas schools don’t offer sex education. After emailing White's campaign to ask how he reached his conclusion, we noticed that the Austin-based Texas Freedom Network, which describes itself as the state’s watchdog for monitoring far-right issues, estimated in 2017 that 25.1 percent of the state’s school districts in 2015-16 didn’t teach sex education in their secondary schools--when just 2 percent weren’t doing so in 2007-08, the group previously found. Broadly, the group’s February 2017 report states that in 2015-16, about eight in 10 Texas school districts taught abstinence alone "or nothing at all when it comes to sex education." Abstinence-plus programs, including information on contraceptives, showed up in nearly 17 percent of districts. The results were reached starting from a survey sent to 138 of 976 Texas school districts that had high schools that weren’t also charter school districts--plus the state’s 10 highest-enrollment districts. Districts were "representative of the diversity in geography, enrollment, racial demographics and district type (rural, urban or non-metropolitan/smaller cities) in Texas public schools," the report says. The report concedes that it didn’t pin down precisely what’s taught to students in each district. Rather, the group asked which textbooks, third-party programs or curricula and/or speakers that districts had obtained and/or used to teach sex education in middle and high schools. Also, the report says, "we asked specifically for materials districts had obtained from crisis pregnancy centers or other alternative-to-abortion organizations, any materials that cover sexual orientation, gender identity/expression or abortion, and copies of class schedules and district policies." To our inquiry, a network spokesman, Dan Quinn, listed the 35 sampled districts found not to be teaching sex education--nearly all of them rural. Health class in high schools Quinn also told us by email: "A key factor in the increase in the percentage of school districts not offering sex education appears to be the Legislature’s decision in 2009 to drop health class as a high school graduation requirement." The 2009 Legislature and then-Gov. Rick Perry advanced House Bill 3 into law. It directed the State Board of Education to spell out the classes students would have to pass to fulfill different kinds of graduation plans. Yet the law barred the board from specifying electives, such as health, as classes that had to be taken to graduate. Quinn wrote: "Health class is often where students get sex ed. Many school districts either continue to offer health as an elective or make it a local graduation requirement, but a substantial number of school districts appear to have dropped health classes since 2009." The network’s 2017 report states: "We found that districts with no health class were more than four times more likely to offer no sex education at all (as compared with the overall distribution of districts). Conversely, school districts with health classes were more likely to offer either abstinence-plus or abstinence-only sex education. This finding suggests that the decision to remove health education as a state graduation requirement has contributed to the rise in the percentage of districts that teach students nothing at all about human sexuality in high school," the report says. Health classes don’t necessarily cover sex education We further learned that just because a district offers a health class doesn’t mean its students take the class or that the class covers more than the state-required emphasis on abstinence alone as the best practice. The state’s curriculum guidelines for the one-semester health class call for students to analyze the "effectiveness and ineffectiveness of barrier protection and other contraceptive methods." They otherwise say each student is expected to analyze the importance of abstinence from sex as the only method that’s 100 percent effective in preventing pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases. But Lauren Callahan, a spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency, cautioned against presuming the guidelines show what’s being taught because, she noted, that’s up to individual districts. State law requires each district board of trustees to establish a local school health advisory council to "assist the district in ensuring that local community values are reflected in the district's health education instruction." Also, the law says each board shall choose course materials related to sex education with the council’s advice. Notably too, not all students lately take health classes. Callahan pointed us to annual school health surveys undertaken by the agency. Per the latest results, nearly 52 percent of districts and charter schools in 2015-16 indicated they weren’t requiring all high school students to take "health education" to graduate--with 48 percent replying that they did require every student to take a class in health education. Study: Abstinence-plus instruction isn’t widespread The study estimated that 58 percent of districts offered abstinence-only sex education. In contrast, the study says, nearly 17 percent of districts were taking an abstinence-plus approach by having medically accurate information on condoms and other forms of contraception. Quinn noted that in 2007-08, the network previously found, about 4 percent of districts took an abstinence-plus approach. Quinn, asked to identify the districts in its 2017 sample that were found to have abstinence-plus teaching materials, listed 30 districts, including eight of the state’s 10 highest-enrollment districts--such as the Houston, Dallas, Fort Worth and Austin districts. But, Quinn wrote, determining "how those ab-plus materials are used in classrooms — whether teachers use them as suggested, skip portions, or whatever — was beyond the scope of this project." Similarly, David C. Wiley, a Texas State University education professor who worked on the study, told us by phone: "There’s no guarantee that teachers are actually teaching that information." Upshot: "Texas kids don’t get much information about contraception," Wiley said. As we completed this research, Desi Canela of White's campaign said by email that White reached his conclusion about schools not offering sex education based on the network's 2017 study. Our ruling White said a "large number" of Texas schools don’t offer sex education. In fact, most districts offered sex education in high school in 2015-16, according to a statewide analysis, though nearly 60 percent were teaching abstinence alone. The study estimated that 25 percent of districts didn't offer sex education. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-14244	"Hedge fund managers and others in private equity pay much lower (tax) rates on their income than do truck drivers and teachers and nurses."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/apr/13/tammy-baldwin/testing-tammy-baldwin-claim-taxes-hedge-fund-manag/	In a recent interview on WISN’s UpFront with Mike Gousha, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin talked about how the burden of college debt requires bipartisan action from Congress. "But we’re not going to wait around to start talking about the solutions," she said. Baldwin then cited legislation she has introduced to close the so-called "carried interest" loophole, which allows the primary source of income for hedge fund managers to be taxed differently than others earning a similar amount. "Hedge fund managers and others in private equity pay much lower (tax) rates on their income than do truck drivers and teachers and nurses," Baldwin said in the Feb. 14, 2016 interview. "Outrageous." Last May, PolitiFact National checked a similar claim from Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton: Hedge fund managers "pay less in taxes than nurses and truck drivers." The claim was rated False, since the raw amount paid in taxes by hedge fund managers far exceeds that paid by nurses and truck drivers. Similarly, the tax rates paid would typically be higher as well. Baldwin’s claim is very similar to the one from Clinton. Does Baldwin fare any better? Carried interest The carried interest provision Baldwin referred to concerns the compensation of investment managers. Hedge fund managers oversee money from investors and are compensated with a cut of the profits. Their paycheck is typically determined according to a "two and twenty" formula -- that is, a 2 percent fee for all assets invested and 20 percent of profits earned. The fee on profits, called carried interest, serves as investment manager’s main source of income. The 20 percent cut is taxed as capital gains, rather than normal earnings, so those funds are subject to a lower rate -- 20 percent with surtaxes of 3.8 and 1.2 percent. Carried interest also isn’t subject to payroll taxes. Meanwhile, the income of the wealthiest Americans is taxed at the highest rate -- nearly 40 percent. The issue: Many hedge fund managers would otherwise fall into this group. Baldwin’s legislation, termed the Carried Interest Fairness Act of 2015, would tax these earnings at ordinary income tax rates. For all the talk, carried interest represents a very small portion of all employee compensation in the United States. Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that ending the tax break would raise $1.32 billion this year and $15.64 billion over 10 years. This is just a drop in the bucket for the federal government, which collected about $1.5 trillion in income taxes in 2015. Baldwin’s claim We have checked a Baldwin claim about the tax break before. In September 2015, she said "the pope and Donald Trump and Tammy Baldwin all agree" on eliminating the "carried-interest" tax break. We rated the claim Half True. Trump, the Republican presidential front runner, does agree with Baldwin, but we could find no evidence of Pope Francis making a statement on ending the tax break. When we asked for backup for the claim that hedge fund managers pay "much lower" income tax rates than "truck drivers and teachers and nurses," Baldwin’s staff simply pointed to the "carried interest" tax break. So that’s our starting point. As noted, the hedge fund manager’s cut of profits is taxed at around 25 percent when surtaxes are included. The average truck driver, meanwhile, would fall into the 15 percent tax bracket, while a well-compensated one may be taxed at 25 percent. Based on IRS salary figures, most nurses and teachers would be taxed at 25 percent of their income. However, thanks to various exemptions, deductions and credits, nearly all people pay a lower average tax than their tax bracket suggests. So what’s the average tax rate for truck drivers, teachers and nurses? According to 2015 figures from the Joint Committee on Taxation, an individual making between $75,000 and $100,000 -- which would typically be a high-end salary for the cited occupations -- would pay an average tax rate of 6 percent. To be sure, a lot of variation exists in the taxes paid, so it is possible that some truck drivers (or teachers or nurses) may pay a higher average tax rate than a hedge fund manager. But Baldwin was speaking in a broad sense, and our analysis looks at it that way, too. "The truck driver will pay a lower percentage of income than will the hedge fund manager," said Roberton Williams of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. "But the hedge fund manager pays a lot less tax than he or she would if the carried interest were considered income rather than capital gains." Indeed, the same Joint Committee on Taxation analysis found the highest earners -- people who make more than $500,000 a year and are taxed at nearly 40 percent on their last dollar earned -- typically face an average tax rate of 27.4 percent Of course, the hedge fund managers pay less, as previously noted, based on the nature of their income. Our rating Baldwin said "hedge fund managers and others in private equity pay much lower (tax) rates on their income than do truck drivers and teachers and nurses." Based on the carried interest provisions, there could be some individual scenarios in which a truck driver would pay a larger portion of income than a hedge fund manager. But when looking at average tax rates -- the amount typically paid after deductions and exemptions -- a typical truck driver, teacher or nurse would pay a far smaller percentage of their income in taxes.

pomt-10728	"Well, you know, the Teamsters wanted to drill in Alaska. I voted against drilling in Alaska. So it's not like I'm a slam dunk on every issue."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/15/dennis-kucinich/not-quite-lockstep-with-unions/	During the Democratic debate in Las Vegas on Nov. 15, 2007, CNN host Wolf Blitzer tried to probe the limits of Rep. Dennis Kucinich's longstanding support of union positions. Blitzer said: "I take it that ... there's nothing — there's no issues, no major issues you disagree with America's unions." Kucinich, a House member from Ohio, responded with this statement, which we find to be True. In 2001, Teamsters officials lobbied Capitol Hill in favor of oil exploration in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. "It's time for America to have what it has lacked for too long: a responsible, realistic energy plan that meets our needs and protects our future," Jerry Hood, a Teamsters leader from Alaska, said at a news conference on July 31, 2001. One day later, Kucinich voted against drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge when he voted "yes" for an amendment that would have removed proexploration provisions from an energy bill. He cites threats to the environment and human rights in his opposition to exploration. Kucinich calls himself "the candidate of workers ... the one candidate in the race who comes right from the working class and can address those needs directly because I remember where I came from." On this issue, he's correct in saying he wasn't with the unions.	None	Dennis Kucinich	None	None	None	2007-11-15T00:00:00	2007-11-15	['Alaska', 'International_Brotherhood_of_Teamsters']

pomt-14526	"The richest 80 people in the world own more wealth than the bottom half of the global population."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/feb/17/bernie-sanders/pretty-much-money-sanders-says-80-richest-own-more/	Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders’ campaign against economic inequality went global in a video for the One Campaign, a global AIDS and poverty advocacy group,. "The issue of wealth and income inequality is the great moral issue of our time," Sanders said. "It is the great economic issue of our time and the great political issue of our time. Truthfully, there is something profoundly wrong when the richest 80 people in the world own more wealth than the bottom half of the global population, 3.5 billion people." That’s an astounding fact, if true, that 80 people own as much wealth as 3.5 billion. We decided to see if Sanders was right. He largely is. Sanders relied on a 2014 analysis from Oxfam, which came up with the comparison from two different reports. The first, from Credit Suisse, estimated the distribution of household wealth worldwide. The second was Forbes’ list of billionaires. We'll walk you through the calculations and a couple of caveats. The Credit Suisse report Analysts hired by Credit Suisse estimated total personal wealth at $263 trillion. From there, analysts estimated that the bottom half of the world’s population (approximately 3.5 billion people) owned less than 1 percent of all wealth. To be precise, (and you can find this on page 110 of the full Credit Suisse databook) the bottom half of the world’s population own .72 percent of world household wealth, which comes out to about $1.7 trillion. James Davies, one of the report’s lead authors and an economist at the University of Western Ontario, said no one else has done this exact study. That’s true, but the Allianz Group, another global financial corporation, and the Boston Consulting Group, a financial and management consulting firm, have estimates of total household financial wealth that are pretty close to what Credit Suisse reported. Brent Beardsley, managing director at the Boston Consulting Group, told us both his firm and Credit Suisse used much of the same data, but Credit Suisse included more countries. Beardsley said that difference wouldn’t be significant. Raul Santaeulalia-Llopis, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis, said the Credit Suisse may have underestimated wealth in low-income countries. But even if true, it wouldn’t throw off Sanders’ comparison much. Santaeulalia-Llopis said Sanders and Oxfam might need to add a few more billionaires to their tally to make it more accurate. The strongest criticism of the Credit Suisse report is that it includes a significant number of people in wealthy countries who are not poor but have large debts. That produces misleading results, Beardsley said. "(They) are not actually living in poverty but simply have very low or even negative net worth due to amassment of debt to finance housing, education and consumption beyond current income," Beardsley said. "In this case, wealth -- or rather net worth -- is not an adequate measure of what is commonly understood as poverty." However, this doesn’t challenge the underlying numbers. Instead, it raises a question about interpreting them. Economist Branko Milanovic, formerly with the World Bank and now at City University of New York Graduate Center, countered in a blog post that sometimes, a negative net worth is a very big deal. "Even for those people in the rich world who are ‘anomalously’ placed among the wealth-poor and who may lead nice lives despite owning nothing, a shock in the form of a medical emergency -- unless there is public health care -- or loss of job may have catastrophic consequences," Milanovic wrote. "There is just no wealth to fall back on to tide you over the bad times." Forbes billionaire estimates The second half of the comparison is relatively straightforward. Oxfam used Forbes' list of billionaires and counted how many people it would take to reach $1.7 trillion -- the figure representing the wealth of the bottom half of the global population. Forbes' calculations aren't perfect, but they are the best estimate publicly available. Forbes tracks changes in real time, but the base comparisons depend on estimates generated by members of the Forbes team. Sometimes the billionaires themselves say the numbers are off because far from all the necessary information is public knowledge. Then there are fluctuations due to changing currency exchange rates and the ups and downs of the stock market. The list can’t deliver pinpoint accuracy, but it does represent a good faith effort to assess the net worth of the world’s wealthiest people. Like the wealth calculations in the Credit Suisse report, it should be seen as a reasonable estimate. One final note The divide between the super rich and the bottom of the global population appears to be getting worse. Credit Suisse, Forbes and Oxfam update their numbers at least every year and for 2015, Oxfam said just 62 billionaires own as much as half the world’s people combined. The Sanders campaign, however, told us the video was shot before the latest Oxfam report. So we won't hold it against Sanders in our rating. Our ruling Sanders said that 80 people own as much as half the world’s population. The statement was in line with the latest Oxfam report available at the time Sanders spoke. The Oxfam analysis was based on a report from Credit Suisse and the Forbes list of billionaires. The exact number of billionaires might well be different from the 80 that Sanders said, or the 62 that Oxfam said more recently. But out of world population of 7 billion, it makes little difference if the tally were 160. It still represents a tiny sliver of a percentage of the people in the world. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2016-02-17T16:29:38	2016-02-07	['None']

pomt-02840	Says Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has "blocked the Senate over 400 times."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/nov/20/alison-lundergan-grimes/alison-lundergan-grimes-says-mitch-mcconnell-block/	Is Mitch McConnell the "guardian of gridlock"? One of the marquee races in the 2014 midterm elections is McConnell’s bid to win a sixth term representing Kentucky. And one of the issues likely to get significant attention in the campaign is whether McConnell, as the Senate’s minority leader, has unduly obstructed the Senate majority’s work. The allegation of obstructionism is at the center of an ad released in October by his Democratic challenger, Alison Lundergan Grimes. The ad shows a house slowly catching fire, as the narrator says, "He calls himself a proud guardian of gridlock. He’s blocked the Senate over 400 times, then voted to shut down the government, hurting Kentucky’s economy. Mitch McConnell can’t light the house on fire, then claim credit for putting it out, especially while it’s still burning." As evidence, the Grimes campaign cited a report by WFPL, the Louisville NPR affiliate, in July 2013. The radio report noted that "since 2007, Senate statistics show McConnell has used the filibuster 413 times as minority leader. That is almost twice as much as when Democrats held the minority from 1995 to 2001." The rules behind filibusters can get pretty wonky, but Grimes’ claim has sparked intense discussion concerning some highly technical rules of Senate debate. Our fact-checking colleagues at FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker have looked into the claim, with FactCheck.org concluding that "Grimes uses inflated figures," and the Fact Checker giving the claim three Pinocchios out of a possible four. Meanwhile, political scientists pushed back, saying Grimes’ claim had merit. We decided to take a fresh look at the evidence. The finer points of Senate procedure Under the Senate’s rules, action on legislation can proceed one of two ways. The smoother path, if it can be achieved, is through unanimous consent of all senators on the terms of a debate. But, as the term "unanimous" indicates, this standard means that any senator who wishes to can block consent. The alternative is to file a "cloture motion." If it passes, then debate on the underlying legislation can proceed. If it fails, Senate action remains stalled. A cloture motion must secure a supermajority -- 60 votes. Because rounding up 60 votes is no easy task, the Senate’s minority party -- and indeed any individual senator in either party -- can wield significant influence by slowing or stopping action, simply by objecting, either publicly or behind the scenes. The claim in Grimes’ ad, that McConnell blocked the Senate 400 times, counts almost every time a cloture motion was filed between 2007 and 2013. But skeptics have pointed out that, in some of those cases, cloture was approved, meaning that the blockage was ultimately overcome. In other cases, cloture requests were withdrawn, meaning the parties managed to work out an agreement to proceed. And in some cases, it was McConnell who filed cloture to end a Democratic blockage, a move that shouldn’t be considered part of McConnell’s efforts to block action. After weeding out these instances, both Factcheck.org and the Fact Checker settled on 120 cases in which the chamber voted on cloture but failed to approve it. That’s a lot less than 400. McConnell’s office agrees with this interpretation. "As a matter of a fact check, your job is simple," McConnell spokesman Don Stewart told PolitiFact. "Did McConnell block the Senate ‘over 400 times’ or not? That’s an easy one: No." The Grimes campaign acknowledged that there are other reasonable interpretations of the data, but said it stands by the ad. Other ways to define obstructionism Experts on congressional procedure told PolitiFact that counting only 120 cloture votes doesn't fully encapsulate the extent of blocking undertaken by McConnell or the conference he leads. Part of the uncertainty stems from the definition of the word Grimes used: "block." If blocking means a maneuver that permanently prevents something from happening, then 120 examples would seem to be the right call. But if blocking means a delaying action, sometimes for months or years at a time, then the number of cloture motions filed -- roughly 400 -- begins to look much more defensible. When counting the number of cloture motions filed, rather than just those voted down, "the sequence of events suggests that the majority tried to move forward but couldn't because they were blocked by the minority," said Sarah Binder, a congressional scholar at the Brookings Institution. "So the majority filed for cloture, and then the minority came to the table. You just can't drop those from the count. McConnell, with support of his party, effectively blocked the Senate, at least temporarily." Binder offered two examples to illustrate the larger phenomenon. In the first case, Barbara Keenan, a judicial nominee, had to wait four months for a confirmation vote due to GOP opposition. After Reid filed for cloture, the Senate approved cloture by a 98-0 margin. "Yes, cloture was invoked, but GOP obstruction delayed seating a judge for four months," Binder said. Binder’s second example is Richard Cordray, President Barack Obama’s nominee to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Cordray waited almost two years for a vote; one finally came in July 2013, when cloture was approved, 71-29. "How can you say there was no effort to block the Senate from confirming Corday?" Binder said. "The minority tried to block him and they failed." Binder sees the Keenan and Cordray cases as "examples of a more general phenomenon." Other congressional scholars agreed. "Looking only at things actually killed by failed cloture motions is the narrowest way to look at the impact of filibusters and threatened filibusters," said Norm Ornstein, a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. "Instances of filibusters invoked on bills and nominations that passed unanimously or nearly so are done to soak up huge amounts of the Senate's most precious commodity, time. I view those actions as blockage." Steven Smith, a congressional scholar at Washington University in St. Louis, thinks the more expansive definition of what counts as "blocking" has merit, because delays aren’t cost-free. "Agencies that go without leadership, courts struggling with large workloads, departments without regular appropriations, and many, many other consequences of delay cannot be dismissed as inconsequential," he said. In fact, if you use the broader definition of "block" -- and throw in examples of the minority using amendments, motions, extraneous debate and roll-call vote demands -- then the number 400 could actually underestimate the amount of blocking going on. How much is McConnell to blame? Another tricky issue is whether the obstruction can be pinned on McConnell personally. Most experts we checked with said both parties bear some responsibility for the current paralysis in the Senate -- both due to Democratic actions prior to 2007 (when their party was in the minority) and current actions by the Democratic majority that have minimized the GOP’s ability to offer amendments. In addition, each senator is individually empowered to block whatever legislation they wish, so some of the blocking is being driven by individual senators rather than McConnell specifically. Still, the experts agreed that just because McConnell shares the responsibility doesn’t mean he’s absolved of all responsibility. After all, he’s been the GOP leader since 2007 and once said, "The single most important thing we want to achieve is for President Obama to be a one-term president." Binder believes that as the party’s leader and chief Senate strategist, "it’s reasonable to hold him accountable for party-backed filibusters." "If an observer can't see that this is central to McConnell's style of leadership, then it's time to find another line of work," said Roy T. Meyers, a political scientist at the University of Maryland-Baltimore County who specializes in Congress. Our ruling In her ad, Grimes said that McConnell has "blocked the Senate over 400 times." If you look at cases of permanent blockage -- which you can do by counting failed cloture votes -- then Grimes’ number significantly exaggerates the scale of McConnell’s obstructionism. But her 400 figure sounds much more reasonable if one uses a broader definition of "block" that counts delays, many of which have gone on for months and even years. In fact, there are enough ways for a minority to gum up the works that aren’t counted in the statistics that the actual number of blockages -- if it could be divined -- could well push the number higher than 400. And that’s a key problem for Grimes -- the number can’t be divined, meaning that Grimes’ figure, even if it is actually a low estimate, communicates a false sense of statistical specificity. It’s also debatable how much McConnell deserves blame for the Senate’s current gridlock, though most experts say he at least deserves some. On balance, we rate Grimes’ claim Half True.

pomt-10203	"I fought to bring about the largest private-sector infrastructure project in North American history."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/15/sarah-palin/not-quite-the-largest-and-not-quite-brought-about/	Since Sen. John McCain named Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin his vice-presidential running mate, she has repeatedly touted her push for a new pipeline in Alaska as evidence of her executive experience and energy expertise. But she has often fudged the truth in the process, as we explain in this article . Here we'll look at a claim Palin made both in her speech at the Republican National Convention on Sept. 3, 2008, and in a radio address three days later. Here's the full context, from the radio address: "Despite fierce opposition from oil company lobbyists, we broke their monopoly on power and resources," Palin said. "As governor, I insisted on competition and basic fairness to end their control of our state and return it to the people. I fought to bring about the largest private-sector infrastructure project in North American history. And when that deal was struck, we began a nearly $40-billion natural gas pipeline to help lead America to energy independence." The pipeline, which has been a pipe dream (pardon us) of officials and oilmen in Alaska for three decades, would carry to market natural gas currently stranded under the state's remote and rugged North Slope. Palin's plan is for the Canadian company TransCanada Corp. to build a 1,715-mile line southeast along the Alaska Highway, through the Canadian province of British Columbia to a hub in Alberta. Before her election as governor, Palin opposed the idea of routing the pipeline through Canada, a version of which her predecessor, Frank Murkowski, had advocated. But after she was elected governor she decided to consider all options. She pushed the Legislature to pass a law providing $500-million in state funds to whatever company presented the best proposal for the project. The Legislature accepted TransCanada's proposal in August 2008, and the company now faces the multiyear process of seeking federal approval. So yes, Palin "fought to bring about" a new plan for the pipeline. (Though she also fought to put the kibosh on Murkowski's plan.) Her phrasing — "fought to bring about" — could suggest that she did bring about the pipeline — that is, that it has been built, or is at least under construction. That's not true — TransCanada does not plan to begin construction until 2015, if at all. Now, would the pipeline be "the largest private-sector infrastructure project in North American history"? Palin didn't specify what she meant by "largest," but according to engineering experts, cost is the most common measure of the size of large-scale projects. "Generally when people talk about the size of an infrastructure project they're talking about the cost," said Jay McCauley, vice president of the Society for Industrial Archeology. We talked to several experts in pipelines and large-scale engineering projects, who said the only private infrastructure project on the scale of Palin's proposed pipeline that they could come up with was the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, an oil pipeline also from the North Slope that is often referred to as the Alaska Pipeline. (Most large infrastructure projects are publicly funded, whether directly, like the Interstate Highway System, or indirectly, like the Transcontinental Railroad.) The Alaska Pipeline was completed in 1977 at a cost of $8-billion. At 800 miles, it is physically shorter than TransCanada's proposed pipeline, but its $8-billion price tag would be at least $27-billion in 2007 dollars, according to the three online inflation calculators we consulted. Palin has claimed repeatedly that TransCanada's pipeline would cost "nearly $40-billion." But we could not determine where that estimate came from, and neither Palin's office in Alaska nor the McCain campaign returned our calls to tell us. Alaska's Web site says TransCanada's project would cost about $26-billion, and TransCanada spokeswoman Cecily Dobson confirmed the cost estimate remains "approximately US$26-billion in 2007 dollars." That's less than the $27-billion inflation-adjusted cost of the Alaska Pipeline. Not by much — but it's less. Palin was right to say she "fought to bring about" the pipeline. But she implies that it's further along than it really is. And she was wrong — though not egregiously so — to say it would be the largest private-sector infrastructure project in North American history. We judge her claim to be Half True.

pomt-07802	"One of the biggest causes of our soaring debt and economic insecurity ends up being Pentagon spending. The budget for the Pentagon consumes more than half of our discretionary spending."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/feb/18/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-says-defense-spending-consumes/	President Obama submitted his 2012 budget proposal to Congress on Valentine's Day, but the debate on efforts to cut spending started weeks earlier. Rep. Dennis Kucinich opened it with a call to question the cost of wars. "We can have a strong defense, but we are spending so much money that we are undermining our ability to be able to provide for the American people here at home," he said. "One of the biggest causes of our soaring debt and economic insecurity ends up being Pentagon spending. The budget for the Pentagon consumes more than half of our discretionary spending." PolitiFact Ohio wondered about that and took a closer look. We turned to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and to the National Priorities Project, a nonpartisan, liberal-leaning think tank that analyzes data to show how tax dollars are spent. The federal budget has two types of spending, discretionary and mandatory. Mandatory spending, also called direct spending, refers to outlays required by law. It includes such entitlement programs as Social Security and Medicare, veterans' benefits, food stamps, education and health programs. Mandatory spending is about two-thirds of the total budget. The problem of dealing with the politically charged entitlements is why balancing the budget is so difficult. Discretionary spending is the part of the budget governed by the annual appropriation process and debated by Congress. That category includes "defense" (which does not include all military-related spending), security, agricultural subsidies, education, health programs, highway construction and housing assistance. Discretionary defense outlays in fiscal 2010, which ended in October, were $689 billion, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Non-defense outlays were $677 billion, or less than half the total. For fiscal 2011, the CBO projects an even larger percentage of the discretionary budget -- 58 percent -- is military. Discretionary spending on the military has been trending up for more than a decade. From 2001 to 2010, it increased by 71 percent -- almost three times the rate of increase in domestic discretionary spending, which rose about 24 percent. Nonsecurity-related discretionary spending accounts for only about 15 percent of the $3.5 trillion total budget. We leave the question of whether that’s good policy for others to debate. But as to Kucinich’s statement, we rate his claim as True.	None	Dennis Kucinich	None	None	None	2011-02-18T06:00:00	2011-01-24	['The_Pentagon']

pomt-00162	John Adcock and Republicans’ plan for health care "would get rid of coverage altogether for thousands of families and raise premiums on the rest of us."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/23/sydney-batch/democrat-falsely-links-newly-appointed-republican-/	Democrats in North Carolina are campaigning on the idea that the GOP-controlled legislature should do more to improve health care in North Carolina. A recent video ad by Sydney Batch, a Democrat running for NC House District 37 in southern Wake County, tries to build off that idea. She’s running against Republican John Adcock, who was appointed to the seat in September. "John Adcock wants to join politicians who took thousands from insurance companies and support letting them deny health care coverage," a narrator in the ad says. "Their plan would get rid of coverage altogether for thousands of families and raise premiums on the rest of us." The claims are vague, leaving PolitiFact to wonder which plan by legislative Republicans would eliminate coverage for North Carolina families. The first quote is a reference to Republicans refusing to expand Medicaid, said Benjamin Woods, Batch’s campaign manager. It’s been well-documented that expanding Medicaid in North Carolina could provide coverage for up to 500,000 people. So let’s move on to the second quote. Woods said it refers to legislative Republicans’ "work to undermine the positive impact of the Affordable Care Act in North Carolina." Woods referenced a Charlotte Observer editorial about a Republican proposal this summer that would allow nonprofit organizations to offer health benefits to their members. An alternative to the ACA Health benefit plans, which exist in other states but aren’t available in North Carolina, can be cheaper than typical health insurance because they’re not regulated and don’t have to meet financial solvency requirements for sufficient funds to pay customers’ medical bills, The News & Observer reported in June. The plans don’t cover mental health benefits or preventive health services, unlike health insurance regulated under the ACA. (Although, in some cases, customers can pay extra for that coverage.) Critics, including The Charlotte Observer editorial board, fear the nonprofit benefit plans would lure healthy customers away from ACA plans, "which in turn would force insurers to raise premiums even more to cover the costs of the less healthy folks and elderly who remain on Obamacare." The Observer’s editorial continued: "The result: Obamacare will be gutted. So will its preexisting conditions benefit." The bill’s intention is indeed to provide healthy North Carolinians an alternative to subsidizing insurance for unhealthy people, said David Anderson, a research associate for Duke University’s Margolis Center for Health Policy. "It’s a cynical dodge, but a legal one," Anderson said. And it "would harm a small group of families who have significant medical conditions." The plan and Adcock The bill wouldn’t directly eliminate coverage, as the ad suggests. But it could drive up prices for ACA customers, prompting customers with the highest premiums to leave the marketplace altogether. "You’d probably start seeing price changes if 10,000 to 20,000 (healthy ACA customers) leave the risk pool," Anderson said. Eventually, he said, people with pre-existing conditions and the poor "will have to make the decision between paying the mortgage and paying for insurance." The bill, however, never became law. And Adcock hasn’t expressed support for it. In an email to PolitiFact, Adcock said he doesn’t know the specifics of the bill. But, "I know that many Republicans in the State House had many concerns with this bill as written, and I agree with them that the bill in its current form should not pass. "I think that if non-profit organizations want to offer health insurance to their members, they should be bound by consumer protections and have to cover all of their members, regardless of pre-existing conditions," Adcock continued. "While I’m open to considering a bill authorizing self-funded health benefit plans for non-profit organizations, I would need to review an extensive and objective analysis of its impacts before I could determine if such a bill is in the best interest of my constituents." Our ruling Batch’s commercial suggests a plan supported by John Adcock and legislative Republicans "would get rid of coverage altogether for thousands of families and raise premiums on the rest of us." Her campaign manager cited a bill that would have provided an alternative option to the Affordable Care Act. While that bill could ultimately destabilize the ACA marketplace, causing premiums to rise, it doesn’t directly eliminate coverage. It didn’t have enough support to pass and Adcock says he opposes it. We rate this claim False.

pomt-11430	In Japan, "they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn't qualify...It's horrible, the way we're treated."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/15/donald-trump/trump-botches-japanese-bowling-ball-test/	President Donald Trump often speaks of how other countries treat American products unfairly. At a private fundraising event in Missouri, Trump singled out a particular practice in Japan. "It's called the bowling ball test. Do you know what that is?" Trump said, according to a recording obtained by the Washington Post. "That's where they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air, and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn't qualify. Well, guess what, the roof dented a little bit, and they said, nope, this car doesn't qualify. It's horrible, the way we're treated. It's horrible." The Washington Post noted, "It was unclear what he was talking about." So we wanted to look into it. We asked the White House press office what Trump had in mind and got no comment. In her regular press briefing, White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump was just joking. However, we found something that loosely fits what he described. There are no bowling balls, and no 20-foot drop. But Japan’s National Agency for Automotive Safety and Victim Aid does what’s called a pedestrian head protection performance test. It’s designed to measure the force someone’s head would absorb if a car hit them. This involves firing a carefully calibrated hemisphere-shaped device (so, more like half of a bowling ball) at the hood and windshield. The device records the force. Here’s a graphic from the agency’s website: Note that the largest head impactor is 4.5 kilograms, or about 10 pounds. So, the details about a bowling ball, the weight and the height of the drop are all wrong. But those details aside, Trump also got the purpose and nature of the test totally wrong. When he said, "If the hood dents, then the car doesn't qualify," that would be a test of the strength of the hood. In contrast, the test is all about a person’s head and the force it has to absorb in an accident. "It’s the complete opposite," said Sean Kane, president of Safety Research and Strategy, a private firm that studies vehicle and consumer product safety. In fact, the more a hood dents or flexes, the better it is for the head of the unlucky pedestrian. "It’s akin to any other type of crash," Kane said. "You look at cars today, and the impact damage to cars is much greater. There’s a lot of crush, but that’s to absorb the energy and keep it away from people." A biomedical engineering dissertation from Wayne State University made the same point: "To lower head injury criterion, two main principles are necessary: provision of sufficient deformation space and provision of a low stiffness of the impacted vehicle body parts." However, Trump got one element correct. American cars sold in Japan, at least all models made this decade, have to meet the Japanese safety standard. So Trump was correct that this is a hurdle for American car makers. It’s worth noting that Europe has a similar standard. In the early 2000s, the problem of cars hitting pedestrians was worse in Europe and Japan than in the United States. In Japan, for example, 27 percent of all traffic fatalities were pedestrians hit by cars. In the United States, it was 13 percent. "The head impact test is a standardized test and has been there for many years," said Pankaj Mallick, professor of mechanical engineering at the University of Michigan-Dearborn. "Our car companies are very much aware of this, but at this time, there are no National Highway Traffic Safety Administration requirements to do this test for qualification of a car hood." Kane noted that the United States stands out for having lower safety standards than Europe and Japan. "If U.S. car makers wanted to make safer cars, they could sell them in both markets," he said. "If they don’t, that’s a business decision." Our ruling Trump said that in Japan, "they take a bowling ball from 20 feet up in the air and they drop it on the hood of the car. And if the hood dents, then the car doesn't qualify." American cars must meet a Japanese standard. But Trump mangled the highly controlled process, which does not involve a bowling ball dropped from 20 feet. Where Trump really goes astray is on the purpose of the test; he has it backward. It’s not about seeing if the hood is strong. The more a hood gives way, the better it is for the head of a pedestrian. Trump’s understanding of the test is so far off the mark, we rate this claim False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2018-03-15T17:41:13	2018-03-14	['Japan']

"Just in: actor ‘Vin Deisel’ (sic) dies after a failed attempt to perfect a stunt on set," reads a headline of an article on the website thth.mayatmenen.info. That sounds sadder than the death of Groot. But did it really happen? The article is a pitch-black void of evidence to suggest that Diesel died. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Figuring out the facts of this story was less complicated than the plot of XXX. For starters, Diesel’s name is spelled incorrectly in the headline. It’s also notable that there’s no byline for the article. Reputable news stories usually come with a byline to keep writers accountable and allow readers to contact the author if necessary. Below the headline, there are two paragraphs lifted, word-for-word, from Vin Diesel’s Wikipedia page. The page also contains a video clip featuring a Fox News logo and a newscaster. Clicking on it, you’d expect to hear a news anchor reporting on the news of Vin Diesel’s death. But if you click on the video, you’ll actually hear the anchor say, "Finally, I have some very sad news," before the clip freezes and is replaced by the words "Share to Uncover This Video." Clicking on those words opens up a pop-up window that allows you to share a link to the article on Facebook. We found after we shared the story, the video still would not load. A Nexis search revealed that no major news outlets have reported on Diesel’s death, and no obituaries have been written for him. This isn’t the first time that incorrect rumors of Diesel’s death have spread like the Necromongers across the galaxy. The hoax occurred at least one other time, in 2014. We were unable to get in touch with the website where the article was posted, as we could not find any contact information for them. Our ruling A story on a website, thth.mayatmenen.info, claims that actor Vin Diesel died "after a failed attempt to perfect a stunt on set." The article provides no evidence to support this claim, and no major news outlets are reporting that Diesel died. This is an iron giant of a hoax. We rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-03438	Says Georgia Power customers pay 10 percent to 15 percent below the national average for electricity.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/jun/24/ron-shipman/georgia-power-customers-pay-lower-rates-most-offic/	So, do Georgia Power customers pay less for their services than people in other parts of the country? The answer is yes, a company official said at a June 10 community meeting. How much less? Ten percent to 15 percent below the national average, said Ron Shipman, the company’s vice president of environmental affairs. PolitiFact Georgia heard about the claim and decided to do some research. Georgia Power has nearly 2.4 million customers. That’s about one out of every three adults in this state. The Partnership for Southern Equity, an organization that tries to help the working poor in metro Atlanta, put together the meeting. The crux of the meeting was that there ends up being a lot of inequity in the communities when it comes to utility bills. Some low-income Atlanta-area residents live in older homes that are not energy-efficient, thus, their utility bills are super high. Company officials at the meeting stressed that there are programs to help those people. In general, the company contended at the meeting, their service is less expensive in comparison to other parts of the country. We found the company has been below the national average, but by how much? Georgia Power, a subsidiary of Atlanta-based Southern Co., is regulated by the state’s Public Service Commission. It gets 47 percent of its fuel from natural gas; 35 percent from coal; 18 percent from nuclear; and a small amount from hydropower and other renewable sources. As a regulated monopoly, Georgia Power must provide electricity to all customers in its territory. It is allowed to recoup the costs of providing that power plus a profit. The average bill was expected to increase by 44 cents a month in January. Georgia Power credits programs such as free in-home energy audits for residential customers plus others that assist commercial customers in installing energy-efficient equipment in their facilities for lower costs than most utilities. The company also recently introduced My Power Usage – an online program that allows residential customers to track their daily energy costs, view their projected bill, set up email notifications about their usage and more, company spokesman Jacob Hawkins said. Georgia Power bases its claim on how much it charges customers for its services, Hawkins said. In 2012, Georgia Power customers paid about 9 cents per kilowatt hour. The national average, he said, was 10.13 cents per kilowatt hours. The difference was about 11 percent. The federal government has an agency that keeps track of how much money Americans pay for energy use, the U.S. Energy Information Administration. EIA data are used by other organizations, such as the Edison Electric Institute, an 80-year-old organization of U.S. shareholder-owned electric companies. The EIA figures we found for Georgia Power customers in 2012 were nearly identical to what the company sent us. The national average in 2012 was slightly lower, 9.865 cents per kilowatt hour. Thus, Georgia Power customers paid 8.7 percent less than the national average, according to our analysis of 2012 data. In 2011, we found Georgia Power customers paid 2.9 percent below the national average. Before 2011, Georgia Power customers paid 10 percent less than the national average eight consecutive years. They paid more than 15 percent below the national average in five of those years. Georgia Power officials sent us their own figures, saying it’s not an "apples to apples" comparison to include every utility company in the nation. The company shared a comparison that focused solely on investor-owned utilities. Georgia Power’s numbers showed its customers paid 10 percent or more below the national average in nine of the past 10 years. In 2011, Georgia Power customers paid 5.1 percent below the national average. To sum up, Georgia Power official Ron Shipman said the company’s customers pay 10 percent to 15 percent below the national average. Our findings showed Shipman’s numbers were off the past two years but on point for the prior eight years. Georgia Power’s research was fairly similar. Since he was slightly off for 2012, but right for eight of the nine years before that, we rate Shipman’s claim as Mostly True.	None	Ron Shipman	None	None	None	2013-06-24T00:00:00	2013-06-10	['None']

pomt-01624	"Cory Gardner is sponsoring a bill to ban all abortions right now."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/28/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/democratic-group-claims-cory-gardner-backs-bill-ba/	Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who’s running to unseat Democratic Sen. Mark Udall, is finding his stance on abortion targeted by another Democratic attack ad. We previously rated a Udall claim that Gardner "championed" an effort to ban birth control in Colorado as Half True. The latest 30-second spot, aired by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, features a handful of women criticizing the Colorado Republican’s pro-life stance. "Why do guys like Cory Gardner think it’s any of their business to tell women what do?" one woman asks. Another calls Gardner’s positions "extreme," after a narrator says Gardner would "ban abortions even in cases of rape and incest." Later, the narrator adds: "Gardner is sponsoring a bill to ban all abortions right now." We decided to take a look at this last claim. The DSCC points to H.R. 1091, known formally as the Life At Conception Act and informally as a "personhood" bill. Gardner is listed as a cosponsor on the bill. The bill was introduced April 8, 2013, by Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio. According to the bill text, it would "implement equal protection for the right to life of each born and preborn human person" and "declares that the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being." It goes on to say that "‘human person’ and ‘human being’ include each and every member of the species homo sapiens at all stages of life, including the moment of fertilization, cloning, or other moment at which an individual member of the human species comes into being." If this sounds confusing to you, that’s because it is. None of the above mentions abortion, even though it’s quite clearly an anti-abortion measure. In fact, the only part of the bill that seems to directly reference abortion only further muddies the waters: "Nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize the prosecution of any woman for the death of her unborn child." It’s difficult to weigh the impact of such a perplexing bill. On the one hand, the bill doesn’t explicitly carve out exemptions for cases that involve rape or incest or instances when the woman’s life or health is in danger. On the other hand, the bill doesn’t explicitly mention abortion in the first place. This means that judicial interpretation will play a big role in how any such law is implemented. But because no state has passed a personhood bill, courts have not established a track record about how they would interpret such a measure and how the measure would affect abortions. By suggesting that a fetus has the "right to life," the bill challenges the Supreme Court’s past support for a constitutional right to abortion. An act of Congress cannot overrule the constitution, meaning the Supreme Court would have to change its past positions on abortion. That’s possible, but even if the bill is a vehicle to challenge Roe vs. Wade and subsequent decisions, it’s not clear that the outcome would "ban all abortions." Glenn Cohen, codirector of the Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics at Harvard University, said claiming that the personhood bill would ban all abortions "might be a bit strong." Depending on how courts rule, it might still be possible that exceptions could be made in cases where the mother’s life or health was at risk, he said. "One could believe that fetuses are persons but still have those exceptions on a theory like self defense," Cohen said. Further complicating matters is that Gardner is straddling both sides of the issue. He has publicly stated that he no longer supports the personhood movement because of its potential affect on some FDA-approved birth control -- yet he has not taken his name off the bill as a cosponsor. Gardner’s campaign said his cosponsorship of the legislation is to "reflect his belief that life begins at conception." The campaign said Gardner is on record supporting exemptions for "rape, incest, and life of the mother," and the campaign disagrees that the personhood bill amounts to a ban on all abortion. The bill is not expected to come up for a vote. Gardner is cosponsor of a different bill filed in 2013 that would take away federal funding for abortion providers except when the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest or a physician certifies that the woman's life is in danger if she carries the baby to birth. Our ruling The DSCC said Gardner "is sponsoring a bill to ban all abortions right now." The claim is based on Gardner’s cosponsorship of a bill that grants a fetus the same rights as a person from the moment of fertilization. It’s clear that such personhood bills are anti-abortion measures, but there’s a lot of uncertainty in the bill’s language that would have to be sorted through, over time, by the court system, and it’s not clear that it would ban all abortions. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee	None	None	None	2014-08-28T13:43:55	2014-08-21	['None']

pomt-01228	Austin mayoral candidate Steve Adler has "never been active in anything that has to do with City Hall."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/nov/20/mike-martinez/martinez-says-steve-adler-hasnt-been-active-anythi/	Austin mayoral candidate Mike Martinez says his opponent, Steve Adler, lacks experience in municipal matters. Martinez, an Austin City Council member since 2006, told Austin’s KVUE-TV for a news story aired Nov. 11, 2014: "He’s never been active in anything that has to do with City Hall," stressing "anything." Adler and Martinez are vying in a Dec. 16, 2014, runoff. Adler’s campaign manager, Jim Wick, asked us to look into Martinez’s claim. Asked how Martinez reached his conclusion, Martinez spokesman Nick Hudson emailed: "Mike meant something specific when he made this statement. While Mike Martinez has been on the Austin City Council for nearly eight years and has a near-perfect attendance record, Steve Adler has not, to our knowledge, ever taken an active role in our local government by appearing before Council on an item." That’s a way to get to "never." To be sure, Adler has been running as a City Hall outsider eager to get city government moving in a fresh direction. Wick told us Adler never has been on a council-appointed board or commission. But Wick said by email the eminent-domain lawyer has built familiarity with city affairs, in part by representing clients whose land was being condemned by the city. In 2004, Adler represented Lowe’s when the store and city of Austin tried to keep construction of a store continuing in Southwest Austin. The project ultimately proceeded after a 2005 legal settlement involving the city of Sunset Valley and environmental groups. Adler also has volunteered in causes that connected with city government, Wick wrote. According to an October 2014 Austin American-Statesman profile, Adler led the board of the Austin-area Anti-Defamation League from 2009 to 2012. In that role, Wick told us, Adler "helped conceive of and serves on the city-led Hate Crimes Task Force." The Austin ADL says on a web page that when the task force was launched in December 2010, its "convenors" included the ADL, several council members and more than 70 individuals representing 40 organizations or departments. A May 2011 Austin Chronicle news story, pointed out by Wick, listed the ADL among groups having a hand in starting the task force. The story described Laura Morrison as one of three council members behind the task force’s creation in the wake of the beatings of two men outside City Hall in 2010. "The attack prompted Morrison and colleagues Sheryl Cole and Randi Shade to ask the Austin chapter of the Anti-Defam­a­tion League to put together a proposal for what a city-led task force might look like," the Chronicle said. The story said: "The idea is for the group – which includes" Travis County’s district and county attorneys, the Austin Police Department, "University of Texas and Austin Independent School District police, members of the Anti-Defam­ation League, Out Youth, and other civil rights groups, among others – to identify and develop an approach to dealing with hate-motivated violence ‘before, during, and after’ it happens." That story didn’t mention Adler. But in May 2014, an Adler profile in the Austin Bulldog quoted Austin ADL board member Kirk Rudy saying Adler "was instrumental" in creating the task force. By phone, attorney Karen Gross, a former ADL staff member, told us she and Adler helped launch the task force by reaching out to any group with a possible stake in the collaboration of city, county and non-governmental entities. Wick said Adler also had a hand in writing the city’s cultural master plan. An April 2008 consultant’s report lists Adler among 71 members of the CreateAustin Leadership Council, an appointed group of "civic, business and cultural leaders who agreed to provide the visible leadership in reaching out to engage the community, to assist in crafting the CreateAustin Cultural Master Plan and to galvanize the effort to implement the plan’s recommendations." By telephone, Janet Seibert, the city’s civic arts program consultant, said the members were chosen by city staff. The report says the city’s Cultural Arts Division launched the CreateAustin "strategic planning process" in September 2006 because the city "wanted to review and refine municipal roles and responsibilities for cultural support, but that was only half of it. The City recognized they couldn’t support arts, culture and creative industries alone. They sought to trigger and develop community leadership to explore major issues and develop strategies to sustain the creative culture of Austin." The leadership council, the report said, "met regularly to review research, findings and community input in order to help shape the cultural plan." Adler, the report says, was on the body’s Cultural Infrastructure task force. Adler co-chaired that task force, Seiberg said to our query. She said the Austin City Council accepted the master plan in June 2010. Our ruling Martinez said Adler has "never been active in anything that has to do with City Hall." Adler hasn’t been a member of city boards or commissions and we accept Martinez’s assertion Adler hasn’t addressed the council. Then again, Adler had a leadership hand in developing the hate crimes task force and the city’s cultural master plan. All told, this never/anything statement strikes us as incorrect and ridiculous.

pomt-01413	"20,000 Kansans lost their health insurance because of (Obamacare)."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/09/pat-roberts/pat-roberts-obamacare-killed-insurance-20000-kansa/	In an unexpectedly tight race, Republican Sen. Pat Roberts of Kansas is doing everything he can to paint his opponent -- independent Greg Orman -- as a liberal henchman. One of Roberts’ favorite points is Orman’s stance on the Affordable Care Act. Orman says he does not support the health care law, but he also says pushing legislation to repeal it is impractical, because President Barack Obama would simply veto it. In a recent Web video, Roberts treats that view as support for Obamacare. The ad starts out with video of Orman shaking hands with constituents, one of whom asks him a question about repealing Obamacare. Orman replies, "That’s an interesting question," and moves on down the line. "Greg Orman won't repeal Obamacare," the ad’s narrator says, "even though 20,000 Kansans lost their health insurance because of it." Roberts was expected to easily win a fourth term (the last time Kansas elected a Democrat to the Senate was in 1932). Then, Democratic candidate Chad Taylor dropped out, and independent Orman surged in the polls. Now the race is a toss-up. Some see a Roberts win as necessary for Republican Senate control in 2015. Both candidates say they do not support Obama’s health care law, but we wanted to know how the law had affected Kansas -- did 20,000 people really lose their health insurance? The answer, it seems, is no. How many Kansans lost insurance? We asked Linda Sheppard, health policy adviser for the Kansas Insurance Department, how many Kansans had lost their insurance due to Obamacare. She said the state does not require health insurance carriers to report when people go on or off coverage, so there’s no way to definitively know the answer. However, Sheppard said insurance carriers do have to check in with the department when they decide to terminate a policy. So 20,000 people losing health insurance would have likely come to her attention. "We are not aware of any wide-scale cancellation of policies," she said. Here’s what happened. About a year ago, in October 2013, Kansas’ largest insurance carrier -- Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas -- sent letters to about 9,450 policyholders, according to numerous news reports. Those members would be unable to renew their plans for 2014 because those plans do not comply with new standards under the Affordable Care Act. Sheppard told us there are no official numbers for how many people received these notices from insurance carriers other than Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas. Roberts’ ad cites the 20,000 figure from an October 2013 story out of Kansas Watchdog, a conservative news website. That story says Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas City (which is primarily based in Missouri but also serves two Kansas counties) sent out notices to about 10,000 Kansan policyholders, on top of the 9,450 from Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Kansas. For Roberts, this is where the story ends. But in reality, the thousands of people who received these letters did not end up without insurance. The following November -- after the failed roll out of HealthCare.gov (Kansas uses the federal marketplace) -- Obama announced that people who had recieved these nonrenewal notices could keep their policies through 2014. Then in March of this year, Kansas agreed to another transitional policy that allowed all of these policies to continue through 2016. It’s Sheppard’s understanding that Kansas insurance companies turned around and retracted those nonrenewal notices -- meaning the thousands of people who received those notices were able to keep their health insurance. Retracting the nonrenewal notices caused some behind-the-scenes challenges for the carriers, but "for the consumer it was pretty easy," said Scott Brunner, senior analyst at the Kansas Health Institute, a nonprofit think tank. Of course, these policyholders could have chosen not to renew. They could have picked a different plan, switched to a different provider or dropped insurance altogether -- but they were not forced out of health insurance by the Affordable Care Act. "It is disingenuous to focus on those who lost insurance without acknowledging that it doesn’t mean they are currently (uninsured)," said Roberta Riportella, a professor of community health at Kansas State University who supports the Affordable Care Act. Roberts’ ad also ignores that the number of uninsured Kansans who have gained coverage under the Affordable Care Act. Because the state does not meticulously track the number of insured folks, and the law only became fully implemented this year, it is hard to know with certainty how many people gained insurance as a result of Obamacare. But about 57,000 Kansans are now enrolled in the health insurance marketplace, Riportella said. If Kansas follows national estimates, then roughly half of those people were previously uninsured. There’s no evidence to suggest that more people are uninsured now than before the Affordable Care Act was implemented, Brunner said. "The expectation would be that with the Affordable Care Act that the number would continue to decline," he said. Our ruling Roberts said, "20,000 Kansans lost their health insurance because of (Obamacare)." There’s no official information to corroborate Roberts’ claim. Several thousand Kansans received notices that their insurance plans could not be renewed because they did not comply with Obamacare standards, but the notices were retracted about a month later. Meanwhile, about 57,000 Kansans obtained insurance on HealthCare.gov. If the state follows the national trend, roughly half of these people were uninsured before the law. We rate Roberts’ claim False.	None	Pat Roberts	None	None	None	2014-10-09T18:39:19	2014-10-01	['None']

pomt-10099	John McCain's health care plan "won't guarantee coverage of cancer screenings or maternity care."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/27/planned-parenthood/few-guarantees-in-mccains-plan/	The Planned Parenthood Action Fund has launched an attack ad on John McCain that makes a case that his health care plan hurts women. The ad features a nurse, Shaina Klackle, talking about a study created by the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. "As a nurse, I'm concerned about your health care," Klackle says. "And so is Planned Parenthood's Action Fund. In fact, their study found John McCain's plan won't guarantee coverage of cancer screenings or maternity care." The ad goes on to make other claims about McCain's health plan, but here we wanted to look at the claim about guaranteed coverage for cancer screenings and maternity care. We should say off the bat that McCain's health plan contains no details about specific conditions or coverage. The heart of his plan seeks to stimulate the market for individual health insurance by ending the tax exemption on employer-provided health care benefits in exchange for a tax credit. McCain hopes this will lead to greater competition in the health care market by allowing people to shop around for their own insurance. Also along those lines, his plan calls for allowing people to shop for policies across state lines, so they can purchase the most effective policy, no matter where the insurance provider is located. It's that last provision that is the basis for Planned Parenthood's statement, according to the report they issued to back up the ad. Many states have passed laws that say health care providers operating in their state must provide coverage in certain areas. Planned Parenthood cites requirements for cancer screenings and maternity care in more than 20 states. Under a McCain plan, insurers could operate in any state and sell all over the country. A rollback of insurance requirements isn't spelled out in McCain's plan. But it's a reasonable fear, said Sara Collins of the Commonwealth Fund, a nonpartisan policy group that seeks to improve the health care system. Health insurance requirements differ substantially from state to state, and insurance companies would likely locate in the states with the least regulations, Collins said. "Ultimately, you would have an individual market that's not regulated in any state," Collins said. "It's very different from what we have right now." Planned Parenthood's ad says that McCain's plan doesn't "guarantee" coverage of cancer screenings or maternity care, and on a literal level, that's true. But Planned Parenthood's deeper point is that some people have a "guarantee" under their respective state's current laws, and they could lose that guarantee under McCain's plan. McCain's plan has no literal guarantees for coverage, and Planned Parenthood makes an additional case that his regulations could undermine existing state guarantees. On that basis, we rate Planned Parenthood Action Fund's statement True.	None	Planned Parenthood	None	None	None	2008-10-27T00:00:00	2008-10-24	['None']
pomt-10548	Says the difference between her and Barack Obama is "about 35 years of experience."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/19/hillary-clinton/she-has-experience-but-maybe-not-at-math/	Sen. Hillary Clinton often boasts that she has a long resume. Asked during a Texas campaign event about the difference between her and Sen. Barack Obama, Clinton replied, "Well, about 35 years of experience." But we find her math is off. Although we find here that she is largely correct when she says she has 35 years of experience in politics, she has failed to include Obama's experience in her calculation. By our count, Obama, who is 14 years younger than Clinton, has about one year running a voter-registration project, three years as a community organizer, four as a full-time attorney handling voting rights, employment and housing cases, and 12 years in the Illinois Senate and U.S. Senate. That's a total of 20 years in public policy matters. So the difference between Clinton and Obama is really 15 years. We rate her claim False.

pomt-08469	Says "Sean Duffy was a no-show" as Ashland County District Attorney while he was on the campaign trail	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/13/julie-lassa/congressional-candidate-julie-lassa-says-gop-rival/	Ashland County’s Courthouse couldn’t be much smaller -- one judge, one district attorney, one part-time assistant DA. So it was no surprise that Dan Goglin, the part-time assistant DA, stirred attention when he appeared in a television ad for Democratic congressional candidate Julie Lassa ripping Sean Duffy -- his former boss and Lassa’s opponent -- for spending more time campaigning than prosecuting criminals. For most voters in the northwest Wisconsin district, both candidates are new -- they are aiming to replace retiring U.S. Rep. Dave Obey (D-Wausau), who has held the 7th District seat since 1969. The ad from Lassa, a state senator, aims to undercut Duffy by relying on first-hand testimony from someone who presumably knows his work best. "We did not see him often," Goglin says of Duffy in the ad. "His campaign was taking him away from the job." Goglin continues: "All the time, witnesses (and) victims would have to wait in the hallway for him to come to work. The quality of services that were provided to the citizens of this county suffered." Goglin’s image fades and is replaced by these words, with a voice saying: "Sean Duffy was a no show." It’s unclear whether or not the final words were spoken by Goglin. So, is Lassa right: Was Sean Duffy a "no show"? We started with Lassa’s campaign, to see what evidence they could provide beyond the testimony of Goglin, who is active in the local Democratic party. (Goglin gave $150 to Obey’s campaign fund Feb. 22. There is no indication he has contributed to Lassa’s campaign.) The Lassa campaign, relying largely on Duffy’s campaign finance reports, cited seven nights where Duffy apparently stayed out of town overnight in the time period between March 22 and June 2, 2010. The list included a GOP "Young Guns" fund-raiser in Washington, D.C., on May 25. The campaign also said Duffy didn’t log onto his work computer for 20 work days in the first six months of the year "but attended campaign events on more than half of those same dates." A little background will help here. Duffy served about eight years as district attorney for the small county in far northern Wisconsin. He was appointed by former Gov. Scott McCallum, a Republican, and soon hired Goglin as his part-time assistant. In July 2009, Duffy announced he would challenge Obey, the third most senior member of the U.S. House and chair of the powerful Budget Committee. In late April, 2010, The New York Times ran a front-page story noting Obey faced a stiff challenge. Ten days later Obey, made the surprise announcement that he was retiring. Now an open seat, the race became even more of a target for national Republicans and the campaign heated up. In June 2010, Duffy resigned from the $93,123-a-year job to campaign full time. Gov. Jim Doyle named his replacement, Kelly McKnight, a month later. Lassa’s evidence, on its face, does not support the charge she is making. There was no list of hearings that were delayed or any phone records of citizen complaints. Duffy, for instance, could have used vacation time on the days he was out of town or his computer was not turned on. We attempted to find Duffy’s vacation records, but there are none. As a state employee, district attorneys are allowed to take time off at will and no record is kept of that, according to McKnight, Duffy’s replacement. So Lassa’s claim hinges largely on the testimony of Goglin. We called Goglin, who refused to take our call. He said through a staff person he would not take political calls from our work phone. We left several additional messages. He did not respond. We then turned to a variety of other people familiar with the inner workings of the courthouse and the community. All said they have not been actively involved in the campaign on either side. Was Duffy a "no show" on the job, prompting complaints and problems? * "That did not seem to be the case," said Claire Duquette, editor of The Daily Press newspaper in Ashland. She said the paper had received no complaints and the paper did not hear of problems with cases being delayed or mishandled. *"Nobody called me on that," said district court administrator Scott Johnson, who added: "It’s a busy court. It was situation normal." * "As far as the court system, no," said Ashland County Clerk of Courts Katie Colgrove. "It did not come to a screeching halt." Colgrove and others said the comment about people waiting in the hallway makes sense to a point. "That sounds like a usual Monday here" when Judge Robert Eaton holds intake court for those arrested over the weekend, Colgrove said. Others noted that there isn’t a waiting room for the district attorney’s office. "The waiting room for the DA’s office is the hallway," said defense attorney Joe Rafferty, who added: "I have never seen anyone sitting on that bench." The most detail about the campaigning DA came from Nancy Thyberg, the office’s victim-witness coordinator. She said Duffy, a married father of six young kids, tried to do too much -- a full-time job and the campaign. "Sean was a very good DA, but in all honesty in the last couple of months he wasn’t there a lot," she said. "He really thought he could do both and he couldn’t. It’s just an impossible thing." She said Duffy was difficult to reach at times, and "we had some scheduling issues." She said the transition increased frustration, particularly for Goglin, who had to do more work to help run the office. McKnight, Duffy’s replacement, said there were some cases backed up when he took over but said it wasn’t clear to him whether it was because of Duffy’s campaigning or the four weeks between Duffy’s announcement and his being named to the job. Finally, Mark Perrine, assistant state public defender, said in his view Duffy was "getting a little frazzled" and that others in the office were "covering for Sean." But like others, he did not cite any cases that were delayed or specifics on items missed or mishandled. The Lassa campaign noted that between September 2009 and March 2010, Duffy’s campaign reimbursed him $13,712 for campaign-related travel. At 50 cents a mile, that means Duffy drove 27,422 miles during that period. Duffy said the figure is accurate: "I’m working my tail off here." He acknowledged the demands on his time mounted in the spring but said it did not come at the expense of his job. He said he tried to flex his schedule and came into the office on weekends. By the end of May, he said he realized campaigning in a large district would not work with his job, a position he could have held at least until the 2012 election. "I did the honorable thing" and stepped down, he said, noting he worked until Doyle named his replacement: "It’s not like I said ‘OK, I’ve moved on, see you all later.' " Lassa, it should be noted, has continued to hold her $49,943-a-year job as a state senator -- and many other officials, including gubernatorial candidates Democrat Tom Barrett (Milwaukee mayor) and Scott Walker (Milwaukee County executive) have campaigned for higher office while keeping their day jobs. So what to make of Lassa’s allegations of an AWOL DA? In making her charge, Julie Lassa cites some nights out of town and days out of the office, but by themselves they are not evidence that Sean Duffy’s campaign schedule had a negative impact on his work schedule. Thus, her claim largely centers on the testimony of assistant district attorney Dan Goglin, who cites several general examples of delays. But others at the Ashland County courthouse paint a different story and largely do not back up his claims. Nevertheless, by Duffy’s own admission, in his final months on the job it was a difficult balance. That is why, he said, he resigned -- something Lassa and other higher-office seekers have not done. We rate Lassa’s claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08793	"U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Rauf’s trip to the Middle East."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/19/ileana-ros-lehtinen/ileana-ros-lehtinen-peter-king-correct-federal-fun/	As the high-voltage battle over the "Ground Zero Mosque" was raging on Aug. 10, 2010, two Republican lawmakers -- Florida Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, the ranking member on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, and New York Rep. Peter King, the ranking member on the House Homeland Security Committee -- took aim at the State Department for allegedly footing the bill for foreign travel by the imam behind the proposed center in lower Manhattan. "It is unacceptable that U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Rauf’s trip to the Middle East," the lawmakers wrote. "Abdul Rauf has cast blame for 9/11 on the U.S., and even refuses to call Hamas what it is –- a Foreign Terrorist Organization. This radical is a terrible choice to be one of the faces of our country overseas. The U.S. should be using public diplomacy programs to combat extremism, not endorse it. The State Department’s selection of Feisal Abdul Rauf to represent the American people through this program further calls into question the Administration’s policy and funding priorities." We're separately looking at other aspects of the controversy here, including some elements of what Ros Lehtinen and King said in their statement. But in this item, we wanted to look at the narrow question of whether the lawmakers were correct that "U.S. taxpayers are being forced to fund Feisal Abdul Rauf’s trip to the Middle East." At an Aug. 10, 2010, State Department briefing, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs P.J. Crowley confirmed that a program under the State Department's auspices -- the Bureau of International Information Programs -- is paying for Rauf's trip. "Imam Faisal will be traveling to Qatar, Bahrain, and the UAE on a U.S. government-sponsored trip to the Middle East," Crowley said. "He will discuss Muslim life in America and religious tolerance. ... We have about 1,200 of these kinds of programs every year, of sending experts in all fields overseas. Last year we had 52 trips that were specifically focused on religious -- promoting religious tolerance. We will expect to have roughly the same number of programs this year." On Aug. 18, 2010, Fox News and the Associated Press, citing the State Department, reported that Rauf will be paid $3,000 directly by the U.S. government and that the government will pay for his airfare, lodging and expenses. The total amount for sending Rauf overseas will be roughly $16,000. Crowley noted that this will be Rauf's fourth trip overseas on the government's dime, including two of them under the administration of former President George W. Bush and one earlier this year. "In 2007, he visited Bahrain, Morocco, the UAE and Qatar," Crowley said. "And earlier this year, in January, he also visited Egypt. So we have a long-term relationship with him. You know, his work on tolerance and religious diversity is well-known and he brings a moderate perspective to foreign audiences on what it's like to be a practicing Muslim in the United States. And our discussions with him about taking this trip preceded the current debate in New York over the center." So Ros-Lehtinen is correct that the federal government (and, therefore, U.S. taxpayers) will be funding Rauf's trip to the Middle East. Some commentators have gone a step further by saying the trip is tantamount to a fundraising jaunt for Rauf's center. The Washington Times' editorial page wrote that "by funding the trip so soon after New York City's Landmarks Preservation Commission gave the go-ahead to demolish the building on the proposed mosque site, the State Department is creating the appearance that the U.S. government is facilitating the construction of this shameful structure. It gives Mr. Rauf not only access but imprimatur to gather up foreign cash. And because Mr. Rauf has refused to reveal how he plans to finance his costly venture, the American public is left with the impression it will be a wholly foreign enterprise." Crowley, in his Aug. 10 briefing, was asked about the fundraising issue. He knocked down the notion. "It is something that we have talked to him about, and we have informed him about our prohibition against fundraising while on a speaking tour," Crowley said. "We do not expect him to fundraise." We aren't rating this claim, because we don't believe it's provable either way that the trip will offer fundraising opportunities. On the one hand, the government has made clear that fundraising cannot take place during the trip. On the other hand, it's possible that the trip, indirectly, will raise Rauf's profile with people who hear him speak in Qatar, Bahrain, and the UAE and, in the process, ease future fundraising for his planned center. But while we're not taking sides on the fundraising question, we believe that the less-far-reaching statement by Ros-Lehtinen is accurate. U.S. taxpayers are indeed funding Rauf’s trip, as they have his prior two trips to the region. It's worth noting that the decision to sponsor his trip was made before the current controversy became the focus of media attention, and also that Rauf took his first State Department-funded trip during the Bush administration rather than Barack Obama. But none of those facts undercut the statement we checked by Ros-Lehtinen. We rate her statement True.

pomt-01053	The economy is "creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-economy-creating-jobs-fastest/	President Barack Obama’s State of the Union address was notable for its celebratory language about the state of the economy, following a recovery that was widely considered long and slow. Here’s one of the claims Obama made: "Tonight, after a breakthrough year for America, our economy is growing and creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999." We initially read this to mean that both the economy and the number of jobs had been growing at the fastest pace since 1999. That would have been a problematic claim, since the final figures for growth in gross domestic product in 2014 aren’t in yet. However, when we asked the White House press office for clarification, they responded that the president was making two separate claims -- first, that the economy is growing, and second, that the United States is creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999. The first of those claims is clearly true -- except for one quarter of negative growth in the first quarter of 2014, the economy has been expanding -- but we weren’t sure about the second part. So we decided to take a closer look at Obama’s claim that the economy is "creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999." Looking at job growth over the course of the calendar year We looked at total nonfarm employment from December of one year to December of the next, using official figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Here’s what we found: Time period Total job growth Dec. 1998 to Dec. 1999 3,177,000 Dec. 1999 to Dec. 2000 1,946,000 Dec. 2000 to Dec. 2001 - 1,735,000 Dec. 2001 to Dec. 2002 - 508,000 Dec. 2002 to Dec. 2003 105,000 Dec. 2003 to Dec. 2004 2,033,000 Dec. 2004 to Dec. 2005 2,506,000 Dec. 2005 to Dec. 2006 2,085,000 Dec. 2006 to Dec. 2007 1,140,000 Dec. 2007 to Dec. 2008 - 3,576,000 Dec. 2008 to Dec. 2009 - 5,087,000 Dec. 2009 to Dec. 2010 1,058,000 Dec. 2010 to Dec. 2011 2,083,000 Dec. 2011 to Dec. 2012 2,236,000 Dec. 2012 to Dec. 2013 2,331,000 Dec. 2013 to Dec. 2014 2,952,000 So Obama’s on target: The job growth during calendar year 2014 was higher than any year going back to 1999. Adding some context That said, the current recovery is hardly perfect. There have been three clear periods of job growth over the past quarter century. We looked at the gain in employment between the low point in jobs and the high point (or, for the current period, the most recent month). As this chart shows, these periods of expansion were quite consistent while they lasted. SOURCE: Bureau of Labor Statistics Here’s the breakdown of the three job expansions: Time period Total jobs created Jobs created per month May 1991 - Feb. 2001 24.5 million 207,847 Aug. 2003 - Jan. 2008 8.2 million 152,167 Feb. 2010 - Dec. 2014 10.7 million 181,220 This shows that the current jobs recovery, while more robust and longer than the one from 2003-08, pales in comparison to the one that lasted from 1991-2001. Indeed, it pales in two different ways: The current job expansion has created 13 percent fewer jobs every month on average than the one in the 1990s, and it has so far lasted only half as long. The earlier expansion lasted for almost a full decade. Our ruling Obama said the economy is "creating jobs at the fastest pace since 1999." The current jobs recovery isn’t perfect, but Obama is correct that it’s the fastest since 1999. So we rate the claim True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2015-01-21T16:21:46	2015-01-20	['None']
pomt-09174	"I've traveled the country advocating for the FairTax ..."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/04/tom-graves/linder-says-graves-played-minor-role-fairtax/	U.S. Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.) and 9th Congressional District candidate Tom Graves seemed to be on the same page regarding their support for the FairTax, particularly since they spoke in favor of the idea at an event in Missouri in June 2009. Not exactly. Graves has been telling supporters and voters about his efforts to work with Linder on the FairTax. "I’ve traveled the country advocating for the FairTax, along with Herman Cain, Neal Boortz and John Linder," Graves, a former state representative, said at an April 23 candidate debate at the Georgia Mountains Center in Gainesville. Linder, who represents Georgia's 7th Congressional District and is retiring at the end of this term, says that's an exaggeration. The congressman took the unusual step of accusing Graves, a fellow Republican, of lying about his efforts to push the idea. Linder even said he "didn't know who [Graves] was or why he was there." "Tom Graves is telling you that he has traveled the nation with John Linder to sell the FairTax. That simply is not true," Linder said in a 30-second robocall on May 27 for Graves’ opponent, Lee Hawkins. The congressman added: "If a candidate is willing to lie to you to get elected, what will you expect from him after he is elected?" The Graves campaign said it is surprised by Linder’s remarks and baffled by Linder's seeming unfamiliarity with the candidate. "It’s kind of bizarre for the congressman to say he didn’t know what he [Graves] was doing there," said Graves campaign spokesman Tim Baker, who added the two men traveled together to the event. We decided to check out how involved Graves has been with Linder to sell the FairTax. First, what is the FairTax? It would abolish all federal personal and corporate income taxes and other taxes, and replace them with a federal retail sales tax, according to the Web site FairTax.org. It essentially is a consumption tax -- the more you buy, the more tax you pay. The FairTax is an important cause to Linder. He’s been advocating the idea for more than a decade and co-wrote a book with Boortz explaining its benefits. Jennifer Drogus, Linder's communications director, said her boss appreciates Graves' support for the FairTax. But Linder felt like Graves exaggerated his role in the effort. We asked Graves campaign officials whether they thought their candidate was exaggerating things a bit by saying he "traveled the country" in support of the idea. "The record speaks for itself," said Baker, the campaign manager. "If you look at the fact, he was there." When asked whether they made other trips to talk about the FairTax, the Graves campaign focused on that Missouri trip as proof that their candidate is correct. Yes, they made a trip halfway across the country. But we think one trip to Missouri does not equate to "traveled the country." We find Tom Graves’ claim is Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07294	Next year, "you will be mandated by federal law to get rid of your existing light bulbs."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/20/chain-email/conservative-group-claims-new-law-would-require-pe/	A fundraising letter making the rounds from a conservative political action committee draws a political line in the sand over light bulbs. The letter, circulated by AmeriPAC, a political action committee that largely supports conservative Republican candidates, claims President Barack Obama is "banning" incandescent light bulbs in favor of compact fluorescent lighting. It includes a lengthy letter purported to be written by Ron Arnold of the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise Action Fund. "A silly little light bulb is merely a small piece of the larger puzzle of global socialism that he feels is his agenda to enslave the American people -- and to choke Americans from a free enterprise system!" the letter states. The letter seeks contributions and support for S.B. 395, the Better Use of Light Bulbs (BULB) Act, sponsored by Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo., which seeks to repeal the light bulb efficiency standards included in the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007. We're writing about several claims in the letter, but here, we wanted to set the record straight on one of its worst inaccuracies. "Next year your light bulbs will be obsolete," the letter reads. "You will be mandated by federal law to get rid of your existing light bulbs." A few paragraphs later, the letter hits on the same idea, stating, "Next year you will be required to trade in -- whoops...throw away...your trusty incandescent light bulbs so you will supposedly be 'environmentally-safe' with much more expensive Compact Fluorescent Light Bulbs (CFLs)." Sec. 321 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 spells out the new standards for light bulbs, essentially requiring them to be 25 percent more efficient. The idea is that, over time, more efficient light bulbs will replace older, less efficient ones. But there is nothing in the bill that requires you to get rid of the light bulbs you've got. Rather, the bill sets standards for new light bulbs "manufactured or imported" to the United States. Just to be sure, we asked Jen Stutsman, a spokeswoman for the Department of Energy, who said, "The standards apply to bulbs being imported or manufactured after the standards go into effect." Not only can people keep using their existing bulbs, she said, stores can continue to sell the old ones -- even after the new standards are in place -- until they are sold out. "There are no energy police coming to your home to make you remove your light bulbs," scoffed Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. We asked Arnold of the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise Action Fund, who is purported to have penned the letter, about the claim. Initially, Arnold told us "that's probably not a very good way to put that. I could have been more careful with that." Then he said he didn't recall including such a phrase in his letter at all. When we sent him a copy of the letter we received, he said it was "an earlier version that was sent out by AmeriPAC, which had no reason to believe it was wrong in any part." Arnold attached another version of the letter, the one he said CDFE sent out, and it words the claim a little more carefully: "Democrats in Congress have mandated that you must give up using traditional light bulbs all because environmentalists believed that traditional light bulbs caused global warming." But we're fact-checking the earlier version from AmeriPAC because it was widely circulated and spread even further via chain e-mail. The claim that next year, "you will be mandated by federal law to get rid of your existing light bulbs," has no basis in fact. It amounts to a manufactured, baseless charge, and we rate it Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2011-05-20T15:03:29	2011-05-16	['None']

pomt-11809	Congressional Republicans "want to take health care from millions of Americans in order to pay for" a tax bill.	half-true	/new-york/statements/2017/nov/16/andrew-cuomo/what-impact-will-eliminating-individual-mandate-ha/	Republican efforts to reverse portions of the Affordable Care Act are not over yet. A few months after failing to pass a bill repealing and replacing the law, some senators are pushing to add a provision to the tax overhaul bill that would repeal the individual mandate, which requires Americans to have health insurance coverage or else pay a tax penalty. While the repeal provision wasn’t in the original version of the bill released by Senate Republican leaders, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said on Twitter he would introduce an amendment to add it. Democratic critics of both the tax bill and the effort to undo the Affordable Care Act pounced on this development. "Apparently giving a massive tax cut to corporations and the wealthy wasn't enough for the GOP. Now they want to take health care from millions of Americans in order to pay for it," tweeted New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We wondered whether Cuomo was right to say that congressional Republicans "want to take health care from millions of Americans in order to pay for" a tax bill. We found his phrasing misses some important points, including this one: Many Americans would be choosing to give up their health insurance if the individual mandate were lifted. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo at a news conference on Nov. 2, 2017. (Jefferson Siegel/New York Daily News/TNS) Where Cuomo has a point In the tweet, Cuomo linked to a story in The Hill newspaper headlined, "Senate GOP tax bill will include repeal of ObamaCare mandate." The article supports Cuomo’s assertion that savings from eliminating the individual mandate could help offset lower revenues from tax cuts elsewhere in the bill. The general principle is this: The more money an additional tax bill provision saves for the Treasury, the more tax cuts lawmakers can propose without adding more to the deficit. Getting rid of the mandate "will raise an estimated $300 billion to $400 billion … that could be used to pay for lowering individual and business tax rates even further," The Hill article said. The estimate cited in The Hill story originated with an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan office that studies legislative proposals for Congress. The CBO projected that eliminating the individual mandate would reduce the federal deficit by $338 billion over 10 years. The savings would come from a reduction in subsidy payments for people who currently buy insurance on the law’s online marketplaces but would not do so if the mandate was lifted, and from reductions in Medicaid payments. Collectively, these reductions would more than balance out the loss of penalty payments by uninsured Americans, which CBO projected to be $43 billion in 10 years. Meanwhile, the CBO also projected that 4 million fewer Americans would have health insurance in 2019 as a result of the individual mandate being eliminated, which would rise to 13 million in 2027. What Cuomo’s claim doesn’t tell you Cuomo is putting the cart somewhat before the horse. For starters, the provision is already controversial among some senators, including Susan Collins, R-Maine -- one of the GOP senators who sank the previous repeal-and-replace effort and whose support is widely expected to be crucial for passing the tax bill. And even if a Senate bill that includes the individual mandate repeal does pass, the same language appears unlikely to be in the House bill. In remarks to CNBC, House Speaker Paul Ryan said that his chamber would not include the provision in the version it takes up on the floor, though he left open the possibility that it could be included in the "conference committee" version of the bill that attempts to iron out differences between any bills that pass the House and Senate. The bigger problem, however, is Cuomo saying that the GOP will be taking away people’s coverage. In reality, it’s more complicated than that. Some Americans who are only buying insurance today under threat of the mandate will choose to drop their coverage voluntarily. But if this group is healthier than average, as health care economists say is likely, then the people remaining in the insurance pools would be less healthy — and thus more costly to insure. That would increase premiums, potentially squeezing out some people who, all things considered, would have rather kept their insurance. If the mandate is lifted, no one knows for sure how many people will drop their coverage voluntarily and how many will have their insurance stripped against their will. The CBO figures do not drill down into the reasons that people will be uninsured -- just that they will be uninsured. Here’s CBO’s summary (look at the bottom line). See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Christine Eibner, a health policy analyst with the RAND Corp., said it’s "reasonable" to argue that the disenrollment from Medicaid would be voluntary, since price would not be a factor for beneficiaries. This would account for 1 million fewer Americans with insurance in 2019 and 5 million fewer in 2027, the bulk of them "voluntary." Eibner said it’s harder to guess about disenrollments from the individual market. (The individual market consists of policies purchased outside the employer-provided insurance market.) In previous research, RAND estimated that roughly two-thirds of disenrollment would stem from voluntary choices and one-third would be due to price increases. Other research has put the percentage at about 50-50, said Linda Blumberg, a health policy specialist at the Urban Institute. Cuomo did say "millions" rather than specifying CBO’s 13 million figure, and even on the lower end, estimates such as these could well produce "millions" of involuntary losses of coverage. But it’s worth remembering that there’s a lot of uncertainty in the numbers. Our ruling Cuomo said that congressional Republicans "want to take health care from millions of Americans in order to pay for" a tax bill. Cuomo has a point that Republicans would be able to increase the size of their tax cuts if they could count on a projected $338 billion in added revenue over 10 years, and ending the individual mandate would result in an estimated 13 million fewer Americans with health coverage by 2027. However, it’s worth pointing out that ending the individual mandate isn’t the same thing as stripping away health insurance away for a large number of Americans. While some would lose access to health insurance due to increased premiums, many others would drop their coverage voluntarily. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-15229	Wisconsin’s "rainy day fund" is "165 times bigger than when we first took office."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/aug/07/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-wisconsin-reserve-fund-165-times/	One of Gov. Scott Walker's talking points -- a claim about the size of Wisconsin’s budget stabilization fund -- is striking in seemingly contradictory ways. Here is how Walker phrased the claim Aug. 3, 2015 at a presidential candidate forum in New Hampshire: "Our rainy day fund's 165 times bigger than when we first took office." On one hand, "165 times" sounds like a huge increase. On the other, what was the size of the fund if it could be made 165 times larger? So let's dig in a little. To back Walker's claim, the governor's office cited two state reports. They show that the so-called rainy day fund was $1.68 million when Walker took office and now is $280 million. That's more than 165 times bigger. Some history The Wisconsin Legislature created the budget stabilization fund with a 1985 law. No significant deposits were made during the first 20 years of the fund’s existence, according to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state’s budget scorekeeper. But the 2001-’03 state budget added a requirement that whenever the state budget runs a surplus, 50 percent of the surplus must be transferred to the fund. So, a governor is required to put money in the rainy day fund whenever there is a surplus; it's not a voluntary act. At the same time, a governor can take some credit for there being a surplus in the first place. There have been three deposits to the rainy day fund as a result of budget surpluses since Walker took office in January 2011: Fall 2011: $15 million. That was a result of a surplus in the final budget of Walker’s predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. (The end of that budget, it should be noted, came at the beginning of Walker's term. So, adjustments and actions in the final six months under Walker helped lead to the surplus.) Fall 2012: $109 million. While that was the largest deposit to the fund in state history at the time, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel noted, it was only enough to run state government for about three days. Fall 2013: $153 million. Those deposits, plus interest earned, put the total in the rainy day fund at $280 million. In 2014, with another surplus projected, Walker proposed a combination of tax cuts and adding another $117 million to the rainy day fund. But the tax-cut legislation he later signed suspended the required contributions to the fund for the 2013-’15 biennium. (The state's fiscal year runs July 1 to June 30.) Had the requirement remained in effect, it would have meant another $113 million in the rainy day fund. Walker instead used the money instead to help cut taxes. Still, there’s no question the fund has grown significantly under Walker. Our rating Walker said Wisconsin’s "rainy day fund" is "165 times bigger than when we first took office." The $280 million currently in the budget stabilization fund is 165 times larger than the $1.68 million when Walker took office. Walker signed a tax cut law in 2014 that contained a provision voiding a requirement that would have put another $113 million into the fund. But that doesn’t change how much larger the fund is.. We rate Walker’s statement True. (Editor's note: After this item was published, a spokeswoman for Walker's gubernatorial office noted that the budget that resulted in the Fall 2001 contribution overlapped with Walker's time in office. The item has been adjusted to reflect that. It does not change the rating.)	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2015-08-07T12:00:00	2015-08-03	['None']

A story circulating on Facebook appears to offer a discount in exchange for taking a three-question survey about Walmart. Why? Because, the story says, the mammoth retailer is celebrating its 125th anniversary. First of all, Walmart was founded in 1962. So it’s at least 55, not 125. More importantly for Walmart fans, the offer is not real. Walmart spokeswoman Tara Aston confirmed the scam. "We care deeply about our customers and have procedures in place to help protect them from criminal behavior," she said. "We frequently review our educational and prevention measures and when necessary, take additional steps to better inform our customers about the dangers of scams." Walmart also clarifies on its website cases of fraud in which surveys are listed as potentially suspicious. A legitimate survey from Walmart is only taken on its official website. PolitiFact decided to test out the offer. When clicking on the survey link, we were notified that only 456 coupons remained. (That number didn’t change as we refreshed and revisited the page at different points.) The survey consists of three questions: Have you ever shopped at Walmart? You prefer Walmart because of? Are you satisfied by the services of Walmart? When we finished, we were asked to share the survey with our Facebook friends — the promised coupon never materialized. It wasn’t a bug. It’s just not real. Neither were free Delta and Southwest airline tickets. We rate this scam Pants on Fire.

pomt-08305	"Paul Workman wants to raise the sales tax."	false	/texas/statements/2010/oct/31/valinda-bolton/rep-valinda-bolton-says-paul-workman-wants-raise-s/	The run-up to Nov. 2 is full of frightful statements. For instance, a recent political mailer from Rep. Valinda Bolton, D-Austin, that casts GOP challenger Paul Workman as a vampire with a tax scheme that will suck your wallets dry. Flip the mailer over to see a picture of a Jack-O-Lantern bucket filled with money. "Paul Workman's scary sales tax: A treat for politicians and a trick on families." When Bolton's leaflet landed on our desks, we were already reviewing a similar statement from an earlier mailer. In it, Bolton says "Paul Workman wants to raise the sales tax" and that he "admitted that he supports a plan to raise the sales tax dramatically." Both ads cite a Sept. 9 Oak Hill Association of Neighorhoods (OHAN) forum where Workman and Bolton each spoke. When we asked Bolton to back up her statement, her campaign manager, Elizabeth Hartman, sent a campaign document citing both the Republican Party of Texas platform and Workman's remarks at the forum. The Bolton camp's document says that since Workman is listed as a Republican candidate on the Travis County Republican Party website and received campaign contributions from the Republican Party of Texas, "one can assume his positions are in alignment with his party's platform." According to the document, the Texas GOP's platform proposes to abolish the Internal Revenue Service, repeal the 16th Amendment — the one that allows Congress to collect income tax —and implement a national sales tax in place of all other federal taxes. "However, until such time that the income tax is abolished, we support deductions for private and home schooling, home mortgages and sales tax," the party's platform states. On the state level, the party supports abolishing "property taxes for the purpose of funding schools and to shift the tax burden to a consumption-based tax while maintaining or reducing the overall tax burden." The party opposes "all professional licensing fees and real estate and similar transaction fees or taxes," taxes on Internet sales and wants the state to repeal the revised franchise tax. Under the GOP scenario, until property taxes can be abolished property valuations should remain fixed for no less than three years following each revaluation. Currently, property is taxed based on its Jan. 1 market value. Bolton's take-away point: the platform "urges the elimination of property taxes and would have that revenue stream replaced by a consumption-based tax — in other words, a sales tax." From the OHAN forum, the Bolton camp's document quotes Workman saying: "We're not going to get an income tax in this state. It ain't gonna happen, so there's really only two ways to pay for schools. It's either going to be a property tax or it's going to be a sales tax... The only way that I would be in favor of a sales tax is if we eliminated property tax. But if you believe that the state of Texas is the one who is responsible for providing that free education, then the money needs to be collected to the state and then distributed to the school districts in some equitable basis." Workman then says that Texas would need to increase the sales tax by 5 cents for every dollar spent in order to replace the property tax system. The state sales tax is now 6.25 percent, though Texas cities, counties, transit authorities and special purpose districts can impose an additional local sales tax up to a total tax of 8.25 percent. The Bolton campaign's conclusion: "Mr. Workman gave an 'either or' scenario — property taxes or sales taxes... Workman would support his party's plan to reform school funding — to first eliminate property taxes and then to replace them with increased sales tax." On Oct. 19, Workman's campaign issued a press release responding to what it called Bolton's "intellectually dishonest attack." "Workman didn't advocate raising the sales tax at the OHAN forum," the release says. Eric Bearse, a consultant for Workman's campaign later cited another statement Workman made at the forum: "My position is that we will balance the budget by cutting spending," he said. "We will not raise taxes." Lastly, we reviewed an audio recording of Workman's Oct. 12 interview with Austin American-Statesman reporter Kate Alexander. In it, he says: "There's really in my mind only three ways to pay for schools. That's an income tax, a state sales tax, or the current system of property tax plus whatever state revenue. Because we're not going to have an income tax, and I don't know if you can get the people to buy off on a state sales tax in lieu of property tax, so it appears to me that we're liable to be just kicking the can down the road further with no real fair equitable solution to the problem." We'll stop kicking our own can to sum up what we've learned. The state GOP platform, in keeping with the so-called national Fair Tax agenda, advocates replacing current taxes with a national consumption or sales tax. (A bipartisan panel convened under former President George W. Bush estimated that such a scheme would require a sales tax of 34 percent or more.) While Workman doesn't seem to have distanced himself from his party's platform, he has indicated he has practical concerns — like getting "people to buy off on a state sales tax in lieu of property tax." True, going the GOP's preferred school-funding route would require a dramatic increase in the sales tax. Workman said as much at the forum attended by Bolton. He also said he'd favor such a change only if school property taxes were wiped out. Her statement ignores this critical fact, distorting Workman's position. We rate the statement as False.

pomt-05903	"The national debt is equal to $48,700 for every American or $128,300 for every U.S. household. It is now equivalent to the size of our entire economy."	true	/virginia/statements/2012/feb/03/randy-forbes/rep-randy-forbes-says-national-debt-comes-48700-pe/	U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes is sounding the alarm on the U.S. debt. "The national debt is equal to $48,700 for every American or $128,300 for every U.S. household," Forbes, R-4th, wrote in a January 24 blog post. "It is now equivalent to the size of our entire economy." Those are some eye-catching numbers, so wanted to see if Forbes was right. Forbes is referring to gross national debt -- which includes publicly held debt as well as the amount the government owes trust funds for Social Security and Medicare. The gross debt was about $15.2 trillion on the day the congressman made his statement, according to data from the U.S. Treasury Department. Joe Hack, Forbes’ spokesman, said the congressman used census data to break down the debt load to per-person and per-household shares. Hack referred us to the U.S. Census population clock, which continuously updates the estimated number of people living in the the nation. On Feb. 1, the clock showed the U.S. population was 312.9 million. When you divide the amount the U.S. owes creditors by the population, the national debt equals $48,686. So Forbes, rounding up, is right in saying the debt comes to $48,700 per person. Now, let’s turn to households. There were 118.7 million of them in the U.S. in March 2011, according to the most current Census Bureau estimate. Doing the math, that means the debt per household comes to $128,378 -- just above Forbes’ calculation of $128,300. Still, Forbes is comparing a January 2012 debt figure to a March 2011 household number. We found a sure-fire way to make an updated estimate. The Census 2012 Abstract of the United States shows that the size of the average household was 2.6 people in 1990, 2000 and 2010. So we divided 312.9 million (the Feb. 1, 2012 U.S. population tally) by 2.6, and arrived at 120.4 million households. That would equal $126,585 of debt per household at the of this month -- pretty close to the number Forbes cited. But if the debt comes $48,700 per person, does that mean each individual in the U.S. would end up paying that amount to make the nation whole? Bill Frenzel, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution, said the answer is no. The debt is owed by the U.S. government, which ultimately pays up through its ability to tax, said Frenzel, a former Republican congressman. "We as individual citizens will pay for that debt in quite differing amounts," Frenzel said. Frenzel, the former ranking member of the House Budget Committee, used multi-billionaire Warren Buffett as an example. The overall amount Buffett would pay in taxes would be much higher than Americans of lesser means, he said. Breaking down the debt by person and household creates a "gee whiz" number aimed at grabbing people’s attention, Frenzel said. "The problem is that $15 trillion is such a big number that it doesn’t mean anything to anybody," he added. Patrick Louis Knudsen, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, echoed that sentiment. But he said it would be better to measure debt not by its gross total, but rather by the amount of "publicly-held" debt. "That’s how much the government actually owes to outside entities," Knudsen said. On the day Forbes made his statement, publicly-held debt was about $10.5 trillion. Running the numbers again, that would equal to $33,470 per person or $87,023 per household. Economists have told PolitiFact in recent years that publicly-held debt as well as the gross national debt tally are each valid measures of the nation’s debt load. What about Forbes’ last contention -- that the national debt is equivalent to the size of the U.S. economy? Hack cited data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis showing that the average U.S. Gross Domestic Product -- the market value of all final goods and services produced -- was $15.1 trillion throughout all of 2011. That’s just below the total debt level of $15.2 trillion. The BEA data also shows that for the last three months of last year, the GDP came in at $15.3 trillion. Still, when talking about such large numbers, that’s roughly equal to the size of the national debt. Our ruling: Forbes said the national debt is equal to $48,700 per person and $128,300 per household. He also said the debt is equivalent to the size as the U.S. economy. On all three scores, he’s pretty much on target. We rate the claim True.	None	Randy Forbes	None	None	None	2012-02-03T11:18:04	2012-01-24	['United_States']
abbc-00256	The controversy over dual nationality that has engulfed the Australian Parliament since mid-July now involves at least seven politicians from the Government, the Greens and One Nation.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-08/fact-check-the-high-court-and-dual-citizenship-scandal/8874064	Contrary to Mr Dreyfus's claim, the situation is not cut and dried. In those cases the court said that for a person to be eligible to stand and be elected to Parliament he or she must take "all steps that could reasonably be taken to renounce" any foreign nationality or citizenship. Looking at the facts in isolation, Mr Joyce, Senator Canavan and Senator Nash did not meet that requirement, as all continued to be dual citizens after being elected. But the matter is not black and white: the court has not had to deal with a situation exactly like this one before. In the previous cases, the people in question were not Australians from birth and there was no dispute that they knew that they obtained citizenship of another country at some point in their lives. It is open to the High Court to completely overturn its existing interpretation of section 44(i). Alternatively, the court can add or clarify its existing interpretation to take into account these different circumstances. This is the position conveyed by the Solicitor-General and the legal representatives of Senator Canavan and Mr Joyce at a recent High Court directions hearing. Whether this would constitute a "change" to the existing position is up for debate.

pomt-09985	"Already we've identified $2 trillion in deficit reductions over the next decade."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/21/barack-obama/obamas-claim-deficit-depends-how-you-figure-number/	President Barack Obama says his 2010 budget is a responsible plan that will reduce the deficit. "Already we've identified $2 trillion dollars in deficit reductions over the next decade," Obama said in a speech at Georgetown University on April 14, 2009. Conservative columnist Charles Krauthammer called the $2 trillion number "transparently phony" and a "whopper," and we've seen similar criticisms elsewhere. So we decided to check it out. Keep in mind that the deficit is a number that reflects income minus expenses over the course of a single year. At the end of Bill Clinton's administration, the government had a few years of surplus, but since then it's been running a deficit every year. Each year's deficit gets tacked on to the growing pile of public debt. Obama's budget assumes the government's expenses will continue to exceed its income for the next four years. But it proposes policies that Obama says will make the deficit smaller. He claims the budget cuts the deficit in half over four years (a claim we found Mostly True ) and cuts deficit spending by $2 trillion over 10 years. When you talk about the deficit getting "smaller," though, you have to ask, "smaller compared to what?" The answer: smaller than it would have been without Obama's proposed changes. The reductions depend on looking 10 years into the future and comparing Obama's proposal with what we would have spent if we continued with current policies. These projected numbers of current policies are called the baseline. Obama's critics contend he's inflating the baseline. In particular, they say, Obama claims we would have spent a pile of money on "overseas contingency operations," which means the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Obama's budget then posits that he wouldn't spend that much money, and he totals up the savings at $1.6 trillion. The numbers get bigger the further into the future we go. In 2019, for example, Obama projects that he will save $187 billion than would have otherwise been spent on those "overseas contingencies." We asked the White House's Office of Management and Budget how it came up with its numbers, but we didn't hear back. We turned to several federal budget experts from across the political spectrum to see if they thought Obama was inflating the baseline. Absolutely, said Brian Riedl, a senior policy analyst with the right-leaning Heritage Foundation. "It's the equivalent to assuming an expensive vacation, then not taking it, and saying you've cut your family's budget," he said. "To claim savings off that baseline is ridiculous." The left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities also looked at the $2 trillion number and found it a bit inflated. Its research said a more realistic number for deficit savings was $900 billion, a little less than half of Obama's estimate. Calculating the baseline can be an honest difference of opinion, said James Horney, the center's director of federal fiscal policy. Obama's budget "does a different thing, but I can't say it's wrong," Horney said. Also, he pointed out, Obama's budget increases revenues by letting the Bush tax cuts expire on people who make more than $200,000 a year for singles or $250,000 for couples. The Obama budget document shows a deficit reduction of $636 billion over 10 years from those tax increases. Obama's critics don't mention his deficit reductions due to the tax increases, Horney said. "They don't tell you the next step, which is that he is still below current policy, because that is driven by ending the tax cuts that they support," he said. We found yet another interesting perspective from the Heritage Foundation's William Beach, the director of their center for data analysis. Beach said that the problem with Obama's budget is that he assumes he can reduce the spending on Iraq and Afghanistan at all. Beach thinks that's highly unlikely. "Everybody who has said we can reduce costs in Iraq has been wrong, whether on the left or the right," Beach said. "Everyone who goes in stays longer than they want to. It's almost like a budget trap over there." "Four years from now, Obama will be as intractably involved in Iraq and Afghanistan as he is today," Beach said glumly. "I hope I'm wrong," he added. So after hearing arguments from both sides, we agree with critics who say Obama is exaggerating his savings estimates. Even Sen. John McCain, Obama's opponent, said during the campaign that he would have brought home most of the troops in 2013 if elected president. So for Obama to estimate costs getting bigger and bigger for a full 10 years is a stretch. On the other hand, it's very difficult to say how much of a stretch it is — after all, we're talking about numbers based on predictions about complex military and global events. In one sense, Obama's statement is true. He has identified $2 trillion in deficit reductions. But presenting a budget figure 10 years out as a solid number is dicey. And people on both ends of the political spectrum say his numbers are exaggerated considerably. And we find it's significant that the estimate from the well-respected, left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities is less than half of Obama's. So we find Obama's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-13749	Unemployment numbers "are artificial numbers. These are numbers that are massaged to make the existing economy look good, to make this administration look good when, in fact, it's a total disaster."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/25/donald-trump-jr/donald-trump-jr-says-unemployment-rates-are-manipu/	Are the unemployment numbers being manipulated to make the Obama administration look good? That was the contention of Donald Trump Jr., son of the Republican presidential nominee, during the July 24 edition of CNN's State of the Union. Trump was making a point frequently made by his father — that the official unemployment rate is lower than it should be because it doesn't take into account the people who would like a job but have stopped looking. "The way we actually measure unemployment is after x number of months if someone can't find a job, congratulations, they're miraculously off," he said. "That doesn't count" in the calculation. "These are artificial numbers," Trump continued. "These are numbers that are massaged to make the existing economy look good, to make this administration look good when, in fact, it's a total disaster. ... Those are the people we want to put to work" He's correct that the widely-reported unemployment number doesn't capture the full employment picture. But for this check, we'll talk about whether the numbers are massaged to make the economy look better than it is. We've looked at the issue before with Donald Trump Sr. when he claimed the "real" rate was 18 to 20 percent (False) or may be as high as 42 percent (Pants on Fire). The unemployment rate is developed by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics based in part on data from interviews of about 60,000 households conducted by the Census Bureau As Trump Jr. indicated, it only includes people who have recently looked for a job. But that's the way it's consistently been done for decades. Alternative methods have their own limitations. Allegations of manipulation When we asked for evidence that the numbers are distorted for political reasons, Trump campaign spokesman Dan Kowalski referred us to a 2013 New York Post story alleging that the Census Bureau "faked" the sharp drop in the September 2012 unemployment rate just prior to the election that gave Obama a second term. The story's only identified source was a Census employee, Julius Buckmon, who told the Post that his superiors had told him to make up interviews that serve as the basis for the statistic. Two problems: Buckmon had left the bureau by 2012, and he told the paper he was never told to sway the statistic in favor of Obama. As we reported in 2013, even a worker who made up interviews wouldn't be able to pull enough statistical weight to significantly affect the unemployment rate for any month. A typical worker handles data from 35 to 55 of the 60,000 or so households surveyed. And the bureau routinely double-checks its findings by having households re-interviewed by a different person in an attempt to look for inconsistencies that might point to manipulation. The Office of the Inspector General at the Commerce Department concluded in May 2014 that there was "no evidence" that the numbers had been manipulated in the runup to Obama's reelection, especially when other sources confirmed the trend. The report said: "It would have taken 78 Census Bureau Field Representatives working together, in a coordinated way, to report each and every unemployed person included in their sample as 'employed' or 'not in labor force' during September 2012" to produce that kind of manipulation. Since then, unemployment has continued to fall. Artificial numbers? Other experts joined Baker in dismissing the younger Trump’s allegation about the standard unemployment rate. "The same basic definition of the unemployment rate has been used (with minor changes) going back almost all the way to World War II, under both Republican and Democratic administrations," said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution. "This measure has been consistently produced following the same basic methodology in the U.S. and copied around the world for over 50 years," said Tara Sinclair, an economist at George Washington University. And what about Trump's complaint that the numbers are skewed by not including people who have given up looking for work? Sinclair said the BLS tries to track that through a variation of the unemployment rate known as U-6, or the "underutilization" rate. This version includes people who have stopped looking for work but say they would start if the market improved, people working part-time because they can't get full-time work, along with the people included in the standard unemployment rate. By it's nature, the U-6 rate is higher. The June rate was 9.6 percent compared to the conventional unemployment rate of 4.9 percent. But that estimate has its limitations as well. It doesn’t count recent graduates who never entered the labor market in the first place because they feared there would be no jobs for them, and it doesn’t count people who chose to take care of their kids full-time, went back to school or retired early to avoid having to compete for a job. By that statistic, the economy is not as healthy as the conventional unemployment estimate would indicate. Casey Mulligan, professor of economics at the University of Chicago, said it's fair for the younger Trump to dispute the standard unemployment rate as an indicator of economic performance because the labor market has not gained the type of strength you would expect with the current unemployment rate. It's a question of which BLS data to use "rather than the competence of the BLS per se," he said. But Harvard University government professor Jeffrey Frankel said the important thing "is to be consistent across time in which measure you use. It wouldn't be right to switch from looking at the conventional rate to a measure that includes discouraged workers just because you don't like the incumbent president and want to make things look bad for him." Other experts were more blunt. Trump’s comment "is a reprise of the same nonsense his father floated a few months ago. It is yet another conspiracy theory that the Trumps have grabbed onto," said Neil Buchanan, a George Washington University law professor. The limitations of the unemployment number are well known, he said. "Everyone who reads an article in a decent newspaper about the employment picture each month reads about discouraged workers, part-time workers, and so on." "There are plenty of grounds for us nerd-types to complain about the accuracy of the BLS numbers," said Dean Baker, co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic Policy and Research in Washington. "No survey is perfect and there will always be issues with how a survey is conducted and questions are posed. But the idea that BLS cooks numbers is beyond ridiculous." Our ruling Trump Jr. said that unemployment numbers "are artificial numbers. These are numbers that are massaged to make the existing economy look good, to make this administration look good when, in fact, it's a total disaster." The economists with whom we spoke said Trump is wrong to question the integrity of the federal unemployment data. The method of developing the estimates have been used for decades, their limitations are widely recognized, other economic indicators have confirmed their reliability, and there's no evidence that they have been massaged for political purposes.

pomt-01551	"Over 40 of our 100 (House of) Delegates seats go uncontested every year, and over 40 percent of our state senate seats go uncontested every year."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2014/sep/14/robert-sarvis/sarvis-says-over-40-percent-virginias-general-asse/	Libertarian U.S. Senate candidate Robert Sarvis says the two-party system leads to a lot of one-candidate elections. In a speech at the Buena Vista Labor Day Festival, Sarvis said voters need more choices, particularly in General Assembly elections. "Over 40 of our 100 (House of) Delegates seats go uncontested every year, and over 40 percent of our state senate seats go uncontested every year," Sarvis said. With all General Assembly seats up for election next year, we put Sarvis’ statement to the Truth-O-Meter. Nicholas Cote, spokesman for the Sarvis campaign, said the claim was based on election data compiled by the Virginia Public Access Project. The records examine general elections going back to 1999 and show the number of uncontested statehouse elections. All seats in the 100-member House are up for grabs every two years. Cote accurately noted that in the last eight elections, an average of 49.75 seats House seats were uncontested. That would be in line with Sarvis’ proclamation that more than 40 House of Delegates seats are one-candidate elections. All seats in the 40-member Senate are up every four years. And Cote correctly noted that an average of 17.25 Senate seats were uncontested in the last four elections. That’s an average of 43 percent per election, Cote said, consistent with Sarvis’ claim. But Sarvis didn’t phrase his statement as an average. He said "every year" more than 40 percent of the seats in each chamber weren’t contested. So we have to look at each election year individually. Here are the number of uncontested seats in biennial House elections since 1999, according to returns from the state Board of Elections: 2013 -- 45 2011 -- 63 2009 -- 31 2007 -- 59 2005 -- 51 2003 -- 61 2001 -- 40 1999 -- 48 Sarvis’ claim that "over" 40 seats went uncontested each cycle doesn’t hold up for 2009 and -- because it’s our job to be sticklers -- in 2001. Here are the number of uncontested seats in quadrennial Senate elections since 1999: 2011 -- 14 2007 -- 17 2003 -- 19 1999 -- 19 Remember, the Senate has 40 members. Sarvis’ claim that more than 40 percent of the seats went uncontested each cycle sputters in the latest election, in 2011, when 35 percent the races had no competition. Virginia’s not the only place where a significant percentage of state legislature races go uncontested each election year. An October 2012 study from the College of William and Mary found that 39.7 percent of the 6,000 statehouse races across the country that year lacked competition between major party candidates. The study examined the 44 states that had legislative races that year. Virginia wasn’t included because it holds General Assembly races in odd-numbered years. The study said legislative redistricting -- in which lawmakers draw election maps and usually fashion safe districts for themselves -- discouraged competition for statehouse seats. That would carry over to Virginia, where lawmakers control redistricting, according to John J. McGlennon, a professor of government at the College of William and Mary who co-authored the report. McGlennon said another factor deterring competition is that Virginia’s statehouse races occur in years when there are no presidential or congressional races. That means down-ballot candidates for the state legislature can’t ride a coattail effect into office, he said. Our ruling Sarvis said "every year" more than 40 percent of House and Senate seats have only one candidate. Election figures generally back Sarvis. The only blip is that during a few years -- 2011 for the Senate, as well as 2009 and 2001 for the House -- the number of uncontested races didn’t quite hit the threshold Sarvis cited. His point is basically correct but could use some additional information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Robert Sarvis	None	None	None	2014-09-14T06:00:00	2014-09-01	['None']
pomt-10819	"The Republican governor who stood up and cut spending instead of raising taxes."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/21/mitt-romney/define-tax-increase/	This claim depends on your definition of a tax increase. As governor of Massachusetts, elected in 2002, Romney inherited a $3-billion state budget shortfall. And it's true that the budget problem was fixed without raising state income taxes. But Romney closed loopholes in the corporate income tax, which effectively increased taxes for some companies. And he and the legislature did increase a myriad of fees, on such things as boat registrations and court filings, which some might consider tax increases. Also, state payments to cities and towns for schools and police were reduced, which caused those local governments to increase property taxes. The Club for Growth, a conservative political action committee that pushes for spending cuts and tax cuts, evaluated Romney's fiscal record: "Overall, Romney's record on tax policy is mixed. His record is marred by questionable statements and positions and his fee hikes and 'loophole' closures are troubling." We will note that the Club for Growth applauded Romney for supporting broad-based tax cuts. We find his claim that he "cut spending instead of raising taxes" to be only half of the story about how he dealt with the state's financial crisis.

pomt-07047	Says that as a gubernatorial candidate, Chris Christie "promised no school cuts."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/01/stephen-sweeney/new-jersey-senate-president-stephen-sweeney-says-w/	Democrats and Republicans made many promises during the 2009 gubernatorial campaign, but did Chris Christie vow not to slash aid for the state’s public schools? State Senate President Stephen Sweeney claims he did. "The governor, who as a candidate promised no school cuts, was well aware that his draconian cuts to education were illegal," said Sweeney (D-Gloucester) in a May 24 press release following the New Jersey Supreme Court’s latest ruling on school funding. The court said the state had to send $500 million in additional funding to 31 urban school districts known as Abbott districts. PolitiFact New Jersey questioned Sweeney’s claim about Christie. As governor, Christie cut school funding -- he withheld $475 million in aid in 2010 and slashed $820 million in funding from the current budget.. But did he promise to maintain school funding during his campaign? We initially found some conflicting evidence, but then the governor admitted that he had made that promise. Derek Roseman, a spokesman for the Senate Democrats, sent us to two news reports to support Sweeney’s statement: an Asbury Park Press article dated Jan. 9, 2010 that said Christie "promised not to cut state aid to local school districts" and another report from the newspaper dated Oct. 14, 2009 that reported Christie "would keep local education funding flat for the year, saving the planned $500 million increase" in state aid. PolitiFact New Jersey searched newspaper archives and found more contradictory reports, some saying he would cut the aid; others saying he wouldn’t. The governor’s office did not return two requests for comment. The conflicting evidence had the Truth-O-Meter jammed, but the governor himself made a statement that tipped its scales. During a question and answer session on June 28, after the governor signed legislation overhauling public employee benefits, Christie responded to a question about a campaign promise not to change pensions for law enforcement officials. "When I got here I found circumstances to be different than the governor was characterizing them when I ran. When you are a candidate, what you are restricted to is what the current occupant of the office will tell you about the circumstances surrounding the fiscal state of New Jersey. Gov. Corzine told us that fiscal year '11 was going to be a $6 to $7 billion deficit. It turned out to be $11 billion," he said. "So, I made a lot of other promises. I also said that I wouldn't cut education aid in fiscal year 2011, but when a $6 or $7 billion budget deficit turns into a $11 billion deficit and you don't have the option to print money, you got to make a lot of decisions." Now, let’s return to Sweeney’s statement. Sweeney said Christie promised during his campaign that he would not cut school funding. The spokesman for the Senate Democrats provided conflicting evidence to support Sweeney’s claim and PolitiFact New Jersey found even more conflicting evidence in news reports. However, Christie himself recently said he promised not to cut school aid while he was a candidate. We can’t argue with that. We rate Sweeney’s statement True.

pomt-07346	During the Eisenhower Administration, "not a single soldier … died in combat."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/10/doris-kearns-goodwin/doris-kearns-goodwin-says-no-us-combat-deaths-unde/	During the May 8, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, historian and author Doris Kearns Goodwin offered a striking statistic about combat casualties under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Host David Gregory began the exchange by playing a video clip from Robert Kagan, a foreign policy scholar and commentator who has advised several Republican office-holders. "The American people," Kagan said, "have an interesting quality in their character which you can trace all through their history. They want their presidents to be men of peace, but they also want to know that, if necessary, the American president can kill." Gregory asked Goodwin whether she thought Kagan had a worthwhile point in analyzing President Barack Obama’s recent success in ordering the killing of al-Qaida mastermind Osama bin Laden. "I think that's right," Goodwin said. "I mean, think of two of our most lovable presidents, Theodore Roosevelt, what was his slogan? Speak softly and carry a big stick. This was a big stick. Eisenhower, having won World War II, could then take enormous pride in the fact that not a single soldier had died in combat during his time. So I think what happened in this thing is, it's not just the public perception of Obama that's strengthened now because he acted as commander in chief, but you never know what happens internally to a president when they take a risky thing and it works. JFK took control of his presidency after the Cuban missile crisis. This guy will now take control of his presidency. I think he's going to be able to trust his own judgment even more than the military, and that's huge psychologically. And America feels better again. I mean, that's the huge thing that we don't know about how long that will last. But our prestige and our sense of ourself is now heightened for a while, and everybody wants that." We thought we’d look into whether Goodwin was correct that "not a single soldier … died in combat" during the Eisenhower presidency. We knew that Goodwin’s claim had problems when we checked the starting and ending dates of the Korean War. It was an active conflict through the signing of a truce on July 26, 1953. Since Eisenhower was inaugurated on Jan. 20, 1953, he served as commander-in-chief for the final six months of the war. His presidency ended on Jan. 20, 1961. The final six months of the Korean war included a battle that became emblematic of the war -- the Battle of Pork Chop Hill. The battle produced many casualties at a time when the powers were negotiating an armistice, even though the battle was fought to control a topographic feature that had little inherent value. In his book The Korean War, Max Hastings wrote that the battle reflected both the "courage of the defenders and the tactical futility" of that stage of the war. How many casualties were there during those six months? We didn’t find any official government data with casualties separated by year, but we did find a private collection. The veteran-supported Korean War Project has a website that offers day-by-day casualty figures for the war. So we looked at the figures for the first six months of Eisenhower’s presidency and found 3,406 casualties. Casualties, however, include non-combat deaths and non-mortal wounds, not just combat deaths. So we took casualty ratios for the entire Korean War and determined that combat deaths accounted for 24 percent of casualties. Multiplying this percentage by the number of casualties produces 802 combat deaths during Eisenhower’s six months in charge. (The total for the war was almost 34,000.) The figure we came up with isn’t exact, but it seems safe to assume that combat deaths during that period numbered in the hundreds. In addition, Eisenhower was president during the start of U.S. involvement in Vietnam. At the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the National Mall, the names of the fallen begin with Air Force T-Sgt. Richard B. Fitzgibbon Jr., with a casualty date of June 8, 1956. The number of casualties in Vietnam remained much smaller than the number during the final part of the Korean War. The first battlefield fatality came in late 1961, almost one year into the Kennedy Administration. Eisenhower also presided over some small-scale military deployments in or near Taiwan, Lebanon and Cuba, and he was president during the Suez crisis of 1956. But we were unable to confirm any casualties for these events. Meanwhile, a lower-profile source of U.S. casualties stemmed from covert operations related to the Cold War. "Eisenhower ordered a wide array of covert operations against the Soviet Union and Communist China, including clandestine overflights of both countries, during his two terms, and some of those missions involved American deaths," said Lance Janda, a historian at Cameron University in Lawton, Okla. "The deaths were generally kept secret and did not occur during declared wars or major operations known to the public, and for that reason a scholar might argue they technically do not fall into the ‘combat death’ category. But I would find that line of reasoning extremely suspect. Eisenhower ordered Americans into harm’s way in support of the national interest, and their deaths therefore fall very clearly in my view under his responsibility as commander-in-chief." All this means Goodwin’s statement is incorrect. She’s "wrong, and not just technically so," said William W. Stueck, a historian at the University of Georgia. When we contacted Goodwin, she immediately acknowledged her error. "What I was reaching for when I talked was a more general point -- which is accurate -- that the general who had overseen major battles in a time of war was basically a man of peace during his presidency, thus fitting the idea that Americans love men of peace who can also kill," Goodwin said. "That would have been a better way of putting it!" Goodwin does have a point. After the shooting war on the Korean peninsula had ended -- a war that Eisenhower had inherited and which he ended within six months-- Eisenhower did preside over a relatively peaceful seven and a half years, particularly compared to his two immediate predecessors (Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman) and two of his three successors (Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon). "Eisenhower was extremely skillful when it came to foreign policy and military affairs," Janda said. "He was extraordinarily judicious in his application of American power, negotiating severe crises over Indochina in 1954, the Taiwan Strait in 1955, and Suez in 1956, which could easily have led to massive U.S. intervention and/or the use of nuclear weapons. He was also a powerful proponent of covert operations and diplomacy during one of the most difficult periods of the Cold War and the president who argued most forcefully of the dangers posed by the military-industrial complex. He should be celebrated for those achievements, but not by overstating the facts." We agree that Goodwin’s broader point is reasonable, and we appreciate her quick acknowledgement of error. Still, she made a pretty clear-cut mistake: Hundreds of combat deaths is a number vastly greater than saying that "not a single soldier had died in combat" under Eisenhower. So we rate her statement False.	None	Doris Kearns Goodwin	None	None	None	2011-05-10T12:02:53	2011-05-08	['None']

pomt-09887	Health insurance companies are "making record profits, right now."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/23/barack-obama/health-insurance-company-turned-profit-not-rec/	President Barack Obama has often argued that health insurance companies need more competition, and he's proposed a public option for health insurance to provide it. "There have been reports just over the last couple of days of insurance companies making record profits, right now," Obama said during a prime-time news conference. "At a time when everybody's getting hammered, they're making record profits, and premiums are going up. What's the constraint on that? ... Well, part of the way is to make sure that there's some competition out there." We wanted to know if he was correct that insurance companies are making record profits during one of the worst economic recessions on record. It seems likely that Obama was referring to the latest earnings report from UnitedHealth Group, one of the largest publicly traded health insurance companies. The day before Obama's news conference, UnitedHealth had announced unexpectedly robust profits that prompted the company to revise its annual earnings guidance upwards. There are many ways to look at a company's earnings, but Obama said "profits," so we looked at net income, which is revenue minus expenses. For the quarter, UnitedHealth earned $859 million. But that's not a record for quarterly net income. During the same period in 2007, for example, its net income was $1.23 billion. We reviewed the income statements of the other largest publicly traded health insurance companies — WellPoint, Aetna, Cigna, Humana and Coventry Health Care — and found similar trends. Generally speaking, profits were higher during 2007 and 2006, before the economy began its slide. So Obama's modifier "record" does not appear to be correct. Of these companies, only UnitedHealth has announced its second quarter earnings. Coventry Health Care is set to announce earnings on July 28; Aetna and WellPoint on July 29; Cigna on July 30 and Humana on Aug. 3. Still, UnitedHealth did make healthy profits, and we asked Steve Shubitz, a health care financial analyst with the investment firm Edward Jones, about it. "The profits are still significant, there's no question about that. But the reality is they're losing a lot of customers in this economy," Shubitz said. When companies lay off workers and the workers lose their health insurance, the insurance companies lose customers, and that's why UnitedHealth has seen declining enrollments, he added. If UnitedHealth only offered insurance to companies, "they would not have had a very good quarter because of the numbers of customers they've lost," Shubitz said. But UnitedHealth has diversified, and its business with the government health programs Medicare Advantage and Medicaid performed well, as did divisions that handle pharmaceuticals and health information technology. Shubitz added that the stock prices for health insurance companies are not as high as one might expect, because of impending efforts at health reform. "There are so many different possibilities of what can happen," said Shubitz, who also follows WellPoint and Aetna and has "hold" recommendations on all three. "A lot of this uncertainty is already priced into these stocks." Getting back to our ruling, we wonder if Obama was simply remembering a story he'd read in the paper that day and puffed it up a bit. One health insurance company did report unexpected profits. But it's not clear yet whether others will. And the profits UnitedHealth reported were not "record profits." We find his statement False.

pomt-14149	Missouri "is the state with the lowest paid workers."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2016/may/02/kiki-curls/missouri-state-senator-half-right-pay-states-worke/	Following a Missouri Senate Budget Committee hearing about Medicaid coverage, Sen. Kiki Curls claimed on April 4 that Missouri "is the state with the lowest paid workers." We decided to see how Missouri's workers compare to the rest of the country. Curls' office didn't respond to our requests for the background information behind her claim. We see three ways to read her words. She might be talking about all workers, just private sector workers, or possibly, just state government workers. We examined all three. All Workers The latest numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics show the average weekly wage for all workers in Missouri is $846. This number places Missouri 31st and well above the state with the lowest paid workers, Mississippi, where workers make an average weekly wage of $706. Private Sector BLS reports show that in Missouri the average weekly wage in the private sector is $851. The national average is $965 per week. This ranks Missouri in the bottom half of all states, but far from having "the lowest paid workers." Public Sector The BLS also reports the average weekly wages for state workers. In the third quarter of 2015, Missouri's state government employees made an average weekly wage of $803. This puts Missouri dead last of all the states. The national average weekly wage is $1,083 for state government employees, more than $200 over Missouri's average. Our Ruling Sen. Kiki Curls claimed that Missouri "is the state with the lowest paid workers." We don't know if she meant all workers, workers in the private sector or state government workers. For any analysis that includes private sector employees, Missouri ranks closer to the bottom than the top, but it does not rank last. Missouri does hold the distinction of having the lowest paid state workers, based on their average weekly wages. That's enough to make her statement partially accurate. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-02965	"About 47 percent of able-bodied people in the state of Maine don’t work."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/23/paul-lepage/maine-gov-paul-lepage-says-47-percent-able-bodied-/	Maine’s Republican governor, Paul LePage, has a history of making controversial comments, from telling the NAACP that the group can "kiss my butt" to charging that a Democratic legislative leader "claims to be for the people but he’s the first one to give it to the people without providing Vaseline." Recently, LePage made another comment that has attracted national attention. On Oct. 22, 2013, a blogger for the Bangor Daily News posted an audio clip from a speech LePage made in Falmouth, Maine. Here’s what the blogger wrote: "Informed that the event was wrapping up, LePage said he had two more points to make. The first was just one word: ‘energy.’ The second was, he said, in reference to ‘workforce development.’ "‘About 47 percent of able-bodied people in the state of Maine don’t work,’ said LePage. "On the recording you can hear a member of the audience ask, ‘What?’ LePage repeats himself. ‘About 47 percent. It’s really bad.’" The blog post inspired a flurry of media attention, in part because LePage’s comment echoed the one from the 2012 presidential campaign in which Republican nominee Mitt Romney said that 47 percent of the American people are "dependent upon government." Romney’s comment was widely considered a blunder that hampered his bid for the White House. But what about the substance of LePage’s remark? Was he correct that "about 47 percent of able-bodied people in the state of Maine don’t work"? The strength or weakness of Maine’s labor market isn’t out of the mainstream; the unemployment rate in August 2013 was 7.0 percent, putting it in a six-way tie for 22nd place nationally. We contacted LePage’s press office for supporting evidence, but no one responded. A spokeswoman for LePage did send Huffington Post a statement, saying in part that "the governor understands that not everyone who is dependent on taxpayer dollars is 'able-bodied,' but he does believe that everyone, regardless of their ability or physical condition, can contribute to society in a meaningful way." The Census Bureau found that Maine’s estimated population in 2012 was 1,329,192. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that in August 2013, Maine had 659,059 people employed. So by the roughest calculation, Maine had 670,133 people not working, or about 50 percent. This number would suggest that LePage is in the ballpark. But calling this a "rough" calculation is too kind. It’s actually a silly way of calculating it. First, doing it this way suggests that everybody -- no matter how old or young -- should be working. The numbers change dramatically if you exclude Maine residents up to age 18 and over 65 from the statistics. In 2012, Maine’s 18-to-64 population was 836,898. Using this as the denominator means that about 21 percent of Maine residents were not working. What about LePage’s reference to "able-bodied people"? The Census Bureau has estimated that in 2011, Maine had 101,000 people aged 18 to 64 who have a "health problem or disability which prevents them from working or which limits the kind or amount of work they can do." If you subtract this group, then there were 735,898 "able-bodied people" age 18 to 64 in Maine, and only 10 percent of them were not working. Finally, in August 2013, there were 49,966 unemployed people in Maine. These are people who have looked for work recently but have not found it. If you add these to the number of employed Maine residents, then just 3.6 percent of able-bodied Maine residents aged 18 to 64 are neither working nor actively looking for employment. That’s far off from the 47 percent LePage claimed. It’s possible to quibble about the specifications we’ve used, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. For instance, you could get a bit closer to LePage’s 47 percent figure if you counted 16- and 17-year olds or people up to age 74, who have been working in growing numbers in recent years. Still, Burtless said, "even if you tried to include all the ‘able-bodied’ Maine residents past 65 in your calculations, I'm pretty confident you'd find Gov. LePage's claim to be ridiculous." Our ruling LePage said that "about 47 percent of able-bodied people in the state of Maine don’t work." Unless LePage thinks newborns and nonagenarians ought to get off their tushes and find a job, this is a ridiculous claim. In reality, only about 10 percent of able-bodied Maine residents aged 18 to 64 aren’t employed. And if you include those who are actively looking for work but who can’t find a job in today’s poor economy, the figure drops as low as 3.6 percent. We rate LePage’s claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-05089	The transportation tax is regressive, and Emory University is "literally getting its own transit line at virtually no cost to itself."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/jul/02/georgia-green-party/transportation-tax-opponents-says-emory-gets-free/	Georgia voters will decide on a series of regional transportation plans in the July 31 primaries that could bring as much as $8.5 billion in new spending to metro Atlanta alone. The money would come from a special 1-cent sales tax dedicated to dozens of road, rail and other projects. The plan has a lot of support from the business community, but groups across the political spectrum oppose it. For example, the left-leaning Georgia Green Party has circulated a list of the "top ten lies" about the referendum, including a claim that the projects are giveaways to rich businesses and institutions at the expense of working people who would pay the "regressive" tax. The flier specifically mentions a proposed $700 million MARTA rail spur from the Lindbergh Center station to the Emory University campus. "Sales taxes [are] highly regressive, falling most heavily on low income consumers, much more lightly on higher income persons and almost not at all on big corporations and other wealthy institutions like Emory University, which is literally getting its own transit line at virtually no cost to itself," the flier claims. If the referendum passes, the 3.7-mile rail line is scheduled to be built along the Clifton Corridor around 2020. Hugh Esco, a member of the state Green Party committee, said the line is an example of the problem with using sales taxes to fund infrastructure projects. "We’re being asked to pony up ... to pay for this new construction," he said. "If there were no other mechanisms for raising funds, that might be appropriate." Esco said the rail line to Emory is an example of working-class people subsidizing a benefit for a wealthy institution. As a nonprofit, private university, Emory does not pay sales tax, so the university itself will not contribute to building the line. "This is insane to ask us to pay for this nonsense. This isn’t serving the general public," he said. Let’s split the Green Party claim into its two basic parts: -- Sales taxes are regressive and place a heavier burden on the poor. -- Because the line is built with sales tax money, big business and institutions such as Emory are getting something for nothing. Georgia State University economist David Sjoquist said the regressiveness of the sales tax depends on how you look at it. "Conventional wisdom is that if you look at annual income, people with lower income pay a higher percentage of their income in sales taxes," he said. In that sense, the Green Party is right that the sales tax is regressive. A 1 percent sales tax on groceries means more to a person making $18,000 a year than someone making $180,000 a year. The Green Party claims that big businesses pay almost no sales taxes. That’s not true. Sjoquist said businesses account for between 35 percent and 40 percent of sales tax collection in Georgia. "They buy a computer, a desk, food for parties, they pay sales tax," he said. "They are paying a share of this." But he said businesses have a choice when paying that tax to either eat it or pass that cost along. Except in highly competitive situations, sales taxes that businesses pay end up being passed down to the consumer in higher prices or to employees in lower wages, he said. Sjoquist said the inequities of the sales tax tend to flatten out over a consumer’s lifetime due to changes in how people of even modest incomes spend and save, but he said people typically don’t look at it that way. That gets to the Green Party’s second point: The proposed line to Emory is a freebie catering to a wealthy private university. While it may be true that Emory -- as an institution -- would not pay the sales tax (private colleges are specifically exempt), Douglas Hooker, executive director of the Atlanta Regional Commission, said another funding mechanism might make little difference. "Large institutions that are nonprofits tend not to pay any kind of tax, so this is no different," he said. But it is not true that Emory has nothing invested in the effort. Hooker said the university is a member of the Clifton Corridor Transportation Management Association, which funded the design of the rail spur. That design work costs money, but it is just a tiny fraction of the cost of building it. So, if Emory doesn’t pay into the sales tax, is it true the university would get its "own transit line"? According to a project fact sheet developed for the referendum, the line would have five stations with an estimated 10,300 daily boardings. Emory spokesman Ron Sauder said the line would serve people heading to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta, among other big employers. Emory is by far the largest of the employers in the corridor, plus it has more than 7,200 students in its undergraduate programs alone. Emory would likely claim a large share of the ridership on the rail line. But not all of it. Sauder said Emory already operates a shuttle bus fleet and subsidizes public transit fees for employees, but the line isn’t "just about Emory." ARC spokeswoman Julie Ralston said this: ""That’s the largest employment center in DeKalb County. Those are jobs that contribute to the livelihoods of people. It’s been part of an aspirational plan for a long time to have rail in that area." So where does that leave the Green Party’s two-barreled statement? There is general agreement that the sales tax is more of a burden on lower-income people than people with higher incomes, businesses and nonprofit institutions. But there is also evidence that the proposed rail line is not simply a paean to Emory University. Half the Green Party statement is true; the other half, not so much. We rate the Green Party claim Half True.	None	Georgia Green Party	None	None	None	2012-07-02T06:00:00	2012-07-02	['None']
pomt-02693	The Obama administration offered "no magic number" of people that needed to sign up for health care on the marketplaces.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/05/gene-sperling/obama-economic-adviser-gene-sperling-says-theres-n/	What botched rollout? That was so 2013. Talking points from President Barack Obama’s advisers are pointing to something new about Obamacare, something that sounds good: About 2.1 million people signed up for health insurance plans through the federal and state marketplaces. NBC’s Meet the Press host David Gregory posed a key follow-up question to Obama economic adviser Gene Sperling during the Jan. 5 show: Is the progress good enough for the administration to meet its original goal? "2.1 million have signed up. The goal is 7 million by March. How do you think you realistically get there?" Gregory said. "Well, first of all, there’s no magic number," Sperling said. "The key is to enroll as many people, have an exchange that’s working, have a stable exchange ..." "The secretary of Health and Human Services said that was success, 7 million by March," Gregory said. "I think success is having an ongoing, strong market," Sperling said. PolitiFact wanted to know: Is Sperling trying to rewrite the past by saying Obama had "no magic number" for the number of people that need to sign up for coverage by the end of open enrollment in March? (We offer a hat-tip to our friend The Fact Checker of the Washington Post, which recently visited this topic after White House health care adviser Phil Schiliro made a similar denial on MSNBC.) The 7 million mark There were at least two times Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, the official Obama appointed to oversee the agency in charge of implementing Obamacare, referred to 7 million as the mark. The number, though, didn’t come from her. The figure originated with the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes the impact of legislation. In February 2013, CBO estimated 7 million people would sign up for health insurance through the federal and state marketplaces starting in October through the end of March, the deadline to enroll and avoid a tax penalty. By 2024, enrollment in the marketplaces would be 24 million, CBO said. Sebelius offered cautious optimism about the target for enrollment in a June press briefing and pointed out the sheer size of the risk pool is not the only concern. "We're hopeful that 7 million is a realistic target and that we're going to be driving our efforts toward that kind of enrollment effort," she said. "And it's both about numbers and also hopefully getting a balanced risk pool." A Politico story covering her appearance opened with, "For Obamacare the magic number is 7 million." A leaked Sept. 5 memo from another high-ranking HHS official, Marilyn Tavenner, to Sebelius outlined the department’s month-by-month projections for enrollment. Drawing on the estimates from CBO, as well as "the experience of Commonwealth Care in Massachusetts, Medicare Part D, and conversations with employers, issuers and states," Tavenner wrote that she expected marketplace enrollment to start at a slow pace but ramp-up in December and March, the months with deadlines. Tavenner’s memo anticipated 3.3 million people to have enrolled by Dec. 31, rising to 7.066 million by March 31. Remember, the estimates and targets from CBO and Tavenner happened before healthcare.gov made its dysfunctional debut. That was not part of the equation. On Sept. 30, the night before the exchanges opened, NBC Nightly News aired an interview with Sebelius in which a reporter asked her, "What does success look like?" "I think success looks like at least 7 million people having signed up by the end of March 2014," Sebelius said. The next few weeks were not pretty, to say the least. The online federal marketplace wasn’t ready, with big kinks preventing lots of people from buying plans. Some people, like Wonkblog’s Ezra Klein, argued CBO’s estimates should be tossed because October and November were lost months. The Obama administration considers someone to be "enrolled" if they select a plan, not necessarily if they paid for it. Data is not yet available for people who paid a first month’s premium to their insurers. Couching it HHS and White House spokespeople directed us to recent statements by administration officials whose answers about the 7 million goal mirror Sperling’s. For example, senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said on ABC’s This Week on Nov. 3, "Well, that’s a goal that the CBO said is what they thought would happen. Our goal is to get as many people done as possible." The position, said HHS spokeswoman Joanne Peters, has been the mix of people is more important than the number. She pointed to Sebelius’ June comments and a late November post by Klein, who said White House officials told him as he reported a July story they defined success as "a function of the mix of people in the exchanges -- the ‘ratio’ -- rather than the number of people in the exchanges." The administration made plans for a marketing campaign aimed at signing up young adults who tend to be healthier and uninsured. A good health mix in each risk pool is crucial to control costs, and sick people who require more care "are most likely to sign up and do so early," said Gail Wilensky, an expert on the health care law who was the director of Medicaid and Medicare under President George H.W. Bush. At this point, we don’t know much background about the enrollees, such as health and payment status. Obama’s officials are not backtracking so much as they are "realizing that factors are coming into play that weren’t expected," said Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee University law professor who is an expert on the law. "I really think it’s still possible by March to get 7 million," Jost said, adding that it’s "meaningless" that there are not as many people signed up by the end of the year as once projected. Other experts, such as Stan Dorn, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, have been quoted as saying the federal marketplace will function properly even with as low as 2 million enrollees. "Everyone's been trumpeting this 7 million target," Dorn told USA Today. "I think they can fall well short of it and still be on their way to a very successful program." Our ruling Sperling denied the administration had a "magic number" for how many people it wanted to see enrolled through the exchanges for health insurance coverage. No one knows how many people need to sign up to make the health care law work. And Sperling has a point that the mix of individuals signing up is likely more important than the raw number. But the Obama administration has used a number -- 7 million by March -- in the past. There’s no denying that. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-11272	Says of disclosing his $20,000 speech about Syria, "there was no hiding. I released it."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2018/apr/26/dennis-kucinich/dennis-kucinich-said-he-didnt-hide-payment-syria-s/	When Dennis Kucinich amended his financial disclosure to show that he was paid by a pro-Syrian government group, it set off a firestorm in the Democratic primary for Ohio governor. Former Gov. Ted Strickland, who supports Kucinich’s main rival Richard Cordray, accused Kucinich of trying to hide the $20,000 payment. "The fact that Dennis intentionally omitted his ties to these despicable individuals speaks volumes, I think, and it shows he knew these relationships were problematic," Strickland said during a conference call with reporters arranged by the Cordray campaign. In 2017, Kucinich was paid by the Association for Investment in Popular Action Committees to give a speech in England at an event hosted by the European Centre for the Study of Extremism. The California-based association is the parent of the Syria Solidarity Movement, which says it takes no sides about Bashar Hafez al-Assad but appears sympathetic to the Syrian president. Kucinich disputed Strickland’s characterization that he hid anything in an interview with Cleveland radio talk show host Mike Trivisonno. "There was no hiding," Kucinich said April 10. "I released it," adding, "I released the information. There’s no hiding here. I’ve never hid anything in my life." Time for PolitiFact to weigh in. Did Kucinich hide who paid him for a $20,000 speech about Syria? Kucinich’s speech has become a hot topic in the crowded Democratic May 8 primary for governor. Kucinich was asked to amend his financial disclosure On his April 9 financial disclosure form, Kucinich listed "paid speeches." Ohio Ethics Commission Executive Director Paul Nick sent Kucinich an April 13 letter asking him to identify the source of the paid speeches. Most filers must list every source of income and briefly describe the services they provided, according to the instructions. Kucinich provided additional information to the commission showing that he was paid $20,000 by the Association for Investment in Popular Action Committees. He also wrote that he received $10,000 from Nexus Earth and $3,000 from author Marianne Williamson. Kucinich said he went beyond the disclosure requirements. "I instantly not only said who I spoke to but I also said what the amount was, which I wasn’t required to do," he said in the radio interview. The amount of income is only required in some cases, such as if they were providing services to a lobbyist. Kucinich said that he should have included who paid him on his first filing. "I made a mistake," he said. "It was an omission. It was an error, but it wasn’t deliberate." Syria Solidarity Movement appears pro-Assad Kucinich has said that the conference was about peace. He posted an abstract of his 2017 speech, in which he said the West can’t impose its will on Syria. "The Syrian people, who are not unanimous on the question of President Assad, are resolute in protecting their way of life, which includes free education and free health care, while supporting the Assad government from a military overthrow which would destroy Syria." Paul Larudee, a steering committee member of the Syria Solidarity Movement, told PolitiFact that it doesn’t support Assad or any candidate. "We have no position on whether Assad should remain in power, and neither should the U.S. or your organization or anyone who is not Syrian," he said. "This is for Syrians to decide without interference or outside pressure." The Syria Solidarity Movement tries to cast doubt that Assad used a chemical attack and suggests the majority of Syrians support the Assad government. It includes articles with headlines such as "Voices from Syria: Assad is Essential for Syria’s Unity & Security." It calls for the West to not intervene and accuses human rights groups such as Doctors without Borders and Amnesty International of false allegations about the government in Syria. Robert S. Ford, former ambassador to Syria during the Obama administration and a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute in Washington, told PolitiFact he is certain that the Syrian government used chemical weapons. Ford said the Syria Solidarity Movement appears to be"vehemently pro-Assad government, denying regime war crimes." "They are trying to discredit the harder-line opposition (secular and Islamist both) while recommending that the world accept the Russian-mobilized Succhi dialogue process," he said. "That process aims to keep Assad now in return for promise of reforms at some later date." Kucinich has faced criticism in the past for meeting with Assad in 2017. His spokesman said that he held "fact-finding missions to find a way to end the violence." While in Congress, he opposed entering into war in Iraq and other military incursions. In April, Trump ordered a missile attack on Syria following reports that Assad’s regime used chemical attacks. Kucinich criticized that attack, stating that it "puts the U.S. on a path of military escalation with Russia, which opens wide the possibility of further miscalculations, errors or accidents that can ignite a world war." Our ruling Regarding his $20,000 speech about Syria, Kucinich said, "there was no hiding. I released it." But Kucinich initially listed "paid speeches" on his campaign financial disclosure form with no further detail. When the Ohio Ethics Commission asked him to identify the source of payments, Kucinich provided the commission with a list of the entities that paid him to give speeches, including $20,000 from the Association for Investment in Popular Action Committees. So Kucinich initially omitted the information, but disclosed it when asked to do so by a state commission. He also admitted that he made an error by not initially disclosing the source of who paid him for the speech. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-09018	The company I created, Point Judith Capital, "is the only venture capital firm in Rhode Island."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jul/09/gina-raimondo/raimondo-says-hers-only-venture-capital-company-rh/	In her quest to become general treasurer, Democrat Gina Raimondo is stressing her Rhode Island roots and her financial experience. In a YouTube video available through her website, she talks about wanting to come back to the state to start a business. "I wanted to create a company, create a business, in Rhode Island. I could have chosen to put it elsewhere, but I wanted it in Providence. So I came home and created it. It's called Point Judith Capital, and it's the only venture capital firm in Rhode Island. I'm very proud of what we've built." Venture capitalists are people who raise money from entities such as private investors and public pension funds, and then invest it in start-up companies, hoping for a big return if those companies take off. It's a risky proposition, which is why there are not a lot of them around. But we thought Rhode Island had others besides Point Judith. So we called Richard G. Horan, senior managing director of the Slater Technology Fund, which also gives money to start-up companies. It turns out that there are other groups in Rhode Island that serve a similar function, but they are not truly venture capital firms in the strict sense, which supports Raimondo's claim. "There are others engaged in venture investment, but they have a different orientation," said Horan. Slater, for example, is publicly funded. It was created by the state in 1997 to stimulate the creation of new companies that focus on technology and is financed annually by the General Assembly. The Slater Fund typically invests up to a million dollars in "seed" money at the earliest stage of a company's development, with the expectation that a traditional venture capital firm, such as Raimondo's, will make a play to be involved in the company and provide the next round of funding. Another class, known as angel investors, also provides start-up money for promising businesses. They are represented in the state by the Cherrystone Angel Group. "They tend to be individual investors acting like investment clubs" and think of themselves as being in a separate class from venture capital firms, said Horan. Peter Dorsey, executive director of Cherrystone, agreed, explaining that his group, with 50 members, differs from a venture capital firm because it is not a committed fund, not professionally managed and doesn't have a paid staff. Finally, people often think of private equity firms, such as Providence Equity Partners, as being involved in venture capital, but they invest only in mature companies, he said. Providence Equity, for example, specializes in enterprises that deal with media, communications and information. So both Dorsey and Horan agree with Raimondo, who told The Providence Journal on Jan. 20 that she would quit Point Judith Capital if she is elected. Point Judith is "the one capital venture fund based here in Rhode Island," Horan said, adding that, "We need more. The Rhode Island entrepreneurial community would benefit greatly if other firms like Point Judith were established and operating here." So we rate Raimondo's claim as True.

pomt-09951	Judge Sotomayor has said "that policy is made on the U.S. Court of Appeals."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/26/republican-national-committee-republican/rnc-claims-supreme-court-nominee-sonia-sotomayor-s/	On the day President Barack Barack Obama announced Sonia Sotomayor as his Supreme Court nominee, many conservative opponents seized on a Sotomayor statement they say revealed her as someone who thinks judges make laws. While Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele struck a measured pose — saying Republicans would "reserve judgment on Sotomayor until there has been a thorough and thoughtful examination of her legal views" — the RNC also sent around a talking points memo to the press and hundreds of influential Republicans that claimed "Judge Sotomayor has also said that policy is made on the U.S. Court of Appeals." And Wendy E. Long, counsel to the Judicial Confirmation Network, called Sotomayor a "liberal judicial activist of the first order who thinks her own personal political agenda is more important than the law as written. She thinks that judges should dictate policy." The conservative blogosphere is full of similar sentiments, all based on the Sotomayor statement, "The Court of Appeals is where policy is made." So we decided to take a look at the context of Sotomayor's statement. It came during a presentation at Duke University in February 2005. Sotomayor was one of three judges who participated in a panel discussion for law students thinking about applying to be judicial law clerks. Snippets of Sotomayor's comments have been popular on YouTube; see the full, unedited video here (the pertinent part starts around the 43-minute mark). Sotomayor was asked about the differences between clerking for judges in the federal district courts as opposed to those in federal appeals court. "The Court of Appeals is where policy is made," said Sotomayor, a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. "And I know this is on tape and I should never say that because we don't make law. I know … I know. (some laughs) I'm not promoting it. I'm not advocating it. I'm … you know. Okay. (more laughs) "Having said that, the Court of Appeals is where, before the Supreme Court makes the final decision, the law is percolating. It's interpretation. It's application." So keep in mind the audience and the question here, said Tom Goldstein, a partner at Washington law firm Akin Gump and the founder of ScotusBlog, a widely read blog on the Supreme Court. Goldstein watched the full video, and simply sees it as Sotomayor noting that in comparison to district court judges, "there's more policy involved" in the appeals courts. "The truth of the matter is, in the court of appeals, they are dealing with gaps and ambiguities in the law," Goldstein said. There's a lot for judges to interpret. Appeals court judges often have to make a call when a statute is unclear. In a sense, the policy is set by those calls made by the judges, even if they don't want to. To use that one line from Sotomayor to paint her as an activist judge is misleading, he said. "She's not a sweeping visionary ideologue in any way," Goldstein said. "Conservatives who are genuinely concerned about the direction of the Supreme Court, they are sort of grasping at straws here. That's an awful lot to put on one sentence." David Garrow, a historian who follows the Supreme Court, agrees. There has always been two schools of thought on the role of judges, Garrow said: those who see the law almost as an academic exercise, trying their best to mechanically apply the law; and the legal realists, who believe interpreting the law involves making choices, discretion. "What she (Sotomayor) said there is simply the honest version of what any judge knows and realizes," Garrow said. But "you're not really supposed to acknowledge it on the record." It's unfair to extrapolate that comment to suggest Sotomayor would mandate policy, he said. "To anyone who knows the intellectual history of judicial decisionmaking, she's just being honest, not activist," Garrow said. In short, the quote in question is the first line of a larger discussion about the differences between clerking for a district court rather than an appeals court judge. And Sotomayor goes on to detail those differences. In full context, it's clear that she is making the point that there are more decisions about interpreting and applying policy at the appeals court level. To the extent that the RNC raises the point to suggest it means she would be an activist judge on the Supreme Court, we think that's misleading.

pomt-05158	"More than 43 percent of all food stamps are given to illegals."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/19/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-more-43-percent-all-food-stamps/	A reader recently sent us a Facebook post with "10 Illegal Alien Facts." One of them was that "more than 43 percent of all food stamps are given to illegals." We decided to take a look -- and quickly found the claim was preposterous. In March 2012, the most recent month for which figures are available, a total of 46.4 million people received food stamps, so 43 percent of that number would be slightly less than 20 million. For obvious reasons, the numbers of illegal immigrants is much trickier to track. However, the most widely accepted number comes from the Pew Hispanic Center, which estimated that there were 11.2 million illegal immigrants in the United States in 2010. So it’s mathematically impossible for more than 43 percent of all food stamps to be given to illegals -- there simply aren’t enough undocumented immigrants in the country to make the math work. Nor does the math work if you choose a month before the number of food stamp recipients rose due to the recession. In October 2008, there were 30.8 million recipients; 43 percent of that number is 13.2 million, which exceeded the total number of illegal immigrants at the time, 11.6 million. None of this even takes into account an even more basic reality: It is against the law for Illegal immigrants to receive food stamps and the government has a process to verify immigration status. Citizen children of illegal immigrants can qualify (there are 3.5 million, according to Pew) but that's not enough to make the math work. Is it possible some illegal immigrants receive food stamps anyway? Sure. But even if every single one somehow managed to fool the government, it still wouldn't be enough to account for the 43 percent. Our rating The first of the Facebook post’s 10 claims -- that "more than 43 percent of all food stamps are given to illegals" -- is ridiculously false. It isn’t mathematically possible given the number of illegal immigrants in the United States, and it ignores the fact that illegal immigrants can’t even receive food stamps legally. Pants on Fire!

pomt-10081	"And 100 percent, John, of your ads . . . 100 percent of them have been negative."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/dec/03/barack-obama/no-mccains-ads-havent-all-been-negative/	(Published Oct. 15, 2008) One of the more pointed exchanges between Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. John McCain in the third and final debate on Oct. 15, 2008, was over the topic of negative ads. Here’s how one exchange went: Obama: "And 100 percent, John, of your ads — 100 percent of them have been negative." McCain: "It’s not true." Obama: "It absolutely is true." (You can find the exchange on the YouTube version about 26:30 into the debate.) Obama appears to be cherry-picking the ads run during a single week — from Sept. 28 to Oct. 4 — during which the Wisconsin Advertising Project found "nearly all" of McCain’s ads were negative. That week, they found that 34 percent of Obama’s ads were negative. But McCain has aired many, many ads that were not negative. If you look at a report from the same organization on Sept. 17, they found that in the week after the conventions, for example, Obama aired a higher percentage of negative ads than did McCain (76 percent to 56 percent). In all, the Wisconsin Advertising Project has found that 73 percent of McCain’s ads have been negative, to date. That's far short of 100 percent. (It also found 61 percent of Obama’s ads have been negative.) That’s up for both parties from the 2004 election, when 64 percent of George Bush’s ads were negative, compared to 34 percent of John Kerry’s. So Obama might be right for one week, but he is way off for the overall campaign, when McCain's negative ads accounted for 73 percent. That's so far off that we find it Pants on Fire wrong.

pomt-06640	"$360 million of our tax dollars went straight to ... the Taliban."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/sep/15/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-says-360-million-taxpayer-dollars-wen/	Democratic ex-congressman Alan Grayson is talking about the Taliban again. The first time -- when he not-so-subtly compared his opponent in the 2010 election to the Taliban -- didn't work so well. See, previous paragraph (i.e., ex). But Grayson is back, preparing to run for Congress after losing to Republican Dan Webster. In an e-mail to supporters (subject line: "Iraq: I Did My Part") on Sept. 1, 2011, Grayson wrote about the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, which released its final report on prevalent waste and fraud among taxpayer-paid contractors in those countries. The bipartisan commission determined the U.S. government lost between $31 billion and $60 billion to waste and fraud as a result of ineffective oversight of contract spending. Grayson elaborated in his e-mail: "In fact, $360 million of our tax dollars went straight to ... the Taliban. Wow. Who could have imagined that? Well ... me." The rest of Grayson's note details how he revitalized a Civil War-era law that allows people to file lawsuits in the name of the federal government, a move that attracted attention from the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN and Wall Street Journal (he included links). He wrote that he voted against the wars, was a vocal opponent of them while in office and provided breakdowns of the war's toll on taxpayers. His point? He did something against the wars. But did he also make a false claim? Of all his figures, his statement that the United States sent $360 million "straight to the Taliban" was the most striking. It didn't take long to turn up what he was talking about. Grayson was referencing an Aug. 16, 2011, story by the Associated Press that preceded the commission's in-depth report. The AP reported that an investigation by a military task force found that $360 million in taxpayer money meant to strengthen Afghanistan's economy ended up going to "the Taliban, criminals and power brokers with ties to both." It happened through a process called "reverse money laundering." The AP explained it like this: American money starts out clean as it is given to companies hired by the military for transportation, construction, fuel and other projects. But the funds become "tainted" -- landing in the hands of crime groups and the Taliban -- either by direct payments or through the network of subcontractors. The Taliban and insurgent groups only reaped a "small percentage" of this $360 million, an anonymous Kabul-based military official told the AP. Most of the money was lost to profiteering, bribery and extortion by criminals and power brokers. About half of the lost money stemmed from a large transportation contract called Host Nation Trucking, comprised of eight prime companies that hired nearly three dozen subcontractors to transport supplies to U.S. troops in Afghan bases. Those subcontractors then paid off insurgents or warlords who control the roads. The task force found that one of the prime contractors, HEB International Logistics, made direct payments to "malign actors," the designation given to the network of corrupt Afghan government and business officials, criminals and insurgents. The work of the military task force ran "parallel" with the research of the wartime contracting commission, commission spokesman Clark Irwin said. But the military's findings have not been publicly made available (at least as far as we can tell). The wartime contracting commission's report, however, is a publicly available document. That report does not peg a specific dollar figure on moneys lost to the Taliban and other criminal groups. It notes, however, that extortion of U.S. transportation and construction project money is the second-largest source of revenue for insurgent groups, behind the drug trade (pages 73-4). From the report: "In Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. funds have been diverted to insurgents and warlords as a cost of doing business in the country. In Afghanistan, insurgents, warlords, or other groups control or contest parts of the country. They threaten to destroy projects and harm personnel. The Commission finds it particularly alarming that Afghan subcontractors on U.S.-funded convoys, road construction, and development projects pay insurgent groups for protection." We asked the member of the commission who wrote that excerpt and an expert on the issue, University of Baltimore government contracting professor Charles Tiefer, for his opinion on Grayson's statement. There was no unclassified amount for money diverted to the Taliban until recently, Tiefer said, but the $360 million figure is credible based on information he gained while on a trip to Kandahar in March and the commission's conclusions. "That figure is consistent with it being the insurgent's second-largest funding source," he said, noting that finding a precise number would be nearly impossible. Tiefer went on to compliment Grayson, saying he "was among the first lawyers to discuss publicly the scale of contracting waste in Iraq -- I never talked to him but I read what he had to say -- so, I think he has more right than most congressmen to pronounce on this issue." Grayson, reached by e-mail, said he received further information on the subject from military briefings during his time in Congress, congressional delegation trips and several whistle-blower clients who worked for contractors in Afghanistan, "none of which, unfortunately, I am allowed to share with you, except to say that the figure is corroborated," he wrote. Here's what we know: Grayson correctly quoted a figure from a national story about U.S. money being diverted to "the Taliban, criminals and power brokers with ties to both." A member of the Commission on Wartime Contracting -- and an expert in the field of government contracting -- found this information credible based on extensive research. But Grayson's statement comes with two minor caveats. He said that tax dollars went "straight to ... the Taliban." The process is actually more complicated and involved a type of money laundering. And the money went to bad actors other than the Taliban in some cases. Those are noteworthy clarifications and enough to rate Grayson's statement Mostly True.

pomt-05894	"Since ObamaCare and the stimulus passed, the unemployment rate in the U.S. has increased."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/06/pete-koekstra/debbie-spend-it-now-ad-pete-hoekstra-errs-unemploy/	On Feb. 5, 2012, former Rep. Pete Hoekstra -- a Republican seeking to unseat Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich. -- released an ad titled "Debbie-Spend-It-Now." The ad quickly attracted public attention for its use of a young Asian woman thanking Americans, in broken English, for helping to boost the Chinese economy. The ad directed viewers to a website that provided additional statistical details. One of the claims on the site is that "since ObamaCare and the stimulus passed, the unemployment rate in the U.S. has increased." We decided to see whether that claim was correct. The stimulus was the first of the two bills to be signed into law -- on Feb. 17, 2009. That month, the national unemployment rate stood at 8.3 percent. Meanwhile, the health care law was signed on March 23, 2010. During that month, the national unemployment rate was 9.8 percent. And in the most recent month for which figures are available -- January 2012 -- the unemployment rate stood at 8.3 percent. So, since enactment of the stimulus three years ago, the unemployment rate has -- after a rise and then a decline -- remained at exactly the same rate. And since the health care legislation was passed, it has fallen by 1.5 percentage points. We should note some fine print. The source for the claim on the website is "Bureau of Labor Statistics, Accessed 1/23/2012" -- a time before the latest decline in the unemployment rate. The rate on that date was 8.5 percent, but it dropped to 8.3 percent by the time the ad aired on Super Bowl weekend. Using the December figure makes the comparison for the stimulus correct, though the comparison for the health care law still would have been incorrect. Either way, though, it’s not the current figure. Our ruling Neither time span offered in Hoekstra’s website checks out, based on the unemployment rate on the day the ad first aired. One shows that the unemployment rate is the same now as it was when the stimulus passed (although it went up in the interim). The other shows that the rate has fallen since the health care law passed. We rate the statement False. EDITOR’S NOTE: After we published this story, a reader asked us to evaluate Hoekstra’s claim from the perspective of Michigan, where he’s running for Senate. So we did. In February 2009, when the stimulus was signed, unemployment in Michigan was 12.0 percent. In March 2010, when the health care bill was signed, the rate was 13.3 percent. In December 2011 -- the most recent month available -- the rate was 9.3 percent. So the declines in unemployment over both time spans were actually steeper in Michigan than they were nationally. We are keeping our rating at False.	None	Pete Hoekstra	None	None	None	2012-02-06T14:53:08	2012-02-05	['United_States']

pomt-08422	"Ted Strickland destroyed Ohio jobs when he busted the budget."	false	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/19/john-kasich/kasich-ad-puts-all-states-budget-woes-job-loses-st/	Republicans have made jobs the central theme of the campaign, and "400,000" -- an aptly titled TV ad from GOP gubernatorial candidate John Kasich -- dutifully delivers its refrain: "Under Ted Strickland as governor, Ohio has lost nearly 400,000 jobs." PolitiFact Ohio earlier rated that claim as Half True. We found it did not reflect the larger economic backdrop of a national recession and a steady loss of Ohio jobs since January 2000. We found the claim broke down at the suggestion that the governor, or any one official, is responsible for the job losses. But the pitchman in "400,000," a burly fellow with a white hardhat tucked under his arm, goes a step further. He says: "Ted Strickland destroyed Ohio jobs when he busted the budget and raised our taxes to help pay for his mistakes." That's a mouthful. PolitiFact Ohio bit off a piece of it earlier, when we examined Kasich's charge that Strickland raised taxes on Ohioans, a charge the Democratic governor has vehemently denied. Strickland says he didn’t raise taxes -- he only froze the final year of a five-year, 21-percent income tax cut that started in 2005. That move, narrowly approved by the Republican-controlled Ohio Senate, saved the state approximately $840 million. Strickland insists the only alternative was to cut the money from primary and secondary education. But there are no guarantees that the tax cut will be unfrozen next year. Taxpayers, who had to pay more in income taxes for 2009 than they had expected, may continue to pay at the higher rate. That’s why PolitiFact Ohio rated Kasich’s statement as Mostly True. But what about the first part of the statement, which we take up now. How did the governor destroy Ohio jobs? What does "busted the budget" mean? And what were Strickland's "mistakes"? We asked the Kasich campaign. This was the answer from press secretary Rob Nichols: "He tried to fill the $850 million hole with slot machines and racetracks. And that didn't work. So he reneged on his pledge not to raise taxes, to the tune of $840 million, in a recession, in the worst economy since the Depression." That still didn’t tell us what "busted the budget" means, or how Strickland busted it. Ohio law requires the state budget be balanced, and the governor shares authority and responsibility for it with the General Assembly. A share of the blame for the $850 million shortfall, or hole, can be pinned on Republicans, who were in power in the General Assembly while spending increased seven consecutive budgets while taxes were cut. House Speaker Armond Buddish, a Democrat, recently chided Republicans for not paying for their tax cuts, a claim PolitiFact Ohio found Mostly True. Democrats, he said, "made the cuts that Republicans wouldn’t" slicing almost $2 billion from the current $50.5 billion general revenue fund budget. Strickland did propose installing slot machines at horse racing tracks, a plan he said would have brought the state almost $1 billion. That plan -- which the legislature agreed to put in the budget bill -- was killed by a lawsuit from a group of conservative activists called LetOhioVote. That doesn't make the plan a mistake. It still could be adopted. When lawmakers draft a new two-year budget next year will have to find some source of revenue, or chop programs. They won’t have nearly $5 billion in one-time money that helped balance the current budget. Finally, the claim that Strickland destroyed Ohio jobs amounts to political hyperbole. Ohio and other industrial states all hemorrhaged jobs when the economy hit the skids, and the causes of the recession are much broader than just the state’s budget woes. So where does that leave us? The ad pins all of Ohio’s budget woes on Strickland, when no one person is responsible for the state’s budget. As governor, Strickland must work with the legislature to get a budget approved. The bottom line is that the budget wasn’t busted, it was balanced. The ad labels an effort to fill the budget hole via slot machines at Ohio’s horse tracks as a mistake by Strickland, although the legislature went along with the idea. The ad pins Ohio’s job losses on the governor, claiming they were a result of those state budget woes. We rate Kasich’s claim that "Ted Strickland destroyed Ohio jobs when he busted the budget" as False. Comment on this item.

pomt-14808	"More black babies are aborted in NYC than born."	true	/texas/statements/2015/nov/25/cynthia-meyer/cynthia-meyer-says-more-black-babies-are-aborted-n/	During the first Democratic presidential debate in October 2015, Hillary Clinton proclaimed, "We’ve got to be committed to getting every child to live up to his or her God-given potential." Cynthia Meyer, who took up the post of deputy press secretary for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton in early 2015, fired back with a tweet, "Would help if they had the chance to be born." About a month later, in the next Democratic debate Nov. 14, 2015, the episode was repeated. Clinton echoed her earlier comment, again declaring, "Every single one of our children deserves the chance to live up to his or her God-given potential." This time, Meyer responded by tweeting, "More black babies are aborted in NYC than born," followed by the hashtag #blacklivesmatter. NYC meaning the city of New York. The pair of exchanges elicited a strong sense of deja vu, but Meyer’s second tweet raised a more specific question about abortion rates among black women in the Big Apple: Are there more abortions by black women in NYC than births? To our inquiry, over email Meyer said her responses were an effort to highlight the value of human life and call attention to NYC’s "startling" numbers, which come from a 2013 report on pregnancy outcomes compiled by the city’s Department of Health and Mental Hygiene’s Bureau of Vital Statistics. The numbers have been widely reported by conservative media outlets, including a National Review article that Meyer emailed to us. "To be clear, that tweet came from my personal Twitter account and I was speaking as a private citizen," Meyer said in an email. "Happy to defend the stats, though." Abortions by black women in NYC outpacing births? Figuring out the answer to this question proved rather simple. The first place we went was that 2013 report, the most recent data available, which provides exhaustive breakdowns of birth statistics in New York City. The agency lists pregnancy outcomes by race and ethnicity, as well as by borough, type of birth (live birth, C-section, premature) and health of the mother. According to the report, in 2013 black women accounted for 29,007 terminated pregnancies, representing almost 42 percent of all abortions in the city. That same year, black women in the city gave birth to 24,108 babies. With abortions surpassing live births by nearly 5,000, African American women in the city clearly terminated pregnancies more often than they carried babies to term. Black women terminated pregnancies at a rate of 67.3 per 1,000 women ages 15 to 49, a rate far higher than any other racial or ethnic group. We checked: the statistics were similar the previous year, when African American women in the city had 24,758 births and underwent 31,328 abortions. The numbers for black women in NYC starkly contrasted with women in other racial and ethnic categories. In 2013, births far surpassed abortions for white, Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander women. Hispanic women accounted for the second-most abortions in the city with 21,555, but they also had 35,581 live births. Asian women had both the fewest abortions and fewest births, while white women accounted for the most births overall and second-fewest abortions. There was less discrepancy between the number of births and terminated pregnancies for black women statewide. In 2013, black women in New York state gave birth to 36,130 babies and underwent 34,960 abortions, according to the state’s health department. During the previous year, the numbers were almost dead even, with black women accounting for 36,905 births and 36,633 abortions across the state. The numbers are far different for the four biggest cities in Texas. The Texas Department of State Health Services reports births by both county and city, but abortions are only reported by county. We examined the numbers in 2013 for Bexar, Dallas, Harris and Travis Counties, which contain the cities of San Antonio, Dallas, Houston and Austin, respectively. In all four counties, black women had more live births than abortions. The same was true for white women in those counties. For Harris County, which includes Houston, the largest city in Texas and fourth-largest city nationwide, black women had 12,569 live births and 5,515 abortions, while white women accounted for 16,247 births and 2,661 abortions. If you’d like to peruse the numbers for all four counties, we input the data into a Google spreadsheet for easier side-by-side comparison. It’s important to note that abortion access across the state of Texas stands in stark contrast to NYC. Texas currently has 19 operating abortion clinics, but that number would drop to 10 if the U.S. Supreme Court allows the state's contested 2013 law to fully take effect. In contrast, New York state has 80 abortion clinics. Attitudes toward abortion also differ greatly between the two states. Nationally in 2009, black women had abortions far more often than white and Hispanic women, according to data compiled in December 2013 by the National Center for Health Statistics. For some perspective, an online search turned up a 2008 Guttmacher Policy Review article by Susan A. Cohen, a vice president for the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and abortion rights. Cohen, saying the national abortion rate for black women is almost five times the rate for white women, suggested this is greatly explained by higher incidences of unintended pregnancy among African American residents. Higher rates, Cohen wrote, "reflect the particular difficulties that many women in minority communities face in accessing high-quality contraceptive services and in using their chosen method of birth control consistently and effectively over long periods of time. Moreover, these realities must be seen in a larger context in which significant racial and ethnic disparities persist for a wide range of health outcomes, from diabetes to heart disease to breast and cervical cancer to sexually transmitted infections (STI), including HIV." In examining the socioeconomic factors behind this phenomena, Cohen disputed the idea that black women are recruited into having more abortions, a sentiment that has been shared by anti-abortion activists and conservative politicians. These issues were also extensively explored last September by Zoe Dutton in a piece for The Atlantic called "Abortion’s Racial Gap." GOP leaders have used these statistics to argue against abortion, positing that it disproportionately affects black communities. In August, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson articulated this stance in relation to Planned Parenthood, claiming during an appearance on Fox News that the organization has contributed to abortion being "the number one cause of death for black people." The leading causes of death for black Americans are actually heart disease, cancer and stroke, according to the CDC, but Carson’s rhetoric speaks to the GOP’s broader stance against abortion. The debate over abortion has taken on more fervor in recent years as many states have introduced increased abortion restrictions. Texas has led in this area, in 2013 enacting a law requiring abortion clinics to adhere to the standards of surgical centers and employ doctors with admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic. In November 2015, the Supreme Court agreed to hear a case challenging the constitutionality of those two provisions as undue burdens on women seeking abortions. Our ruling: A Hillary Clinton declaration that every child should be allowed to live up to his potential prompted a tweet from a spokeswoman for Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton that "More black babies are aborted in NYC than born." The tweet from Deputy Press Secretary Cynthia Meyer echoes what has become a talking point among anti-abortion activists, that abortion disproportionately affects the nation’s African American population. Nationally, African American women had a higher rate of abortion than whites, Hispanics or Asians, according to 2013 figures. Even so, black women gave birth more than they terminated pregnancies that year. The same was not true for New York City, where more abortions were recorded for black woman than live births in both 2012 and 2013, the most recent available data. We rate this claim True. TRUE -- The statement is accurate and there's nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. CLARIFICATION, 4:20 p.m., Dec. 1, 2015: We amended this fact check to clarify that the described 2013 abortion rate for black women related to women aged 15 to 49.

pomt-08617	"Kasich’s trade deals cost Ohio thousands of jobs - 49,000 jobs to Mexico, 91,000 to China."	false	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/21/ted-strickland/gov-ted-strickland-ties-ohios-job-losses-john-kasi/	Gov. Ted Strickland's re-election campaign hasn't wavered from the message that his Republican opponent, John Kasich, cost Ohio jobs when he was a congressman by supporting the North American Free Trade Agreement and overseas trade deals, especially with China. A Strickland TV ad, "Truth," sticks to the theme with claims that have been posted on the campaign's website: "Kasich’s trade deals cost Ohio thousands of jobs - 49,000 jobs to Mexico, 91,000 to China." The ad says voting for NAFTA, which took effect in 1994 and eliminated most trade barriers between Canada, Mexico and the United States, cost the state 49,000 jobs to Mexico. It says 91,000 Ohio jobs were lost to China because of Kasich’s vote in 2000 to normalize trade relations with China. We wondered if the effect of the trade deals on jobs was so clear-cut - and if the numbers can be determined so specifically. Calculating job losses and gains is not a simple matter of counting heads. The ad's estimate of job losses tied to NAFTA comes from a 2006 study by the Economic Policy Institute, a pro-union think tank that has long been critical of NAFTA. The study did not, however, claim to count actual job losses. Extrapolating from employment, census and trade data, it estimated how many jobs might have been supported by production that the study says was "displaced" by growing U.S. trade deficits with Canada and Mexico. There are other complications. The nonpartisan General Accounting Office said that job losses were overestimated, because some NAFTA imports displaced imports from other countries instead of production in the U.S. Both the Congressional Budget Office and the Congressional Research Service concluded that factors other than NAFTA caused the widening trade deficit with Mexico. And the Congressional Research Service, evaluating studies by the Congressional Budget Office, the World Bank, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and the U.S. International Trade Commission, found that none attributed changes in employment levels to NAFTA. The estimate of jobs lost to China carries virtually identical problems. The figure also comes from EPI, through a study published this year. It also is based on "displaced production" resulting from trade imbalance, and not on a tally of actual job losses. Further clouding the estimate is the effect that other economic policies and forces - including product dumping, price controls and currency manipulation - have on the trade imbalance. The effect of normalized trade relations cannot be isolated. Kasich did vote for NAFTA in the House of Representatives in 1993 and for normalizing trade relations with China in 2000. Labeling them as "Kasich’s trade deals," as does the ad, is a stretch, though. The Clinton administration supported NAFTA, and 102 Democrats joined Republicans voting for the agreement, which the House approved 234 to 200. Clinton also fought for the Chinese trade bill, which the House passed with 164 Republican and 73 Democratic votes. Strickland, who was also in Congress, voted against both measures. So in the end, here’s what we’re left with: The ad makes claims about jobs lost, but relies on studies that didn’t actually count jobs that were lost. The estimates in those studies of what might have been displaced are affected by factors beyond NAFTA and trade with China, making it virtually impossible to measure the specific impact of either agreement on Ohio. The ad labels NAFTA and the Chinese trade bill as "Kasich’s deals," although he was just one of many members of Congress to vote for them, and both received support from Democrats and Republicans.

pomt-14139	"Seven hundred thousand. That’s how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage….Now Florida is adding one million jobs, not losing them."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/may/04/enterprise-florida/florida-agencys-misleading-attack-californias-mini/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott is not on board with the minimum wage increase in the sunny, oceanside state — of California. As Scott toured the West Coast for the second time attempting to attract businesses, Enterprise Florida (the state’s public-private economic development arm) ran radio ads in San Francisco and Los Angeles attacking California’s $15 wage and trumpeting Florida’s superior job prospects. "Seven hundred thousand. That’s how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage," the ad says, as the Miami Herald reports. "Ready to leave California? Go to Florida instead — no state income tax, and Gov. Scott has cut regulations. Now Florida is adding 1 million jobs, not losing them." California Gov. Jerry Brown didn’t take this lying down, penning a letter welcoming Scott back to California, "a state that in the last year has added more jobs than Florida and Texas combined," and not-so-subtly suggested Scott worry about more pressing matters back home. "Rick, a fact you’d like to ignore: California is the 7th largest economic power in the world. We’re competing with nations like Brazil and France, not states like Florida," Brown wrote on May 2. "If you’re truly serious about Florida’s economic well-being, it’s time to stop the silly political stunts and start doing something about climate change – two words you won’t even let state officials say. The threat is real and so too will be the devastating impacts." Here, we’ll look at Scott’s claim that California will lose almost as many jobs as Florida will gain. The ad is comparing California's projected employment with Florida's past performance — an apples-to-oranges comparison. It also distorts what the 700,000 jobs-lost figure actually refers to. Even with the wage hike, California is expected to gain more jobs than Florida over the next decade, albeit not as many as without it. Furthermore, all the economists we spoke with cautioned against pinning a figure to the minimum wage hike’s impact on employment in California. All that glitters in Golden State jobs A spokesperson for Scott cited a post by American Action Forum, a self-described center-right policy institute, as the source of the 700,000 lost jobs. But the figure doesn’t refer to a decline in the total number jobs in the state, as the ad suggests. Rather, it’s the difference between the number of jobs that California could have gained without and with the wage hike. California will gradually increase the current $10 hourly minimum wage to $15 by 2022. According to the institute's labor market policy director, Ben Gitis, that will lead to a 3.5 percent decrease in employment growth or about 692,235 jobs by 2026 that could have been added if the wage did not increase. Gitis walked us through his math. He used the California Employment Development Department’s latest 10-year forecast, which projects that the state will add 14.9 percent or 2.3 million more jobs from 2012 to 2022. Gitis then calculated the impact of the minimum wage hike; he concluded that California would see its projected 2026 jobs numbers reduced by 3.5 percent. In other words, California would have added about 3.4 million new jobs from 2012 to 2026 without the hike, but 2.7 million with it. So the state isn’t so much "losing" 700,000 jobs as "forgoing" them, said Jeremy West, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who co-authored the Journal of Human Resources study Gitis used for his calculations. Bright employment outlook in Sunshine State Scott’s office forwarded us a press release that says Florida has added more than a million jobs since 2010, a claim that PolitiFact Florida rated Mostly True. But Scott was talking about future projections for California, so we’ll look instead at the number of jobs Florida will gain in the same time frame as Gitis’ analysis. From 2012 to 2026, Florida is actually projected to add more than a million jobs. The increase, however, will still be less than California’s. (We would be remiss to not mention that California’s cost of living is higher than Florida's and its population size is almost twice as big. But as Enterprise Florida touted raw employment numbers, we’ll follow suit.) Florida added about 552,000 jobs from Dec. 2012 to Dec. 2015. According to the Florida Dept. of Economic Opportunity, the state will gain 1.1 million more jobs from 2015 to 2023. That’s a compounded annual growth rate of 1.5 percent, equal to about 445,000 new jobs from 2023 to 2026. Put it all together, Florida will add 2.1 million jobs from 2012 to 2026. That’s still 600,000 fewer jobs than California will add in the same time frame with the $15 wage. Waging in uncharted waters As we have previously reported, there’s a great amount of debate over the effect that minimum wage hikes have job growth. A spokesperson for Brown forwarded us academic and think-tank studies showing that past increases have had little or no effect on employment. California’s hike, however, is so unprecedented that past research may be less relevant. All the experts we spoke with suspect it will reduce employment. "An increase the size of California’s is outside of the experience of any state over the last four decades," said Jonathan Meer, a Texas A&M University economist and co-author of the study Gitis cited. "A dramatic increase in the minimum wage like California’s will undoubtedly reduce employment. However, I would be very cautious about putting any precise figures on the amount." Two home-state economists — Jeffrey Clemens of the University of California, San Diego and David Neumark of the University of California, Irvine — agreed that the huge wage hike will likely cause job losses, but the magnitude is uncertain. "The recently passed minimum wage increases are sufficiently beyond the range of historical experience that I do not think it is possible to predict their effects on employment with any precision," Clemens said. Neumark added that Scott’s job-poaching mission is nonetheless ill-fated, given that the flow of jobs into or out of California is typically miniscule and the jobs most affected by hike (low-skill jobs in the service and agricultural sectors) are hard to move out of state. "Maybe a few low-wage manufacturers will move. But there's no reason to expect they'd go to Florida more than many other low-wage states or overseas, so I suspect the employment growth in Florida from California’s minimum wage increase would be negligible, and statistically undetectable," Neumark said. "So Gov. Scott is probably wasting his and his Florida taxpayers' time." Our ruling A radio ad by Enterprise Florida said, "Seven hundred thousand. That’s how many California jobs will be lost thanks to the politicians raising the minimum wage….Now Florida is adding 1 million jobs, not losing them." This is misleading. The 700,000 figure refers to the number of jobs California could have added by 2026 if it didn’t increase the minimum wage, not a decline in net employment. Based on projections, California will still gain more jobs with the minimum wage increase than Florida during the same time frame. While experts agreed that a $15 wage will reduce employment in California, they said it’s near impossible to pin a number on the impact given how unprecedented the hike is.

pomt-13481	Says Ron Johnson gave himself a $10 million 'sweetheart corporate payout'	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/sep/09/russ-feingold/did-ron-johnson-approve-10m-bonus-himself/	Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson has touted his private-sector experience in his 2016 re-election bid, just as he did in 2010. But it’s a big final payday his opponent wants you to remember. Russ Feingold invoked the matter in a campaign ad in June. Then again in early July. And again in late July. The central claim in all three is that Johnson gave himself a $10 million payout when he left his Oshkosh manufacturing firm after winning the 2010 election. The ads imply there’s something shady about the payment, particularly one launched June 14, 2016. Black and white images of Johnson, the U.S. Capitol and cash fill the screen as a narrator ominously states: "Before Sen. Johnson left for Washington, he gave himself $10 million, a sweetheart corporate payout." Was such a payment made, and, if so, is there anything questionable about it? Let’s dig in. Johnson’s $10 million At issue is money Johnson received shortly before taking office in 2011. It came to light in a federal Financial Disclosure Report that listed the payment as compensation from Pacur, the company he helped found and bought in 1997. Johnson told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s Dan Bice in 2011 the payment was back pay for serving as CEO the previous 13 years, as he had not taken a paycheck since purchasing the company. Johnson sold most of the company in 2010 and stopped active involvement in its operations, though he retains a 5 percent stake, according to campaign spokesman William Allison. Johnson hasn’t gone into much detail on the nature of the payout, saying at the time, "It's a private business. I've complied with all the disclosure laws, and I don't have to explain it any further to someone like you." The column noted the pay didn’t appear to be part of a pre-determined compensation package. Johnson described the payment in 2011 as an "agreed-upon amount," then acknowledged the person who agreed to it was the owner — himself. Allison said Pacur followed "followed standard business practices to settle the account and independently calculate the back pay (Johnson) was owed as a result." He said the payout was reviewed as part of a routine IRS audit and the IRS "took no issue with it." Allison declined to elaborate on the process by which the $10 million amount was decided and approved. So Johnson received $10 million. Does that make it a "sweetheart corporate payout" as the ad claims? That’s a pretty subjective description, but it implies there was something special or unusual about the amount. When considered as back pay, the $10 million works out to about $770,000 per year. That would be a "fairly typical" compensation package for an owner and CEO of a company the size of Pacur, according to a blog post last year in Plastics News. The trade publication does an annual executive pay study for the plastics industry, though it noted it had to estimate the size of Pacur since the private company does not release sales information. David Walker, a professor and executive compensation expert at Boston University School of Law, said that annual amount "doesn’t seem implausible," for someone in Johnson’s position, since many owners of small businesses take out most of the profits as compensation. But like other experts contacted by PolitiFact Wisconsin, Walker said it’s hard to put the amount in context since Pacur is a private company, so we don’t know key factors like its size, profits and other executive compensation. The timing of Johnson’s payment is also noteworthy, though it’s not directly addressed in any of Feingold’s ads. The original column points out the $10 million payment came on the heels of a campaign where Johnson spent $9 million of his own money. Critics said the payout looked like an attempt to circumvent federal regulations and have the company pay for Johnson’s campaign. Corporations are not allowed to contribute directly to federal or state campaigns, and they can’t give money to a candidate for the express purpose of reimbursing campaign costs. The Federal Election Commission never issued a public finding regarding the payment to Johnson. A group claimed to have submitted a complaint last year, but an FEC spokeswoman said it the agency never received it. Election lawyers told Bice in 2011 that Johnson likely didn’t violate any election laws, and proving otherwise would have required a written agreement or other direct proof of a prior plan to reimburse campaign expenses. Such proof never surfaced. Our rating In a recent TV ad, Feingold claims Johnson gave himself $10 million in a "sweetheart corporate payout." The amount is accurate, and Johnson did essentially give it to himself since he acknowledged he was the one to approve it. But there’s no evidence to show this payment was unusual or out of line, as the tone and use of the "sweetheart" descriptor imply. An industry trade publication said the amount is reasonable given Johnson’s role and longevity. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/00cdbff3-5150-48b7-bcf4-12e5fdd5fc83	None	Russ Feingold	None	None	None	2016-09-09T10:30:00	2016-06-14	['None']

pomt-01786	Oregon "is the most trade-dependent state in the nation"	false	/oregon/statements/2014/jul/25/john-kitzhaber/oregon-most-trade-dependent-state-nation/	Gov. John Kitzhaber’s first debate with Republican challenger state Rep. Dennis Richardson covered a lot of ground, with both candidates spending considerable time on economic issues. Their exchanges made clear that the economy will continue to be a pivotal issue as the campaign heads toward the November election. The claim: Kitzhaber, a Democrat seeking a historic fourth term in office, touted his job-creation work and said his policies have helped stabilize the state’s budget. Looking ahead, he said, the state has untapped gold in the form of international trade possibilities. Then Kitzhaber added this: "We are the most trade-dependent state in the nation." PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. The analysis: We called Christian Gaston, a policy adviser for the governor’s campaign. He was sitting in the front row at the debate and said the claim caught his ear as well. In a subsequent email, Gaston said, "The governor misspoke. He meant to say that Oregon is one of the most trade-dependent states in the nation." The latter claim is one Kitzhaber has made before, Gaston said. His email included a YouTube link to an interview in December 2013 in which the governor does say "is one of" the most trade-dependent states. For context, we looked at where Oregon ranks. "Determining trade dependence is extremely difficult," said Robert Whelan, an economist with ECONorthwest, a Portland-based company that provides economic analyses and professional consulting services to public and private entities. "It’s one area that cannot be absolutely checked." For instance, Whelan said, Oregon exports about $1.6 billion worth of chemicals a year, much of that in soda ash and potash. "Most people would see that figure and say, ‘Wow,’" Whelan said, "‘where’s the chemical factory?’ Well, there isn’t any. It’s mined elsewhere, brought in by rail and shipped. But it shows up as an export." All of the products made at a Boeing plant near Gresham, on the other hand, are hauled to Seattle, where they are finished and shipped. Those are counted as Washington exports, not Oregon. Still, Whelan said, "there’s no way to say we are the most trade-dependent, but we are certainly one of them." The value of exports from Oregon to foreign countries this year will be about $19 billion, a figure that ranks 23rd among the 50 states, according to International Trade Association statistics. A trade study released in 2010 by the Portland Business Alliance ranked Oregon seventh nationally in the share exports hold -- 12 percent -- of the state’s economy. A more recent study prepared for the same group indicates that nearly 80,000 jobs in Oregon are directly tied to exporting goods and services, with one in four manufacturing jobs in the state being export-related. Those same numbers are far larger in states that dwarf Oregon in terms of population. But according to the Portland Business Alliance’s study, Oregon exports ranked seventh on a per capita basis in 2013. The ruling: Gov. John Kitzhaber, in a debate with Republican challenger Dennis Richardson, claimed that Oregon is "the most trade-dependent state in the nation." A spokesman said Kitzhaber has previously said that Oregon "is one of" the most trade-dependent states in the U.S. If he had said that, we would have reached a different ruling. As it is, we find Kitzhaber’s claim False. Thoughts on this ruling?

pomt-01771	The Obama administration's policies "have reduced minority dropout rate by 25 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/29/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-obama-policies-have-cut-minority-dr/	During a recent address in Las Vegas to the NAACP, Vice President Joe Biden touted the Obama administration’s role in helping students who are members of racial and ethnic minority groups. Calling the right to vote central to so many other human needs, Biden asked, "How else, were it not the right of all those folks to vote, do you think we would have been able to expand Pell grants for 2.5 million more students? How else would we have put in place the educational policies that have reduced minority dropout rate by 25 percent?" We wondered whether minority dropout rates have fallen by one-quarter during President Barack Obama’s tenure and, if so, whether it’s fair for the administration to take credit in a significant way. Before we look at the numbers, we should explain that there is more than one way to measure dropout frequency. One of the most common is the "status dropout rate," which measures, at a specific point in time, what percent of people within a certain age range are dropouts. The other measurement is called the "event dropout rate." This measures what percentage of people in an age range dropped out during the prior year. The different methods can lead to different figures. In addition, we should note that the data is not entirely up to date. The Education Department has released data on the status dropout rate through 2012, and on the event dropout rate for two specific years, 2008 and 2011. We’ll use the most recent data, but it isn’t a perfect fit for studying the entire Obama era. Using the status dropout rate, Biden is right on the numbers. For African-Americans between the ages of 16 and 24, the status dropout rate declined from 9.9 percent in 2008 to 7.5 percent in 2012. That’s a 24 percent decrease -- very close to what Biden said. For Hispanics, the rate declined from 18.3 percent to 12.7 percent over the same period -- a decrease of 31 percent, which is well above what Biden claimed. The data is somewhat more mixed if you look at the event dropout rate for 15-to-24 year-olds. Between 2008 and 2011, the dropout rate for African-Americans fell from 6.1 percent to 3.8 percent, or a decrease of 38 percent. For Hispanics, however, the decrease was smaller than the 25 percent Biden cited -- the rate fell from 4.9 percent to 4.1 percent, or a decline of 16 percent. So on the numbers, Biden isn’t perfect, but he’s pretty close. What about whether the administration deserves credit for the decline? On an Education Department Web page, the administration cites a number of policies it credits for reducing the dropout rate. The list includes competitive funds such as the Race to the Top, Promise Neighborhoods, and Investing in Innovation programs; an initiative that give states more flexibility to target schools most needing improvement; and programs like Ladders of Opportunity and Promise Zones that provide federal assistance to "communities of concentrated poverty." The administration says it has committed $6.2 billion to School Improvement Grants focused on roughly 2,000 persistently low-achieving schools, "which produce a disproportionate number of the more than 500,000 students who drop out of high school each year." Education experts we contacted said such efforts may well have made a difference. But they added that there’s a long list of factors that likely played a role as well. "While the educational policies put in place by the Obama administration have played their role in addressing the dropout crisis, it would be unfair to attribute the recent decreases in minority dropout rates solely to them," said Jennifer DePaoli, education advisor at Civic Enterprises, a research group that studies education. Here’s a rundown of the other factors that likely influenced the decline in dropout rates, according to experts: Policies instituted by George W. Bush President George W. Bush spearheaded and signed the No Child Left Behind Act, and there’s evidence that it has had an impact on dropout rates. While the decline in dropout rates has accelerated under Obama, the decline actually began under Bush. Between 2000 and 2008, status dropout rates fell by 24 percent for African-Americans and by 34 percent for Hispanics -- significant decreases on their own, even before Obama took office. Changes in policy "can take a while to trickle down, and we might be seeing a delayed and ongoing effect of policies from several years earlier," said Christopher Swanson, vice president of Editorial Projects in Education, which publishes Education Week. "If you look at the overall trend, things have been moving in the right direction for a while." State policies matter, too -- not just federal policies Not only can states pass their own education laws, but they often have some discretion in shaping how federal education policies take effect within their borders. "If Biden is right that national policies are driving things, you wouldn’t get a lot of state-level differences in dropout trends," said David Bills, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Education. "But in fact there are differences." Indeed, a study by Civic Enterprises, America’s Promise Alliance, the Alliance for Excellent Education and the Everyone Graduates Center at John Hopkins University found quite a bit of variation. Twenty states recorded annual gains of at least one percentage point in graduation rates between 2006 and 2010, the report found, while nine states saw flat or declining graduation rates over the same period. In fact, one problem with trusting the statistics too much is that the state numbers may be subject to bureaucratic hijinks, said Julian Vasquez Heilig, a University of Texas professor of educational policy and planning. In Texas, for instance, there’s been skepticism about the validity of statistics showing large shifts in the number of students going from in-school to home-school status. Home-schooled students, as it happens, don’t count in dropout calculations. "Only politicians believe that the dropout rate has gone down," Heilig said. "Ask any educator in an urban schools and they will tell you otherwise. Essentially, we find ways to define away students." A poor economy can keep more kids in school One of the perverse impacts of a weak economy is that it may lead to lower dropout rates. During a strong economic period, slack labor markets may lure teens away from school through job offers and higher wages. But during weaker economic periods, someone who drops out of school would face few employment options. That might be enough to keep a lid on the dropout rate. "Kids are more likely to stay in school when there are no job opportunities," Bills said. "I think economics generally trumps policy." Broader demographic factors can drive dropout trends, too Richard Murnane, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, cites several trends beyond the Great Recession that may have helped lower the dropout rate over the last decade or so. One is a decline in the teenage birthrate, which means that fewer high-school girls are dropping out to take care of a newborn. Another is a decline in arrests of teenagers for violent crimes, reducing another reason for dropping out. And a third is an increase in the number of children attending preschool -- a predictor of future academic success, especially for low-income boys, Murnane said. "There’s no causal evidence that can tell you the relative importance of these factors in explaining the trends" in dropout rates, Murnane said. In all, then, these experts don’t doubt that there’s been some impact from Obama administration policies, but they add that there are many bigger forces that can claim a share of the credit for lowering dropout rates. "It would be nearly impossible to point to any specific federal policies put in place by the Obama administration -- or the Bush administration, for that matter -- that have been directly responsible for the decrease in dropout rates and the increase in graduation rates for minority students," DePaoli said. Our ruling Biden said Obama administration policies "have reduced minority dropout rate by 25 percent." He’s very close on the numbers, and the administration can take some credit for the decline. But a lot of other factors likely played a role, from Bush-era policies to state-level action to larger forces such as the weak economy, falling teen birth rates and rising preschool enrollment. On balance, we rate Biden’s claim Half True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2014-07-29T12:20:06	2014-07-23	['Barack_Obama']
