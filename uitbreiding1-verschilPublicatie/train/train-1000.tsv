pomt-03627	"Six out of 10 of the highest unemployment rates are also in so-called right to work states."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2013/may/06/chris-redfern/ohio-democratic-party-chairman-chris-redfern-ties-/	When a couple of Statehouse Republicans prepared to introduce bills to make Ohio a "right to work" state last week, Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern lost no time going on the attack. Hours after Reps. Ron Maag and Kristina Roegner sent letters to House colleagues seeking co-sponsorship for what they called "Workplace Freedom" legislation, Redfern sent out a fundraising email saying such laws were "controversial, confusing, and wrong for workers and the middle class." "Six out of 10 of the highest unemployment rates are also in so-called right to work states," he wrote. PolitiFact Ohio thought we'd check. According to the National Right to Work Legal Defense Foundation, 24 states have passed some form of right-to-work law. (The exact provisions can vary; generally they ban public and private employers from forcing workers to join or pay dues to unions or other employee organizations.) They are Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Nebraska, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, South Carolina, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Wyoming. For unemployment data, we went to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, the nation's official source for unemployment statistics. Its most recent numbers are the preliminary figures for March 2013. The states with the highest unemployment rates, from the bottom up, were Nevada, Illinois, Mississippi, California, North Carolina, Rhode Island, New Jersey, Indiana, Michigan and (tied) South Carolina and Georgia. Six of the 10 are right-to-work states -- or, including the tie, 7 of the 11. But there is a question about causation vs. correlation -- whether right-to-work status produces lower or higher unemployment. Two of the right-to-work states are relatively recent. Indiana (where similar legislation was passed in 1957 and repealed in 1965) in February 2012 became the first state to adopt right-to-work status since Oklahoma a decade earlier. Michigan followed in December 2012. Of the 10 states with the lowest unemployment rates, eight were right-to-work states. Of those, as we noted in an earlier check, seven states -- North Dakota, Nebraska, South Dakota, Iowa, Utah, Wyoming and Oklahoma -- are from the Great Plains and the Mountain West, which in general were less hard-hit during the recession. So Redfern's statement about 6 of the 10 states with the highest unemployment rates is technically accurate. But it is misleading because it implies a cause-and-effect relationship that is bogus. We rate it Half True.	None	Chris Redfern	None	None	None	2013-05-06T06:00:00	2013-04-30	['None']
pomt-09611	"No Democratic campaign for (Fla.) governor has ever had these kinds of resources this early on in an election cycle."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jan/15/alex-sink/floridas-alex-sink-says-2009-fundraising-tops-for-/	Florida's leading Republican candidate for governor, Bill McCollum, is bragging that he raised more money in the last three months of 2009 than any other candidate running for the state's top elected post. That produced some crowing in response from Alex Sink, the major Democratic candidate. Sink raised more than $5 million in cash and check contributions in 2009, state campaign finance records show. "No Democratic campaign for governor has ever had these kinds of resources this early on in an election cycle, proving what a strong position our campaign is in going into 2010," Sink campaign manager Paul Dunn said on Jan. 6, 2010. We wanted to see if Sink, the state's chief financial officer, has built a war chest so large it's unusual for Florida Democrats. The state Division of Elections maintains an online database of campaign finance information for candidates going back to 1996. The online database covers gubernatorial elections in 1998, 2002, 2006 and 2010. We searched the years prior to each election to see if anyone matches or comes cl ose. Sink's 2009 total -- not including in-kind donations -- was $5,050,000. There were two leading Democrats running for governor in 2006, former U.S. Rep. Jim Davis and former state Sen. Rod Smith. Davis reported raising $1.65 million in 2005; Smith reported a total of $1.26 million in cash and check contributions. That's a little short of $3 million combined ($3.3 million when adjusted for inflation), way short of Sink's haul. Davis ultimately won the party's nomination, but was defeated by Republican Charlie Crist. In 2002, the two frontline Democrats were former U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno and Sink's husband, lawyer Bill McBride. Reno raised $570,000 in the year ahead of the election; McBride raised $743,000. McBride won that primary, but lost in November to incumbent Gov. Jeb Bush. The Democrat in 1998 was Lt. Gov. Buddy MacKay, who was trying to hold the governor's mansion following Lawton Chiles. MacKay raised $1.57 million the year ahead of the election. MacKay lost to Bush. We also checked back to the 1994 gubernatorial election, the last time Democrats won in Florida. Chiles raised a total of $2.7 million in private donations for that campaign, the St. Petersburg Times reported. That's worth nearly $4 million in today's dollars, but Chiles' total includes contributions made in the year prior and year of the election. Sink, on the other hand, still has 11 months of fundraising ahead. Prior to 1994, eclipsing $5 million a year before the election was inconceivable. Sink clearly has benefited by being the only major Democrat running for governor. She's also campaigning at a time that simply requires candidates to raise more money. Yet the $5 million Sink raised in cash and check contributions in 2009 is more than what Jim Davis and Rod Smith raised in 2005, combined. It's also more than what her husband, McBride, and Reno raised a year ahead of the 2002 election. MacKay in 1997 and Chiles in 1993 don't come close, either. We rate Sink's statement True.

pomt-06704	Says Ron Paul insisted FEMA should be shut down.	true	/texas/statements/2011/sep/03/maureen-dowd/maureen-dowd-says-ron-paul-insisted-closing-fema/	Commenting on the federal response to Hurricane Irene, New York Times op-ed columnist Maureen Dowd wrote Aug. 30, 2011 that Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul’s scorn of government is "so great that he doesn’t even want it to coordinate (relief) in natural disasters." Dowd’s column says next that the Texas congressman insisted the Federal Emergency Management Agency, "which (Paul) calls ‘a giant contributor to deficit financing,’ should be shut down." Paul has long advocated less dependence on government. But does he want to fold FEMA, the agency entrusted with coordinating disaster response? Some background: President Jimmy Carter created FEMA through a 1979 executive order merging disaster-aid agencies across the government. Yet the agency says federal involvement in disaster relief began with an 1803 law enabling federal aid to a New Hampshire town after a fire. "In the century that followed," FEMA says, "ad hoc legislation was passed more than 100 times in response to hurricanes, earthquakes, floods and other natural disasters." After asking Paul’s campaign about his FEMA position, we found a CNN transcript of a May 13, 2011, interview of Paul by the network’s Wolf Blitzer, who asked if Paul wants to see the agency ended. Paul replied: "Well, if you want to live in a free society, if you want to pay attention to the Constitution, why not? I think it's bad economics. I think it's bad morality. And it's bad constitutional law." Paul continued: "Why should people like myself, who had, not too long ago, a house on the Gulf Coast and it's — it's expensive there, it's risky and it's dangerous. Why should somebody from the central part of the United States rebuild my house? Why shouldn't I have to buy my own insurance and protect about the potential danger? "Well, the reason we don't have market insurance is it's too expensive. Well, why is it expensive? Because it's dangerous. Well, so why should — why should we take money from somebody else who (doesn’t) get the chance to live on the Gulf and make them pay to rebuild my house?" "I mean it's — it's a moral hazard to say that government is always going to take care of us when we do dumb things. I'm trying to get people to not do dumb things. Besides, it's not authorized in the Constitution." More recently, according to MSNBC, Paul said in New Hampshire on Aug. 26, 2011 that "there’s no magic about FEMA," adding that it’s a "great contributor to deficit financing and quite frankly they don't have a penny in the bank. We should be coordinated but coordinated voluntarily with the states. A state can decide. We don't need somebody in Washington," the network quoted Paul saying. On Aug. 28, 2011, Paul spoke again about FEMA. According to video posted by Fox News, "Fox News Sunday" anchor Chris Wallace asked if Paul would do away with the agency and the things it was doing to help Americans faced with Hurricane Irene. Paul then described FEMA as inept in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, though he indicated he’s not inclined to shutter the agency immediately. "No, you don’t get rid of something like that in one day," Paul said. On Aug. 30, 2011, CNN’s Anderson Cooper prefaced a Paul interview by saying if elected president, Paul has said he’d do away with FEMA. Cooper shortly asked Paul: "So you say we don't need FEMA. Why?" Paul replied that "they don't have a very good record. I mean, these natural disasters are very, very dangerous, so I don’t understand why we’d turn it over to a federal bureaucracy. Federal bureaucracies as a whole don’t do a very good job, but FEMA has the worst reputation of almost any of them." He also said that the government should "look at how things were handled before we had FEMA." Later in the interview, Paul said the federal government should be available for disaster-related rescues. Paul’s campaign didn’t respond to our inquiry. We rate Dowd’s statement True.

pomt-15232	Says Hillary Clinton has "been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/07/marco-rubio/rubio-says-hillary-clinton-office-longer-any-repub/	Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., says the electorate should pick a candidate based on more than his or her resume. At the first prime-time debate for the 2016 Republican presidential primary, Rubio said he’s qualified even though he doesn’t have executive experience. "This election cannot be a resume competition," he said. "It’s important to be qualified, but if this election is going to be a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton's going to be the next president, because she's been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight." Does Democratic frontrunner and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton really have a longer government resume than all 17 candidates on the GOP side? If you only count Clinton’s years as a U.S. senator (2001-08) and and a secretary of state (2009-13), then Clinton has 12 years in office, and that’s easily outpaced by many of the GOP candidates. Rubio is likely counting her time as first lady of the United States, from 1993-2000, when she had a more formal role with her own administrative office and a voice in national policy discussions. While counting her First Lady years is debatable -- it’s not an elected or appointed office -- counting it would bring her total to about 20 years. If you counted her time as first lady of Arkansas from 1979-80 and 1983-92, that would bring the total to 31 years. (Clinton had a private position as a lawyer for the Rose Law Firm during much of this time, so it’s not equivalent to the responsibilities of first lady of the United States.) We think it’s a stretch to count the Arkansas years, so we would put Clinton’s experience at about 20 years. As we’ll see, there are several Republicans who have 20 years or more in public office. Among Republicans, there are three candidates who have no government experience: real estate mogul Donald Trump, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Then there are the candidates who do not have at least 12 years in public office (the number of years Clinton has, minus her years as first lady): former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Virginia Gov. James Gilmore, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. That leaves the candidates who have at least 12 years of experience: Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee: 14 years In 1993, he became Arkansas’ lieutenant governor. He served as the state’s governor from 1996 through the beginning of 2007. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie: 17 years From 1994-98, he held a county-level representative position in New Jersey. He returned to government as New Jersey’s U.S. attorney from 2002-08, and he won election for governor in 2010. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal: 17 years Jindal held various administrative positions in Louisiana and at the national level from 1996 through 2003. He then served in the U.S. House from 2005 through 2008, when he was elected governor. Rubio: 17 years experience In 2000, he joined the Florida House of Representatives after two years as a city commissioner in West Miami, Fla. He has served in the U.S. Senate since the 2010 election. Former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa.: 20 years Santorum held various state-level positions from 1981-86. Then, he served in the U.S. House from 1991 through 1995 and then the Senate through the beginning of 2007. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker: 22 years In 1993, he became a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly. In 2002, Walker became Milwaukee County Executive. He has served as governor since winning election in 2010. Former New York Gov. George Pataki: 25 years Pataki was mayor of Peekskill, N.Y., from 1981 through 1984, then he served in the New York State legislature from 1985 through 1994. He served as governor 1995 through 2006. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.: 28 years Graham had state and local attorney positions from 1988-94. He served in the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1993-95, when he entered the national House. He became a senator in 2003. Ohio Gov. John Kasich: 30 years In 1979, Kasich joined the Ohio Senate at age 26, following two years as a Senate aide. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1983 through 2001. After time in the private sector, he became governor in 2011. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry: 30 years In 1984, Perry was elected to the Texas House of Representatives. He became the state’s agriculture commissioner in 1990, lieutenant governor in 1998 and governor from 2000 through 2014. Our ruling Rubio said that Clinton has "been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight." The only way Rubio gets near this is to count her years as first lady of Arkansas, which we think is a stretch. There are several Republicans who can make a good case that they have just as much experience if not more than Clinton, especially Perry of Texas and Kasich of Ohio. We rate Rubio’s statement Mostly False.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2015-08-07T00:55:38	2015-08-06	['None']
pomt-02638	"In 1916, the U.S. government predicted that by the 1940s all paper would come from hemp and that no more trees would need to be cut down."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/17/facebook-posts/viral-internet-meme-says-us-government-predicted-1/	With the recent legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado, pot is hot. So when a reader was curious about the accuracy of an Internet meme about hemp -- a close botanical cousin of marijuana that has been caught up on in the war on drugs -- they sent it our way. The graphic says: "In 1916, the U.S. government predicted that by the 1940s all paper would come from hemp and that no more trees would need to be cut down." The claim has proliferated all over the Internet. Sometimes a source is listed (such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture archives), but none of the repetitions ever seems to have a checkable citation, much less a direct link to a verifiable source. We decided to take a closer look. First, some background on hemp. Hemp and marijuana are both varieties of the cannabis plant, but hemp has much lower levels of THC, the psychoactive compound that makes marijuana a drug. Over the years, hemp has been used to make a wide variety of products, from rope, fabrics and paper to food and fuel, but its use in the United States dwindled after World War II. After more than a decade of dormancy as a crop in the United States, hemp was effectively outlawed by the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, which drew no distinctions between hemp and cannabis, presumably because the two plants look so similar that it would be easy to conceal illegal marijuana plants in a field of hemp. Some states have since loosened their laws about hemp cultivation, but federal law remains a steep obstacle to efforts to revive the domestic hemp industry. Because the legal fates of marijuana and hemp have been closely intertwined over the years, supporters of decriminalizing marijuana have often made common cause with those who would like to revive hemp as a crop in the United States. That’s why the Internet meme we are checking struck a chord among marijuana-legalization supporters on social media. Still, widely believed doesn’t necessarily mean correct. Did the U.S. government really predict that hemp would, in the course of three decades, make wood obsolete as the raw material for making paper? The notion is not entirely implausible. The Agriculture Department does have "a lot of pre-World War II material on hemp," said Wayne Olson, a librarian at the National Agricultural Library, which is part of the Agriculture Department. That’s because hemp was once a cultivated crop in many states, especially Kentucky. The best known of these Agriculture Department documents is Bulletin 404, which features a pair of studies published in 1916 that investigate the plausibility of using hemp hurds -- a part of the hemp plant -- to make paper. This document has played a key role in the arguments of those who support legalizing hemp and marijuana, due partly to numerous citations in The Emperor Wears No Clothes, a book initially published in 1985 by the late Jack Herer, a pro-cannabis activist. Herer’s volume has been widely read within the pro-cannabis community, though it’s been questioned by historians for the quality of its scholarship. Even though Bulletin 404 was mentioned at several points in The Emperor Wears No Clothes, Herer’s book never makes the claim circulating in the Internet meme we’re checking. More to the point, when we looked at Bulletin 404 itself, we couldn’t find any reference to a prediction that "by the 1940s all paper would come from hemp." The papers that comprise Bulletin 404 are highly technical, dwelling on matters such as how much caustic soda was used in the tests and how to measure "unsieved hurds." Truth be told, the authors’ powers of prediction were rather faulty. They wrote that "there appears to be little doubt that under the present system of forest use and consumption, the present supply can not withstand the demands placed upon it." As anyone who uses paper knows, that certainly didn’t come to pass. Nor did the authors’ prediction that, "without doubt, hemp will continue to be one of the staple agricultural crops of the United States." And even that is not the same thing as predicting that all paper will eventually come from hemp. So Bulletin 404 is a dead end. What about other papers? Tom Murphy, the National Outreach Coordinator with the group Vote Hemp, pointed us to one additional document dating from around the same time -- a 72-page chapter from the Yearbook of the United States Department of Agriculture for 1913. But this document didn’t make the claim we’re checking, either. Olson of the National Agricultural Laboratory was skeptical that the claim actually exists somewhere in the department’s archives. "I have been here since 1987 and have a pretty good idea what’s in the collection, but I have not heard that quote," he said. And Joseph Schwarz of the National Archives and Records Administration said that his office, at our request, searched the general correspondence on hemp for 1916 and 1917 as well as the Online Public Access Catalog. Such a claim could not be located, he said. Academics expressed skepticism that the claim was made. "I never encountered this statement," said Michael Schaller, a University of Arizona historian. "At various times there have been many claims about hemp, so it is possible someone, somewhere, sometime, said it. But I have not seen it in any original source." Ralph Weisheit, a professor of criminal justice sciences at Illinois State University and author of Domestic Marijuana: A Neglected Industry, agreed that "it doesn't sound right. This was a time in our nation's history when trees were abundant, and I'd be surprised if a government agency was completely ruling them out as a source for paper." Ten other experts told PolitiFact that they had never heard of this claim, had never seen it persuasively documented, or both. "I have read Bulletin 404 carefully and can see no such claim," said Samuel Thayer, an expert in edible wild plants, author of The Forager’s Harvest, and creator of the Hemphoax.org website, which casts doubt on a wide variety of claims by hemp advocates. "It is possible the source is something else, but since I have not seen the claim referenced to any document in particular, and I know of no other USDA document regarding hemp from that year, that is my working hypothesis about where it came from." Our ruling The Facebook post said that "in 1916, the U.S. government predicted that by the 1940s all paper would come from hemp and that no more trees would need to be cut down." The most plausible source for this -- Bulletin 404 -- is silent on this claim, and neither our own research nor any of the dozen experts we asked was able to come up with a definitive source. As with all claims of this type, it’s impossible to prove a negative, so we are willing to re-rate this claim if credible evidence emerges. However, our best efforts have turned up nothing more than a puff of smoke. Since the claim is unsupported, we rate it False.

pomt-08426	On privatization of Social Security.	full flop	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/19/jim-renacci/jim-renacci-has-come-down-both-sides-privatizing-s/	In the latest campaign ad for Alliance Democratic Rep. John Boccieri, a Greek chorus of indignant senior citizens ties Republican congressional candidate Jim Renacci to the third rail of politics. "Mr. Renacci. I’d rather put my Social Security money in here, or in here, or in here, than let you privatize MY Social Security," a group of them scold, throwing cash into a hole in the ground, a coffee can, and a dresser drawer. "I paid into Social Security for 40 years, it’s all I have, and you want to gamble it away on Wall Street, Mr. Renacci?" ask another pair of seniors, as the words "Jim Renacci wants to privatize Social Security" flash onto the screen, as if to answer their question. We thought we'd run Renacci's position on privatizing Social Security through the Flip-O-Meter, in light of Boccieri’s ad, to see if his position has been consistent. Renacci campaign manager Jim Slepian says the ad is false, and that Renacci does not want to privatize Social Security. He points to a spot on Renacci's website where the former Wadsworth mayor says the federal government must "implement reforms to address the growing fiscal crisis that is facing the Social Security balance sheet." On his website, Renacci stipulates Washington must "ensure that Social Security benefits are protected and that needed reforms are brought to bear that would not raise taxes or privatize the system." Slepian said that's still Renacci's position. "He has said time and time again that we cannot and should not privatize the system." We asked the Boccieri campaign what information they had that showed something different. Boccieri spokeswoman Jessica Kershaw pointed us to a survey Renacci filled out for "Project Vote Smart." In that survey, Renacci said he favored of privatizing parts of the Social Security system. "To the extent that I support privatizing elements of Social Security, I support allowing workers to privately invest a portion of their payroll taxes," Renacci explained on the Vote Smart website. We do not think that Renacci is advocating measures that amount to turning the entire Social Security system over to Wall Street. But that's not been the case, either, for previous privatization proposals. In 2005, for example, President George W. Bush promoted moving toward a government-funded program that also allowed for personal accounts. Rep. Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has proposed a similar blend of programs as part of an overall budget plan he calls "The Roadmap." His plan, too, is a far cry from a wholly privatized system. So while Renacci's opposition to privatization is firm on his website, his answers to Project Vote Smart's survey suggest support for privatization as it has been proposed in the past. Reconciling those two positions and landing on two feet requires a Full Flop. Comment on this item.	None	Jim Renacci	None	None	None	2010-10-19T06:00:00	2010-10-18	['None']
pomt-06491	"Current projections indicate that Medicare will go bankrupt by 2017, while Social Security will bottom out by 2037."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/oct/14/herman-cain/cain-says-medicare-social-security-financial-troub/	You can’t accuse Herman Cain of lacking confidence. Metro Atlanta’s Republican hopeful for president ran for the U.S. Senate in 2004 without a lick of experience as an elected official. Now he’s running for president without ever having served in public office. His new book, "This is Herman Cain!: My Journey to the White House," treats victory as a foregone conclusion. Already, he’s referring to himself as "President Herman Cain." It’s in more than a few places, including the title of Appendix A, "The Major Issues of the Day, According to President Herman Cain." And President Herman Cain does not like what he sees. Entitlements, he said, are compromising the nation’s financial stability. "Current projections indicate that Medicare will go bankrupt by 2017, while Social Security will bottom out by 2037," Cain said. These figures -- especially the Medicare estimate -- seemed awfully pessimistic. 2017 is only six years away. We contacted the Cain campaign and received no response, so we did our own research. We found that FactCheck.org, another fact-checking group, looked at similar statements. Cain’s campaign website also offered some clues. His policy page makes an almost identical claim, citing a May 2009 article in Newsweek as support. The op-ed is by columnist Robert J. Samuelson, who argued that Medicare, which provides health care for seniors, and Social Security, which provides retirement income, will have to go bankrupt before lawmakers take funding problems seriously. Samuelson said current projections show those programs will go bankrupt in 2017 and 2037, the dates when the "trust funds" that back them are slated to run dry. Those are the same years Cain cited. First, we’ll deal with Cain’s statement that projections show Medicare will go bankrupt by 2017. FactCheck.org wrote in 2009 about a nearly identical claim made in a TV ad for Americans for Prosperity, where Mark Block, the Cain campaign’s chief operating officer, used to work. It checked another in April by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. As FactCheck.org concluded, Medicare does have big financial problems, but there’s no reason to think it’s going out of business. There are four parts to Medicare, and they’re funded by two separate trust funds run by the federal government. Part A covers inpatient hospital care, home health care, and services at skilled nursing facilities and hospices. It’s paid for by the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund, which collects most of its money from federal payroll taxes. Part B covers doctor visits and other outpatient costs, while Part D covers prescription drugs. The Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Fund pays their bills, which are mostly covered by the federal government’s general fund and premiums. Medicare Advantage, or Part C, gives recipients the option to receive care through private insurers. It doesn’t have a trust fund. FactCheck.org’s articles said that the SMI fund is in good shape, and we found it still is. It’s "projected to remain in financial balance for all future years," according to a 2011 report by the fund’s trustees But the the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund? Not so much. As of this year, it’s expected to be exhausted by 2024, according to midrange assumptions. If conditions worsen, the trust fund will run out by 2016. This is better than the 2009 projections, where trustees expected funds to dry up by 2017, according to midrange assumptions. That’s the same date that Cain used. Still, as bad as the news is about the hospital insurance fund, FactCheck.org decided it didn’t truly signal bankruptcy. The fund is only a portion of Medicare. The remainder is solvent for the foreseeable future. It’s also worth noting that Congress has always pulled the hospital insurance fund from the brink of insolvency. According to a Congressional Research Service report, in 1970, the insolvency date was 1972. For the next 16 years, trustees expected its funds to be exhausted by the 1990s. Congress repeatedly changed legislation to lower fund spending and keep it from going dry. Now, let’s deal with Cain’s claim that Social Security will "bottom out" by 2037. There are two Social Security trust funds: Old-Age and Survivors Insurance, which pays for benefits to retired workers, their families and to families of deceased workers; and Disability Insurance, which pays for benefits to disabled workers and their families. In 2009, midrange projections by the Social Security Board of Trustees said these trust funds combined will be exhausted in 2037, while the Disability Insurance fund will be gone by 2020. The outlook worsened this year. The Disability Insurance fund will be exhausted in 2018. Combined, their assets will be exhausted by 2036. When those funds run dry, Social Security will struggle to pay out benefits as promised, according to trustees. Cain’s information was based on a 2009 op-ed. He got that year’s data correct, and projections have not changed dramatically since then. But while it’s fair for him to say that Social Security will "bottom out" by 2037, saying Medicare will go bankrupt by 2017 is a bit extreme. Only one of Medicare’s funds is expected to be exhausted by that date, and Congress has never let it run dry. Lawmakers have bailed out the fund without fail for 40 years. Since Cain’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details about the Medicare trust fund, it meets our definition of Half True.

pomt-00986	"The 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that up to half of daily marijuana smokers become addicted -- an estimated 2.7 million people in the U.S."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/feb/09/susan-shapiro/foe-legalizing-marijuana-says-half-daily-users-bec/	Vigorous debate surrounds efforts to legalize marijuana around the nation and in Rhode Island, where advocates are pushing legalization proposals in the General Assembly. (In 2013, the state decriminalized possession of small amounts of non-medical marijuana.) Author Susan Shapiro, who says she is ambivalent about legalizing marijuana, shared her story about what she called her "extreme addiction" to marijuana in a commentary published Jan. 10, 2015, in The Providence Journal entitled "Susan Shapiro: My pot addiction nearly ruined my life." She told of marijuana’s "dark side," and included statistics to reinforce her point. "The 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that up to half of daily marijuana smokers become addicted -- an estimated 2.7 million people in the U.S," she wrote. We wondered if the figure Shapiro used is true. We called her to find out how she backed up her claim. She referred us to a story that ran July 14, 2014, in USA Today entitled "Marijuana poses more risks than many realize" by reporter Liz Szabo. She took the information from that piece, she said. The story quoted Nora D. Volkow, director of the National Institute of Drug Abuse, a federal agency that supports research on drug abuse and addiction. The relevant section in the story Shapiro cited reads: "Up to half of people who smoke marijuana daily become addicted. According to the 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2.7 million people over age 12 meet criteria for addiction to marijuana." We contacted the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA), which produced the survey cited by Shapiro and Volkow. We also reached out to Volkow’s organization, the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). The SAMHSA survey found that 5.4 million people said they used marijuana daily or almost daily in 2012. Almost daily was defined as 300 or more days in the past year. (Another 18.9 million said they had used marijuana at least once in the past month.) NIDA forwarded us a detailed table from the SAMHSA’s 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. It showed that 2.69 million people over age 12 with dependence on marijuana and hashish in the past year. That’s roughly half the number of daily marijuana smokers, as Shapiro said. Tamara Ward, a SAMHSA spokeswoman, told us that dependence on illicit drugs or alcohol is defined as meeting three out of seven criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV, including the need for markedly increased amounts of the substance, withdrawal symptoms, and reduction or abandonment of social, work or recreational activities because of use. That sounded like addiction to us, but to be sure, we also reached out to Wayne D. Hall, a professor and director of the Centre for Youth Substance Abuse Research at the University of Queensland, in Australia. We asked Hall if dependence amounted to addiction. He said he used the words interchangeably but that not everyone does, especially not in the case of opioid drugs. We also contacted Dr. Stuart Gitlow, an addiction medicine specialist in Woonsocket and president of the American Society of Addiction Medicine. He agreed. "Clearly, all those who have dependence also have addiction, but it's not as clear that all those with abuse also have addiction. Some probably do not," Gitlow said. Our ruling Susan Shapiro wrote "The 2012 National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that up to half of daily marijuana smokers become addicted -- an estimated 2.7 million people in the U.S." The survey found that 5.4 million people reported using marijuana daily or almost daily. A more detailed table from the same survey shows 2.69 million people -- just shy of 2.7 million -- with dependence on marijuana and hashish. Based on that number, and the definitions of addiction from SAMHSA, Hall and Gitlow, we rate Shapiro’s claim True. (Correction: Susan Shapiro says she is ambivalent about legalizing marijuana. The original version of this item and the headline incorrectly said she opposes legalization.)	None	Susan Shapiro	None	None	None	2015-02-09T00:01:00	2015-01-15	['United_States']
pomt-14885	Says the United States is in "the worst recovery from an economic recession since World War II."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/10/chris-christie/christie-us-worst-recovery-wwii/	The central theme of the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee, Wis., was business and economics. Fox Business moderator Sandra Smith laid out a bleak employment picture for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. She said there are 90 million Americans unemployed or not in the workforce at all. For those that are working, Smith said wages aren’t budging. Christie responded with an anecdote of a woman he met in New Hampshire who told him how she worried each month that she wouldn’t have enough to pay her bills. "There are tens of millions of Americans living that way after the worst recovery from an economic recession since World War II," Christie said. Is the United States in the middle of "the worst recovery from an economic recession since World War II"? Conveniently, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis website has a tool that allows you to compare recessions back to 1948. Here’s what the Fed’s site tells us. This recovery is not the worst when it comes to jobs. The Federal Reserve measures the cumulative percentage gain in employment from the point when each recession ended and the recovery began. During the recovery from the 2001 recession, employment didn’t crawl out of negative territory for about 28 months. By comparison, in the recovery following the 2007 recession, at the 21-month mark, the United States began adding jobs beyond the number that existed at the start of the recovery. The following chart measures the jobs picture following every recession since World War II. The red line is the current recovery: Seventy-six months from the start of the recovery, the economy today has produced a cumulative jobs gain of 8.9 percent. After 76 months in the recovery from the 2001 recession, the cumulative gain was 5.4 percent. There is another way to measure job trends. You can look at gains compared to the pre-recession employment peak. By that yardstick, it took 76 months to match the number of jobs in the economy before the 2007 downturn, which was the worst since World War II. It took 46 months for the recovery after the 2001 recession to reach the same point. But the job losses in 2001 were much smaller, so that recovery had less ground to regain. Economic output But Christie does have a point if you look at economic output, as measured by the Gross Domestic Product, or GDP. Looking at GDP growth, the current recovery is indeed the slowest since the Depression. Again here’s the chart: For a few quarters, the current recovery did better than the one that followed the 1980 recession, but while the current recession generally has showed slow gains, the 1980 recovery took off. The cumulative increase in real Gross Domestic Product for the present recovery is 14.2 percent. That is worse than the 17.2 percent for the 2001 recovery. Tara Sinclair is chief economist at Indeed and economics professor at George Washington University. "We've just passed 61 months of consistent employment growth, and longer if you just look at private employment," Sinclair told PolitiFact. "On that metric, the recovery is the longest since WWII, so that hardly seems the worst. On the other hand, the recovery has been notably slow, and we are not back to the trend level of GDP or employment that we would have expected without the recession." Sinclair added that even in terms of GDP it’s hard to call this the worst recovery because the country is emerging from what economists count as the deepest recession since World War II. Our ruling Christie said the United States is in the worst economic recovery from a recession since World War II. Christie’s campaign did not respond to our request for comment. The truth is it depends on what you measure. Looking at GDP growth, he’s right. Looking at the employment picture, the 2001 recovery was worse. Christie’s claim is partially accurate.

pomt-09814	Van Jones "is an avowed, self-avowed radical revolutionary communist."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/08/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-says-van-jones-avowed-communist/	Radio and TV political commentator Glenn Beck has spent weeks detailing what he says is a web of Obama administration officials with socialist or communist ties. And Exhibit A in the Beck argument has been Van Jones, Obama's so-called green jobs czar (his actual title was special adviser for green jobs at the Council on Environmental Quality). Conservative commentators and bloggers criticized Jones because of his past remarks and his involvement with controversial groups. His resignation was announced shortly after midnight on Sept. 6, 2009. Beck has repeatedly claimed Jones is a communist. For purposes of a fact-check statement, we selected a Sept. 1, 2009, remark Beck made on his radio program that Jones "is an avowed, self-avowed radical revolutionary communist." There's little question that Jones was an avowed communist. In a Nov. 2, 2005, profile of Jones in the East Bay Express , an alternative weekly in Berkeley, Calif., Jones said his life hit a turning point in the spring of 1992 when he was swept up in mass arrests while protesting the acquittal of police officers accused of beating Rodney King. Although the charges against Jones were dropped, Jones said that while in jail, "I met all these young radical people of color — I mean really radical, communists and anarchists. And it was, like, 'This is what I need to be a part of.' I spent the next 10 years of my life working with a lot of those people I met in jail, trying to be a revolutionary." "In the months that followed," the Express article said, "he let go of any lingering thoughts that he might fit in with the status quo. 'I was a rowdy nationalist on April 28th, and then the verdicts came down on April 29th,' he said. 'By August, I was a communist.'" In 1994, the story states, Jones formed a socialist collective called Standing Together to Organize a Revolutionary Movement, or STORM. According to a history of STORM written in the spring of 2004, the group held "structured political education" training at every meeting "to help members develop an understanding of the basics of Marxist politics." They "trained members on capitalism and wage exploitation, the state and revolution, imperialism and the revolutionary party." So Jones was a self-avowed communist. But is he still? The answer lies in the very same article. Even before the group disbanded in 2002, the Express article says, "Jones began transforming his politics and work..." According to the article, "He took an objective look at the movement's effectiveness and decided that the changes he was seeking were actually getting farther away. Not only did the left need to be more unified, he decided, it might also benefit from a fundamental shift in tactics. 'I realized that there are a lot of people who are capitalists — shudder, shudder — who are really committed to fairly significant change in the economy, and were having bigger impacts than me and a lot of my friends with our protest signs,' he said." In recent years, Jones established himself as a leading, charismatic cheerleader for transitioning the American economy to green jobs. We weren't able to find any recent interviews where Jones directly addresses the question of where he stands on communism. When he resigned this week, Jones said he was the victim of a "vicious smear campaign" by conservatives and decided to resign so as not to be a distraction. "I cannot in good conscience ask my colleagues to expend precious time and energy defending or explaining my past," he said in a released statement. But check out these two statements and see if this sounds like a communist. This, from his book, The Green Collar Economy , released in October 2008: "There will surely be an important role for nonprofit voluntary, cooperative, and community-based solutions," Jones writes on page 86. "But the reality is that we are entering an era during which our very survival will demand invention and innovation on a scale never before seen in the history of human civilization. Only the business community has the requisite skills, experience, and capital to meet that need. On that score, neither the government nor the nonprofit and voluntary sectors can compete, not even remotely. "So in the end, our success and survival as a species are largely and directly tied to the new eco-entrepreneurs — and the success and survival of their enterprises. Since almost all of the needed eco-technologies are likely to come from the private sector, civic leaders and voters should do all that can be done to help green business leaders succeed. That means, in large part, electing leaders who will pass bills to aid them. We cannot realistically proceed without a strong alliance between the best of the business world — and everyone else." Or how about this, from an address before the Center for American Progress on Nov. 19, 2008 (well before Jones was brought into the Obama administration): "Everything that is good for the environment, everything that's needed to beat global warming, is a job," Jones said. "Solar panels don't manufacture themselves. Wind turbines don't manufacture themselves. Homes don't weatherize themselves. Every single thing that we need to beat global warming will also beat the recession. And the challenge is, how do we get the government to be a smart, and limited, catalyst in getting the private sector to take on this challenge?" That doesn't sound Marxist to us. Beck would have been on solid ground if he said Jones used to be a communist. Jones has been up front about that. But Beck has repeatedly said Jones is a communist. Present tense. Although we could not find a comment in which Jones explicitly said why he is no longer one, we found ample evidence that he now believes capitalism is the best force for the social change he is seeking. So there's truth to Beck's claim in that Jones was a communist, but it's apparent he isn't any longer, as Beck suggests. So we find the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09496	"Bill McCollum said tax cuts don't work."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/feb/24/alex-sink/sink-says-mccollum-said-tax-cuts-dont-work/	A Republican candidate against tax cuts would be like President Barack Obama being against hope, right? But that's the accusation that Florida's Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink, a Democratic candidate for governor, makes against Republican opponent Bill McCollum, the state's attorney general. On her Facebook page Feb. 16, 2010, Sink wrote: "Career politician Bill McCollum said tax cuts don't work. That's just plain wrong -- wrong for businesses, our economy, and everyday Floridians." The charge refers to comments McCollum has made over the years, but the Sink campaign also cited some of McCollum's votes while in Congress from 1981 to 2001. First, his words. Sink's Facebook statement refers to a Feb. 15, 2010, article from the News Service of Florida about comments from three candidates for governor -- Sink, McCollum and Republican Paula Dockery -- at a Tallahassee forum sponsored by the National Federation of Independent Business and Florida TaxWatch. Here is what the article said about McCollum's comments on tax cuts: While Democrat Alex Sink and Republican Paula Dockery both promoted the idea of offering tax breaks to spur job-creation, Republican Bill McCollum said the approach is not a panacea. "Targeted tax credits, in my experience in Washington, were minimally effective," said McCollum, a former 10-term Congressman from the Orlando-area. "They can be in the short run, but in the long run they are not effective," he added. "But I think all of us wish there were a simple solution to the re-creation of jobs in Florida." The article also stated that all three candidates "vowed to steer clear from tax increases" and "supported delaying a sharp increase in the state's unemployment compensation tax that businesses now face paying on April 1." Sink's campaign also cited a Nov. 5, 2000, South Florida Sun-Sentinel article in which McCollum, then a U.S. Senate candidate, discussed tax cuts. The article said that McCollum's "stump speeches Saturday repeated his themes of 'better government, not bigger government.' And he continued his attack on [Democrat Bill] Nelson for his support of $500 billion in targeted cuts, rather than the $1.3 trillion in across-the-board cuts favored by Bush. "'Targeted tax cuts are just a liberal's fancy way of saying they want government to decide who gets the money,' McCollum told a handful of supporters at a Punta Gorda retirement community." Those passages indicate that McCollum's position on tax cuts has followed party lines; he was opposed to the Democrat's "targeted cuts," but he appears to have supported an across-the-board tax cut favored by Republicans. To rebut the Sink claim, McCollum's campaign provided us with a few articles quoting him in favor of tax cuts. A Feb. 15, 2010, Newsmax article quotes McCollum saying, "We need to reduce the capital gains tax" and that he wants to reduce the corporate tax rate. In that article, he criticized Obama's proposal for a tax credit for businesses that hire new workers. "I never thought targeted tax credits were very effective," McCollum said. In a transcript of a McCollum speech printed in the Florida Times-Union on July 31, 2000, McCollum said that Congress could "not only cut taxes, but restructure the tax code." To get a more complete picture of McCollum's position, we also looked at his votes on various tax cuts. His record shows that, contrary to Sink's claim, he voted for tax cuts several times. Even the Florida Democratic Party has noted that; it issued a news release Dec. 29, 2009, stating that McCollum has repeatedly voted in favor of tax cuts for the wealthy. Sink's campaign provided two examples of when McCollum voted against tax cuts in the 1990s, but they were party-line votes that indicate he was voting with other Republicans in opposition to a Democratic proposal. By contrast, McCollum's campaign cited many other votes that McCollum took in favor of tax cuts, including votes to eliminate the marriage tax penalty and the estate tax. So based on the news articles and our examination of McCollum's voting record, it's clear that he has often supported tax cuts -- particularly Republican proposals. So Sink is cherry-picking here. Although McCollum did say he was opposed to "targeted" (read: Democratic) tax cuts, he has spoken and voted in favor of them many other times, particularly the across-the-board proposals favored by Republicans. We find her statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05681	Says Gov. Scott Walker cut aid to local schools despite campaigning on trying to restore two-thirds state funding for education	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/14/kathleen-falk/kathleen-falk-says-gov-scott-walker-cut-school-aid/	Kathleen Falk has a theory about what drove the recall campaign against Gov. Scott Walker -- and it’s not all about his move to sharply curtail collective bargaining by public employees. The Dane County Democrat, a candidate in the all-but-certain recall race, says the recall was rooted in people’s anger at what she considers Walker’s dishonesty in how he balanced the state budget. She offered this example on Feb. 29, 2011 in an appearance at Marquette University for the "On the Issues" series with Mike Gousha. "He said he was going to try to fully fund the two-thirds state commitment to education. That’s what he said he would try to do. But then what did he do? He made the largest cut in public education in our state’s history, a billion dollars." We previously rated True a claim from Falk that Walker’s education cuts -- including higher ed -- were the largest in state history. In that item, we noted Walker’s limits on unions also paved the way for many school districts to cut costs on pension, health insurance and other expenses. In at least some cases, the money the districts generated from employees paying more for pensions and health care totally offset their aid cut. But Falk’s claim about the two-thirds funding is new. It relates to an earlier period and a separate issue: Walker’s positions during the 2010 campaign. During that election, it was clear the next governor would face a huge budget shortfall, one tallying billions of dollars. And Walker was promising a series of tax cuts. But did Walker also talk about trying to "fully fund the two-thirds state commitment to education"? First, a quick word on what’s so magical about "two-thirds" funding. In the mid-1990s, the state pledged to provide two-thirds of school revenue, a move aimed at holding down local property taxes. The change, enacted when Republican Tommy Thompson was governor, marked a major shift in how education was funded. But in 2003, lawmakers repealed the commitment. And by 2010, the state’s overall share had slipped to about 63 percent. That may seem small on a percentage basis, but was very significant for many districts. In his first bid for governor, in 2006, Walker explicitly promised to "maintain" two thirds funding. What about in the 2010 campaign? In that race, Walker did not go that far -- nor does Falk’s claim go that far. She claims Walker said he would "try" to fully fund schools at the two-thirds level. (In her recall bid, Falk has said she supports a goal of two-thirds funding, but hasn’t committed to a specific funding level.) When asked for evidence to support her claim, Falk’s staff pointed us to an October 2010 story in the Appleton Post-Crescent that quoted Walker saying he would "aim" to return to two-thirds state funding. The quote originated in a Tomah Journal story on Sept. 8, 2010, before Walker won the GOP primary. The Tomah Journal reported that on education, Walker said "it would be an aim" to restore two-thirds funding of local school costs. Walker noted Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle had "chipped away at that." We looked for other clues on Walker’s position. On July 24, 2010, Walker was quoted in a Wisconsin State Journal article that described him as saying he supported two-thirds funding "in principle." Meanwhile, when asked on Sept. 2, 2010 by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel if he supported two-thirds state funding for schools, Walker did not directly answer the question. Instead, he emphasized restoring limits on school employee compensation and helping school districts control insurance costs. A Walker administration spokesman told us Walker did back the goal, but did not explicitly promise to do it. Once in office, other priorities and fiscal challenges overtook his aim, said spokesman Cullen Werwie. In the end, Walker moved dramatically in the opposite direction. His budget proposed dropping the state commitment to 61 percent for the two years, down from 62 percent to 63 percent the previous two years. Walker still has two-thirds as a goal. Said Werwie: "We still have one budget to go and because of the tough decisions that were made in the first budget we will be in a much better position to try and make progress towards this aim." In any case, Falk framed her claim around actions by Walker in his first budget. So let’s take a closer look at what he told voters about the prospect the goal could be reached that quickly. In the State Journal piece, Walker doused the idea that he would accomplish a restoration to two thirds in the 2011-’13 budget. He emphasized that "the multibillion dollar hole left by (Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle)" makes it difficult to maintain in the 2011-’13 budget. And in the Tomah Journal story -- in which Walker said he would "aim" to restore two-thirds -- he put his main emphasis on limiting schools’ compensation costs. So Walker sent clear signals his first budget might not be able to meet the goal. Our conclusion Falk claimed Walker proposed a big cut in state school aid, even though in the campaign, he said "said he was going to try to fully fund the two-thirds state commitment to education." Walker did support it in principle and says it remains a goal for the next budget. But Falk’s critique of Walker fails to note that before election day he signalled it may not be possible to be able to move back to two-thirds funding in the first year. We rate Falk’s claim Mostly True.	None	Kathleen Falk	None	None	None	2012-03-14T09:00:00	2012-02-29	['None']
pomt-04246	Says New Hampshire had the fourth-lowest unemployment rate in the country during Maggie Hassan’s time in the state Senate.	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/nov/16/maggie-hassan/new-hampshires-new-governor-maggie-hassan-claims-l/	Throughout her campaign, Maggie Hassan, New Hampshire’s new governor-elect, vowed repeatedly to veto any statewide income or sales tax that crossed her desk. But, even as she celebrated her victory, Hassan was asked to address the matter one more time last week, this time before a national audience. Interviewing Hassan the morning after the election on MSNBC’s Daily Rundown, anchor Chuck Todd asked the newly elected governor about the prospects of a broad-based tax. "I served in the state Senate for six years with retiring Gov. John Lynch. During that time, we had the fourth lowest unemployment rate in the country," Hassan told Todd during the November 7 interview. "Our economy works really well without an income or a sales tax." Throughout campaign season and beyond, candidates commonly refer to New Hampshire’s unemployment rate as one of the country’s lowest. But, was it really fourth best in the country during Hassan’s time in office? We decided to check the books. Federal counts show that the numbers fluctuated slightly during Hassan’s time in the Senate. She she served three terms between 2004-10 before running for governor this year. Amid the changes, New Hampshire’s rate remained among the lowest. Here’s a year-by-year review. 2005: 3.6 percent unemployment, tied with Montana for fourth lowest. 2006: 3.5 percent, tied with Alabama, Delaware for seventh lowest. 2007: 3.5 percent, tied with Delaware, New Mexico for eighth lowest. 2008: 3.9 percent, sixth lowest 2009: 6.2 percent, tied with Iowa for fifth lowest 2010: 6.1 percent, fourth lowest (As a side note, New Hampshire retained its spot as the fourth-lowest unemployment rate, 5.4 percent, in 2011, the year after Hassan left office.) So, the numbers show Hassan’s claim to be in the ballpark. The state’s unemployment rate ranked fourth lowest in both her first year in office and her last, and even when it rose, it remained among the country’s lowest. But, Hassan cited the state’s unemployment rate as evidence the state doesn’t need an income or sales tax. For purposes of this check, we wanted to look at the connection between taxes and unemployment rates to see if there’s a link as Hassan suggests. Analysts say there’s no direct correlation. Across the country, tax policy may contribute to a strong jobs environment, but a variety of other, more local factors likely weigh heavier in determining the unemployment rate, according to Scott Drenkard, an economist with the business-backed Tax Foundation. "New Hampshire fits with the pattern of having low unemployment and having a good tax system, but there are lots of contributing factors," Drenkard said. "I can't say there's a very robust correlation (with the tax structure)." Among the other states that rank among the lowest unemployment rates, for instance, Idaho, Vermont and Virginia all have both income and sales taxes. Hawaii, which had the nation’s lowest unemployment rate, had the nation’s highest income tax rate in 2005 and 2006, Hassan’s first two years in office, according to the Tax Foundation. In New Hampshire, factors such as the state’s small population, its lack of big population centers and its demographics -- older and educated -- contribute heavily to its strong employment, according to Dennis Delay, an economist with the New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies. "For an older population, they're more likely to have jobs and hold on to jobs than the younger population is," Delay said. Further, New Hampshire features strong manufacturing and health care sectors, among others, that keep employment strong, even in economic downturns, said Annette Nielsen, an economist for the state Employment Security office. "It’s a whole mix of things. We have fairly strong high-tech manufacturing, and that combined with not a huge population, it doesn’t take a whole lot to create (good employment numbers)," Nielsen said. Put more succinctly, "There’s no real connection between unemployment and tax structure," said Jon Shure, director of state fiscal strategies at the national Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank. "The key thing to creating jobs in any state is to make sure that you're investing in infrastructure, transportation, health care, all the components of a strong economy. … It’s not necessarily taxes." Our ruling: New Hampshire’s unemployment rate fluctuated a little through Hassan’s tenure. But, even as it reached No. 7 among states in 2006 and No. 8 in 2007, New Hampshire’s rate remained among the country’s lowest. And, by the time Hassan left office in 2010, New Hampshire’s rate had returned to fourth, where it stood in her first year. We’ll give the new governor credit for getting her numbers right (mostly). But, her stated connection between the unemployment rate and New Hampshire’s tax structure doesn’t hold up. Analysts in New Hampshire and around the country suggest that other factors -- including states’ size, demographics and work base -- drive unemployment more than taxes. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-14686	Says Bernie Sanders’ health care plan would "empower Republican governors to take away Medicaid, to take away health insurance for low-income and middle-income working Americans."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/14/chelsea-clinton/chelsea-clinton-mischaracterizes-bernie-sanders-he/	Hitting the campaign trail on her mother’s behalf, Chelsea Clinton attacked Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders’ universal health care plan. "Sen. Sanders wants to dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the CHIP program, dismantle Medicare, and dismantle private insurance," Clinton said in New Hampshire Jan. 12. "I don't want to empower Republican governors to take away Medicaid, to take away health insurance for low-income and middle-income working Americans. And I think very much that's what Sen. Sanders' plan would do." The Sanders campaign and his supporters swiftly called Clinton’s statements inaccurate, so we decided to look into them ourselves — in particular, her claim that Sanders’ plan would "empower" governors "to take away health insurance for low-income and middle-income working Americans." Given that Sanders’ proposed plan specifically calls health insurance an entitlement for all, we found that this is a mischaracterization at best. Sanders hasn’t released a health care proposal as a presidential candidate, but his campaign has said a bill he introduced in the Senate in 2013 would serve as the model. Sanders has called the plan "Medicare for all," referring to the the health safety net that covers those over 65. Clinton has a point that enacting the law would disrupt health insurance as we know it, said Gerald Friedman, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who has analyzed similar proposals. The bill, the American Health Security Act of 2013, specifically strips insurance benefits from the Affordable Care Act, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, Medicare and Medicaid. The bill also bans the sale of private health insurance that duplicates benefits provided by the government program. And she is also right that states would be the primary administrators of the system. The bill calls it a "state-based American Health Security Program." However, the assertion that it would empower Republican governors to take away individual’s health insurance is misleading. Sanders’ plan requires states to set up the specifics of their health care system, though they must meet federal standards for various administrative details. For example, states must identify a single agency to manage the program. If a state does not set up a system, or if they refuse to meet the federal standards, the federal government will step in and run that state’s program. Clinton’s comments seem to be based on how many Republican governors have reacted to the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, deciding not to accept an expansion of Medicaid, the government insurance program for low-income individuals. The Sanders’ campaign said the provision that allows the federal government to step in and run state programs would prevent governors who oppose the law from refusing to provide health coverage for their residents or offering subpar programs. The bill also states that every U.S. resident "is entitled to benefits for health care services" and would require auto-enrollment at birth or at the point when someone becomes a legal resident. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s campaign told us that Chelsea Clinton’s point was that the law would get rid of all of the existing benefits — Obamacare, Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP, etc. — for everyone. That may be true, but Sanders’ health care seeks to immediately replace all of these programs, as well as attempt to cover all those currently uninsured. That would be a federal-level change, rather than governors choosing to scrap those federal programs, and Sanders’ bill does make an effort to establish measures to circumvent the states that try to undermine the law. It sounds like Clinton is saying that millions would be left totally uninsured as a result of Sanders' plan giving more authority to governors, which isn't the case. "Her claim is analogous to saying that Medicare dismantled private insurance for the elderly," said David Himmelstein, co-founder of Physicians for a National Health Program and an advocate for a national health insurance system. "It replaced defective private coverage with something better." Hillary Clinton’s campaign also emphasized that at the very least, state governments could administer the program in such a way that they provide low-quality insurance compared to other states, such as by limiting reimbursement rates for providers. The campaign noted that Sanders' bill says the federal government must fund between 81 and 91 percent of each state’s program, so if a state doesn't cover the remaining costs, that could affect the services provided. One final note: It’s not at all clear that Sanders’ plan would pay for itself or be practical to implement. (We explored those issues in a separate story.) And his plan would certainly get rid of many existing programs. But Chelsea Clinton attacked the plan for one area that seems pretty clear, and that’s its coverage provisions. The plan’s defining feature is that it offers health insurance coverage to every American. Our ruling Chelsea Clinton said Sanders’ health care plan would "empower" governors "to take away health insurance for low-income and middle-income working Americans." Under Sanders’ plan, Americans would lose their current health insurance. However, his proposal would replace their health insurance and cover the currently uninsured. The program would auto-enroll every citizen and legal resident, all of whom would be entitled to benefits. While the plan would give governors authority to administer health insurance within their states, it includes provisions to allow federal authorities to take over if the governors refuse to implement it. It’s impossible to predict with certainty how Sanders’ plan would play out in real life. But Clinton’s statement makes it sound like Sanders’ plan would leave many people uninsured, which is antithetical to the goal of Sanders’ proposal: universal health care. We rate her claim Mostly False.	None	Chelsea Clinton	None	None	None	2016-01-14T14:59:30	2016-01-12	['United_States', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Bernie_Sanders']
pomt-07590	"Withheld union dues fund half of Dem (Democratic) campaigns in Florida."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2011/mar/25/grover-norquist/anti-tax-leader-grover-norquist-said-union-dues-fu/	Grover Norquist, whom a Miami Herald writer recently called the "the high priest of anti-taxation," is interjecting himself -- accidentally or on purpose -- into a debate over whether Florida governments should collect union dues through automatic payroll deduction. Norquist, the president and founder of the group Americans for Tax Reform, went to his Twitter account on March 24, 2011, to praise Gov. Rick Scott's decision to sign a bill that would link teachers' raises to their students' performance on end-of-year exams. But in his support for the signing of SB 736, Norquist also touched on another hot-button issue being considered by the Florida Legislature -- "paycheck protection." Rep. Chris Dorworth, R-Lake Mary, and Sen. John Thrasher, R-St. Augustine, have offered HB 1021 and its companion SB 830, which would prohibit public-sector unions from using automatic payroll deductions to collect union dues. The bills also would require union members to sign an authorization each year allowing the union to use their dues for political purposes. The bill passed the House 73-40 on March 25, and is awaiting action in the Senate. Dorworth and Thrasher have argued that the legislation will empower union members because it gives them more control over how their money is spent. Thrasher also has claimed that eliminating payroll deductions would save government resources, a notion PolitiFact Florida found Barely True. Norquist offered a more pointed, and political effect of the legislation. "FYI," he wrote. "Withheld union dues fund half of Dem (Democratic) campaigns in Florida." That's an awfully big number. So, FYI, we decided to check it out. We sent e-mails to Norquist, who has talked to us before, and his spokesman John Kartch but did not hear back. The not-for-profit, nonpartisan National Institute on Money in State Politics is the only organization that we know of that analyzes and organizes state-level campaign contributions for all 50 states. The institute separates campaign donations received by party, and also 19 different industry sectors. In 2010, Florida state candidates received a total of $332 million in contributions, according to the institute. Of that sum, $89 million went to Democrats and $195 million went to Republicans (the remainder went to third-party candidates or ballot measures). One of the industry sectors that the institute uses is classified as "labor" and is made up of general trade unions, public-sector unions and transportation unions. Contributions classified as "labor" went heavily to Democrats, according to the institute. But nowhere near the percentage that Norquist suggested. Labor contributed a total of $13.8 million to Florida political campaigns in 2010 -- $10.2 million to Democrats, about $1 million to Republicans and the rest to third-party candidates or campaigns for ballot measures. That translates to about 11 percent of total Democratic donations -- way lower than Norquist said. Moreover, he said "union dues" were funding 50 percent of Democratic campaigns. The institute's 11 percent figure includes direct contributions made by unions through dues, but it also attempts to include members of unions who contributed individually, either on top of or in lieu of their union dues. It also includes "union" contributions that are made to candidates from a separate political fund that members participate in voluntarily, said Doug Martin, lobbyist and political director the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees in Florida. The biggest union contributor was the Florida Education Association, which spent $4.1 million in 2010 ($3.5 million of it on Democrats). As its name suggests, the National Institute on Money in State Politics only covers state races and does not cover races for the U.S. House or U.S. Senate. We were not able to find as good a way to track donations to Florida Democrats in federal races. The Center for Responsive Politics reported that during the 2009-2010 federal campaign season, Democratic candidates in Florida received a total $35.9 million (compared to $48.7 million for Republicans). But the center doesn't parse out donations to political party by sector. We were able to examine a few specific candidates, including the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate in 2010, Kendrick Meek, who raised about $9 million. According to the center, lawyers and law firms contributed more to Meek than any other industry, about $1 million. The "education" industry, which would include education unions, contributed about $106,000. Building trade unions contributed an additional $75,000. Ron Klein, who raised around $4 million in his unsuccessful attempt to win re-election to the U.S. House, received $75,000 from public-sector unions, $67,000 from public trade unions and about $50,000 from transportation unions. In both cases, not chump change. But hardly half of what the candidates raised. Norquist said union dues fund half of Democratic campaigns in Florida. While unions predominantly donate to Democrats, according to research from the National Institute on Money in State Politics, there's no evidence union dues fund anywhere close to half of state Democratic campaigns. About 11 percent of all contributions to state-level Democrats came from unions and their members, but not even all of that came from dues. Some of the contributions are made individually by members. Others are pooled through voluntary political action committees. This claim is way off. We rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-08043	"Rhode Island has the highest percentage of uninsured adults of any state in New England."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jan/04/marie-ghazal/health-clinic-executive-says-rhode-island-has-high/	The cost of health care is a huge issue for everyone. If you have health insurance, the chances are excellent that you've seen your costs, along with co-payments and deductibles, go up significantly. If you don't have health insurance, the bill you get from your doctor or hospital is strikingly higher than what people with health insurance are charged. That's because insurance companies negotiate deep discounts that uninsured people never see. And because people who don't have insurance are seven times more likely to skip the care they need, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, that typically makes your care more expensive when you do seek it. If, on top of everything else, you can't pay for that care and a hospital provides it for free, as a hospital is obligated to do, those costs are passed on to everyone else. So it caught our attention when Marie Ghazal, chief executive officer of the Rhode Island Free Clinic, the Providence nonprofit organization that treats the uninsured, began an opinion column in The Providence Journal by asserting that "Rhode Island has the highest percentage of uninsured adults of any state in New England." She stated that between 13.9 percent and 21.4 percent of residents are not insured, which translates to 139,000 to 214,000 Rhode Islanders. We wondered if our ranking was really that poor, and why the range was so large. When we contacted Ghazal, she said she got the information from a story in the Providence Business News. The article gives no specific numbers for Rhode Island or most other states. It was based on a map developed by the CDC that breaks the states into three categories: those having the highest proportion of people with health insurance, those having the lowest and those in between. Rhode Island -- like New York, New Jersey, Ohio, Virginia and most of the states in the Midwest -- is in the in-between category. Ghazal said our rate of uninsured adults was 13.9 percent to 21.4 percent because, as it turns out, that's how the CDC defined the in-between group. We asked if she had specific numbers. She said she didn't. So we went searching. When we contacted CDC, they directed us to state-by-state numbers, as collected by Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a telephone survey that counts how many people are without health insurance at the time of the call. According to the BRFSS statistics, which served as the basis for the map cited by Ghazal, the 2009 telephone survey of 4,318 Rhode Islands found that the percentage of uninsured adults in Rhode Island was 14.2 percent, below the national average of 16.9 percent. Thirty-two states had a lower rate of health insurance coverage than Rhode Island. The worst rate was in Texas, where 29.1 percent of the population was not covered. In 15 states, at least 20 percent of the adult population younger than 65 was without health insurance. But we found something else while digging into the numbers. The margin of error in the survey was plus or minus 1.9 percentage points. If you ignore the margin of error, it is true that Rhode Island had the highest rate of uninsured adults in New England. Maine, where 13.7 percent were uninsured, was closest to Rhode Island. But that's a difference of only 0.5 percentage points. Massachusetts, in contrast, had the lowest rate of uninsured -- 6.2 percent -- because the Bay State has mandatory health insurance. However, if you consider the margin of error in the poll, we could rank ahead of New Hampshire (where 13.1 were uninsured) and Maine. For additional context, we looked at the percentages going back to 1995 (excluding 2001 and 2002, two years when the survey results are not on the National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention & Health Promotion website). It turns out that in 2004, the level of uninsured in Rhode Island was a bit higher -- 14.4 percent; 15 years ago it was at about 13 percent. The rate did dip to 11.7 percent in the 1998 survey but, in general, the numbers have stayed consistent. By any measure, that's still a lot of people walking around without health insurance. Ultimately, if you ignore the margin of error, Ghazal is correct about our ranking compared with other New England states. But if you take that into account, its possible that her statement could be inaccurate. More importantly, she's making a selective comparison. When you compare us with the rest of the country, we're better than average. Because of those omissions, we rate her statement Mostly True.

pomt-13817	"Do you know what the second sport with the most concussions is? Women’s soccer… And the third most dangerous sport? Cheerleading."	half-true	/texas/statements/2016/jul/15/drew-brees/drew-brees-says-womens-soccer-cheerleading-pose-co/	Drew Brees, the New Orleans Saints quarterback headed into his 16th NFL season, insists he doesn’t fret about concussions. But the Austin native, who led the Westlake High School Chaparrals to a state football championship in 1996, stirred our curiosity in his June 2016 interview with Kirk Bohls of the Austin American-Statesman when he said: "Do you know what the second sport with the most concussions is? Women’s soccer. But do you see anyone telling their daughters not to play soccer? And the third most dangerous sport? Cheerleading. You understand the risk with every sport you play." Our attempts to draw Brees’ backup information failed. But we took him to be saying women’s soccer and cheerleading rank second and third, respectively, in the incidence of concussions. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, we confirmed that football consistently poses the greatest concussion risks. Women's or girls soccer, which has surged in popularity since the 1980s, often places a distant second by this metric, we found, with the chances of a concussion from cheerleading much lower. Women's soccer As we looked into the soccer portion of Brees' claim, experts pointed out a 2014 report, "Sports-related Concussions in Youth," sponsored by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention with backing from the National Football League, the Department of Defense and the National Institutes of Health. The report, collating several studies, said: "Soccer, lacrosse, and basketball are associated with the highest rates of reported concussions for U.S. female athletes at the high school and college levels." A report chart shows that according to four studies of concussions in sports, football consistently placed first with six to 11.2 concussions per 10,000 "athletic exposures," a term meaning the number of practices and competitions in which an individual actively participates (i.e., in which he or she is exposed to the possibility of athletic injury). Significantly, two of the cited studies showed women’s soccer with the second-highest concussion rate, 3.6 or 3.5 per 10,000 athletic exposures while the sport was close to No. 2 in the other studies. Per one study, men’s lacrosse had higher concussion rates and in the other, men’s hockey and men’s and women’s lacrosse had higher rates. The chart: SOURCE: Chart in report, "Sports-related Concussions in Youth," National Academies Press, 2014 In a 2015 report, Dawn Comstock, a professor at the Colorado School of Public Health, and others synthesized nearly 50 studies to pinpoint the causes of concussions among American youth soccer players. According to a summary, the authors found that contact with another player was the most common cause with heading the ball the reason for 25 percent of concussions among girls. We reached out to Comstock for more perspective. By phone, she told us that a general factor to acknowledge is the likelihood of female athletes more likely revealing concussion symptoms because females are more likely than males to discuss health-related issues. "We honestly don’t know if girl soccer players are sustaining more concussions than boy ice hockey and lacrosse players or if they’re just more likely to be diagnosed because they’re more likely to report their symptoms," Comstock said. Cheerleading The 2014 national report says of cheerleading: "Concussions and other closed-head injuries account for 4 to 6 percent of all cheerleading injuries," a conclusion attributed to a "policy statement" from the American Academy of Pediatrics, "Cheerleading injuries: Epidemiology and recommendations for prevention." But the 2012 statement says concussion rates in cheerleading, 0.6 per 10,000 athletic exposures, have been relatively low compared with other girls’ high school sports such as soccer (3.6), basketball (1.6-2.1), lacrosse (2.0), softball (0.7-1.1), and field hockey (1.0). Troubling note: From 1998 to 2008, the academy says, concussion rates in cheerleading increased by 26 percent a year, greater than any of the other girls sports studied. "Concussion rates increase with age and competitive level," the statement says, "likely because of the increasing difficulty of stunts." The 26 percent figure traces to a regional 2011 study of concussions among high school boys and girls in a dozen sports in 25 Fairfax County, Virginia schools from 1997-98 through 2007-08. In that study, football and girls soccer posed far greater concussion risks. By a wide margin, football ranked first in total concussions with 1,407 or 53 percent of all the tallied concussions. Considerably behind in second place was boys’ lacrosse, which accounted for 244 concussions, 9 percent of the total--with girls’ soccer landing third with 195 concussions, 7 percent of the total. Football also had the highest concussion rate, the study says, with 6.0 concussions for every 10,000 athletic exposures. Among the studied girls sports, the concussion rate for girls soccer, 3.5/10,000 AEs, far outpaced the 0.6 rate for cheerleading--with the latter having the lowest rate of the girls sports including basketball, lacrosse, field hockey and softball. By phone, the study’s lead author, Andrew Lincoln, director of the MedStar Sports Medicine Research Center, told us that while cheerleading can be dangerous, its concussion rate is low. Lincoln pointed us to the North Carolina-based National Center for Catastrophic Sports Injury which issued a 2015 report indicating that from fall 1982 through spring 2014, female cheerleading ranked only behind football, in U.S. high schools, for its number of "direct catastrophic events," meaning severe injuries such as fractured vertebra to incidents resulting in paralysis or even death. Worse, once the number of participants in each sport is factored in, cheerleading ranked No. 1 for its rate of such events. Among college sports, the report said, football had the highest number of direct catastrophic events, followed by female cheerleading and baseball. We heard more about cheerleading risks from Chris Nowinski of the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at the Boston University School of Medicine. By email, Nowinski pointed out a May 2014 analysis on FiveThirtyEight.com that quoted Comstock saying: "Cheerleading is not nearly as dangerous a sport as some of the previous research painted it to be." Comstock’s focus was on concussions. Among a set of high school athletes tracked across 20 sports from 2008 through 2010, Comstock said, cheerleading had the 10th-highest concussion rate. An accompanying chart indicates 1.4 concussions per 10,000 AEs for cheerleading. In contrast, football had a 6.4 rate, per the chart, girls soccer had a 3.4 rate--and five boys sports plus girls lacrosse, field hockey, basketball and softball each had higher concussion rates than cheerleading. A wrinkle: Cheerleading was the only sport in the study with a higher risk of concussion in practice (1.4 per 10,000 AEs) than in competition (1.2 per 10,000)--a result Comstock attributed to cheerleading not widely being recognized as a sport, hence subject to practices in parking lots and on other sketchy surfaces. Comstock, asked for the latest data, told us that across 22 high school sports in 2014-15, football games by far accounted for the highest concussion rates. For every 10,000 players in a given Friday night’s games, she said, 31 sustained a concussion. In second place came girls soccer, she said, with about 21 of every 10,000 players on a given game night sustaining concussions. Far less frequent were concussions among participants in cheerleading competitions, Comstock said, at a rate of 1.8 for every 10,000 AEs. The professor also pointed us to a 2015 study she helped author stating that from 2009-10 through 2013-14, concussions were nationally the most common cheerleading injury even though concussion rates were significantly lower than in other sports. Our ruling Brees said: "Do you know what the second sport with the most concussions is? Women’s soccer… And the third most dangerous sport? Cheerleading." Football by far poses the greatest concussion risks, studies show, with women’s/girls soccer often placing a distant second. Cheerleading poses risks too, more so in practices, yet concussion chances are relatively slight compared to numerous sports. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-11794	Says Doug Jones "is for full-term abortion."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/21/kayla-moore/moores-wife-coins-new-anti-abortion-term-attack-hi/	As Alabama Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore wrestles with accounts of sexual encounters with underaged teens, his Democratic opponent faces political attacks about abortion. Doug Jones is unabashedly pro-abortion rights, and Moore’s wife Kayla spoke at a rally in Montgomery, Ala., about his position. Reading from a prepared statement, Moore called Jones "an ultra-liberal." "Who was an Obama delegate," she said of Jones on Nov. 17. "Who is for full-term abortion? Who is for more gun restrictions? Who is for transgender bathrooms? Who is for transgender in the military?" The list continued, but we wanted to look at whether Jones is for full-term abortions. First of all, while the phrase "late-term abortion" is familiar, "full-term abortion" is not. We asked the Moore campaign what Kayla Moore meant. "Kayla was referring to Doug's statement on Chuck Todd (on Meet the Press) where he refused to support an abortion ban after 20 weeks," said Hannah Ford, deputy campaign manager. We’ll take a look at that Meet the Press segment, as well as another interview Jones gave to Alabama newspapers when he talked about late-term abortion law. Regarding "full-term abortion," Moore has used a phrase that virtually didn’t exist before she said it. Key interview No. 1 Jones appeared on MSNBC’s Meet the Press in late September. Near the end, host Chuck Todd pressed him on abortion. Here’s the full exchange: Todd: "What are the limitations that you believe should be in the law when it comes to an abortion?" Jones: "I am a firm believer that a woman should have the freedom to choose what happens to her own body. And I’m going to stand up for that, and I’m going to make sure that continues to happen. I want to make sure that as we go forward, people have access to contraception, they have access to the abortion that they might need, if that's what they choose to do. I think that’s an issue that we can work with and talk to people about on both sides of the aisle." Todd: "So you wouldn't be in favor of legislation that said, ban abortion after 20 weeks or something like that?" Jones: "I'm not in favor of anything that is going to infringe on a woman's right and her freedom to choose. That's just the position that I've had for many years. It's a position I continue to have. But I want people to understand that once that baby is born, I’m going to be there for that child. That’s where I become a right-to-lifer." Key interview No. 2 Jones added more detail to his position on abortion in a Nov. 2 interview with AL.com. "I fully support a woman's freedom to choose to what happens to her own body," Jones said. "Having said that, the law for decades has been that late-term procedures are generally restricted except in the case of medical necessity. That's what I support. I don't see any changes in that." Jones had said largely the same thing in mid October in a statement released by the campaign. "This is a deeply personal decision," the statement said. "I support the current law on a woman’s freedom to choose, which has been in place for decades, where late-term abortions are permitted to protect the life or health of the mother." While Jones spoke of late-term abortions, the phrase itself has no fixed legal definition. Broadly speaking, the term refers to a dividing line set at different points in different states. Before that point (20 weeks post-fertilization in Alabama, for example) a woman can have an abortion for any reason. After that point, she can have one only if her life is endangered or her physical health is severely compromised. So Jones has said he supports laws that allow abortions beyond a certain number of weeks in order to protect the health of the mother. Fuzzy language The Moore campaign’s definition of what qualifies as a full-term abortion — meaning, abortions that occur after 20 weeks — does not match the medical definition. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a full-term pregnancy falls between 39 weeks of gestation to 40 weeks and six days. That span falls well beyond the 18 to 25 weeks set by state law that determine when abortion restrictions apply. From the earliest days when the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed abortion’s legality based on the rights of the mother, fetal viability has helped define the dividing line. But as medical knowledge has pushed back the time when a premature infant can survive, the breakpoint has changed. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists focuses on the period in which independent life outside the womb is at tipping point. In 2017, a panel of doctors determined that period ranges from as early as 20 weeks after fertilization to just under 26 weeks. In that span, "outcomes range from certain or near-certain death to likely survival with a high likelihood of serious morbidities." In common parlance, anything beyond 20 or 25 weeks is often referred to as a late-term abortion. So where does Moore’s use of full-term abortion fit? And Jones’ use of late-term? "I have not heard the phrase ‘full-term abortion’ used in the debates over abortion, but neither have I heard the phrase ‘late-term’ abortion used without specifying gestational limits," said O. Carter Snead, associate professor of law at the University of Notre Dame. "They are both speaking in more colloquial terms rather than using terms of art deployed in the legal and political debates." That said, the use of the phrase late-term abortion empirically is far more common. A Nexis search for it between New Year’s Day 2017 and the day before Moore gave her speech produced 569 hits. The same search for full-term abortion produced one. It was in a letter to the editor that appeared in a Maine newspaper. Law professor I. Glenn Cohen at Harvard University said he hadn’t heard the term and found it "puzzling." Lisa Harris, a physician who studies abortion practice, law, policy and ethics at the University of Michigan Medical School, said " ‘full-term abortion’ is not a term I have heard before, and doesn’t exist as a matter of routine practice." "If there's a reason someone needs to deliver early, then you induce labor, or you perform a C-section," she said. Harris said the only situation that might match Moore’s "full-term abortion" are rare cases of third trimester abortion. "Third trimester abortions are incredibly infrequent," Harris said. "My understanding is that these are difficult and unusual situations that generally involve a fetal anomaly that makes life untenable for the fetus." At its roots, abortion law sorts out the moral rules during the time when the baby depends on the mother for survival. The idea of full-term abortion lies beyond that window of time. By definition, at full-term a baby without significant anomalies is able to survive outside the womb. Our ruling Kayla Moore said Jones is for full-term abortion. The language of the abortion debate is imprecise, but the phrase "full-term abortion" had virtually no track-record before Moore said it. Jones said he supports laws that allow abortions after 20 weeks or so of gestation, commonly known as late-term abortions, to protect a mother’s life or health. He hasn’t addressed a situation that, in the view of a leading medical researcher, doesn’t exist in practice. Moore measured Jones against a term that is disconnected from reality.

pomt-08487	"For the first time in history, Wisconsin has more government jobs than manufacturing jobs."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/oct/11/leah-vukmir/gop-state-senate-candidate-leah-vukmir-says-wiscon/	Ever since achieving statehood in 1848, Wisconsin has stood proudly as a Goliath of manufacturing: Milwaukee became "the machine shop of the world," Green Bay was home to the world’s largest cheese maker, an internationally known steam valve manufacturer emerged in La Crosse. The Badger State remains a national leader in making things, with manufacturing providing jobs to 15 percent of the workforce. But recent decades have been marked by factory shutdowns, including the loss of one of every four manufacturing jobs since 2000. In several 2010 races for the state Senate, the decline in manufacturing has been highlighted by Republicans, including state Rep. Leah Vukmir of Wauwatosa. Her challenge to Democratic Sen. Jim Sullivan, also of Wauwatosa, is one of several races that could determine whether Democrats keep control of the Senate. "For the first time in history," Vukmir declares in a flier that she distributes door to door in the district, "Wisconsin has more government jobs than manufacturing jobs." Such a statistic, if true, would indicate a profound change in the very complexion of the state. Vukmir, according to her campaign staff, based her statement on a December 2009 article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The article was about a state Department of Workforce Development report on unemployment in the previous month. The report said the state had 438,200 government jobs (federal, state and local, including schools) in November 2009. That was 2,400 more than the 435,800 jobs in manufacturing. The article went on to say government employment had exceeded manufacturing employment in April and May of 2009, as well. Those developments were notable because, on an annual basis, manufacturing jobs exceeded government jobs in every year since 1966, which is as far back as the state statistics go. In her flier, Vukmir presented the change as a done deal. But the reality is much fuzzier. Picture it as a race, with two runners taking turns as the leader. Our review of more recent monthly data showed that November 2009 was the first of seven consecutive months in which government jobs outpaced manufacturing jobs. That ended in May 2010. But manufacturing regained the lead in June through August 2010. September numbers have not yet been released. As for annual figures, which are more telling and the common measuring stick, in 2009 manufacturing employment outpaced government employment by 10,800 jobs. It remains to be seen where 2010 winds up. There are many factors at work when it comes to what is happening in the Wisconsin labor market. Beyond the long-term trends, the recession hit manufacturing jobs hard, while government employment has been supported by federal stimulus money aimed at preventing layoffs. Additionally, the count of manufacturing jobs has been artificially low in recent years, according to state labor economist Dennis Winters, because factories are hiring more temporary workers. The state classifies temporary workers as service employees, even if they work in manufacturing. So, where does that leave us? To press her case that more needs to be done to help create private-sector jobs, state Senate candidate Leah Vukmir said that for the first time in history, government jobs outnumber manufacturing jobs in Wisconsin. At various points in 2009, that was indeed the case -- though for the year as a whole, manufacturing jobs narrowly led. The jury is still out for 2010, though manufacturing jobs lead in five of the first eight months of the year. We rate Vukmir’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-00725	"Fifteen years ago, you couldn't even get a pizza delivered in that neighborhood."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/apr/24/sabino-pio-renteria/councilman-sabino-renteria-says-15-years-ago-pizza/	East Austin neighborhoods near downtown Austin north of Lady Bird Lake have gentrified rapidly, the Austin Chronicle noted in a recent cover story. "The lower Eastside is increasingly dotted with high-end restaurants and chic bars where homes once stood. Many residents seem surprised at the brisk pace of new development," reporter Tony Cantú wrote, going on to say the "transformation" started in the early 2000s. There’s ample additional detail. But we chewed on a comment by Sabino "Pio" Renteria, a resident elected to the District 3 seat on the Austin City Council in November 2014. After mention of the area’s fluctuating home values, Renteria indicated conditions have noticeably changed. "Fifteen years ago," he said, "you couldn't even get a pizza delivered in that neighborhood." Really? To our request for elaboration, Renteria, who lives near Martin Middle School, told us he was referring to the largely residential blocks just east of downtown Austin, specifically the region bounded by Interstate 35 to the west, the lake to the south, Pleasant Valley Road to the east and East Seventh Street to the north, all of which was considered too dangerous for pizza deliveries 15 years ago and earlier, he said by phone. If he wanted a pizza delivered, Renteria said, he had to meet the delivery driver in the parking lot of the lakeside Holiday Inn on the west side of I-35, then drive his pie the several blocks home. "No one wanted to come into the Eastside," he said. Varied accounts We gathered a range of recollections while looking into this claim: --By phone, Zach Rogers said that in 1999-2000, he was a delivery driver for Pizza Classics, on 29th Street near the University of Texas, and his boss insisted he deliver pizzas everywhere; --Hoover Alexander, 60, who has a landmark restaurant on East Austin’s Manor Road, said by email that while he grew up north of Renteria’s neighborhood and north of 12th Street, "the collective black & brown neighbors east of IH 35, from the river to Manor Rd., knew we were in the ‘no delivery zone’ that stemmed from the belief that East Austin was unsafe & crime ridden, and there was a fear of drivers getting robbed. Rightly or wrongly, the perception became the reality of no deliveries." Alexander specified: "No pizza delivery for my neighborhood for sure until '00 - '05," so Alexander would drive about five minutes west to pick up orders. --Jane and Gilberto Rivera, residents of East Austin’s Rosewood neighborhood, north of Renteria’s area, recalled not being able to lure a pizza delivery through the 1990s, though they said it’s possible that changed by 2000. Gilberto Rivera said pizza places on East Riverside Drive south of the lake would hand off their order at a gas station near the Holiday Inn, "almost like a drug transaction." Eventually pizza was delivered from a Pizza Hut on Airport Boulevard, he said. Jane Rivera said: "You can safely say that at least up until 2000, (in) all of East Austin, you could not get pizza delivered." --East Austin resident Todd Campbell said by phone he could recall not being able to get a pizza delivered to the home he shared with others at Second and Navasota in 2000. Then again, Eastside resident Marisol Prins described Mr. Gatti’s delivering to the area from its downtown location. Prins said pizza stores on Riverside wouldn’t deliver. --Down the street from Renteria’s home, we spoke with Ernest Vargas, 59, who said he couldn’t recall ever not being able to get a pizza delivered. He said his family, which bought its house in 1969, used to get pizzas delivered by Pizza Hut. --Close to I-35, on the western edge of the neighborhood, the principal of Sanchez Elementary School, Azucena Garcia, said by phone she couldn’t recall any trouble getting pizzas delivered over her 23 years at the school. Pizzas were brought by various stores, she said, with the school shopping for deals. By phone, another school employee, Jennifer Riojas-Santos, said that while living and working in the area in the 1990s, she experienced "very limited" pizza delivery options--including a Pizza Hut south of the lake, she said. On first pass, then, it appears that pizzas weren’t uniformly delivered in East Austin at some time in the past. Checking telephone books We couldn’t devise a wayback machine for checking 2000-era deliveries. But we test-kitchened an approach by visiting the Austin History Center to pinpoint pizza places that were then arguably close enough to Renteria’s neighborhood to bring a pie. Telephone books for 1999-2000, one published by Southwestern Bell and the other by Great Western Directories, Inc., listed more than 30 Austin pizza restaurants at the time with several saying they delivered--including Domino’s, Little Caesars, and Papa John’s. We also identified a pizza place in Renteria’s neighborhood at the time, La Pizza Loca, which was at 2727 East Seventh. In 1996, in fact, the Chronicle’s food critics credited La Pizza Loca with having the "best eastside delivery." The critics also said: "As those of us who reside east of I-35 can attest, options are pretty slim where dinner delivery is concerned." Otherwise, according to the phone books, pizza places with delivery closest to Renteria’s neighborhood were downtown west of I-35 (a Pizza Hut at 1201 W. Sixth St.) or along Riverside south of the lake (where University of Texas students already filled multiple apartment complexes): specifically, a Doubledave’s Pizzawork; a Pizza Hut; a Mr. Gatti’s; and a Little Caesars. Noted: Phone-book ads for Papa John’s and Domino’s said delivery wasn’t available everywhere. The Domino’s ad said: "Delivery area limited to ensure safe driving. Our drivers carry less than $20.00." In contrast, Mr. Gatti’s, which had more than 20 Austin-area locations, touted its phone number as the "one number that’s good for pickup and delivery all over Austin." Spokesman: Gatti’s ‘would have delivered’ We tried to reach representatives of the identified pizza stores; most didn’t engage. But by phone and email, a Gatti’s spokesman insisted its stores on East Riverside and West Sixth made deliveries throughout the Eastside in 1999 and 2000. Ronnie Steck said he’d confirmed that Gatti’s Pizza restaurant #160 on W 6th St. and Rio Grande opened in June 1999, closing in March 2014. "During that time," he wrote, "our delivery area extended west to the lake in the" Tarrytown area "and all the way east to Pleasant Valley, easily encompassing the area in question. In addition, the Oltorf location we had at the time picked up any delivery needs that fell south of the #160 delivery area." "We’ve been serving pizza to people all throughout this great city for going on 46 years and we’ve certainly witnessed and marveled at the rapid change happening on the East side. That said, had Council Member Renteria called 459-2222, Gatti’s would have gladly delivered," Steck said. Asked if the pizza chain was concerned about the safety of its drivers in the neighborhood, Steck said not, adding: "That gentrification didn’t just happen yesterday." We alerted Renteria’s office to Steck’s comments and didn’t hear back from him. A store owner’s recollection To our inquiry, a founder and former owner of Austin’s Pizza, Clay McLaughlin, said by phone its first store opened in 1999 at 12th Street and West Avenue near the main campus of Austin Community College west of downtown Austin. McLaughlin said that store, like nearby competitors, did not deliver east of I-35. "We really tried to stay more toward campus," he said. "To be totally candid, I don’t know that was our market." Also, he said, "safety was definitely a concern. Going up to somebody’s house, cash in the pocket... we didn’t want to get any of our drivers in jeopardy," he said. Our ruling Renteria said that 15 years ago, you couldn’t get a pizza delivered in his neighborhood just east of downtown Austin. We see a dash of truth here; not every pizza place delivered there at the time and earlier, into the 1990s, you evidently couldn’t get a pizza delivered at all. But it looks to us like you could get a pizza delivered 15 years ago if you knew which vendors to call. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-00847	"In an average grocery store, roughly 75 percent of processed foods contain genetically modified organisms, or GMOs."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/mar/22/donna-nesselbush/sen-donna-nesselbush-three-quarters-processed-food/	There’s a longstanding campaign to require special labels for foods made from genetically modified organisms -- plants or animals created by precisely manipulating their DNA, in ways that don’t occur in nature. In Rhode Island, Sen. Donna Nesselbush, D-Pawtucket, has submitted legislation requiring such GMO labeling. "Are [genetically modified foods] good for us or bad for us? The problem is that we really don’t know," she asserted in a commentary supporting her legislation. "In an average grocery store, roughly 75 percent of processed foods contain genetically modified organisms, or GMOs." She made a similar comment in a news release, saying that most processed foods contain GMOs. There’s little solid evidence that foods made from genetically modified organisms pose a greater risk to consumers than their non-modified counterparts, a fact noted by major scientific organizations such as the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Medical Association and the World Health Organization. They have been on the shelves for nearly two decades. U.S. products have been approved for market by as many as three different federal agencies. Independent safety testing has been done in Europe. We were interested in whether these products have become as commonplace as Nesselbush says. But first, we note a distinction that will be important in evaluating part of Nesselbush’s claim. She references foods that contain genetically modified organisms, which sounds scary to many people. But in reality, GMO foods typically don’t contain organisms; they’re derived from organisms that have been genetically modified. For example, if you eat a genetically modified ear of corn, you’re eating the once-living cells of a genetically modified organism. But if you eat a brownie baked with corn syrup extracted from genetically modified corn, you’re only eating the syrup, not the organism. When we asked Nesselbush for a source, she didn’t have an immediate answer, saying that the information came from her staff. She promised to check further. In the meantime, we did our own research. It appears that the number, although widely reported, is mostly an educated guess. We contacted the Center for Food Safety, an advocacy group critical of biotechnology, which told PolitiFact National in 2007 that 60 to 70 percent of processed foods contain at least some residual genetically modified organisms. When we asked where their numbers came from, spokeswoman Abigail Seiler said they came from the Grocery Manufacturers Association, a trade group opposed to labeling for products manufactured through genetic modification. The latest grocery association statement says, "70-80 percent of the foods we eat in the United States, both at home and away from home, contain ingredients that have been genetically modified." When we heard back from Nesselbush, she cited the same statement as her evidence. We noted that the percentage is on target but her characterization wasn’t. The grocery association says it’s 70 to 80 percent of ALL foods we consume. She said it applies to processed foods in a grocery store. The federal Food and Drug Administration defines processed foods as "raw agricultural commodities" that have been "subject to canning, cooking, freezing, dehydration or milling." Processed foods also include any foods that are not raw agricultural commodities under the FDA’s legal definition. It turns out that there’s little consistency in how the estimate is used. For example, Whole Foods in 2010, citing the grocery association, said "GMOs are now present in 75 to 80 percent of conventional processed food in the U.S." (We’re not sure if there are "unconventional" processed foods.) And where does the grocery association get its figure? Spokesman Brian Kennedy said it was an estimate based on data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. We found updated numbers showing that in 2013, genetic engineering had been done on 90 percent of all cotton planted in the United States, 93 percent of all soybeans and 90 percent of all corn. Cottonseed and soybean oils are used in mayonnaise, salad dressings, cereals, breads and snack foods. Corn syrup is a widely used sweetener and corn starch is used in soups and sauces. "Also, more than half of the sugar sold in the U.S. comes from sugar beets," Kennedy said. "Sugar beets crops are 90 percent [genetically modified]." We asked the association to detail how it settled on the 70 to 80 percentage. Kennedy repeated that it was an estimate. "And it's important to keep in mind that these particular crops, though widely used, are not used in all processed food products. Plus you’re also overlooking all of the organic and non-GM processed food products on the market today," he said. John Ruff, past president of the Institute of Food Technologists, told us in an email that estimates of around 75 percent are widely quoted and are based on data from the late 1990s. "I’m not aware of any definitive studies, perhaps because the presence of GMO derived ingredients often cannot be detected in the finished product," he said. "This is because the GMO itself is not present in the product." Nesselbush is incorrect when she says that such foods contain genetically modified organisms. Often they only contain substances created by genetically modified organisms, such as sugars, which may be identical to the sugars created by non-modified plants. Our ruling Donna Nesselbush said, "In an average grocery store, roughly 75 percent of processed foods contain genetically modified organisms, or GMOs." Nesselbush quoted a percentage intended to apply to all foods and not restricted to processed foods. Although the figure is widely cited by both sides in the debate, it’s not clear that this is anything more than an estimate. And finally, in the cases of many processed foods created using the sugars, oils and other products of genetically modified organisms, the organisms themselves aren’t present in the food at all. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.

pomt-04845	"We actually made history in 2010. We came the closest in 24 years to defeating Frank Pallone."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/13/anna-little/congressional-candidate-anna-little-claims-she-mad/	Even though her 2010 bid to unseat U.S. Rep. Frank Pallone ended in defeat, Republican congressional candidate Anna Little says she still made history. As Little prepares for a rematch against Pallone in the Nov. 6 general election, the Monmouth County native has said the 2010 victory was his narrowest win in more than two decades. "We actually made history in 2010. We came the closest in 24 years to defeating Frank Pallone," Little, a former county freeholder and mayor, said in an Aug. 2 interview on NJToday. "We think we’ve got a great foundation and we want to pick up where we left off." The 2010 election did mark the closest Pallone victory in two decades, but it wasn’t exactly the historic outcome that Little described in her TV interview. As of 2010, the Democratic congressman was only first elected 22 years beforehand -- not "24 years," as Little claimed. Yet even over those 22 years, Pallone’s margin of victory in 2010 was not the closest. He had tighter victories in his first two elections for a two-year House seat. Here’s how the election results break down: When Republicans took control of the House in 2010, Pallone narrowly defeated Little by 16,520 votes to continue representing the Sixth Congressional District. Little’s candidacy was backed by the Tea Party movement, which played a key role in securing wins for GOP House candidates across the country. The close election in 2010 was a stark change from most of Pallone's preceding victories. Just in 2008, the congressman had won by more than 86,000 votes for the largest margin of victory in his career. In fact, the 2010 election represented the closest Pallone victory in 20 years. But in 1988 and 1990, the congressman faced even closer calls. Pallone defeated Republican Joseph Azzolina in 1988 by 9,545 votes for his first two-year term. In 1990, Pallone tallied 4,170 more votes than Republican Paul Kapalko. The following chart shows Pallone’s GOP challengers and margins of victory since winning his first two-year seat in 1988. Year Republican challenger Pallone’s margin of victory 2010 Anna Little 16,520 2008 Robert McLeod 86,608 2006 Leigh-Ann Bellew 55,076 2004 Sylvester Fernandez 83,039 2002 Ric Medrow 48,900 2000 Brian Kennedy 79,244 1998 Michael Ferguson 22,922 1996 Steven Corodemus 51,233 1994 Mike Herson 33,635 1992 Joseph Kyrillos 17,317 1990 Paul Kapalko 4,170 1988 Joseph Azzolina 9,545 For trivia buffs out there, you’ll notice that Kyrillos -- Pallone’s 1992 challenger -- is the GOP candidate for U.S. Senate this year, looking to unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez in the general election. Our ruling In a TV interview, Little claimed: "We actually made history in 2010. We came the closest in 24 years to defeating Frank Pallone." There’s no doubt that Pallone’s victory over Little in 2010 was one of the closest wins of his career, but the timing of Little’s claim is off. The congressman’s margin of victory represented his tightest win in 20 years -- not 24 years -- and the third-closest finish of all his races for a two-year House seat. Pallone won by even fewer votes in 1988 and 1990. We rate the statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Anna Little	None	None	None	2012-08-13T07:30:00	2012-08-02	['None']

pomt-01583	"Obama admin gutted @ProjChildSafe budget to provide trigger locks and safety kits."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/08/dana-loesch/loesch-obama-slashed-funding-gun-safety-program/	For well over a decade, gun owner groups have promoted the use of trigger locks to protect children from weapons around the home. One long-standing effort is Project Child Safe, run by the National Shooting Sports Foundation, the voice of gun makers, shooting ranges, and retailers. Conservative radio host and commentator Dana Loesch went to Twitter to berate President Barack Obama for neglecting this approach. "Obama admin gutted @ProjChildSafe budget to provide trigger locks and safety kits," Loesch tweeted Sept. 4, 2014. We wanted to see whether the current administration drove down spending for this particular trigger lock program. We emailed Loesch’s show for evidence to back up the statement, but we did not hear back. The senior vice president and general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, Lawrence Keane, explained that Project Child Safe is a nonprofit run by his group and is largely sustained by the foundation and private donations. But during the administration of President George W. Bush, it received a great deal of government support. "There was grant funding from the Department of Justice," Keane said. "There were a number of different grants. They varied in size. Over time, they totaled $90 million over 8 years." The foundation used the money to buy trigger locks and safety manuals. It partnered with over 15,000 state and local law enforcement agencies across all 50 states to distribute these safety kits for free to gun owners. Keane said since 2001, the program has provided over 36 million kits, with no government money going toward salaries or overhead. There’s no question the federal money is a fraction of what it was. Whether that happened on Obama’s watch is another matter. A more complicated picture We went to USA Spending, a government website that gives anyone the chance to see how federal agencies spend the taxpayers’ money. 2002 was the high-water mark for federal grants to the National Shooting Sports Foundation. That year, the Justice Department awarded it nearly $50 million to cover the costs of trigger locks and other safety materials. 2003 was also a strong year. Washington provided another $25 million. But as this chart shows, after that, the flow of government dollars to the foundation plummeted. In 2006, the Department of Justice gave the foundation $917,850. By 2008, the amount fell to $500,000. These declines took place under the Bush administration, three years before Obama took office. The chart also shows a shift in the federal agency that supported the distribution of safety kits. In 2009, the Department of Veterans Affairs began granting the National Shooting Sports Foundation to provide the kits to veterans. "The VA approached the National Shooting Sports Foundation because of concerns they had, and have, with returning vets having post-traumatic stress disorder," Keane said. Under the Obama administration, the VA provided the foundation about $3 million through 2012 to deliver about 1.5 million Project Child Safe safety kits, according to Keane. On an annual basis, that is slightly more than the amount spent in the last year of the Bush administration. Keane said the work with the VA is ongoing with an estimated additional $2 million in the pipeline. According to the Justice Department, the foundation had provided 32 million kits by 2005. In the seven years since, about 4 million kits have been delivered. Our ruling Loesch said that the Obama administration gutted the budget for Project Child Safe. In reality, the deepest cuts took place during the Bush years. Obama inherited a program funded at $500,000. In 2009, the funding agency changed from the Justice Department to Veterans Affairs. While the funding for Project Child Safe itself ended, the same kind of kits were distributed to peoples’ homes, although through different channels. Funding increased very slightly from the last year of the Bush administration. The work between the foundation and Veterans Affairs continues. We rate the claim False.

pomt-13880	Says Donald Trump’s proposed tax treatment of hedge fund managers "makes the current loophole even worse."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/01/hillary-clinton/clinton-right-say-trumps-plan-good-hedge-funders/	Hillary Clinton is attacking Donald Trump’s tax plan, saying it actually benefits the hedge fund managers Trump had promised to cut down to size. "Now, before releasing his plan, Trump said, ‘Hedge fund guys are getting away with murder.’ And he added, ‘They’ll pay more,’ " Clinton said. "Then his plan came out. And it actually makes the current loophole even worse. "It gives hedge-fund managers a special tax rate that’s lower than what many middle-class families pay," Clinton continued in the June 21, 2016, speech. "And I did have to look twice because I didn’t believe it. Under Donald Trump’s plan, these Wall Street millionaires will pay a lower tax rate than many working people." Trump’s plan does roll back one high-profile advantage for hedge fund partners. Is Clinton right to say they still come out ahead? Trump took an aggressive position on tax rates for hedge fund managers during his fight for the Republican nomination. In an interview with CBS in August, Trump called them "paper pushers" who "did not build this country." In a Republican debate in September, Trump said his tax plan would make them pay more. "The hedge fund guys won’t like me as much as they like me right now. I know them all, but they’ll pay more," Trump said. After the Republican debate, Trump released the outline of his tax plan. Trump’s plan eliminates the so-called carried interest tax loophole, which allows general partners in private investment firms (including most hedge fund managers) to treat some of their income as income from investments, or capital gains, subject to a top tax rate of 23.8 percent, instead of the much higher tax rate for ordinary income (43.4 percent). Under Trump’s plan, income from carried interest would no longer be treated as capital gains. Tax rates for ordinary income tops out at 25 percent under Trump’s plan. This looks like a hike in line with Trump’s promises. Except. Along with private equity and venture capital funds, many hedge funds are structured as partnerships. Under Trump’s plan, income through a business partnership is taxed at a rate of no more than 15 percent, significantly less than the 23.8 percent they previously paid, according to an analysis of Trump’s tax plan from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Eliminating the carried interest "loophole" actually helps these hedge fund managers under Trump’s plan. If carried interest was still treated as capital gains, it could be taxed at the top rate for capital gains in the plan (20 percent), higher than the fixed 15 percent tax for partnership income. Trump’s plan presents the discounted rate for partnership income as a way to help "the small businesses that are the true engine of our economy." It also helps large businesses and wealthy financiers who structure their businesses as partnerships, including the hedge funds managers he attacked in his campaign. Clinton also said that rates for hedge fund managers would be lower than for middle-class families under Trump’s plan. Defining the middle class can be tricky, but in the Pew Research Center’s range of $42,000 to $125,000 for a household of three in 2014, a substantial number of middle-class households would make enough to qualify for a marginal tax rate of more than 15 percent if Trump’s plan were enacted. Not all of these people would pay more than 15 percent overall, according to Bob Williams at the Tax Policy Center, and it would be difficult to say how many middle-income people would pay more than hedge fund managers once the many different variables involved played out. But some would, Williams wrote in an email. In May, Politico reported that the Trump campaign had engaged two economists to craft a new tax plan. The Trump campaign has not confirmed whether they plan to re-write their tax plan, and did not respond to Politico’s request for comment. The tax plan announced in September remains on Trump's website, and is the basis of this article. The Trump campaign did not respond to our request for comment on this article. Our ruling Clinton said Trump’s proposed tax rate for hedge fund managers "makes the current loophole even worse." She has a point. By setting a lower tax rate for income from business partnerships, Trump’s tax plan would benefit many hedge fund managers. Though the plan would cut tax rates for middle-class families as well, the cuts that would apply to most hedge fund managers are steeper and their resulting tax rate is lower. Trump promised that his tax plan would roll back advantages for hedge fund managers. Instead, in most cases, it would improve their position. We rate the statement True.

pomt-07855	More than one-quarter of America’s young adults are too fat to serve in the U.S. military	true	/georgia/statements/2011/feb/11/michelle-obama/michelle-obama-says-many-too-fat-fight-military/	America, the first lady says, has a pudgy problem. A significant percentage of its youths are too fat to fit in military uniforms. First lady Michelle Obama talked about the issue during her visit Wednesday to the Atlanta area to promote healthy eating. In a speech at Alpharetta’s North Point Community Church to highlight her "Let’s Move" healthy living campaign, Obama relayed a gaudy statistic. "Believe it or not, right now, nearly 27 percent of 17- to 24-year-olds are too overweight to serve in our military," she said. Perhaps the military needs its own "Biggest Loser" contest for recruits. AJC PolitiFact Georgia had another thought. Should we believe the first lady? Obama’s claim apparently came from a study released last year that was titled -- aptly perhaps -- "Too Fat to Fight." It was released by more than 100 high-ranking retired military officials and other enlisted leaders who want high-calorie food and sugar-sweetened drinks removed from the nation’s public schools. That doesn’t include sweet tea, does it? The report said: "over 27 percent of all Americans 17 to 24 years of age -- over nine million young men and women -- are too heavy to join the military if they want to do so." The estimate was based on a 2005 national survey conducted by the Lewin Group. "The estimate uses a weight-for-height cutoff that allows somewhat higher weights than the cutoff used by civilian organizations, such as the National Institutes of Health," the report said. In 2008, there were 11,472,200 Americans between the ages of 18 and 24 who were obese or overweight, the study reported, citing research by the Atlanta-based Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There were 29.8 million Americans between those ages, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. That equals nearly 39 percent of Americans in that age range who were obese or overweight, an even higher percentage than those found in the "Too Fat to Fight" study who couldn’t serve in the military. Stay away from the cheeseburger, soldier! Military officials say this is serious business. "The United States military stands ready to protect the American people, but if our nation does not help ensure that future generations grow up to be healthy and fit ... the health of our children and our national security are at risk," the report says. It also affects the federal budget. The military discharges about 1,200 recruits a year because they are not fit enough to serve. The military estimates it costs $50,000 to recruit and train a soldier. Add it up and that’s $60 million a year the federal government loses on enlistees too heavy to fight. The average American man is 5 foot 9 and weighs 195 pounds, according to the CDC. The average American woman is nearly 5 foot 4 and weighs 165 pounds. The mean height and weight for an 18-year-old man is 5 foot 9 and 166 pounds, according to the most recent data we could find. The mean height and weight and BMI for an 18-year-old woman is 5 foot 4 and 143.5 pounds. We couldn’t find data detailing the percentage of 18-year-olds who are overweight or obese. The CDC does report that 18 percent of 12- to 19-year-old Americans are obese. So what constitutes too fat to fight? Each military branch has its own rules. An 18-year-old, 5-foot-9 man who weighs more than 175 pounds would raise eyebrows for the Army, according to Military.com. The Army would be similarly concerned about a 5-foot-4, 18-year-old woman who weighs more than 133 pounds. For 40-year-old women that height, the Army would be worried if they weighed more than 145 pounds. The Air Force and Navy are a little easier on their enlistees. The Navy considers a 5-foot-9 man greater than 186 pounds overweight, and its maximum standard weight for a 5-foot-4 woman is 156 pounds. The Air Force says the maximum weight for a 5-foot-9 recruit is 186 pounds. A New York Times article in August highlighted the problem. One U.S. Army general said 4 percent of male recruits at one training center in 2000 failed the most basic fitness. By 2006, more than 20 percent of male recruits failed the same test. The percentages were higher for women. PolitiFact Georgia has tackled such weighty issues before. Before Thanksgiving, the American holiday of gastronomical gluttony, we checked a claim that Georgia has the second-highest rate of childhood obesity in the nation. Our finding? True. According to the CDC figures, the mean American 18-year-old is close to being considered overweight but would still be accepted in the military in most cases. But about one in five of them is considered obese, the CDC says, and would be at least 15 to 20 pounds too heavy to fight. Based on the CDC study, we believe it’s reasonable to think that at least an additional 7 percent of America’s remaining 17- to 24-year-olds would have trouble meeting the military’s weight guidelines. The "Too Fat to Fight" study supports the theory that 27 percent of America’s youths couldn’t serve in the military. We rate the first lady’s statement as True.

pomt-14763	Says Marco Rubio said "we should be considering internment" of Muslims, and "maybe we should close down cafes and diners where Muslims gather and in fact compared them to the Nazi party."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2015/dec/10/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-wrongly-says-marco-rubio-/	Democrats are trying to link Donald Trump’s incendiary statements about Muslims to comments by other Republicans in the presidential race. Democratic National Committee chairwoman and South Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz bashed several GOP candidates, most notably fellow Floridian U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, in a Dec. 9 interview on CNN. "It's not just Donald Trump that has said that Muslims are unacceptable for admission to this country," said Wasserman Schultz, highlighting comments about refugees by former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie before turning to Rubio. "Marco Rubio after the Paris attacks said not only that we should be considering internment, he actually suggested that maybe we should close down cafes and diners where Muslims gather, and in fact, compared them to the Nazi party," Wasserman Schultz said. Did Rubio actually say those things about Muslims? Our research shows Wasserman Schultz distorted Rubio’s recent TV interviews. We will explain each portion of her statement and why it creates an inaccurate picture of Rubio’s comments. Rubio has not called for internment of Muslims Even the DNC admitted the "internment" part of her attack on Rubio is completely inaccurate. Rubio has not proposed anything similar to the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II for Muslims. DNC spokesman Sean Bartlett claimed Wasserman Schultz had comments by Trump in mind during this part of her interview. In December, Trump told TIME magazine he wasn’t certain if he would have supported internment of Japanese during World War ll. "I would have had to be there at the time to tell you, to give you a proper answer," he said. "I certainly hate the concept of it. But I would have had to be there at the time to give you a proper answer." Trump told Morning Joe on Dec. 8 that he wasn’t proposing internment camps for Muslims. But in an interview on Good Morning America, he compared himself to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who ordered the Japanese internment. "What I'm doing is no different than FDR," Trump said. "I mean, take a look at what FDR did many years ago and he's one of the most highly respected presidents. I mean respected by most people. They named highways after him," he said, referencing a highway in New York City named for the former president. When asked if he supports internment camps, Trump said no. These comments by Trump, however, don’t add validity to what Wasserman Schultz said about Rubio. Rubio on Muslim cafes and diners According to Wasserman Schultz, Rubio "actually suggested that maybe we should close down cafes and diners where Muslims gather." Rubio did talk about closing down cafes in an interview Nov. 19 with Fox News’ Megyn Kelly, but Wasserman Schultz fails to mention a key qualifier. Rubio said any place should be closed down if it is a site "where radicals are being inspired." In the interview, Kelly asked Rubio, "Donald Trump is suggesting we may need to close mosques that have problems with radicals at the top. What do you say?" Rubio replied, "Well, I think we need to target radicalism. A lot of it is actually happening online, not simply in mosques. The vast majority of the mosques in America is not..." Kelly asked: "But the mosques piece is a controversial piece, so where do you stand on that?" Rubio then said: "Well, I think it's not about closing down mosques. It's about closing down any place. Whether it's a cafe, a diner, an internet spot. Any place where radicals are being inspired. "And that we have — the biggest problem we have is our inability to find out what these places are because we've crippled our intelligence programs, both through an authorized disclosure by a traitor, in other words, [Edward] Snowden, or by some of the things that this president has put in place for the support even of some from my own party to diminish our intelligence capabilities. "So, whatever facilities being used, it's not just a mosques. Any facility that's being used to radicalize and inspire attacks against the United States should be a place that we look at." Closing down any place if it is being used to "inspire attacks" is different from flat-out calling for shuttering cafes and diners simply because Muslims gather there. Nazi comparison The last part of Wasserman Schultz’s attack is that Rubio compared Muslims "to the Nazi party." This is also a case of Wasserman Schultz twisting Rubio’s words out of context. Bartlett of the DNC pointed to Rubio’s interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s This Week Nov. 15, the night after a Democratic debate. Stephanopoulos asked Rubio: "You saw Secretary Clinton there did not want to use the words ‘radical Islam.’ What is your response?" Rubio replied, "I don’t understand it. That would be like saying we weren’t at war with Nazis because we were afraid to offend some Germans who may have been members of the Nazi party but weren’t violent themselves. We are at war with radical Islam, with an interpretation of Islam by a significant number of people around the world, who they believe now justifies them in killing those who don't agree with their ideology. This is a clash of civilizations. ... Of course all Muslims are not members of violent jihadist groups." Rubio was trying to use an analogy to suggest it would have been ridiculous to avoid using the word "Nazis" during World War II out of fear of offending some Germans who were members of the Nazi party. We emailed a spokesman for Rubio to ask if he had addressed this comparison again but did not hear back, and a Nexis search did not turn up other examples of him talking about this. Our ruling According to Wasserman Schultz, Rubio has said "we should be considering internment" of Muslims, and "maybe we should close down cafes and diners where Muslims gather and in fact compared them to the Nazi party." Rubio has not called for internment of Muslims. This is flatly wrong. Her paraphrases about Rubio wanting to close Muslim cafes and diners and comparing Muslims to Nazis are at least missing context. But to suggest he wants internment of Muslims — to take away their freedom and rights in the United States and separate them from the rest of society — is a grave accusation that leaves listeners with a grossly misleading impression of Rubio’s statements.

pomt-14594	Arizona is spending "less on a per-capita basis than every single state in this country in higher education."	mostly true	/arizona/statements/2016/feb/04/michael-m-crow/arizona-worst-higher-education-funding/	Arizona State University President Michael M. Crow said Arizona is the worst per-capita in terms of investing in higher education. He made these remarks as he lobbied for more state dollars in front of a state Senate Appropriations Committee Jan. 26. "We need to think seriously what it is about us that has put us in a position where we are now investing, not just a little bit less than other places, (but) markedly less on a per-capita basis than every single state in this country in higher education," said Crow. The Legislature is currently finalizing a budget for fiscal year 2017, which runs from July 1, 2016, through June 30, 2017. Crow’s statement intrigued us, especially as he laid out the university’s strategic plan in front of the Arizona Board of Regents Thursday, so we put it to a fact-check. Makes the grade The basis of Crow’s remarks is a Jan. 25 survey done by the Center for the Study of Education Policy at Illinois State University and the State Higher Education Executive Officers Association, a Colorado-based group of education executives. In the study, which ranks all 50 states, Arizona is ranked 49th per capita in state higher education funding for fiscal year 2016, second to New Hampshire. Arizona spent $136.72 per resident on higher education in fiscal year 2015 and is expected to spend $115.83 per resident in the current fiscal year. New Hampshire spent $92.74 in fiscal year 2015 and is expected to spend $92.50 in the current fiscal year. Wyoming gives the most state funding to higher education. They spent $645.19 per resident in fiscal year 2015 and will spend $715.14 in the current fiscal year. The survey leaves out fiscal year 2016 data for Illinois and Pennsylvania, noting that these states haven’t finalized their budgets. In our map, we used fiscal year 2015 data for these states, with Pennsylvania and Illinois ranking as 48th and 7th, respectively. Crow said he used conservative states "with conservative legislatures and conservative executives" as his basis for comparison. ASU spokesman Mark Johnson told us the same thing, noting that the comparison group was not every state. Nonetheless, Arizona is not the worst when it comes to higher education funding per-capita -- New Hampshire is. Whether or not New Hampshire can be considered a "conservative" state is debatable given its Republican-led Legislature and Democratic governor. However, Arizona is at the bottom of several other higher education funding categories. The survey shows that Arizona has the biggest year to year drop in state higher education funding at 14 percent. In March, the Grand Canyon State also cut $99 million in funding to universities, which pales in comparison to the $8 million in new funding Gov. Doug Ducey has pitched for the state’s fiscal year 2017 budget. "Our data is pretty straightforward," Grapevine editor Jim Palmer said, noting that the survey uses data from the U.S. Census Bureau and U.S. Department of Commerce. "Arizona did experience the biggest decrease in funding from ‘15 to ‘16." Arizona also had the steepest decline, 47 percent, in state higher education spending per student from 2008 to 2015. But the state isn’t alone, either. A December 2014 Government Accountability Office report found that "state funding for all public colleges decreased" between fiscal years 2003 and 2012. Eileen Klein is president of the Arizona Board of Regents. She said the additional $8 million in state higher education funding is an encouraging first start. However, the objective isn’t to "catapult" through the rankings. "The point is to make sure that we have sufficient dollars to support Arizona students," Klein said. "Today, our universities operate at a loss for every Arizona resident student because the state is only committing, at this point, 34 percent towards the cost of educating our Arizona students." Our ruling Crow said, "We are now investing, not just a little bit less than other places, (but) markedly less on a per-capita basis than every single state in this country in higher education." Arizona is not the worst, they’re 49th, for the current fiscal year in funding higher education. Crow said he made his comparison among conservative states, but New Hampshire, the worst for higher education funding based on the study he cited, appears to be in the middle of the political spectrum. Nevertheless, Arizona has endured the sharpest decline in state higher education funding from fiscal year 2015 to fiscal year 2016. Even on a per student basis, their spending dropped 47 percent, more than any other state, from 2008 to 2015. Given the context, we rate Crow’s claim as Mostly True.	None	Michael M.

pomt-01932	"Candidates for governor routinely disclose" their spouses’ tax returns.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/jun/26/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-gubernatorial-candidates-routinely/	A new ad by Gov. Rick Scott’s campaign has a simple message: Scott and his wife Ann have shown Florida their tax returns, so it’s only fair that former Gov. Charlie Crist and wife Carole show theirs. In the ad released June 25 called "What’s He Hiding," Scott’s political group Let’s Get To Work demands that Crist release not only his tax returns, but Carole’s, too. The ad says the Scotts have released tax returns both in 2010 and for this year’s election. "But millionaire Charlie Crist refuses to release his spouse’s tax returns," the ad says. "Candidates for governor routinely disclose those returns. Alex Sink and Rick Scott both did it four years ago." Crist has said he won’t be releasing his wife’s tax returns, saying Scott was "out of bounds" for making the request and should apologize. PolitiFact Florida wondered, however, if spouses truly do "routinely disclose" their tax returns. Here’s our disclosure: It depends on what you consider routine. A separate issue The practice of gubernatorial candidates themselves disclosing tax returns goes back a long time, but for this check we’ll head as far back as Reubin Askew, who became governor in 1971 and released several years’ worth. Florida elected officials are required by law to file an annual statement showing their assets and liabilities. They are not required to release tax returns, but candidates for governor have traditionally done so. We should note that this generally applies to the general election candidates, and not always primary candidates. For example, Bill McCollum did not release his returns in 2010 while running in the primary against Rick Scott. As to whether spouses fess up their finances, well, that’s an interesting history. Most candidates have filed jointly with their spouses. Jeb Bush and his wife Columba released several years’ worth of joint returns during Bush’s years in office, and Rick and Ann Scott filed jointly. It wasn’t until 2002, when Democrat Bill McBride ran against Bush, that the issue of a spouse filing separately came up. McBride’s wife, Alex Sink, began to file separately from her husband specifically because her husband was running for governor, but in 2002 she released two years of tax returns under pressure from the Bush campaign. Sink had retired as president of Bank of America’s Florida operations in 2000. McBride, a lawyer who worked at Tampa firm Holland & Knight for many years, returned the favor in 2010 and released his returns when his wife ran for governor against Rick Scott (McBride died in 2012). Crist was a solo filer when he ran for governor in 2006, because he was single. He didn’t marry Carole Crist until 2008. He has said they continue to file separately because he "was a single guy for a long time. She's got her own business, and it's her business." Carole Crist is an owner of a family Halloween costume and novelty business, Franco-American Novelty Co., and has created a second company, Goddessey. Crist, a lawyer by trade like McBride, announced the release of three years of tax returns as the ad began airing. The next day, he released returns going back to 2001, with promises to release more, going back to 1991. Candidates releasing their spouses separate returns has become more of an issue in the last couple of decades as more women become entrepreneurs independently of their spouses. Susan McManus, a University of South Florida political science professor, says the expectation of disclosing separate returns really took off when Walter Mondale chose Geraldine Ferraro as his Democratic running mate during the 1984 presidential campaign. Ferraro faced many questions from political opponents and the media about her husband John Zaccaro’s real estate company. They ultimately released the returns, and Ferraro admitted she was an officer in the company, albeit without the authority to sign company checks. In recent years the same expectation has come up in presidential campaigns; Sen. John McCain’s millionaire wife Cindy eventually released two years of individual tax returns during the 2008 presidential campaign amid Democratic pressure. But those are examples from presidential politics. In Florida, the question is whether two instances -- by the same couple, in McBride and Sink -- over the last 12 years constitutes spouses’ tax returns being released "routinely," as Scott alleges. It’s only recently that we’ve seen candidates’ spouses filing separate returns. How you feel about it as a voter likely depends on how you feel about the race and the candidates, McManus said. "The interesting thing in this case is that attitudes about this are changing," she said. "In the future we’re likely to see everyone routinely releasing everything." Our ruling Scott said "candidates for governor routinely disclose" spouses’ tax returns. It is routine when candidates file joint returns with their spouses. It’s only recently that gubernatorial candidates and their spouses have started filing separate tax returns, though. When spouses file separately, there are two instances to look to, when first Alex Sink and then her husband Bill McBride disclosed individual returns for their spouse’s respective gubernatorial runs in 2002 and 2010. So the trend of spouses who file separately is a new one, but one way or the other, spouses' returns have been released over the years. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-13143	Says Gerald Daugherty is endorsed by the Austin American-Statesman.	false	/texas/statements/2016/nov/01/austin-board-realtors-pac/austin-realtors-group-incorrect-saying-gerald-daug/	Republican Gerald Daugherty, seeking re-election to the Travis County commissioners court, is "endorsed by" Austin’s daily newspaper, an advocacy group told select members. Hold that pony. The Austin American-Statesman, which is headquarters for PolitiFact Texas, announced in May 2016 its editorial board wouldn’t be endorsing candidates going forward. So we were curious when a reader asked us to check the Daugherty endorsement claim spotted in an Austin Board of Realtors PAC mailer. Separately, we fielded a copy of the mailer from Jonathan Panzer, campaign manager for David Holmes, a mediator and the Democratic nominee facing Daugherty, a businessman, to represent the county’s Precinct 3. To be sure, Daugherty was endorsed by the newspaper in early 2016. That February, the American-Statesman editorial board urged readers to favor Daugherty over Jason Nassour in the March 2016 Republican primary. "Republicans should stick with the incumbent," that editorial said after calling Daugherty "an important compass for the commissioners court on matters of fiscal responsibility" who "has shown an ability to prod his predictably blue colleagues to the right despite his minority status." But in May 2016, American-Statesman editors announced the newspaper would no longer endorse candidates for office--and that announcement was followed by the paper making no candidate endorsements leading up to the November 2016 general election. In a May 21, 2016, article describing changes in the paper's opinion pages, editors said: "Perhaps the most significant philosophical change as we adjust resources is that we will no longer endorse political candidates, although we will weigh in as necessary on ballot measures and other issues." That article, by the paper’s editor, Debbie Hiott, and Viewpoints editor, Tara Trower Doolittle, went on: "The sheer number of candidates in a metropolitan area this size and the number of editorial writers we have makes it challenging to add to the contours of the electoral debate. In the last" Austin City Council "cycle, our board met with more than 120 political candidates. In the most recent primary season, we held more than two dozen meetings and we declined to endorse in a number of statewide and county races in our readership area. We also have been increasingly forced to not endorse in races where candidates have chosen to skip the interview process altogether." So, we wondered how the Realtors group concluded Daugherty had snagged the paper's general-election backing. By phone and email, an ABOR representative, Emily Chenevert, said the mailer--sent independently and not in coordination with Daugherty, she said--was incorrect and 3,000 recipients, among the group’s more than 11,000 members, would receive a corrective email. Chenevert further told us that "we made the mistake of not clarifying that Commissioner Daugherty was endorsed by the Statesman in the primary. We recognize that no endorsement was made by the Statesman for the general election." Earlier the same day, we confirmed that Daugherty’s campaign website said he was endorsed by the American-Statesman, an element brought to our attention by the reader: SOURCE: Gerald Daugherty’s campaign website (screen grab, Oct. 31, 2016) To our queries about that, Daugherty noted by phone that he had been endorsed by the newspaper before the primary. Since then, he said, he’s guilty of not changing the pre-primary endorsement mention on his site. "I probably should have gone in there and said ‘in the primary,’" Daugherty said. The same day, he called back to say his site had since been amended to say he was "endorsed in the March Republican primary only," a change we confirmed. Generally too, we asked Hiott to weigh in on anyone touting pre-primary endorsements in the context of the 2016 general elections. She replied by email: "Every candidate knows that an endorsement is made within the context of a particular race and particular opponents. To then present it as an endorsement in another race is disingenuous at best." Our ruling ABOR’s mailer says Daugherty is endorsed by the American-Statesman. The newspaper did not endorse Daugherty or any candidate before the November 2016 general election after editors earlier announced the paper wouldn’t endorse candidates going forward.

pomt-10991	Says Mark Pocan’s proposal to eliminate the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) would "eliminate border enforcement."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jul/13/leah-vukmir/gop-us-senate-hopeful-leah-vukmirs-pants-fire-clai/	Would a Wisconsin congressman’s proposal to eliminate ICE really mean no more enforcement of the U.S. borders? No. But that’s the claim by Leah Vukmir, who is running for the U.S. Senate seat held by Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin. Here’s why Vukmir’s blanket statement goes way wrong. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Pocan’s proposal On June 25, 2018, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, a Madison-area Democrat, announced his proposal to eliminate the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). That was five days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order ending the separation of families who were trying to enter the United States illegally at the Mexican border. To be clear, ICE was not involved in those border actions, which resulted in the separation of more than 2,300 children and their parents. Pocan instead alluded to ICE actions taken inside the United States, accusing a unit of the agency of "hunting down and tearing apart families" at churches and schools, and raiding places such as garden centers and meatpacking plants. His proposal drew the wrath of Vukmir, who faces Kevin Nicholson in the Aug. 14, 2018, Republican primary for the Senate. The winner will take on Baldwin on Nov. 6, 2018. In a news release on July 5, 2018, Vukmir raised the prospect of open borders, saying Pocan’s proposal would be "effectively eliminating our border" She added: "Sen. Baldwin, where do you stand? Do you believe we should eliminate border enforcement? Americans deserve to know." (Baldwin doesn’t support Pocan’s proposal, which was introduced as legislation on July 12, 2018. In an odd twist, Pocan and other Democrats who introduced the measure said the same day that if GOP leadership follows through with their vow to bring it to the House floor, they would vote against it. "We know" Speaker Paul Ryan "is not serious about passing our" bill, the Democrats declared in a statement, saying they "will not engage in this political stunt." So, Vukmir is claiming that Pocan’s proposal to eliminate ICE would "eliminate border enforcement" — a broad statement essentially echoed later by her campaign spokeswoman. But Pocan isn’t proposing to get rid of border enforcement — and ICE isn’t the agency that patrols the borders, anyway. What is ICE? Many Americans might associate ICE with border enforcement. But as University of Texas professor and immigration expert Ruth Ellen Wasem put it, "most do not know that ICE’s role in immigration enforcement is not at the border." Border security is actually the responsibility of another federal agency — Customs and Border Protection. CBP is the parent agency for the Border Patrol, which patrols the U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada. It is the Border Patrol that did the recent separation of parents from children at the Mexican border. Elizabeth Cohen, a Syracuse University political science professor and immigration expert, told us: Customs and Border Protection is responsible for enforcement at the border and 100 miles in from any point on the border of the U.S., land and water. Eliminating ICE would not eliminate CBP or enforcement at the border. What ICE does is arrest, detain and deport unauthorized immigrants who are already inside the United States. This focus on the interior of the country is made clear on the ICE website: While certain responsibilities and close cooperation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and others require significant ICE assets near the border, the majority of immigration enforcement work for ICE takes place in the country’s interior. For example, in what The Atlantic described as two of ICE’s largest raids, both in Ohio in June 2018, the agency arrested 146 employees at a meat-processing plant and detained 114 workers at a nursery for suspected immigration violations. Not abandoning enforcement Indeed, Pocan has been clear that he is not proposing to end border enforcement. In a USA Today opinion column published two days before Vukmir made her claim, he wrote: Abolishing ICE does not mean open borders. ICE is the agency directed by the president to aggressively round up and detain individuals already living in our country, not the agency tasked with patrolling the border. Under my legislation, we would still have agents stationed to secure the border. FactCheck.org found that Pocan, as well as all other Democrats in Congress who are calling for the end of ICE, have not called for abandoning border enforcement. See all of our fact checks in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race. Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration, argued that eliminating ICE would hamper immigration enforcement. He told us that while some people entering the United States illegally are immediately returned to Mexico, those detained for any length of time are placed in the custody of ICE. So, eliminating ICE would result in a "catch and release policy," he said. But Stephen Legomsky, a Washington University law professor emeritus and immigration expert, told us that CBP or any agency that replaces ICE could take on the detention function. As for Vukmir, when we asked her campaign for information to support her statement, spokesman Mattias Gugel sent us a link to an animation that shows how to do a Google search. Amusing, perhaps, but it didn’t help his boss. Our rating Vukmir says Pocan’s proposal to eliminate ICE would "eliminate border enforcement." But enforcing the border is not even ICE’s job. Rather, the federal agency pursues unauthorized immigrants who are already inside the country. A different federal agency is responsible for patrolling the border, so border enforcement would continue even if ICE were eliminated. And, in any case, Pocan is not proposing to end border enforcement. For a statement that is false and ridiculous, we rate Vukmir’s claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-03107	"One out of 10 minimum-wage workers in the U.S. live in Texas."	true	/texas/statements/2013/sep/20/stephanie-cutter/crossfire-anchor-undershoots-texans-comprising-one/	As of July 2012, Texans accounted for nearly one in 10 Americans, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. On CNN’S Crossfire Sept. 18, 2013, from-the-left co-host Stephanie Cutter prefaced questions of Texas Gov. Rick Perry by saying: "One out of 10 minimum-wage workers in the U.S. live in Texas." She undershot. In 2012, according to Cheryl Abbot, a regional economist for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Texas workers paid at or below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour accounted for 452,000, or nearly 13 percent, of the nation’s 3,550,000 workers paid minimum wage or less. "Another way of stating that is that in Texas, 7.5 (percent) of all hourly-paid workers were paid at or below the federal minimum wage," Abbot said by email. The same year, Abbot said, nearly 12.7 million Texas workers in total amounted to 8 percent of the nation’s 155-million-strong labor force. Abbot pointed us to a bureau chart showing each state’s share of workers earning minimum wage or less in 2012 — which showed, too, that Texas had far more workers in this dual category than the second-place state in this way, New York, which had 224,000 workers earning the minimum wage or less, equal to 6.3 percent of the nation’s workers in those pay categories. Nationally, Abbot said, some 75 million hourly workers accounted for 59 percent of all salaried and hourly paid workers. In Texas, the state’s 6 million hourly workers represented 57 percent of all wage and salary workers, she said. To our inquiry, Austin economist Stuart Greenfield agreed with Abbot’s analysis, though he pointed out by telephone that strictly speaking, according to the bureau chart, nearly two in 10 of the country’s minimum-wage workers lived in Texas. That is, Texans accounted for 282,000 of 1,566,000 U.S. workers paid the minimum wage, according to the chart, with 170,000 Texans paid less than the minimum wage. The Texas share of U.S. minimum-wage-only workers, 18 percent, far outpaced the No. 2 state in this category, Pennsylvania, which was home to nearly 6 percent of such workers, according to the chart. Also, Texas led other states with its 8.6 percent share of hourly U.S. workers paid below the minimum wage, though Florida landed a close second by having 8.3 percent of such hourly workers, the chart indicates. Our ruling Cutter said one of 10 minimum-wage workers in the U.S. lives in Texas. Actually, 18 percent of U.S. workers paid the minimum wage in 2012 toiled in Texas, according to government figures, while Texas was home to 13 percent of the nation’s hourly employees paid minimum wage or less. Since Cutter was arguing that Texas is not a land of plenty, the fact that she understated the state’s share of minimum-wage workers doesn’t short the Truth-O-Meter. We rate this claim as True.

pomt-02081	"Governor Scott Cut Taxes 40 Times For Florida Families"	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/may/21/rick-scott/gov-scott-claims-he-cut-taxes-40-times-florida-fam/	It seems like just yesterday we were analyzing Gov. Rick Scott’s claim that he had cut taxes for Floridians 24 times. But on May 13, Scott’s campaign raised the count to 40. "Governor Scott Cut Taxes 40 Times For Florida Families," Scott for Florida announced on Twitter. "40 tax cuts in 4 years. #letskeepworking." Scott and the Legislature don’t have the budget shortfalls of years past, so tax cuts were the name of the game in Tallahassee in 2014, especially with Scott up for re-election. What were these new cuts he was touting? We hit the lawbooks to find out. Counting the ways In 2013, Scott defined a "tax cut" as anything that reduced government revenue by $3 million in a given year. That involved a lot of creative interpretation, such as considering a sales tax holiday a tax cut, then counting it each year. He also ruled reductions in automatic fee increases, tax credits and temporary measures as tax cuts. For 2014, this definition changed slightly, and Scott’s team also counted things that reduced government revenue by less than that. In the 2014 legislative session, freed from having to deal with budget deficits, lawmakers passed two major bills for the governor to tout. One was SB 156, which reduced auto registration fees. The other was HB 5601, a wide-ranging tax cut package that included more sales tax holidays, business tax credits and tax exemptions for child booster seats, college meal plans and even certain pet foods. After tweeting the good news, Scott’s campaign shared with us their list of 40 items, which actually totaled 41 things. Here’s a closer look at all of them: 1, 2.) Unemployment compensation taxes: Businesses saved $124.5 million when Tallahassee reduced the number of weeks and payout for unemployment compensation in 2011. A tax increase for businesses was rolled back in 2012, although not eliminated. The projected savings were $830 million for tax years 2012 through 2014. 3, 4.) Manufacturing equipment: A 2012 sales tax exemption on machinery purchases was expanded, saving $56 million. The next year the Legislature eliminated the sales tax entirely for three years, starting April 30, 2014. It was slated to cost the state $370 million and local governments $83 million through 2017. 5.) Property taxes: Scott and legislators forced state water management districts (except northwest Florida) to reduce their property tax collections by 30 percent in 2011. The $210 million cut led to modest savings for property owners. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.) Sales tax holiday: Scott counted the mostly annual tax-free shopping holiday four different times prior to 2013, at a cost of about $30 million to the state. It applied to shoes and clothing (up to $75 per item) and school supply purchases (up to $15). The state has offered the holiday every year since 1998 except in 2002, 2003, 2008 and 2009. The 2013 tax holiday (Aug. 2-4) counted twice, according to Scott, because it also exempted sales taxes on electronic equipment, such as E-readers, laptops and tablets, up to $750. For 2014, there will be three sales tax holidays: The first is a nine-day sales tax holiday for hurricane preparation supplies. Starting May 31, Floridians can purchase batteries, flashlights, tarps, and even generators worth $750 or less, without having to pay the state's 6 percent sales tax. That should reduce state revenues by about $2.9 million. Another sales tax holiday is a three-day back-to-school shopping period from Aug. 1-3, during which shoppers would not have to pay sales taxes on any clothes worth $100 or less, school supplies worth $15 or less, or on the first $750 of the cost of a personal computer. It accounts for $30 million or so. The third sales tax holiday will be held Sept. 19-21 on the purchase of energy- and water-efficient appliances costing $1,500 or less. That will reduce state revenues by about $1.7 million. 13, 14.) Corporate Income Tax exemptions: Scott asked lawmakers to expand the exemption for corporate income taxes from $5,000 to $25,000 in 2011, and then all the way up to $50,000 in 2012. Both cost the state about $60 million. 15.) Tax credit scholarships: This measure expanded a program that gives businesses a tax credit if they purchase tuition vouchers for low-income families to go to private schools, costing the state $25 million. 16, 17, 18.) Energy breaks: A 2013 law implemented part of a 2008 constitutional amendment that says a property appraiser may not base an increase in a property’s just value on the installation of a "renewable energy source device," including windmills, solar panels and roof pools. The law, effective this year, may lead to local revenue losses of $12.6 million by 2017. Two other credits are in a 2012 bill, HB 7117, aimed at inspiring more renewable energy production in our natural gas-dependent state. Credits aimed at helping agribusiness and renewable energy production facilities are set to expire in 2016. Scott allowed the bill to become law without his signature. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.) Various business tax incentives: Since 2011, Scott and the Legislature have expanded tax credits available to businesses under a federal/state "new markets" program, allowing businesses to take it against their corporate income tax bill or insurance premium tax bill. It costs the budget $12.9 million per year. They’ve allowed companies that spent at least $250 million on capital costs from 2011-13 to write-down a portion of their Florida business taxes for a $7.5 million revenue loss. They temporarily waived a requirement that a new facility creating at least 100 jobs be in certain technology fields in order to qualify for the Capital Investment Tax Credit, though only if they are located in certain Panhandle counties. The exemption, which costs the state $4.4 million per year, lasts through June 30, 2014. They also created an annual corporate income tax credit for certain research and development expenses of up to $9 million a year. HB 5601 this year gave businesses a small decrease on the tax rate on electricity, saving $3 million, and allowed a sales tax refund on bad credit card debt, for about $6.7 million. 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33.) Targeted breaks: Lawmakers eliminated sales taxes on repairs to planes between 2,000 and 15,000 pounds, worth $12.3 million. The same bill tweaked requirements for a tax credit for businesses in an urban high-crime area, costing the state $3.5 million per year. The Legislature blocked a July 2013 automatic inflation adjustment factored in registration for hunting and fishing license fees every five years, costing the state $4.4 million for 2012-13. A wide-ranging 2012 law eliminated the annual adjustment and surcharge for severing phosphate for an annual cost of $12.6 million. A person licensed as a real estate salesperson or broker associate does not have to apply for an exemption from a local business tax when he or she is an employee of someone else under a 2012 law. That resulted in a $3.8 million hit to local government per year. A portion of the 2014 tax cut package clarified how prepaid calling plans were taxed, costing $7.2 million in revenue. It also contained provisions to cut taxes for premiums on bail bonds ($700,000) and title insurance ($5.4 million). The bill also extended and increased financial incentives for businesses to donate to community development and housing projects for low-income residents by providing a tax credit or sales tax refund. These changes to the Community Contribution Tax Credits program cost $14.7 million. 34.) Communications dealers: HB 809 in 2012 spared communications dealers, in certain situations, from being liable for penalties if they assign a customer to the wrong local tax jurisdiction. The change will result in annual savings of about $4.7 million for the communications industry. 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40.) Sales tax exemptions: The tax cut package from 2014’s HB 5601 included several exemptions for more than just businesses. There was a temporary $3.3 million cut for the purchase of cement mixing drums for cement trucks, but the list also includes child car seats and youth bike helmets (at a combined cost to the state of about $2.5 million), prescribed diet pet food (another $2.5 million or so) and prepaid college meal plans (in the neighborhood of $12 million). These exemptions are in effect until 2017. 41.) Car registration fees: With no budget shortfall to deal with, the Legislature quickly passed SB 156, which rolled back the 2009 annual auto tag fee increase. Those fees had gone up to deal with a budget shortfall. It’s an especially big feather in Scott’s cap, who has been using the past increase as an attack against presumptive gubernatorial opponent Charlie Crist. The fee cut will save motorists about $25 a year per vehicle registration, with about $395 million in savings annually. Scott signed the bill into law April 2, but it won’t take effect until September, reducing revenue by $309 million for 2015. Tax cut tally If you’re still with us at this point, you must really want to know if Scott’s list counts as 40 tax cuts. The bottom line is, it depends on how you look at it. Experts PolitiFact Florida spoke with -- both after this claim was made and last year when Scott was trumpeting 25 cuts -- said the list contained several kinds of tax alterations that may or may not apply. The sales tax holidays, like the sales tax exemptions, are based on consuming the goods covered by the policies. The exemptions are temporary, and the holidays, which have been offered off and on since 1998, can be suspended from year to year. Counting tax credits is dubious, because that means you have to spend in one place to save in another. Preventing appraisers from raising property taxes for making an energy efficient improvement, for example, only benefits people who have already made capital improvements. Similar is the elimination of scheduled increases in hunting and fishing licenses. The fee is still being paid, just not at a higher rate than it was. Cuts in unemployment compensation may save businesses money, but they cost out-of-work Floridians money they would normally have. In fact, the bulk of the list is very friendly to businesses, but not your average taxpayer. These changes also don’t take into account whether local governments have to raise taxes to offset losses to their revenue. Our ruling Scott for Florida tweeted, "Governor Scott Cut Taxes 40 Times For Florida Families," highlighting a list that actually contained 41 items. These tax cuts range from credits to exemptions to changing rates and penalties. The list focuses heavily on businesses, and like his original 24 cuts, is full of caveats. Some are counted more than once, some are only changes to scheduled increases. This year’s legislative session added a few more measures aimed at consumers, but businesses still benefit from much of it. Scott’s tax claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-05-21T14:48:38	2014-05-13	['None']
pomt-12293	Says Donald Trump "wants to kick thousands of kids off of BadgerCare."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jun/28/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwins-half-true-claim-donald-trump-wants-/	Addressing the Wisconsin Democratic Party’s annual convention, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin laid into Republicans, particularly President Donald Trump. "You know, I remember Donald Trump coming to Wisconsin during the campaign and saying the same things Republicans always say here: I’m on the side of the little guy, I’m for working families, I’ll fight for you," the Baldwin said on June 2, 2017. "But it was another scam." Baldwin, a Democrat who faces re-election in 2018, then criticized several proposals backed by Trump, including the GOP replacement plan for Obamacare. "He wants to kick thousands of kids off of BadgerCare," Baldwin charged, echoing comments she made a few days earlier on MSNBC. "Who would cut health care for children?" Let’s see if she’s right. What is BadgerCare? BadgerCare (also known as BadgerCare Plus) provides health insurance coverage to low-income Wisconsin residents, including pregnant women, childless adults and children. It is funded through Medicaid. The latest enrollment numbers, from May 2017, show 790,189 residents enrolled, including 412,208 children. Several days after Baldwin’s speech, GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker proposed changes in the program for able-bodied adults, saying he wants to move them "from government dependence to true independence," partly through drug testing. If the federal government gives Walker permission, Wisconsin would become the first state to do such drug testing. Under the plan, those who fail and refuse substance abuse treatment would have their coverage rejected. Baldwin’s evidence To back Baldwin’s attack on Trump, her campaign cited estimates made in May 2017 by two left-leaning research groups. The Wisconsin Budget Project, a program of the nonprofit Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, said in a blog post that a group of about 5,000 children in Wisconsin is particularly at risk of losing their eligibility for BadgerCare as a result of funding reductions to the Children’s Health Insurance Program that would be made under Trump’s 2018 budget proposal. Jon Peacock, the group’s research director, told us that while the budget would not dictate that children be removed from BadgerCare, Wisconsin would have to make up for the funding reductions in order to keep those children on BadgerCare. He said a total of 80,000 children would be put at risk of losing BadgerCare. The Washington, D.C.-based Center for American Progress made a longer-term estimate, saying 53,600 children would lose BadgerCare in 2026 because of Medicaid funding reductions proposed by the GOP’s replacement for Obamacare that has been approved by the U.S. House of Representatives. That figure was based on estimates done by David Cutler, a professor of applied economics at Harvard University who was a campaign adviser to Barack Obama; and Emily Gee, a health economist at the center who formerly worked at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Other evidence A spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, which administers BadgerCare, said the department has not done a full analysis of Trump’s budget or the GOP health plan, but told us the state is committed to ensuring that "everyone living in poverty has access to affordable health insurance." The two estimates, however, include people with family incomes above the federal poverty level. So, they would not be covered by such a commitment from the Walker administration. Zach Hunter, a spokesman for a House committee that wrote much of the GOP replacement bill, said the bill contains tax credits that would provide families up to $14,000 a year to purchase insurance. He also said the Center for American Progress estimate is based on projections made by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which he said has "repeatedly struggled to estimate coverage impacts with accuracy" when it comes to Obamacare. Our rating Baldwin says Trump "wants to kick thousands of kids off of BadgerCare." The president’s budget proposal and the GOP replacement for Obamacare, which he supports, don’t dictate that children lose their BadgerCare health insurance. But both would make cuts to federal spending that two left-leaning research groups say would threaten the BadgerCare eligibility of thousands of children. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-02143	"Every single one of the 41 Republican senators who just blocked a raise in the minimum wage will receive a $2,800 cost-of-living adjustment on January 1, 2015."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/may/06/facebook-posts/social-media-meme-says-lawmakers-will-get-2800-rai/	There are few things that inspire as much popular outrage as examples of politicians behaving hypocritically. That’s why a recent Facebook post packed such a punch. "Every single one of the 41 Republican senators who just blocked a raise in the minimum wage will receive a $2,800 cost-of-living adjustment on January 1, 2015," said the meme, which was posted by the creators of the "Raise the Minimum Wage" Facebook page. That page has attracted almost 132,000 supporters, and the meme, when it was posted on May 1, 2014, drew 1,984 likes. But is the meme’s claim accurate? Not exactly. Since passage of the Ethics Reform Act of 1989, congressional pay raises are calculated by a formula that involves changes in private-sector wages and salaries, according to the Congressional Research Service. The annual pay hike automatically goes into effect unless Congress either votes to reject the adjustment or votes to change the amount. However, lawmakers have often been loath to raise their own pay. Even though the 1989 law makes it easier for politicians to get a raise without having to affirmatively vote for one, it hasn’t led to raises year after year. In fact, almost half the time, lawmakers have gone out of their way to reject the automatic pay raise. According to CRS, lawmakers let their pay be raised 13 times (those scheduled for January 1991, 1992, 1993, 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, and 2009) and denied raises 11 times (those scheduled for January 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1999, 2007, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014). That means the last time lawmakers let an impending raise stand was for the one scheduled for January 2009. That was when George W. Bush was president and the Democrats controlled both chambers of Congress. At that time, the basic congressional salary went from $169,300 to $174,000, its current level. Since then, for five years running, Congress has passed language forgoing a pay raise. The CRS report confirms the numbers cited in the meme -- the maximum potential January 2015 pay adjustment would be 1.6 percent, or $2,800, an amount established by calculations made in January 2014. But the recent history of pay-raise rejections provides a crucial asterisk to the meme’s claim. If Congress refuses to act, lawmakers will get the raise specified in the meme -- but for the past five years, Congress has acted to reject the increase, and this year, there are solid reasons why lawmakers would want to avoid a raise again. "The economy, while showing signs of recovery, is still shaky, especially when it comes to steady private-sector job creation," said Pete Sepp, executive vice president of the National Taxpayers Union, which has long tracked congressional pay and benefits. "Furthermore, it would be politically suicidal for Congress to debate, much less affirm, the raise before the November election." Sepp added, though, that it’s possible that lawmakers could go into a lame-duck session after the election. Then, he said, "the political pressure is off to act like they feel their constituents' pain, and who knows what could happen? Opponents of allowing the raise to take effect might introduce a provision blocking the pay increase, only to be outmaneuvered in the rush to approve final business for the year." In other words, a hike by january 2015 is far from the slam dunk the meme suggests. Our ruling The pro-minimum-wage group said in a Facebook meme that "every single one of the 41 Republican senators who just blocked a raise in the minimum wage will receive a $2,800 cost-of-living adjustment on January 1, 2015." That is what would happen if Congress fails to affirmatively reject a raise. But there is hardly a guarantee that lawmakers would simply go along with this pay hike. Accepting a pay raise is so politically unpopular that Congress has rejected such an increase for five years running. The difference between "will receive" a raise and "could receive" a raise is significant enough for us to rate this claim Half True.

pomt-11957	Says the Dickey Amendment "prevents the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from even researching the relationship between gun violence and public health. ... The government can’t study gun violence but is spending $400,000 analyzing the effects of Swedish massages on rabbits."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/05/steve-israel/former-democratic-congressman-compares-gun-violenc/	The mass shooting in Las Vegas prompted former Democratic Congressman Steve Israel of New York to write that these horrific events have little impact on public policy. In a New York Times op-ed, Israel walked through a list of shootings -- the murder of 26 children and adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012, the June 2016 mass shooting in an Orlando nightclub, and others -- and noted that despite the hand-wringing after each one, nothing changed. Israel said Democrats were unable to enact reforms, including "our attempts to rescind the infamous Dickey Amendment, which prevents the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention from even researching the relationship between gun violence and public health." "The result?" Israel wrote Oct. 2. "The government can’t study gun violence but is spending $400,000 analyzing the effects of Swedish massages on rabbits." There are two elements to sift through here: Does the Dickey Amendment block government research into gun violence and public health? And is Washington studying Swedish massage on rabbits? The Dickey Amendment In 1996, with strong support from the National Rifle Association, Congress included an amendment by Rep. Jay Dickey, R-Ark., in its omnibus spending bill. The amendment said "none of the funds made available for injury prevention and control at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention may be used to advocate or promote gun control." In the same bill, Congress pulled $2.8 million aimed at gun injury research and assigned it elsewhere in the CDC. Ever since, Washington and the CDC have steered clear of funding research that could run afoul of that amendment. Israel said the provision prevents government-funded studies of the ties between guns and public health, but plenty of people say the rule is not binding. Dickey himself joined with the former head of the CDC’s National Center for Injury Prevention and Control Mark Rosenberg to challenge that long-held assumption. "We believe strongly that funding for research into gun-violence prevention should be dramatically increased," they wrote in a 2016 public letter. "We do not see the congressional language against using federal funds ‘to promote or advocate gun control’ as a barrier to this research." An article on the Harvard Law Petrie-Flom Center blog argued that the amendment bars research aimed at promoting gun control and not all research. U.S. Sen. Tom Carper, D-Del., echoed that point in a letter to the CDC, saying the meaning had been "misconstrued." But that belief had its own consequences. "As a result, public health researchers at the CDC and other federal agencies have been discouraged from conducting scientific research on gun violence," Carper wrote March 17, 2016. "Although the CDC self-directs a portion of its nearly $6.2 billion annual budget to a wide variety of intra- and extramural research, the CDC has been reluctant to devote funding to gun violence research without a specific appropriation from Congress." Carper offered proof that the Dickey Amendment can co-exist with government gun violence studies. He noted that in 2015, the CDC assessed the causes of a rise in gun violence in Wilmington, Del. In general, the impact of the Dickey Amendment is more political than legal. Research could move forward, but without an explicit signoff from Congress, there’s been limited activity. After the 2012 Newtown slayings, President Barack Obama directed the CDC to conduct or fund research into the causes of gun violence. The impact was modest. "As far as I can tell the CDC still correctly believes that gun research, or even mentioning guns, is too hot to handle," said director of the Harvard Injury Control Research Center David Hemenway. Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research director Daniel Webster also said there’s been no new funding from CDC or the National Institutes of Health. Rosenberg told us, "The research scientists at CDC are very anxious to do this research, but the recent directors of CDC have been willing to let this eminently solvable problem fester because they fear that the NRA will prod Congress into cutting public health programs that are viewed as more central and critical to CDC's mission." Rabbit massage As for the $400,000 spent on studying the effects of Swedish massages on rabbits that Israel mentioned, yes, the government did that. (The exact amount was closer to $387,000.) It gave the Ohio State University Sports Medicine Center money to build a small device that mimics the action of Swedish massage to see if the treatment reduced pain and inflammation. Rabbits were the test subjects. The treatment helped, by the way. Researchers found that with the right mix of force, duration and frequency, there was "maximal recovery of muscle and joint function." However, there’s an issue of timing with Israel’s statement. He said the government is currently spending money on this research. In fact, the study ended in 2014. Israel spokesman Harrison Feuer didn’t argue that detail. "The larger point that Congressman Israel was looking to accurately make is that the government has funded studies into various endeavors that are less impactful than guns on public health," Feuer said. Our ruling Israel said the Dickey Amendment prevents the CDC from researching the relationship between gun violence and public health. As a matter of law, it only prevents money going toward research aimed at promoting gun control. But as a matter of politics, that distinction is murky, and as a result, research has been limited. Israel’s point about Swedish massage on rabbits is off on the timing, but right on the substance. Israel’s statement has some technical flaws, but the broader thrust is accurate.

pomt-11802	"Bump stocks are already illegal in the state of New York. You can't buy one."	mostly false	/new-york/statements/2017/nov/17/andrew-cuomo/bump-stocks-are-still-legal-own-and-sell-new-york-/	Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo says New York state law already bans the accessory a gunman used to kill 58 people in Las Vegas last month. The accessory, called a bump stock, allows someone to convert a semi-automatic firearm to a nearly fully automatic one. Lawmakers in New York state have introduced legislation to ban the accessory, but Cuomo during a conference call with reporters called the bill unnecessary. "The bump stocks are already illegal in the state of New York," Cuomo said. "You can't buy one." Is Cuomo right? What’s in state law Technically, New York state has banned the use of bump stocks for more than 80 years. The State Legislature passed a law in 1931 that said "a person who sells or keeps for sale, or offers, or gives, or disposes of any instrument or weapon of the kind usually known as a machine-gun to any person is guilty of a felony." That statute exists today, but instead says anyone who owns, "manufactures or causes to be manufactured any machine-gun" or weapon simulating a machine gun is guilty of a felony. A machine gun is defined as a weapon that can fire a number of shots with one continuous pull of the trigger. A bump stock modifies a gun to simulate that. What’s not in state law Assemblywoman Patricia A. Fahy was one of the first lawmakers to introduce legislation banning bump stocks in New York state after the Las Vegas shooting. She contended that while using a bump stock might be illegal in New York state, owning or selling one is not. The New York State Police agree with her. "It’s OK to have a bump stock in the back of your car," State Police Spokesperson Beau Duffy said. "But the minute you attach it to a semiautomatic rifle, it’s illegal in New York state." Bump stocks are not regulated by the state or federal government, so just having one is not a crime, Duffy said. You can also sell them in New York state without penalty. That means you can also legally buy one in New York state without going through a background check, whether it’s through a gun shop or a private seller. National gun law experts have the same understanding of the law. "Though this current law functionally prohibits New Yorkers from possessing firearms that are equipped with bump stocks or similar devices, our understanding is that it does not prohibit possession of bump stock devices that are un-attached to a firearm," said Ari Freilich, a staff attorney at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Many of the guns a bump stock would work with are now illegal for new gun owners under the SAFE Act in New York state. That doesn’t mean they don’t exist. Residents were allowed to keep guns outlawed by the SAFE Act as long as they registered them with the state by April 2014. Cuomo’s response A spokeswoman for Cuomo clarified that the governor meant to say that someone could not buy and then use a bump stock in New York. "The governor was stating you cannot buy a bump stock in New York and affix it to a weapon, which is banned under the state’s penal law," Abbey Fashouer said. Our ruling Cuomo said "bump stocks are already illegal in the state of New York. You can't buy one." That’s not true. It’s illegal to use a bump stock in New York state but you can buy and own one.

pomt-14516	In Sauk City, Wisconsin, "the ID office" that provides identification for voting "is only open on the fifth Wednesday of every month" -- a total of four days in 2016.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/feb/19/john-oliver/office-provides-id-voting-one-wisconsin-burg-open-/	Sauk City, which prides itself on being the oldest incorporated village in Wisconsin (yeah, it’s a little confusing), made HBO on Feb. 14, 2016. The mention came on "Last Week Tonight," a Sunday show that takes a satirical look at news, politics and current events. The program is hosted by John Oliver, who used to be a correspondent for "The Daily Show with Jon Stewart" on Comedy Central. Opening the segment by noting "we are finally in an election year," Oliver talked about voting in America -- in particular, identification requirements for voting. (The show happened to air two days before Wisconsin’s primary election, when voters cast ballots for the a state Supreme Court seat and a variety of local offices.) Several minutes later, Wisconsin and a few other states, along with Sauk City (pop. 3,410), were singled out. "And in some parts of the country, the offices that issue IDs are hardly ever open," an incredulous Oliver said. "In 2012, a study found that in Wisconsin, Alabama and Mississippi, fewer than half of all ID-issuing offices in the state are open five days a week. "And in Sauk City, Wisconsin," Oliver continued, "the ID office is only open on the fifth Wednesday of every month -- and only four months in 2016 even have five Wednesdays." Oliver’s Sauk City claim later got online attention from Vox and Bustle. A graphic that flashed on the screen during Oliver’s monologue carried a screenshot of a website page that listed the hours of operation for a state Division of Motor Vehicles office in Sauk City. That appeared to back up Oliver’s claim. But Oliver’s claim could leave the impression that the only place Sauk City residents can get an ID for voting is at an office that’s open only on fifth Wednesdays, as in four days for all of 2016. Voter ID law In 2011, Republican Gov. Scott Walker signed a bill that requires residents to present a photo identification in order to vote. The law was used for the first time in the February 2012 primary election. But after that, the law was put on ice while it was challenged in court. In 2014, the challenge reached the U.S. Supreme Court, which declined to hear it. That meant the law was put back into effect. The first time it was used again was in the primary held two days after Oliver made his claim. Oliver’s claim Let’s be clear that Wisconsin has no "voter ID." Rather, under the voter ID law, Wisconsin voters must present an existing ID. Generally, it’s one of these: drivers license; state-issued ID (often in lieu of a drivers license); a military ID card issued by a U.S. uniformed service; a U.S. passport; or an identification card issued by a federally recognized Indian tribe. To get a drivers licensed or state-issued ID, residents are directed to the state Division of Motor Vehicles. You need to go to a DMV customer service center, fill out two forms and present documents (such as a marriage certificate) to prove your identity, as well as documents (such as a pay stub, a utility bill or a bank statement) to prove you’re a Wisconsin resident. So, if you’re in Sauk City, which is about 30 miles northwest of Madison, how do you find the nearest DMV office? We went to the DMV’s online locator for DMV offices by city and chose the listing for Sauk City. That DMV service center is inside the Sauk City Community Center. And, sure enough, as Oliver’s piece stated, it’s open only on the fifth Wednesday of every month, from 8:15 a.m. to 4 p.m. The DMV doesn’t list the actual dates, so we looked them up. The four fifth Wednesdays in 2016 are in, as Oliver noted, March, June, August and November. (Oliver even offered a clever rhyme to remember when the fifth Wednesdays fall, but it’s a little profane.) A number of DMV locations relatively nearby, however, are open more often. The one in Baraboo (home to Circus World), about 20 miles away, is open 7 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays and Wednesdays. The one in Reedsburg ("fastest available" Internet speeds in Wisconsin), about 30 miles away, is open the first, second and third Wednesday of each month from 8:15 a.m. to 4 p.m. And in Madison, the nearest major city, there are three DMV facilities that are open even more during the week, plus Saturday mornings. To be sure, Sauk City isn't the only small town where DMV hours are limited, but no DMV site is open less. Our rating Oliver said that in Sauk City, Wis., "the ID office" that provides identification for voting "is only open on the fifth Wednesday of every month" -- a total of four days in 2016. He’s correct that the state DMV office in Sauk City is only open on those four days in 2016, but that isn’t the only place where residents can go to get a state ID that they can use for voting. Several other locations within a relatively short drive of Sauk City are open much more often. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.

pomt-14031	"I believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change. That is not (Hillary Clinton's) position."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/29/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-only-he-supports-carbon-tax-an/	Bernie Sanders still doesn’t want to talk about Hillary Clinton’s damn emails. Asked for his reaction to the State Department report of Clinton’s use of a private email server, Sanders told Meet the Press’ Chuck Todd that he’d rather talk policy differences. "Our campaign is about defeating Secretary Clinton on the real issues," he responded. "I want to break up the Wall Street banks. She doesn’t. I want to raise the minimum wage to 15 bucks an hour. She wants $12 an hour. I voted against the war in Iraq. She voted for the war in Iraq. I believe we should ban fracking. She does not. I believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change. That is not her position. Those are some of the issues that I am campaigning on." Sanders is right about Clinton’s Iraq war vote and where she stands on breaking up banks, a $15 minimum wage and fracking. (For more of their policy differences, read this.) But is he also right about their differences on carbon tax and climate change? There’s no doubt that Sanders’ rhetoric on climate change and his plan to deal with it are aggressive and, unlike Clinton, he has advocated for a carbon tax. Clinton does, however, have a climate change plan. While some environmentalists have said it isn’t tough enough, others have given it positive reviews. Both the Sanders and Clinton campaigns referred us to each candidate’s climate change plan. Sanders’ plan is long and comprehensive. Beyond a tax on carbon, it includes an array of proposals from banning certain drilling and mining practices to improving the national public transit system. Clinton’s plan is shorter and, though it doesn’t include a tax on carbon, contains similar provisions on renewables. Here’s an overview: Sanders’ plan Clinton’s plan Fossil fuel influence • Cut tax subsidies for oil and gas companies • Prohibit fossil fuel lobbyists from working in the White House • Investigate climate change deniers • Cut tax subsidies for oil and gas companies Environmental standards • Enact a tax on carbon • Ban fossil fuel leasing on public lands and promote conservation and habitat preservation • Ban Arctic oil drilling, offshore drilling, fracking, mountaintop removal coal mining and pipeline projects • Stop exports of natural gas and crude oil • Defend and close loopholes in the Clean Air Act • Increase fuel efficiency standards • Begin a moratorium on nuclear power • Create a national environmental and climate justice plan • Reform fossil fuel leasing and expand clean energy production on public lands • Defend and extend environmental standards like the Clean Power Plan • Eliminate lead poisoning, clean up brownfield sites, and create an Environmental Justice Task Force Renewables • Invest in clean energy infrastructure and modernize the energy grid • Invest in clean energy, alternative fuels and energy efficiency programs • Invest in clean energy infrastructure • Launch a $60 billion local-state-federal clean energy partnership As in her plan, Clinton prefers to focus on renewables on the stump. In a January Medium post responding to the Sanders camp, Clinton’s campaign manager highlighted her pledge to "make America the clean energy superpower of the 21st century" in her launch speech. Clinton, who played a role in negotiating the Paris climate change agreement, herself touted her goals for more solar panel and clean electricity as "big" and "bold." Clinton has gotten her best reviews from the League of Conservation Voters, who endorsed Clinton last fall (to some controversy). The green group considers Clinton’s plan strong and aggressive and, more importantly, achievable, Tiernan Sittenfeld, its senior vice president of government affairs, told PolitiFact. "Hillary is focused on practical solutions," Sittenfeld said, pointing out that there are many lawmakers in Congress who still deny climate change science. "So (a carbon tax) is pretty remote possibility." But some are skeptical of Clinton’s "boldness." Pulitzer Prize-winning website InsideClimate News called Clinton’s plan ambitious but said it "falls short of bold." The Washington Post’s editorial board said her ideas are "second best." Environmental news magazine Grist summed up her positions as not bad but "not quite the climate hawkishness we need." Our ruling Sanders said, "I believe we should have tax on carbon and deal aggressively with climate change. That is not her position." Unlike Sanders, Clinton doesn’t advocate for a carbon tax. And while Clinton doesn’t go as far as Sanders in her climate change plan, she does have one. The League of Conservation Voters supports her plan as realistic and achievable.

pomt-06991	"There are actually half a million fewer government employees now than there were when (President Barack) Obama took office."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/11/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-says-government-jobs-have-fallen-half/	In the July 11, 2011, edition of the New York Times, Paul Krugman -- a Nobel Prize-winning economist and liberal columnist -- noted a statistic about recent trends in government employment. He wrote, "Everybody knows that President (Barack) Obama tried to stimulate the economy with a huge increase in government spending, and that it didn’t work. But what everyone knows is wrong. Think about it: Where are the big public works projects? Where are the armies of government workers? There are actually half a million fewer government employees now than there were when Mr. Obama took office." Has government employment really gone down in the past two and a half years? We looked in the databases for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official tabulator of employment statistics. We found that between January 2009 (when Obama took office) and June 2011 (the most recent month available), Krugman was right for overall government employment -- the combination of federal, state and local government workers. Overall government employment declined by 518,000 workers, or about 2.3 percent of the January 2009 level. So his statistic is correct. But the closer you look at the data, the more varied the data becomes. First, let’s look at federal government employment, which accounts for just 13 percent of all government employment. The number of federal workers has increased by 38,000 over the same period -- an increase of 1.4 percent. And if you separate out the U.S. Postal Service, the growth was even bigger. Non-postal federal employment -- about 10 percent of all government employment -- increased over the same period by 139,000 workers, or 6.7 percent. The decline in government employment clearly wasn’t driven by job losses at the federal level. It came from state and local government. So we’ll look at the trends for those categories here. State employment accounts for 23 percent of the government workforce. State government payrolls declined by 113,000 over the same period, or 2.2 percent. Within this category, state education workers -- who account for a little under half of state workers -- actually rose slightly over the period. The hits were taken in the remainder of the state workforce -- a decline of 115,500, or 4.1 percent. But the biggest declines in the government sector came in local government. Local government -- which accounts for 64 percent of all government employment -- fell by 443,000 workers, or 3 percent. That accounts for a huge portion of the half-million decrease in jobs that Krugman cited. Education workers at the local level fared worse than those at the state level. Local education workers declined by 204,800, or 2.5 percent. Non-education workers in local government fared even worse -- employment was down 238,400, or 3.7 percent. The decline in government workers has certainly had an impact on the overall employment picture. Since the recession officially ended in June 2009, private payrolls have increased by more than 1 million workers, but government payrolls have declined by 493,000 -- cutting the number of jobs created almost in half. So how does all this relate to Krugman’s comment? The fact that federal employment outside the Postal Service has risen by 6.7 percent in the past two and a half years is an important point to recognize for anyone studying employment trends. But Krugman was careful enough to avoid suggesting that federal employment declined by a half-million jobs. In fact, since a large chunk of the stimulus came in the form of aid to states -- specifically to help save jobs in education and other government sectors -- using total government employment figures as a yardstick seems reasonable to us. So we rate his statement True.	None	Paul Krugman	None	None	None	2011-07-11T14:40:33	2011-07-11	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-09242	On military recruiters at Harvard, Elena Kagan "took a position and the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that she was wrong."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/10/john-barrasso/supreme-court-rejected-arguments-kagan-promoted/	One of Elena Kagan's top credentials -- that she was dean of Harvard Law School -- created some controversy on the day that President Barack Obama announced her nomination to the U.S. Supreme Court. As dean, Kagan took a lead role in trying to keep military recruiters off campus because of the "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" policy that prevents gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military. Several Republicans pointed to that episode in their initial comments on Kagan, calling the incident troubling. Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., also pointed out that the incident put her on the losing side of a Supreme Court ruling. At Harvard Law School, Barrasso said, "She took a position and the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that she was wrong." Barrasso said he was keeping an open mind on the nomination. We were interested in fact-checking his statement that the Supreme Court "ruled unanimously that she was wrong." The controversy over military recruiters began even before Kagan became dean of Harvard Law in 2003. Harvard was one of several top-tier law schools that attempted to ban military recruiters because of the policy that prevented gays and lesbians from serving openly in the military. In 2003, Kagan penned a letter to the law school community expressing her thoughts on the issue: "I abhor the military's discriminatory recruitment policy. The importance of the military to our society -- and the extraordinary service that members of the military provide to all the rest of us -- makes this discrimination more, not less, repugnant. The military's policy deprives many men and women of courage and character from having the opportunity to serve their country in the greatest way possible. This is a profound wrong -- a moral injustice of the first order. And it is a wrong that tears at the fabric of our own community, because some of our members cannot, while others can, devote their professional careers to their country." Congress threatened to yank federal funding for schools that banned recruiters through a measure known as the Solomon Amendment, named for Rep. Gerald Solomon, R-N.Y., and first passed in 1996. Schools and recruiters tried to sort out their differences in the intervening years, with some schools providing partial access. But eventually the issue came before the Supreme Court in 2004 in a case known as Rumsfeld vs. Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, known as FAIR. FAIR was an association of law schools that opposed the Solomon Amendment. In her role as a professor of law at Havard, Kagan signed onto an amicus brief (sometimes known as a "friend of the court" brief) filed by 40 Harvard professors that argued that the federal government should not be able to withhold funding if the schools applied the same policies to all recruiters. Harvard, for example, required all recruiters to sign forms indicating they would not discriminate against applicants based on sexual orientation. The withholding of funds interfered with the schools' freedom of expression to oppose what they felt were discriminatory policies. The Harvard law professors argued in their brief that "this case is not -- and has never been -- about whether law schools may 'discriminate' against the military or whether they must provide 'equal access' to military recruiters. Instead, the question is whether the Solomon Amendment confers upon military recruiters the unprecedented entitlement to disregard neutral and generally applicable recruiting rules whenever a school's failure to make a special exception might incidentally hinger or preclude military recruiting. The answer is 'no.'" The Supreme Court, however, disagreed in an 8-0 ruling on March 6, 2006. The majority opinion, written by Chief Justice John Roberts, ruled against FAIR and, in doing so, rejected the claims of Kagan and the other law professors that the school had the right to enforce non-discrimination policies against the military. "Under the statute, military recruiters must be given the same access as recruiters who comply with the policy," the opinion said. The court also rejected arguments that claimed that the law schools' treatment of military recruiters could be considered expression under the First Amendment. If the action itself were purely expressive, the court reasoned, the schools would not have to issue statements explaining their actions. The court compared the situation to someone who says he won't pay his income taxes because he disapproves of the Internal Revenue Service. The disapproval is protected speech, but the non-payment of taxes is not. The opinion was supported by Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy, David Souter, Clarence Thomas, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, and Stephen Breyer joining Roberts. Justice Samuel Alito did not participate because he had not yet been seated to the court when oral arguments were made. Barrasso said Kagan "took a position and the Supreme Court ruled unanimously that she was wrong." The court did reject the arguments put forward by the law schools, which included FAIR and the brief filed by the Harvard professors. All of the justices who voted opposed the law schools' arguments. So we rate Barrasso's statement True.	None	John Barrasso	None	None	None	2010-05-10T18:24:15	2010-05-10	['Elena_Kagan', 'Harvard_University']

pomt-15075	"Eighty-three law enforcement officers have died in the line of duty this year. Twenty-four of them were shot and killed in cold blood."	true	/georgia/statements/2015/sep/22/casey-cagle/cagle-right-law-enforcement-death-count/	Years have passed, but not the collective chill that comes when our minds are drawn back to Sept. 11, 2001. In the days leading up to this year’s 14th anniversary of the terrorists’ attacks, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle issued a press release, urging Georgians to stop to reflect on the critical role that law enforcement officers play in our communities. "Eighty-three law enforcement officers have died in the line of duty this year," Cagle said in the statement issued Sept. 8, "Twenty-four of them were shot and killed in cold blood." Those are sobering national statistics, the sort that have been replayed more lately -- the result of angry displays and discourse that have escalated since the August 2014 killing of a black teenager by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri. But are the stats accurate? PolitiFact decided to check. We contacted Ben Fry, Cagle’s chief of staff, who said the numbers came from the Officer Down Memorial Page, a resource that he said was recommended by the Georgia Sheriffs Association. The privately run website is dedicated to memorializing police officers who die in the line of duty and is constantly updated. It showed a 2015 death count of 92 by Sunday, Sept. 20, that included seven Georgia law enforcement officers. The causes of death varied. Twenty-eight died from gunfire, two accidentally. Auto and motorcycle accidents claimed 24 lives. Vehicle pursuits killed four, and vehicle assaults three. Heart attacks accounted for 15 deaths, and a fall caused one death. Five law enforcement officers died in 2015 of illnesses related to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, according to the website. Texas and Louisiana have had the most officers die this year, 10 and 9, respectively. The website numbers track those in Cagle’s statement; they’re more current and so higher. We decided to spot check the website’s data against information gathered for the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial, as well media reports. The names of officers who die in the line of duty are etched in marble each spring, in conjunction with National Police Week, at the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington D.C. That group keeps up-to-date data on law enforcement deaths and reported 92 on Sunday (identical to what the Officer Down Memorial Page was reporting that day.) We also used Google to verify all seven of the officer deaths in Georgia noted on the Officer Down Memorial Page. This included DeKalb County Police Officer Kevin Toatley, who was killed Saturday night when his patrol car was struck head on by a vehicle traveling in the wrong direction on South Fulton Parkway. The Officer Down Memorial Page, which has data that appears spot on, says that with the count of 92 deaths as of Sept. 20, all law enforcement deaths for 2015 are down 1 percent this year, compared to 2014. Gunfire deaths are down 26 percent; and auto-related deaths, at 36, are up 13 percent. (In May of this year. the FBI released its preliminary stats for 2014 law enforcement deaths in the line of duty. It showed 51 law enforcement officers were feloniously killed, meaning they were killed with "criminal intent, as opposed to by accident), an increase of almost 89 percent from 2013 when the death count was 27. Between 1980 and 2014, an average of 64 law enforcement officers died this way each year. The 2013 death count was the lowest in this 35-year period.) With all the conversation about relations between the police and the communities they serve, that’s valuable information to know, especially when a recent poll by Rasmussen Reports.com suggests that all those discussions may be influencing public thinking. The telephone survey showed that 58 percent of likely U.S. voters believe there’s a war on police in America today. Our conclusion: In the days leading up to the 9/11 anniversary, Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle issued a press release, urging Georgians to stop to reflect on the critical role that law enforcement officers play in our communities. "Eighty-three law enforcement officers have died in the line of duty this year. Twenty-four of them were shot and killed in cold blood," he said. His numbers come from a group that works to diligently track data and pay tribute to law enforcement officers who die in the line of duty. We rate Cagle’s statement True.

pomt-01498	"Every time [the people from Newport Tent] work in a city or town they have a whole different set of permits that they have to get in order to pitch a tent."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/sep/25/catherine-taylor/catherine-taylor-says-plethora-rules-tent-permits-/	In her campaign for lieutenant governor, Catherine Taylor has talked broadly of boosting the Rhode Island economy by, among other things, streamlining business regulations. During a recent appearance on Channel 6’s "On the Record," Taylor, a Republican who resigned from her position as head of the state Division of Elderly Affairs to run for office, argued that red tape at the local level is impeding business. She referred to the experience of one Rhode Island company to illustrate her point. "I go back to the Newport Tent example," she said on the show that aired Sept. 7. "Every time they work in a city or town they have a whole different set of permits that they have to get in order to pitch a tent." This particular claim about Newport Tent sounded familiar to us. It turns out that former Journal staff writer Cynthia Needham (now an editor at the Boston Globe) wrote about the company’s struggles with permitting in a May 4, 2010 story with the headline "New bills could reduce red tape." In the story, Newport Tent owner Bill Corcoran complained about the time and effort it takes to comply with all the differing rules in Rhode Island’s 39 cities and towns. During the busy season in spring and summer, one employee devotes her time to driving around the state getting all the necessary permits, he said at the time. But that was four years ago. Weren’t the nine proposed bills written about in that article supposed to create more uniform permitting processes and put time limits on how long communities have to complete requests? When we contacted Taylor’s campaign, her campaign manager, Zach Sherman, first pointed us to the Rhode Island statute that requires Newport Tent -- or any other tent company - to obtain permits from local authorities. The link he sent was out-of-date. The General Assembly recently changed the law, increasing the minimum size of tents subject to local approvals from 120 square feet to 350 square feet. Sherman also gave us Corcoran’s number, so we called him. Our first question was the obvious one. Haven’t things gotten better since that 2010 package of legislation won passage? No, he said flatly. The problem isn’t so much that each of the state’s cities and towns requires a permit before Corcoran’s company can put up a tent, it’s that the requirements for those permits vary so widely, he said. Some communities require a trip to the building inspector and then the fire department. Some reverse the process. Others call for two visits to the building department. There is little consistency, he said. For example, he said, Providence requires a signed form from a property owner authorizing a tent to be put up. No other community requires such an authorization. We looked at regulations in other cities and towns and found more differences. In Cranston, tent stakes must be installed at least 10 feet apart and aisles must be at least 44 inches wide, according to rules posted by that city’s Fire Department. The Watch Hill Fire Department in Westerly isn’t so specific, requiring only that there be no trip hazards in the tent. Corcoran also said Newport is the only community in the state that allows his company to do business by phone or mail, largely because of the company’s 40-years-plus year history of work there. Permit applications in all other cities and towns must be done in person. Corcoran says there’s more flexibility in Connecticut and Massachusetts. In Connecticut, where his company erected a tent last weekend, everything was done by phone and email, he said. "That was easy," he said. "They had the forms right online." In Rhode Island, he said, he still has an employee who works nearly full-time on permitting in the state. Our ruling Catherine Taylor said that tent companies such as Newport Tent must meet different permit requirements in each of Rhode Island’s cities and towns. Although the state legislature has worked to ease the regulations governing Newport Tent and other tent companies, one thing hasn’t changed. Those companies must still seek permits from cities and towns through processes that vary widely and have differing requirements. We rule Taylor’s claim True.

pomt-04958	"We created as many jobs in the first six months of this year as we did in all of 2011 and 2011 was the best single year for private-sector job growth since the year 2000."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/26/chris-christie/chris-christie-new-jersey-gained-more-jobs-first-s/	Gov. Chris Christie said his self-proclaimed "Jersey Comeback" continues to gain momentum, despite a rising unemployment rate. At a July 23 news conference in Trenton, Christie said he would like to see the unemployment rate -- which jumped to 9.6 percent in June from 9.2 percent in May -- drop, but cited other labor statistics to show a more optimistic picture of the state’s employment market. "By the way, the numbers indicate that the comeback is still very strong -- 9,900 new jobs last month. We created as many jobs in the first six months of this year as we did in all of 2011 and 2011 was the best single year for private-sector job growth since the year 2000," Christie said. Is job growth as vibrant as the governor claims? In this fact-check, we are strictly examining whether the numbers are correct, not whether Christie's policies deserve credit for them. We found Christie’s numbers are on target. In June, the state added 9,900 jobs overall, including private-sector and public-sector employment. Adding that to the jobs gained since the beginning of the year puts 2012’s total so far at 39,600 jobs overall, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Last year the state gained 31,100 jobs. So the first six months of job gains in 2012 have already outpaced job growth in 2011 by 8,500 jobs, supporting the governor’s point. Christie also said "2011 was the best single year for private-sector job growth since the year 2000." That is accurate as well. New Jersey added 33,400 private-sector jobs in 2011. The year before that, the state gained 10,200 jobs. And in 2008 and 2009 -- in the peak of the recession -- the state lost 224,900 private-sector jobs in total. Over the last decade, New Jersey only experienced better job growth in 2000 than it did in 2011. In 2000, the state added 64,500 private-sector jobs. Our ruling Christie said that "we created as many jobs in the first six months of this year as we did in all of 2011 and 2011 was the best single year for private-sector job growth since the year 2000." So far this year New Jersey added 39, 600 jobs in total. That’s 8,500 more jobs than the state gained in all of 2011. And in 2011, the state added more private-sector jobs than any year since 2000. The governor earns a True on this claim. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2012-07-26T07:30:00	2012-07-23	['None']
pomt-01656	"Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/aug/21/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-federal-program-incentivizes-police/	With heavily armored vehicles stationed in the streets and law enforcement officers dressed in camouflage, many have dubbed Ferguson, Mo., a "war zone." After a white Ferguson police officer shot and killed black teenager Michael Brown Aug. 9, much of the conversation has focused on race relations, and the interactions between police and the community. There’s also been criticism of local police forces using military-style equipment and generally giving the appearance of conducting a military operation. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., weighed in on this topic in a Time magazine column, where he said big government’s to blame for this trend. "Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts by using federal dollars to help municipal governments build what are essentially small armies—where police departments compete to acquire military gear that goes far beyond what most of Americans think of as law enforcement." Many recent media reports have tied police militarization to a federal program that gives surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies. Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Ga., has announced that he’s working on a bill to amend this program, in order to scale back police militarization, in light of the situation in Ferguson. We wanted to know more about the program and what experts had to say about it. They told us that the program certainly has contributed to a militarized police force, but that's not the only reason. What is this program, and is it to blame? Paul’s talking about the 1033 program, known as such because it’s outlined in section 1033 of the 1997 National Defense Authorization Act. Congress first approved the program in the 1990 National Defense Authorization Act (then section 1208), as part of the country’s war on drugs, which began in the 1970s. Law enforcement agencies felt outgunned -- police carried handguns, while drug criminals wielded assault rifles. However, much of the equipment the agencies wanted was far out of their price range. The 1033 program allows local law enforcement agencies to acquire surplus military equipment, at nearly no cost (they have to pay for transporting the equipment). This ranges from field gear -- like assault weapons, armored vehicles, night-vision goggles and bulletproof vests -- to office supplies -- like filing cabinets, computers and desks. More than 8,000 agencies participate in the 1033 program, which has given out more than $5 billion in property since it started, according to the website of the Defense Logistics Agency, the government body that oversees the program. (To be clear, the incentive here is the free equipment alone, not any additional payment or reward for accepting it.) Law enforcement agencies apply for specific equipment through the Defense Logistics Agency. Agencies are given preference if they request equipment specifically for counter-drug and counter-terrorism purposes. Additionally, since 9/11, law enforcement agencies have received grants from the Department of Homeland Security to address potential terrorist threats, and some have used those grants to purchase military gear. Public opinion on police using military equipment varies with context, said Jim Bueermann, president of the Police Foundation and a former police chief. For example, in the case of a major bank robbery where multiple robbers have machine guns and are holding people hostage, the community would likely be glad their local police has comparable weapons, an armored vehicle and protective gear. However, when police break out that sort of equipment and military-style tactics at a peaceful protest, they look understandably bad, Bueermann said. For example, HBO television host John Oliver ridiculed police in Keene, N.H., recently for requesting a "military-grade armored personnel truck," citing the town’s annual pumpkin festival as a potential terrorist target. (We rated Oliver’s statement True.) What else is at play? We spoke with many experts, and all agreed that there is an upward trend of police militarization. They said the 1033 program has accelerated this trend, but it’s not the sole cause. Much of the change is rooted in police culture. In fact, many of the experts we spoke with said that absent the 1033 program, police would still want military-grade equipment -- they just wouldn’t be able to afford it. "Militarization is not just equipment -- it’s an ideology and a mindset," said Victor Kappeler, associate dean of justice studies at Eastern Kentucky University. The shift from a community service culture to one that is more militaristic began in the 1960s with the rise of SWAT teams -- made prominent by the Los Angeles Police Department and their response to the violent Watts Riots, said Brian Buchner, president of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement. Police departments across the country quickly created their own SWAT teams elite squads that used military-like tactics. Police started to use SWAT-like tactics in less hostile situations -- such as no-knock raids to execute low-level drug busts -- because of a small (and in some cases unreasonable) fear that they would encounter heavily armed suspects, Buchner said. "That training seeped into other parts of police operations and police culture," Buchner said. The 1033 program has exacerbated the problem, because in the past, when police agencies didn’t have this equipment, they were unable to act as a military force, Kappeler said. Instead of responding to a protest with armored vehicles, they would have had to address the issue in a "community-based" way. But it’s not just the government pushing this equipment on law enforcement agencies. Private defense manufacturers have also started to make dual-purpose equipment that they can market to the military, as well as civilian law enforcement agencies, said Kathleen Campbell, a professor at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point who studies role convergence between police and the military. (Campbell asked us to note that her views and research are her own and do not reflect the views of West Point, the army or the federal government.) Now when police officers see military-style equipment and uniforms in catalogs, they think that’s what they’re supposed to look like -- perpetuating the culture, said John DeCarlo, an associate professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice and a former police chief, in a Washington Post interview. Culture spillover also comes from interactions between the police and military, Campbell said, noting that the two collaborate in anti-drug and anti-terror efforts. Aspects of police work that mirror the military -- like officer hierarchy and a focus on discipline -- make the profession a good fit for former military personnel. A 2010 Bureau of Labor Statistics study found that 10 percent of all employed male veterans ages 18 to 54 work in some sort of protective service, which includes police, sheriff officers, correctional officers, bailiffs and security workers. The recent recession also could have forced police to lose sight of community policing, Bueermann said. Stripped down to their bare bones, some agencies have lost community policing positions, like school resource officers, and are left only with the law enforcement positions. This makes them appear less like they are there to help the community and more like they are there to control it. And it has made agencies more inclined to take advantage of programs like 1033 because they can get free equipment. Our ruling Paul said, "Washington has incentivized the militarization of local police precincts." We found that the government’s 1033 program, which gives surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies, has contributed to police militarization by offering free equipment. But it’s not the only thing. Police culture has shifted toward militarization for a number of reasons over the past 40 years. The program (and Washington) might not be the cause of police militarization, but it does incentivize and allow that culture to continue. We rate Paul’s statement True.

pomt-09968	"We were not, I repeat, were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods were used."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/12/nancy-pelosi/cia-documents-claim-speaker-pelosi-was-told-about-/	Republicans who oppose efforts to pursue legal action against government lawyers who signed off on waterboarding and other controversial interrogation techniques used after 9/11 have settled on a high-profile target: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In the latest game of "What did she know and when?" Republicans claim Democrats' outrage is hypocritical because Pelosi and other Democrats were briefed on waterboarding and other "enhanced interrogation techniques" back in 2002 and 2003 and did not raise objections. In an April 23, 2009, news conference, Pelosi was asked if, during the fall of 2002, she and other key members of the intelligence committee were briefed on interrogation methods, including waterboarding. Pelosi said that on only one occasion had she received a CIA briefing on interrogation techniques, but that "we were not, I repeat, were not told that waterboarding or any of these other enhanced interrogation methods were used. What they did tell us is that they had some legislative counsel — the Office of Legislative Counsel opinions that they could be used, but not that they would." "Further," she said, "the point was that if and when they would be used, they could brief Congress at that time. ... My experience was they did not tell us they were using that, flat out. And any contention to the contrary is simply not true." But her comments are directly contradicted by a CIA timeline prepared by the director of national intelligence that indicates that Pelosi and Rep. Porter Goss, R-Fla., then-chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, were briefed on enhanced interrogation techniques. Specifically, the CIA timeline states that on Sept. 4, 2002, Pelosi and Goss received a "Briefing on EITs (enhanced interrogation techniques) including use of EITs on (alleged al-Qaida operative) Abu Zubaydah, background on authorities, and a description of the particular EITs that had been employed." That briefing came a month after the CIA began using Justice Department-approved enhanced interrogation techniques — including the drowning simulation technique known as waterboarding — on Abu Zubaydah, according to a Justice Department memo released in March 2009. The CIA version is backed up by Goss, who resigned from Congress in 2004 to become CIA director under President George W. Bush, a post Goss held until 2006. In an April 25, 2009, commentary for the Washington Post, Goss said "a disturbing epidemic of amnesia seems to be plaguing my former colleagues on Capitol Hill." Goss said he was "slack-jawed to read that members claim to have not understood that the techniques on which they were briefed were to actually be employed; or that specific techniques such as 'waterboarding' were never mentioned." "Let me be clear," Goss wrote, "It is my recollection that: The chairs and the ranking minority members of the House and Senate intelligence committees, known as the Gang of Four (including Pelosi), were briefed that the CIA was holding and interrogating high-value terrorists; we understood what the CIA was doing; we gave the CIA our bipartisan support; we gave the CIA funding to carry out its activities." Pelosi has been adamant that her briefing was not about interrogation techniques that had been done in the past or present, but only were under consideration for the future. "They can say whatever they want, but the fact is they did not brief us in that regard," Pelosi said. The timeline — and Goss' corroboration — contradicts her, although we should add one caveat about specific discussions of waterboarding. Although Goss says waterboarding was part of the discussion, there's nothing in the CIA timeline that states it was specifically discussed in the briefing Pelosi attended. So if we stick strictly to public documents released so far, there's no conclusive evidence that Pelosi was briefed on waterboarding. However, waterboarding was specifically mentioned elsewhere in the timeline for briefings for other members of the intelligence committee who presumably would be covered by her reference to "we." The timeline says waterboarding was mentioned in a Feb. 4, 2003, briefing with Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., and Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., during which, according to the CIA data, enhanced interrogation techniques were "described in considerable detail," including "how the water board was used." Roberts was chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee at the time, and Rockefeller was ranking Democrat. Jamie Smith, a Rockefeller spokeswoman, told the Chicago Tribune "Sen. Rockefeller was briefed but was not presented with the full picture, nor was he told critical information that would have cast significant doubt on the program's legality and effectiveness." In a May 5, 2009, memo submitted with the timeline, CIA director Leon Panetta acknowledged the differing accounts of the meeting that Pelosi and Goss attended. But he said the CIA's version is based in part on records created at the time of the meeting. "This letter presents the most thorough information we have on dates, locations, and names of all members of Congress who were briefed by the CIA on enhanced interrogation techniques," Panetta stated in his letter to Rep. Silvestre Reyes, chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. "This information, however, is drawn from the past files of the CIA and represents MFRs (memorandums for the record) completed at the time and notes that summarized the best recollections of those individuals. In the end, you and the committee will have to determine whether this information is an accurate summary of what actually happened." At PolitiFact, we normally would be reluctant to make a Truth-O-Meter ruling in a he-said, she-said situation, but in this case, the evidence goes beyond the competing accounts from Pelosi and Goss. We are persuaded by the CIA timeline, which the agency says is based on "an extensive review of (the CIA's) electronic and hard copy files." It's also important to note that the timeline that contradicts Pelosi was put together at the behest of an administration controlled by her own party. That document provides compelling — albeit sparsely worded — evidence that Pelosi's recollection is incorrect. There may be further evidence on this that emerges in the future. Rep. Pete Hoekstra, R-Mich., the top Republican on the House Intelligence Committee, has asked director of national intelligence Dennis Blair and CIA director Leon Panetta to release the CIA briefing notes that the timeline is based on. We reserve the right to change our ruling if new information emerges that contradicts the CIA timeline, but for now, we rule Pelosi's statement False.

pomt-05859	Says a federal judge in San Antonio "issued a ruling that … not only could the students not pray at their graduation, if they used the word ‘benediction,’ the word ‘invocation,’ the word ‘God,’ asked the audience to stand or asked for a moment of silence, he would put the superintendent in jail."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/feb/12/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-judge-threatened-jail-texas-sup/	Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich has his eye on a U.S. district judge in San Antonio. Gingrich has mentioned Fred Biery on the stump when arguing that the legislative and executive branches of government should remove judges perceived as abusing their power and acting out of sync with the nation’s culture. On Jan. 21, 2012, after winning the South Carolina Republican presidential primary, Gingrich again referenced Biery, urging voters to check out a position paper on his campaign website about "the balance of power, putting the judiciary back in its proper role and eliminating dictatorial religious bigots such as Judge Biery in San Antonio, who issued a ruling that … not only could the students not pray at their graduation, if they used the word ‘benediction,’ the word ‘invocation,’ the word ‘God,’ asked the audience to stand or asked for a moment of silence, he would put the superintendent in jail." A reader alerted us to Gingrich’s talk of Biery after the candidate mentioned the judge during a Dec. 18, 2011, appearance on the CBS News show Face the Nation. For this article, we’re checking the accuracy of the candidate’s description of Biery’s order during his South Carolina speech. We’re not going to delve into whether Biery is a "dictatorial religious bigot" — that’s Gingrich’s opinion — or whether his decision on prayer at graduation is an example of the judiciary overstepping its role. The case Taking Gingrich’s suggestion in his victory speech, we checked out the 54-page paper on his website, "Bringing the Courts Back Under the Constitution." Its Appendix B is devoted to Biery, chief judge of the federal Western District of Texas, and is headlined: "Federal district court judge orders the censoring of high school graduation speech." At issue: A June 1, 2011, order from Biery granting an agnostic family’s request for a temporary order prohibiting the 3,000-student Medina Valley school district, west of San Antonio, from including a prayer in its high school’s then-pending graduation ceremony. Gingrich spokesman Joe DeSantis pointed out the order when we asked for the backup for Gingrich’s victory-speech statement. In a May 26, 2011, lawsuit, the family challenged Medina Valley High School’s tradition of having students deliver an invocation and benediction as part of the graduation, a practice that the family said amounted to unconstitutional school-sponsored prayer. The lawsuit, filed on behalf of the family by the Washington-based Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said Christa and Danny Schultz were exposed to the "unwelcome prayers" at the high school’s 2009 ceremony, when their oldest child graduated. The couple’s younger son was in the 2011 graduating class. The lawsuit said: "If the Schultzes were to attend the graduation of their son, they would once again be exposed to the school district’s longstanding practice of presenting prayers as part of graduation ceremonies" unless the court stopped it. The lawsuit alleged that the graduation prayers violated the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment — "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion" — and included a request that the judge issue an emergency order prohibiting the district "from including any prayer … whether denominated an ‘invocation,’ ‘benediction,’ or otherwise" at the graduation on June 4, 2011. During a May 31, 2011, hearing on the request, Craig Wood, a lawyer representing the school district, argued that with respect to the graduation speeches, the district was adhering to a 2007 state law that Wood said was enacted "to honor the fact that students do sometimes wish to express religious viewpoints and ought not be penalized for doing so." Wood was referring to the Texas Religious Viewpoints Anti-discrimination Act, which requires each school district to adopt a policy enabling student speakers at school events, including graduation ceremonies, to voluntarily express a religious viewpoint. At graduations, the law says, districts must "state, in writing, orally, or both, that the student's speech does not reflect the endorsement, sponsorship, position, or expression of the district." "We're attempting to balance those First Amendment interests of all parties involved," Wood told Biery. "And I will acknowledge, your honor, in a community like Medina Valley, it is not unusual for there to be a student selected (to speak at graduation) who would, in fact, make some sort of reference to some sort of religious deity. I will also tell you that in the last couple of years that the closing remarks made by the student had no religious connotation whatsoever." By the end of the hearing, Biery had made it clear that he planned to grant the Schultzes’ request, articulating in court essentially what appeared the following day in his injunction. Ayesha Khan, legal director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, who represented the family at the hearing, requested that Biery’s order specify that the students’ remarks could not include a prayer. "Well, I will put that in there: It’s not to be a prayer," Biery said. "On the other hand, if these young ladies get up and say the same thing without invoking a deity, or they make a personal statement: I believe, myself, in a higher being, like I think Mr. Wood used that phrase. And they can make a personal statement of their own belief. I think that's certainly acceptable." The order Biery’s order, dated June 1, says the district and "its officials, agents, servants, and employees, as well as all persons acting in concert with them, are prohibited from allowing a prayer (as defined in paragraph (b) below) to be included" in the ceremony. Paragraph b mandates that: ** the district instruct the students chosen to deliver the "invocation" and "benediction" to change their remarks to be "statements of their own beliefs as opposed to leading the audience in prayer." ** everyone scheduled to speak at the graduation be instructed not to present a prayer, "to wit, they shall be instructed that they may not ask audience members to ‘stand,’ ‘join in prayer,’ or ‘bow their heads,’ they may not end their remarks with ‘amen’ or ‘in [a deity’s name] we pray,’ and they shall not otherwise deliver a message that would commonly be understood to be a prayer, nor use the word ‘prayer’ unless it is used in the student’s expression of the student’s personal belief, as opposed to encouraging others who may not believe in the concept of prayer to join in and believe the same concept." At the end of paragraph B, Biery says that "in stating their own personal beliefs," students may "speak through conduct such as kneeling to face Mecca, the wearing of a yarmulke or hijab or making the sign of the cross." Also in the order, Biery says that the district must remove the terms "invocation" and "benediction" from the "program of ceremonies for the graduation exercises" and that they are to be replaced with "opening remarks" and "closing remarks." Finally, the order says the injunction goes into effect immediately and "shall be enforced by incarceration or other sanctions for contempt of court if not obeyed by district official(s) and their agents." The fact-check So how does Gingrich’s statement describing Biery’s order stand up? Let’s break it down: ** Gingrich’s first claim — that the judge’s order said students could not pray at their graduation — has a basis. The order prohibits student speakers from leading the audience in prayer or delivering "a message that would commonly be understood to be a prayer." Then again, Biery’s order allows the students to talk about their personal beliefs and use the word "prayer" in that context. ** Next, Gingrich says Biery banned the words "benediction" and "invocation" from being spoken. That’s pretty close. Although the order did not specifically prohibit students from uttering "benediction" and "invocation," the district was told to banish the terms from the paper program. And Biery said at the pivotal hearing that "there will be no words ‘invocation,’ ‘benediction’ in the ceremony." ** Gingrich says "God" was also not to be mentioned during graduation speeches. That seems like a reach since Biery’s order has only one curb on mentions of God; it bars speakers from using the phrase "in God’s name we pray." ** Also prohibited, according to Gingrich: asking the audience to stand or asking for a moment of silence. In fact, the order says speakers cannot ask the audience to " ‘stand,’ ‘join in prayer’ or ‘bow their heads’ " — actions that often precede organized prayer. The order does not mention moments of silence. ** Finally, Gingrich says that Biery’s order says the district’s superintendent would go to jail if the boundaries set by the injunction were crossed. That appears to be an overstatement in that the order says it "shall be enforced by incarceration or other sanctions." That is, punishments short of going to jail were possible. In a July 3, 2011, news article about the case, the San Antonio Express-News reported that Biery’s order said "school administrators could be jailed if they didn’t comply." We consulted two legal experts about the wording of that section of Biery’s order. Charles Silver, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, told us: "It’s possible for someone who has violated a court order to be put in jail, but it would be unusual for that to happen. It would be much more likely for the punishment to involve a fine." Mechele Dickerson, a UT law professor who teaches civil procedure, agreed that the most likely punishment for a violation of Biery’s order would have been a fine for the district. Also, she said, had the judge wanted to jail someone, the order’s language doesn’t necessitate that the person be the superintendent — unlike what Gingrich said. The punished person could be another "agent" of the district — the high school’s principal, for example — Dickerson said. Silver and Dickerson each said the punishment section of the order was fairly common. Silver said: "It’s pretty much boilerplate language. The function is really to put people on notice: ‘Hey, the court means this.’ " Each professor also noted that if the order was violated in some way, procedural steps would have to take place before anyone was punished. First, the plaintiffs in the case — the Schultz family — would have to file a motion with the court; and then a hearing would be held so that the judge could decide whether someone — possibly the superintendent — was in contempt. If so, the judge would then decide on punishment. Biery declined our request for an interview. In a telephone interview, Wood, the district’s lawyer, generally supported the views of Silver and Dickerson and said he thought Gingrich’s statement about Biery’s order wasn’t quite right. He agreed that the order’s language about the possible sanctions was standard and was informing the district that "a violation was enforceable vis a vis the regular methods." The sanctions imposed by the judge would most likely have depended upon the circumstances of the violation, Wood said, such as who had done it and "the degree to which they thumbed their nose at the order." The rest of the story Biery’s order survived for two days. On June 2, 2011, the district asked the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans to dissolve Biery’s order barring the students from praying at the graduation, arguing that the court had abused its discretion, that the district had not violated the Establishment Clause and that the injunction had violated the graduation speakers’ "free speech and free exercise of religion rights as well as state law." The Texas attorney general’s office announced that it had filed a brief with the appeals court supporting the district’s appeal. On June 3, a three-judge panel of the appeals court vacated the injunction, saying that they were "not persuaded that plaintiffs have shown that they are substantially likely to prevail on the merits, particularly on the issue that the individual prayers or other remarks to be given by students at graduation are, in fact, school-sponsored." The judges also said the Schultzes’ request for an injunction "may be rooted at least in part in circumstances that no longer exist," pointing to the statement in the district’s appeal that it had agreed not to include the words "invocation" and "benediction" in the graduation program distributed at the event. The panel sent the case — which included more than simply the injunction request — back to the district court, and on Feb. 9, 2012, it was settled. On the issue of speeches at graduation, the settlement says the district will not include a prayer as part of the official program or invite nonstudent speakers that it "has reason to believe will proselytize, promote religion, or disparage the religious beliefs (or lack thereof) of students or members of the community during their remarks." Student speakers will, however, be allowed to pray or ask the audience to join them in prayer. For its part, Wood said, the district agreed to honor "the students’ right to free expression whether it be religious or otherwise, taking careful steps to clarify that it’s not the district’s speech or sponsorship." For example, if a student leads a prayer at the ceremony, district officials must remain seated. Our ruling To recap, Gingrich’s claim is that Biery "issued a ruling that … not only could the students not pray at their graduation, if they used the word ‘benediction,’ the word ‘invocation,’ the word ‘God,’ asked the audience to stand or asked for a moment of silence, he would put the superintendent in jail." The judge’s ruling did not broadly say students could not pray. However, his order prohibited students speaking at the graduation from leading the audience in prayer or delivering "a message that would commonly be understood to be a prayer." Gingrich is close on this part. Also, the judge told the district to banish "benediction" and "invocation" from the event. The rest of Gingrich’s claim, including its crescendo reference to putting the superintendent in jail, has weaknesses. The order did not bar "God" from any mention during the ceremony, only ruling out the phrase "in God’s name we pray." The judge’s order barred students from asking the audience to stand, presumably in preparation for organized prayer, but it did not forbid a moment of silence. The punch line of Gingrich’s primary-night claim — that the Texas order said the superintendent would be jailed if his ruling was violated — overstates things. The order lists incarceration or "other sanctions" as possible penalties, though nothing as a certainty, and doesn’t specify the superintendent as potential inmate. Also, the punishment language appears to have been standard.

pomt-12466	"Sixty-two percent of all (Texas) property taxes are paid by businesses."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/may/05/don-huffines/don-huffines-overstates-share-texas-property-taxes/	State Sen. Don Huffines, R-Dallas, all but scolded students and parents visiting the Texas Capitol who insisted their tax dollars should help improve public schools rather than help fund private schools. Huffines, who has pushed for private school vouchers and "school choice" legislation, asked the visitors from the Richardson school district why they feel they can decide where tax dollars should go when, he said, "62 percent of all property taxes are paid by businesses," not individuals, according to a video of his Feb. 27, 2017, appearance taken by an audience member and posted on YouTube by the pro-Democratic Lone Star Project. Readers asked us to check the share of property taxes paid by businesses, which turned out not to be as straightforward a calculation as hoped. Huffines points to all taxes paid by businesses To our inquiry, a Huffines’ Senate aide, Brent Connett, said by phone the senator drew his "62 percent" figure for the business share of property taxes from data cited in a January 2017 research report by the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, a nonpartisan business group. The report attributed the data to the Council on State Taxation, a Washington-based trade association for corporate businesses, "Nationally," the Texas group reported, "business accounts for 44.1 percent of all state and local taxes. In Texas, business foots 61.5 percent of the total bill." That’s a bit up from what we confirmed in a 2013 fact check finding Mostly True a claim by a Texas Association of Business leader that businesses were paying roughly 60 percent of all state and local taxes – not just property taxes. At the time, a state projection indicated businesses would soon foot 52 percent of all state taxes with residents covering 48 percent. Estimates of property taxes alone But in his appearance before the Richardson visitors, Huffines was speaking solely about the business share of property taxes collected by local jurisdictions including school districts and city and county governments. Hunting figures specific to property taxes only, we turned to the council’s December 2016 report, the same one cited by TTARA, analyzing taxes paid by businesses in the 50 states the year before. In fiscal 2015, the report says, "Texas had the largest dollar increase in business property tax revenue for the third year in a row, collecting $1.3 billion more than in 2014." We didn’t spot any breakdown of the business share of property taxes alone; otherwise, a chart says Texas businesses paid $35 billion in local taxes that year, amounting to 63 percent of $55.3 billion in locally levied taxes including sales and property taxes. We had better luck with TTARA’s president, Dale Craymer, who told us its latest published foray into estimating the business share of property taxes was a May 2008 TTARA research report stating that in 2007, businesses paid 56.4 percent, or $19.5 billion, of $34.6 billion in property taxes collected statewide. Craymer said the association estimated the business share of property taxes starting from biennial reports by the Texas state comptroller breaking down the types of property of businesses and residents, also drawing on research by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which analyzes property taxes paid by different types of industry. The comptroller’s latest data, covering fiscal 2014-15 and published in December 2016, lists categories of property-taxpayers, but that data are hard to decipher because each one is further sorted by governmental jurisdictions with school districts and city governments, for instance, analyzed separately. Most of the 18 categories of property struck us as hard to divide into paid-by-business versus paid-by-others. Fair point, said Austin economist Stuart Greenfield and TTARA analyst John Kennedy. Both said that grouping the categories presented by the comptroller into "businesses" and "residents" isn’t a black-and-white exercise. For instance, Greenfield said, property taxes classified as "multi-family residential" lumps together taxes paid by residents and business owners. That said, the comptroller’s figures applicable to school districts alone suggest that homeowners through 2014-15 paid 43 percent of all school property taxes with others, including businesses, accounting for 57 percent. The 2008 TTARA report says Texas residents in 2007 paid $15.2 billion, or 43.7 percent, of all property taxes. Craymer told us the association subsequently analyzed property taxes collected in more recent years. Those results weren’t published, he said, but it looks like Texas businesses most recently have paid closer to 60 percent of all property taxes, though the percentage also fluctuates. So, per the comptroller’s research, businesses and other non-homeowners have lately accounted for 57 percent of all school property taxes and, according to TTARA, 60 percent of all property taxes. State comptroller’s projections Seeking a state estimate covering all property taxes paid by businesses, we connected with Kevin Lyons, spokesman for Comptroller Glenn Hegar, who gently said no dice. Lyons told us that the agency doesn’t track the business share of property taxes. Then again, he pointed us to biennial comptroller reports projecting business and consumer shares of property taxes levied by type of jurisdiction two years down the road. The latest report, published about three weeks before Huffines spoke, states that businesses in fiscal 2019, beginning Sept. 1, 2018, will likely account for 51.4 percent of what school districts raise in property taxes with individual consumers ponying up 48.6 percent. Among businesses, corporations, partnerships and sole proprietors are projected to provide 41.5, 8.3, and 1.6 percent shares, respectively. Greenfield, a former analyst for the comptroller’s office, said by phone the predicted shares of property taxes funded by "individual consumers" and businesses has remained consistent over time at around 48 percent and 52 percent, respectively, a point that held up in our review of the comptroller’s projections for fiscal 2013, 2015 and 2017. Our ruling Huffines said businesses pay 62 percent of all property taxes. That figure reflects the business share of all state and local taxes including sales taxes--not property taxes alone. Most recently, in contrast, a state projection predicts businesses will account for 51 percent of what school districts raise from property taxes in 2018-19--a share in keeping with previous projections. On the high side, an unpublished TTARA estimate pegs the business share of property taxes at closer to 60 percent. We rate Huffines' claim Half True.

pomt-00427	"If you are a gun store owner and you decide to go out of business … you right now are allowed to convert your entire gun store inventory to ‘personal use’ and once it is a personal use weapon, you can sell it without background checks."	true	/illinois/statements/2018/aug/26/tammy-duckworth/duckworks-background-check-claim-checks-out/	The so-called "gun show loophole," which says private individuals can sell their guns without conducting a federal background check, has come under increased scrutiny in recent years. Speaking at a community center on Chicago’s South Side following the city’s most violent weekend this year, Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth added another wrinkle to that criticism by highlighting an implication of the law that hasn’t received as much attention. "If you are a gun store owner and you decide to go out of business—you retire, you don’t want to do this anymore for whatever reason—you right now are allowed to convert your entire gun store inventory to ‘personal use,’" Duckworth said. "And once it is a personal use weapon, you can sell it without background checks." The first-term Illinois senator made the comment while expressing her support for federal legislation that would require universal background checks for gun purchases, a policy which polls show more than 80 percent of Americans support. The federal government places few restrictions on private sales by people who aren’t legally considered gun dealers. But could a former gun store owner really sell off the remainder of his or her inventory—a veritable arsenal, potentially—without running afoul of the law? The short answer: Yes, generally speaking. PolitiFact Rhode Island rated as True a similar claim in 2013. The more interesting question is why. Private sales Former gun dealers who no longer are licensed to sell guns have the same legal right to sell guns as any other private citizen. The federal rules for private sellers state they can’t give or sell a firearm to someone they know or reasonably believe is prohibited from owning a gun. They also can’t sell or transport firearms across state lines. But that’s pretty much it—although 19 states have instituted their own background check requirements beyond federal law. Illinois, for instance, requires all firearm purchasers to obtain a state permit, which can only be issued after a background check. But when a federally licensed gun dealer sells a gun in any state, the buyer must go through a background check. And the law says anyone who repeatedly buys and sells guns "with the principal motive of making a profit" must obtain such a license from the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, or ATF. That’s different than occasionally buying and selling guns to enhance or liquidate a collection. From business stock to personal collection So how do guns from a retailer’s business inventory wind up in their personal collection? Federal rules permit licensed dealers to transfer firearms out of their business inventory and into their personal collection—whether they are planning on leaving the trade or not. If they maintain their license, those weapons must sit in their collection for a year before they can be sold in a private, potentially background check-free transaction. If they let their license lapse or it is revoked, they become just like any other private individual, meaning their property and sales no longer fall under the ATF’s purview—unless, of course, they cross the line by buying and selling in a way that resembles doing business. According to Mark Jones, project director for the National Law Enforcement Partnership to Prevent Gun Violence and a former ATF agent, the burden of proof for that crime is high. "It’s a pretty big mountain to climb to go after an FFL (federal firearm licensee) and prove that they’re actually criminally culpable or to go after someone who’s not an FFL but who’s dealing without a license," said Jones. A particularly striking case from 2006 illustrates that point. Sanford Abrams, a Maryland gun store owner and National Rifle Association board member, had his license revoked for a litany of violations, including that he couldn’t account for more than a quarter of his inventory. Between 1996 and 2000, 483 guns that were used in crimes were traced back to Abrams’ store, according to a report from the Brady Center. Yet Abrams maintained he could continue selling off his inventory as part of his personal collection. And in June 2006, the ATF affirmed that he could do so because he would only be acting as a dealer if he repeatedly purchased and resold firearms. Our ruling Duckworth said former firearms dealers can transfer guns from their inventory into their personal collections, and then sell those guns without background checks. Federal law permits gun dealers to transfer inventory to their personal collections, and private gun sales under federal law do not require background checks. Many states, including Illinois, have added their own requirements, though. A former dealer—and any other private individual—could still get into trouble by continuing to buy and sell with profit as their main motive rather than enhancing or liquidating their collection. But there’s no definitive legal yardstick—such as the number of guns sold—for determining compliance. Duckworth’s statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. That’s our definition for a statement that’s True.	None	Tammy Duckworth	None	None	None	2018-08-26T15:00:00	2018-08-07	['None']
pomt-05540	"Lean, finely textured beef is the proper name [not pink slime], and it is a safe, widely used product."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/apr/10/gary-black/dont-call-it-pink-slime-georgia-official-says/	There’s a meaty political campaign going on across the nation with slimy accusations being hurled -- and it has nothing to do with the race for the White House. It began in earnest April 2, when the governor and lieutenant governor of Iowa sent letters to their colleagues in other states to fight against what they said are media misperceptions about a form of ground beef maliciously maligned as "pink slime." Georgia Agriculture Commissioner Gary Black quickly joined the effort to defend this form of beef, holding a news conference two days afterward. "Lean, finely textured beef is the proper name, and it is a safe, widely used product," Black told reporters. Officials in Kansas and Texas have begun their own public relations campaigns in support of the beef that is a cash cow, pardon the pun, in those states. So, too, has U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, a former Iowa governor. Proponents say beef prices would rise with less meat on the market. Although the Department of Agriculture maintains the meat is safe, the federal agency announced in March that it would give schools more beef choices in the wake of public concerns about children eating "pink slime." McDonald’s and some major grocery stores have said they will no longer sell the meat. Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver last year showed how the meat is made to horrify a studio audience. "Everything about this process is about no respect for food or people or children," he said. So is it really safe? First, let’s explain how it is made. The meat is taken from slaughterhouse trimmings with high fat content that are more susceptible to contamination because the meat is often close to the hide, which is highly exposed to fecal matter. The trimmings are warmed to about 100 degrees Fahrenheit in equipment that looks like a large, high-speed mixing bowl that spins these trimmings to separate meat from the fat that has been liquefied. Ammonium hydroxide is mixed in to destroy bacteria and E. coli that could make someone ill if a raw product is not cooked thoroughly. It is then mixed with regular ground beef. The federal government has approved the practice for slightly more than a decade. The use of this meat gained national attention in recent months when a blogger who writes about kids’ food began an online petition to urge federal officials to remove it from school cafeterias. It may sound disgusting to know that beef contains ammonia, but the companies that produce the beef and experts say ammonia hydroxide is used in other foods such as cheese and chocolate to reduce acidity and kill bacteria. The beef is produced by a handful of companies nationwide. Federal officials inspect the process daily. Because this type of beef is not mentioned in packaging, there’s been little discussion about it or its safety. The New York Times, however, reported in late 2009 that E. coli was detected three times and salmonella 48 times, including back-to-back incidents in August in which two 27,000-pound batches were found to be contaminated. The meat in question, produced by the nation’s largest distributor of the product, Beef Products Inc., was caught before reaching lunchroom trays. BPI told the Times it found E. coli in what was described as a low 0.06 percent of samples that year. The Times also reported that from 2005 to 2009, BPI had a rate of 36 positive results for salmonella per 1,000 tests, compared with a rate of nine positive results per 1,000 tests for the other suppliers, according to statistics from the program. BPI said its testing regime was more likely to detect contamination. Some federal officials were concerned that the beef hadn’t been studied enough before it was approved. The Times reported that one federal microbiologist, Gerald Zirnstein, called the processed beef "pink slime" in a 2002 email to colleagues. A University of Arkansas student did a study of the beef last year. The student, Courtney Moon, found the beef held up better than regular ground beef. "I was surprised," Jason Apple, a meat science professor at the school, said in a news release sent by the university. "I just assumed the lean beef trim would negatively impact the quality of the burgers, but it actually made them better in this study." Researchers at other colleges have come forward in recent days offering similar conclusions. We were curious whether this beef was sold in other parts of the globe. A Canadian government health spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia that the country does not allow ammonia to be used in ground beef during production nor does it allow such food to be sold there. Ammonium hydroxide would be considered a food additive and require a safety evaluation, the official said. "Only if a safety evaluation identified no safety concerns would the requested use be considered for approval," Olivia Caron, a media relations official for Health Canada, said via email. Interestingly, Caron used "pink slime" in the subject line of her email. Several food safety experts we interviewed were well-versed on the beef treating process and didn’t have what one of them called "the ick factor" that many Americans are feeling about it. For the most part, they consider it safe to eat. The main problem, they said, was the lack of information about the beef provided by manufacturers and the federal government, particularly at a time when Americans want fewer chemicals and preservatives in their food. "Right now, we’re in a situation where you don’t know, and that’s why people are so infuriated," said Michael Batz, executive director of the Food Safety Research Consortium. "The lack of disclosure and the lack of transparency is very troubling." The USDA recently gave meat processors and supermarkets the option to put labels on ground beef packages identifying it as "lean finely textured beef." So where does this leave us? It is correct that the meat is called lean, finely textured beef and it has been widely used in fast-food restaurants and school cafeterias, and is sold in stores. But is it safe? The federal government says it’s safe. So do some state officials. Some research has concluded it is safe. Still, there are reasons for concern, such as those listed in the 2009 New York Times report. We also find it interesting that our neighbor to the north, Canada, has not permitted the beef to be sold there. With those caveats, we rate Black’s entire statement that the beef is safe as Mostly True.	None	Gary Black	None	None	None	2012-04-10T06:00:00	2012-04-04	['None']
pomt-14451	"A single mother of two can’t qualify for basic healthcare through Medicaid if she makes more than $3,504 dollars a year."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2016/mar/06/chris-koster/koster-doesnt-exaggerate-income-threshold-qualify-/	Medicaid expansion in Missouri continues to be a major item of partisan contention within the state legislature, and now, candidates for governor have begun weighing in on the issue. Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, a Democratic gubernatorial candidate, recently tweeted: "A single mother of two can’t qualify for basic healthcare through Medicaid if she makes more than $3,504 dollars a year." Koster’s statistic seemed pretty low, and we decided to take a closer look at the state’s Medicaid eligibility requirements. Qualifying for Medicaid in Missouri Across the country, eligibility for Medicaid is determined by a person's or family's yearly income compared to the Federal Poverty Level. Each state gets to decide how poor a household must be in order to qualify. Missouri covers children newborn to age 1 at 196 percent of the poverty level, meaning babies qualify as long as their families make just less than $40,000 dollars a year. For children 1 to 18 years old, Missouri covers them at 150 percent of the poverty level, or a yearly family income of about $30,000 dollars, according to Medicaid.gov. However, their parents are only covered if they make less than about 18 percent of the Federal Poverty Level, or about $3,600 dollars per year. The Missouri Department of Social Services charts income guidelines for parents to qualify for Medicaid; it shows the maximum income to qualify for a family of three is $301 dollars per month, or $3,612 dollars per year. We reached out to Koster’s campaign, but did not get a response as to where he got the number he tweeted ($3,504). Carolyn Orbann, associate professor of health sciences at MU, said it’s important to note that because Missouri has not expanded Medicaid, childless adults are not covered regardless of their poverty level. That’s not the case in 32 other states. "The states that have expanded Medicaid qualify adults without children who make 138 percent of the poverty level — in some states, even those who make more than that," Orbann said. In other words, a woman without children in Illinois or Arkansas could make around $16,000 dollars per year and be covered by Medicaid, but a woman in Missouri with two children making above $3,600 would not. Even among states that have not expanded Medicaid, only Texas and Alabama had lower maximum income caps for parents on Medicaid than Missouri, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan information source on health issues. Kansas, which also has not expanded Medicaid, covers parents at 38 percent of the poverty level — more than double Missouri’s 18 percent of the poverty level standard. Our Ruling Koster may be off by a little more than $100 when it comes to the maximum income a single mother of two can have and still qualify for Medicaid. But his point that Missouri’s maximum yearly income for parents on Medicaid is one of the lowest in the nation is on target. The statement is accurate but benefits from additional context.We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Chris Koster	None	None	None	2016-03-06T22:25:06	2016-01-20	['None']
pomt-13383	Says "Hillary Clinton's plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term, alone, with no effective way to screen or vet them. Her plan would cost $400 billion in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/27/donald-trump/trump-says-clinton-would-bring-620000-refugees-her/	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said in a stump speech that immigration is a national security issue, and he criticized Hillary Clinton for refugee policies that he says will make the country less safe. "Altogether, Hillary Clinton's plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term, alone, with no effective way to screen or vet them," Trump said Sept. 20. "Her plan would cost $400 billion in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs." We decided to look into Clinton’s plan and its costs. We found that Trump is doing some embellishing. Refugee math Clinton has not laid out a four-year plan for refugees as Trump described. She’s actually only talked about how many refugees should have been admitted for a single year. Clinton called President Barack Obama’s plan to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees in fiscal year 2016 a good start in a September 2015 interview on CBS Face the Nation, but she said the "United States has to do more." She suggested admitting 65,000 refugees, amounting to a 550 percent increase. We asked Clinton’s campaign how many refugees her administration would admit in the future and how much it would cost, but a spokesman said they had no new details. Trump’s campaign referenced a June 2016 analysis of the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest, chaired by Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., a Trump supporter. It makes the assumption that Clinton would bring in 155,000 refugees each fiscal year, totaling 620,000 in four years. Here’s the subcommittee’s math: It finds that Clinton would increase Syrian refugee admissions by 55,000. (Her suggestion of 65,000 minus Obama’s 10,000 for 2016). To determine how many total refugees Clinton would admit per year, it adds 55,000 to 100,000 -- the Obama administration’s previously stated refugee admission goal for fiscal year 2017. (He recently raised it to 110,000.) To conclude how many total refugees Clinton would admit in her first term, it multiplies 155,000 times 4 (total years in a presidential term) to total 620,000 refugees. The vetting process The United States has a refugee vetting process, and Clinton has not said she would move away from it. In fact, she’s stressed the vetting process in public remarks, including at a November 2015 speech about national security at the Council on Foreign Relations. "Our highest priority, of course, must always be protecting the American people," Clinton said. "So yes, we do need to be vigilant in screening and vetting any refugees from Syria, guided by the best judgment of our security professionals in close coordination with our allies and partners." Congress needs to make sure resources are available for background checks and a close look should be placed on visa programs, she said. There’s no precise dollar amount specified on Clinton’s immigration reform page on her website. It says Clinton would create a national Office of Immigrant Affairs and "support affordable integration services through $15 million in new grant funding." '$400 billion in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs' This summer, Trump said "for the amount of money Hillary Clinton would like to spend on refugees, we could rebuild every inner city in America." We rated that claim Pants on Fire. In that fact-check, we noted that the Obama administration requested under $2.2 billion for refugee and entrant assistance for fiscal year 2017, when the goal was 100,000 refugees. If Clinton tripled the requested amount for refugee funding in fiscal year 2017 and multiplied it over a 4-year term, it would not reach anywhere near Trump’s $400 billion claim. However, in its June analysis, the Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest said the annual budget for refugee resettlement does not encompass all costs, including those related to refugees who qualify for public assistance programs such as Medicaid, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and Supplemental Security Income. That budget also leaves out social services costs at local and state governments and costs of future benefits once refugees become lawful permanent residents and U.S. citizens, the analysis said. "The true lifetime cost of admitting a single refugee must include an accounting of all benefits received by that refugee -- at the federal, state, and local levels, and over the course of that‎ refugee's lifespan," the analysis said. "Any other calculation is akin to saying that the total cost of owning a new car is encapsulated in the down payment." Refugees come to the United States legally and are required to apply for lawful permanent residence a year after their arrival. But they also contribute to the economy. Refugees are qualified to get Social Security cards and are authorized to work. And like U.S. citizens, they have to pay employment, property, sales and other taxes, such as Social Security and Medicare. "The only way to arrive at the large negative effects that Trump claims is to adopt the belief that refugees neither work nor pay taxes after they arrive," said Michael Clemens, an expert on migration and a senior fellow at Center for Global Development. "That is untrue, and a method of counting only fiscal outflows while ignoring fiscal inflows is not a method that would be countenanced by any respected economist." Based on estimates from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, as well as data from Health and Human Services, a reasonably conservative figure for the total short-term, gross fiscal burden of each refugee is around $22,000, Clemens said. But that’s not the long-term net fiscal impact, he said. "The lifetime fiscal effect of a refugee admission -- including the tax revenue they are likely to generate over the course of their working lives, and both the up-front cost of assisting them and the other government services they are likely to use, is likely to be small and positive," Clemens said, citing studies that found refugees tend to perform better in the labor market than non-refugee immigrants over the long-term. At a minimum, the true costs of refugees is disputed and hard to put an exact figure on. Our ruling Trump said, "Altogether, Hillary Clinton's plan would bring in 620,000 refugees in her first term, alone, with no effective way to screen or vet them. Her plan would cost $400 billion in terms of lifetime welfare and entitlement costs." Clinton has not said she would bring anywhere near that number; that’s an extrapolation put together by the Trump campaign. Additionally, there are established protocols for screening and vetting refugees. Finally, the $400 billion figure only looks at potential benefits refugees might draw on without considering their economic output or taxes they might pay. Overall, we rate Trump’s statement False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3be9a5bb-4fff-42a8-a63c-1c461f666b1e	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-09-27T16:04:05	2016-09-20	['None']
pomt-13346	"First, Donald Trump said wages are too high, and both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/04/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-donald-trump-mike-pence-want-elimin/	Sen. Tim Kaine tried to align himself and Hillary Clinton with working people while portraying Donald Trump and Gov. Mike Pence as representing the wealthy. "First, Donald Trump said wages are too high, and both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage," Kaine said during the vice presidential debate at Longwood University in Farmville, Va. We found that Trump has been all over the map about wages and the federal minimum wage, while Pence opposed raising the minimum wage as a member of in Congress. Trump and the minimum wage No state can set a minimum wage lower than the federal minimum wage of $7.25. But states can set a higher wage. Trump has made some conflicting statements about wages. Early in the campaign, he often said wages were too high and showed no interest in raising the federal minimum wage. "We have to become competitive with the world," he said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe in November 2015. "Our taxes are too high, our wages are too high, everything is too high. What's going to happen is now people are going to start firing people." That echoed similar comments he made during the Republican presidential debate in November that wages are "too high" and, when asked whether he would raise the minimum wage, said, "I would not do it." But later in the campaign, Trump showed more interest in raising the minimum wage, though he often said that he would leave that up to the states. On ABC’s This Week on May 8, 2016, host George Stephanopoulos asked Trump, "Minimum wage -- all through the primaries, you were against an increase. Now you're saying you're looking at it. So what's your bottom line on this?" Trump responded, "Well, I am looking at it and I haven't decided in terms of numbers. But I think people have to get more." When Stephanopoulos asked whether that’s a change, Trump answered, "Well, sure it's a change. I'm allowed to change. You need flexibility." Also on May 8, on NBC’s Meet the Press, he said that he doesn’t understand how people survive on the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Trump said that while he would personally like to see a higher minimum wage, he would leave that up to the states. "I would like to see an increase of some magnitude," Trump told NBC’s Chuck Todd. "But I'd rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide. Because don't forget, the states have to compete with each other." Todd followed that up by asking if Trump thought the states should only be able to decide whether to raise their minimum wages from the $7.25 federally mandated minimum wage, or if there should be no federal minimum wage at all – giving states the option to go lower than $7.25 or have no minimum wage at all. "But should the federal government set a floor?" Todd asked. "No," Trump replied. "I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do." Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung referred us to Trump’s statement about letting the states set the minimum wage from his July 27 press conference in South Florida. Here’s what Trump said: "The minimum wage has to go up. People are -- at least $10, but it has to go up. But I think that states -- federal -- I think that states should really call the shot. As an example, I live in New York. It's very expensive in New York. You can't buy a hot dog for the money you're talking about. You go to other states and it's not expensive at all. Now what it does is puts New York at a disadvantage if the minimum wage is up, companies move out and things, bad things happen. At the same time, people have to be taken care of. But what I'm really going to do on the minimum wage -- but it has to go up... So I would like to raise it to at least $10." We gave him a Full Flop for his stance on whether the federal government should set the minimum wage. Pence statements on minimum wage Pence has a record of opposing minimum wage increases and bashing the minimum wage in general while in Congress. However, we could not find evidence he wants to eliminate it as Kaine claimed. In July 2006 while in Congress, Pence said in a statement to the press that he opposed legislation that he said would raise the federal minimum wage by 41 percent. "Minimum wage increases raise unemployment among teenagers, minorities and part-time workers," he said. "The minimum wage violates fundamental free market economics. It costs jobs, and I cannot support policies that will take jobs from those who need a paycheck the most. Pence was one of 21 House Republicans who voted against a bill that included an increase in the minimum wage. Pence voted against raising the minimum wage in January 2007 over two years from $5.15 to $7.25. "An excessive increase in the minimum wage will hurt the working poor, Mr. Speaker, and especially those who are trying to begin the American Dream by entering the workforce at entry level jobs," he said. "Minimum wage increases, the unbroken record of our economic history attests, raise unemployment among the young, minorities and part-time workers -- the very people that a minimum wage is thought to help." In 2013 as governor, Pence signed a law that prohibits local governments from requiring businesses to pay a higher minimum wage beyond what is required in federal law. We asked a Trump spokesman about Pence’s current position on the minimum wage and did not get a response to that specific question. But when we asked if Pence ever called for eliminating the federal minimum wage, Cheung said "No. He voted against raising the (federal) minimum wage in 2007." We told Clinton’s spokesman we found examples of Pence opposing an increase in the minimum wage but not calling for eliminating it. Spokesman Josh Schwerin said that Kaine was referring to the "Trump ticket" and that it is Trump who "dictates the agenda." Our ruling Kaine said "First, Donald Trump said wages are too high, and both Donald Trump and Mike Pence think we ought to eliminate the federal minimum wage." He’s right that Trump has said that about wages, but Kaine exaggerates by saying Trump and Pence want to eliminate the minimum wage. Trump has been all over the map on wages and the federal minimum wage. He has said he wouldn’t raise the minimum wage. He later seemed open to raising the minimum wage but has said that states should make the decision. Pence’s record in Congress showed he was against raising the minimum wage and made some critical comments about the idea of a minimum wage, but we didn’t find him calling for eliminating it. We rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/52d80a8e-d8ca-4fa4-aca2-861eb5fbfb87	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2016-10-04T21:47:03	2016-10-04	['Donald_Trump']
pomt-02923	"Natalyn Archibong skipped (Atlanta) City Council meetings or was late 90% of the time. Then she voted herself a pay raise."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/nov/02/matt-rinker/flier-takes-issue-councilwomans-record/	Atlanta residents are finding their mailboxes flooded with fliers from politicians vying for the City Council, the school board and the mayor’s office. One flier attacking the record of a veteran city councilwoman gained our attention. "Natalyn Archibong skipped City Council meetings or was late 90% of the time," Matt Rinker’s flier says. "Then She Voted Herself a Pay Raise," the flier says in red letters. PolitiFact Georgia wondered about the accuracy of the flier, particularly the part about Archibong voting herself a pay raise. In 2012, Archibong was one of four council members who voted against a pay raise that still passed by a 10-4 margin. Archibong represents the District 5 seat on the council, which includes several east Atlanta neighborhoods located in Fulton and DeKalb counties. An attorney in private practice, Archibong was first elected in 2001 and is hoping to be re-elected to a fourth four-year term. The District 5 council race has become particularly nasty in its final days, with accusations flying back and forth among the four candidates. On Thursday, Archibong filed a lawsuit in DeKalb County against Rinker and candidate Christian Enterkin, accusing them of slander. Enterkin also claimed in a flier that Archibong was late or absent to council meetings 90 percent of the time in 2011 and 2012. Enterkin’s flier did not mention Rinker’s claim that Archibong voted herself a pay raise. DeKalb County Superior Court Judge Gregory Adams denied Archibong’s motion for a temporary restraining order of statements about the councilwoman’s attendance record and other claims about her. The city convenes a panel of citizens once every four years to review the salaries of the mayor and the council. In 2004, the panel met and proposed raising the council’s pay from about $32,000 to $39,473. In March 2005, the council voted by a 9-3 margin to approve the pay raise. Archibong supported the salary increase and voted in favor of it. Rinker said via email he was referring to the 2005 vote. The 2012 vote raised the salaries of council members from $39,473 to $60,000 and takes effect in 2014. Archibong also sent PolitiFact Georgia attendance records that were certified by the city clerk’s office. Those records show Archibong has missed just one council meeting this year and two meetings per year in 2011 and 2012. They show she didn’t miss any council meetings in 2009 and 2010. Council records, though, raised some questions about Archibong’s punctuality. Our review of City Council meeting minutes since the beginning of 2010 shows Archibong was either absent or not listed as present when the meeting convened about 75 percent of the time. In most cases, Archibong’s arrival time was listed about one hour after the meeting was convened. The news website East Atlanta Patch published a spreadsheet that concluded Archibong was either absent or late 78.6 percent of the time during the same time frame. The council often hands out proclamations to citizens and visiting dignitaries at the beginning of meetings and then allows time for public comments before voting on legislation that is on its agenda. It is often 30 minutes to one hour before the council actually gets to the agenda. Most council members sit through the proclamations and public comments. Others, instead, hold sidebar conversations with their colleagues or administration officials or conduct other activities. "I don't sit through proclamations," Archibong told us. "I'm at work though, because the Committee on Council precedes the full council meeting." The Committee on Council is a semimonthly gathering of select council members who discuss council administrative issues. The committee typically meets less than two hours before council meetings. Was Archibong around when the council took its first vote of the day? She was nearly every time, council records show. So, what does this mean about the accuracy of Rinker’s flier? He’s right that Archibong voted to increase her pay, but that was eight years ago. The councilwoman voted against a pay raise in 2012. This makes Rinker’s flier confusing, if not misleading. As for her attendance record, Rinker’s number comes close to our count concerning how often Archibong is either absent or was not present when the council convened. Council records show Archibong is usually present when the council makes its first vote of the day. Rinker’s claim contains some elements of truth, but there is a lot of context that needs to be considered before fully understanding what he put in the flier. On our rating scale, this one gets a Mostly False.	None	Matt Rinker	None	None	None	2013-11-02T00:00:00	2013-10-29	['Atlanta']

pomt-12906	Says North Carolinians are "already paying for" Medicaid expansion, even though the state hasn’t expanded Medicaid.	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2017/jan/19/roy-cooper/nc-gov-roy-cooper-medicaid-expansion-north-carolin/	One of Gov. Roy Cooper’s arguments for accepting an expansion of Medicaid health care coverage into North Carolina is that the state is already paying into the program – and thus might as well get something out of it. The Medicaid expansion debate is currently the subject of a court battle between Cooper ( a Democrat) and the state’s Republican-led legislature. Meanwhile, the governor is trying to drum up support for expansion. "You’re already paying for it," Cooper told a meeting of business officials on Jan. 4. "North Carolina is paying federal taxes that is going to other states (for Medicaid). There have been conservative Republican governors like Mike Pence, who is our vice president, like Chris Christie, like John Kasich, who understood that this was an economic decision for their state and that it was important to do. So we’re already paying for it. The decision has been made." It’s common knowledge that many Republican governors have accepted the Medicaid expansion, and Cooper is right that Indiana, New Jersey and Ohio all accepted the expansion under conservative leadership. We’re more interested in the claim that North Carolina is paying for a program that gives it nothing in return. Two versions of Medicaid The expansion of Medicaid – which the Affordable Care Act made possible – is a separate piece of the regular Medicaid program. North Carolina has been part of the regular Medicaid program since 1970. But it remains one of 18 states that have not accepted the expansion. Medicaid provides government health insurance for low-income people. In 2015, the state reported, 1.8 million North Carolinians were enrolled – most of them children. The expansion would cover people who don’t qualify for either the Affordable Care Act health care subsidies or for regular Medicaid coverage. The state pays about one-fourth of the costs for regular Medicaid expenses in North Carolina, according to the N.C. General Assembly Fiscal Research Division. The federal government pays 60 percent, and the rest is funded by drug companies and other sources. In 2015, when the bill came out to $13.8 billion for North Carolina, the state paid $3.7 billion. But that’s not what Cooper is talking about. He’s referring to the optional expansion of Medicaid – which North Carolina and 17 other states have so far declined to accept. And Cooper is right that, nevertheless, North Carolinians are paying for the expansion in other states. The expansion is funded almost entirely by the federal government – 95 percent now, and dropping to 90 percent by 2020. "Right now, North Carolina tax dollars are going to Washington, where they are being redistributed to states that have expanded Medicaid," Cooper said in a written statement after his speech. But is he right? The federal government does get a lot of money from taxes. But it also makes money from fees, leases, investments and other sources. The government also engages in deficit spending. With all those non-tax options, we wondered about Cooper’s claim. Digging into the numbers According to a 2015 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Medicaid expansion in the decade from 2015-24 is estimated to cost $717 billion. That includes $667 billion from the federal government. And Cooper is right that the cost falls onto states, including those that haven’t expanded the program. In fact, North Carolina taxpayers are likely paying more than $1 billion dollars a year into the program. Donald Taylor, a Duke University professor and health care policy expert, said the federal government’s share of Medicaid expansion (unlike the regular Medicaid program) is mostly funded by income taxes and new taxes the ACA created. For overall taxes as well as income tax in particular, North Carolina’s people and businesses contribute 2.4 percent of the federal government’s tax revenue – at least as of the 2014 fiscal year, which is the most recent state-by-state IRS data available. Going by the HHS report that estimated $667 billion in federal spending on Medicaid expansion over a decade, 2.4 percent is $16 billion. That’s $1.6 billion per year, on average. In reality, of course, government accountants don’t go through taxpayers’ checks to see which ones come from which state and then apportion out funds that way. So the 2.4 percent number is the state’s approximate share, not an actual bill. And it’s possible that figures from the 2014 tax data and 2015 Medicaid cost study could have changed by now, or might fluctuate in the future. Regardless, Cooper is certainly right that North Carolinians are paying into this program. Another interpretation However, there’s a second way that a listener might interperet Cooper’s claim – that by telling people "you’re already paying for it," he’s implying that North Carolina could accept the expansion of Medicaid with no further costs. That is not accurate. Yes, North Carolina is paying into Medicaid, but the state’s costs would absolutely rise if it were to accept the expansion. In various studies by researchers from Georgetown University and the Wake Forest University School of Law, and depending on whether the federal government is paying for 90 or 95 percent of the costs, estimates show North Carolina’s state government would be on the hook for between $210 million and $600 million per year in the near future if it did expand Medicaid. The federal government would also pitch in billions more each year, those studies estimate, of which North Carolina taxpayers – as we already explored – would be responsible for tens of millions of dollars. Our ruling Roy Cooper said North Carolinians are "already paying for" Medicaid expansion, even though the state hasn’t expanded Medicaid. He was arguing for the state to go ahead and accept the expansion. He’s right that North Carolinians are already paying into the program, via federal taxes. Yet what he doesn’t mention is that the state government currently pays nothing into the program but would have to pay hundreds of millions of dollars per year if it did accept the expansion. Doing so would also increase the federal tax burden on people all over the country, including in North Carolina. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-03715	Says a gun bill before the Senate would make it a federal felony to "leave town for more than seven days, and leave someone else at home with your firearms."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/16/Arizona-Citizens-Defense-League/gun-rights-group-says-bill-would-criminalize-leavi/	As gun legislation works its way through the U.S. Senate, gun rights groups warn that some proposals in the original bill could create accidental felons. One such email warning, from an Arizona group, says, "You would be committing a federal felony if you leave town for more than seven days, and leave someone else at home with your firearms." Could hosting a house-sitter become a crime? Could your unsuspecting roommates face a felony? The bill, known as the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013, faces votes on a series of amendments, most prominently one proposed by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa. So all bets are off on the bill’s final language. Still, as the debate unfolds, we were curious: Does Senate Bill 649 make felons of vacationing gun owners with roommates or house guests? Gun transfers As introduced in the Senate in March, S. 649 requires background checks for all gun sales, with a limited set of exceptions. And it’s not just sales that are subject to the law — but gun "transfers." In general, it would be illegal to give your gun to someone else without seeking a federal background check. But there are a series of exceptions that seek to loosen the requirement in some situations — for example, handing your gun to a friend at a shooting range or while hunting legally together, giving a gun as a gift to a close relative or leaving a gun in a will. It’s also okay under the bill to lend your gun to someone in your own home or yard — as long as that "temporary transfer" lasts less than seven days. Thus, the issue raised by the Arizona Citizens Defense League. "While the proposed legislation contains limited exceptions for transfers such as between family members," says the email, sent to supporters April 10, "a little digging shows that you would be committing a federal felony if you ... leave town for more than seven days, and leave someone else at home with your firearms." So, what happens if a buddy house-sits or a roommate stays home during your eight-day vacation? The answer: It would likely depend on the circumstances. "I would say it should be changed to ‘you might be committing a federal felony if you leave town for more than seven days, and leave someone else at home with your firearms,’" said Clark Neily, who helped represent security guard Dick Heller in his successful Supreme Court challenge to D.C.’s handgun ban. If you locked up your guns and expressly forbade others from using them, you would have a pretty good argument that you hadn’t transferred possession, attorneys told us. But say your weapons were available to guests or roommates — that nothing would prevent them from using your guns while you were out of town. Then you might have a problem. The federal government tends to have an expansive definition of "possession," under various laws, Neily said. "I would say there is a real possibility that someone could be convicted under S. 649 for leaving town for more than seven days while someone else is at home with their guns," he said. Still, a house guest’s mere "access" to your weapons wouldn’t necessarily qualify as possession, said Larry Rosenthal, a law professor at Chapman University School of Law who has worked as a federal prosecutor and argued before the Supreme Court as an attorney for the City of Chicago. He pointed to a 2012 case decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals’ Seventh Circuit, United States vs. Griffin, in which a felon had been convicted of illegally possessing firearms and ammunition because he lived with his dad, who had hunting gear around the house. The court overturned the conviction, explaining the government’s argument "confuses access with possession," Rosenthal said. Meanwhile, just staying in a home with weapons — especially if the house-sitter or roommate didn’t know they were there — wouldn’t plausibly qualify as a "transfer" of a firearm, Rosenthal said. There would have to be a "knowing passage of control." So leaving your roommate home alone for weeks, oblivious to the shotgun under your bed, likely wouldn’t violate the bill’s provisions. Our ruling An Arizona group says a gun bill before the Senate would make it a federal felony to "leave town for more than seven days, and leave someone else at home with your firearms." Indeed, S. 649, as introduced in the Senate, allows for "temporary transfers" of guns in your own home that last less than seven days. But leaving a house-sitter or roommate with access to weapons while you’re away for a longer stretch, attorneys explained to PolitiFact, could raise the possibility of violating federal law under the bill’s provisions. Still, experts told us a gun owner might avoid such a consequence by locking up weapons and denying permission to use them. And it’s not clear courts would interpret mere access as a transfer of possession. The claim is just partially accurate. We rate it Half True.

pomt-06906	"The nonpartisan CBO, Congressional Budget Office, has said that the No. 1 policy decision that brought us to the need to prevent the nation from defaulting on our debt for the first time in history were the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/jul/25/debbie-wasserman-schultz/rep-debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-nonpartisan-cbo-/	If you watch TV news, you've probably seen clips of Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz's speech from the House floor July 19, 2011, on the Republican "cut, cap and balance" plan to slash the federal debt — it's the one that prompted fellow South Florida Rep. Allen West to call her vile and despicable. But you may have missed a line about the 2001 and 2003 George W. Bush tax cuts that raised our curiosity. Here's a recap. Wasserman Schultz, chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, argued during House debate that deep spending cuts required by the Cut, Cap and Balance Act of 2011 would "end Medicare as we know it," increasing costs for Medicare beneficiaries. She added it was "unbelievable" that West, a Republican tea-party favorite, would support it, given the number of South Florida seniors. She urged colleagues to reject the "reckless bill" for something that instead "engages us all in shared sacrifice" — for example, legislation that also targeted the Bush tax breaks. West then fired off a name-calling e-mail, setting off a days-long public spat that echoed Washington's partisan wrangling over raising the nation's debt limit. (There's more to say about Wasserman Schultz and West's tumultuous history, but that's not our focus here.) Many conservatives oppose any debt limit increase unless lawmakers cut spending to reduce the deficit, enact "enforceable" spending caps and pass a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution. The GOP-led House ultimately passed the Cut, Cap and Balance Act; the Democratic Senate tabled it July 22, effectively killing the plan. Officials expect the debt ceiling to be reached Aug. 2. As negotiations continue, we were interested in Wasserman Schultz's claim on the House floor about the buildup of the federal debt: "The nonpartisan CBO, Congressional Budget Office, has said that the No. 1 policy decision that brought us to the need to prevent the nation from defaulting on our debt for the first time in history were the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003 that disproportionately benefited the wealthiest Americans." We wondered if the Congressional Budget Office — which has a mandate to provide "objective, impartial analysis" for lawmakers and doesn't make policy recommendations — really said that? Warning sign No. 1: When we asked Wasserman Schultz's communications director, Jonathan Beeton about her statement, he provided us not with a CBO report, but with work done by a liberal think-tank, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Warning sign No. 2: When we contacted the CBO, associate director for communications Deborah Kilroe provided us not with something that sounded like a source for Wasserman Schultz's claim, but with a table of numbers. The table — published within a May 2011 CBO report — does not include a qualitative analysis to support Wasserman Schultz's statement. Instead, the table assigns dollar values to the major revenue and spending decisions that took the country from budget surpluses to budget deficits. On the revenue side, the Bush tax cuts — formally the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 — were the biggest chunk of lost income: $1.5 trillion. That dwarfs all other revenue changes, including tax cuts in the 2009 stimulus. The 2001 tax cut alone is bigger than any other single change, representing $1.2 trillion from 2002-11. On the spending side, the only item in CBO's table bigger than the 2001 tax cut — or the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts together — was lawmakers' discretionary spending. So, the impact of tax cuts in 2001 and 2003? $1.5 trillion. The impact of discretionary spending? $2.9 trillion. Of course, discretionary spending likely represented a series of "policy decisions," individually perhaps smaller than the impact of the tax cuts. And that's exactly what Beeton of Wasserman Schultz's office argued: "The biggest legislative number is for discretionary changes. The 2001 Bush tax cut is the second-biggest," he said. "However, the discretionary number is an aggregation of several different policies enacted at different times. ... In terms of a single piece of legislation's impact on the deficit, the Bush 2001 tax cuts probably still wins the prize for generating the biggest deficit increase." In short, the May 2011 CBO report doesn't say what Wasserman Schultz said, that "the No. 1 policy decision that brought us to the need to prevent the nation from defaulting on our debt for the first time in history were the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003." But the CBO numbers back that claim up, Beeton argues. So does an analysis from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, Beeton said. (The study actually widens its analysis beyond the Bush tax cuts, ascribing the bulk of recent and projected deficits to the economic downturn, the Bush tax cuts and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.) "Her statement clearly has a lot of strength to it," added Bob Williams, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. (Editor's note: We updated the description of the Tax Policy Center on July 28, 2011.) But another think-tank that also analyzes CBO data, the business-backed Tax Foundation, interpreted the same CBO data differently. The Tax Foundation's Scott Hodge and Will McBride make spirited arguments that spending, not tax cuts, provides a more potent explanation for America's debt crisis. The discrepancy in the analyses explains the central problem with Wasserman Schultz's claim. The CBO provides data. Think-tank analysts provide varying interpretations of the data. Wasserman Schultz got up before fellow lawmakers, repeated a think-tank interpretation and passed it off as the objective stance of CBO. (She even slowed down to make sure we understood her source: "The nonpartisan CBO, Congressional Budget Office ...") What does the Truth-O-Meter make of this? Wasserman Schultz said that "the nonpartisan CBO, Congressional Budget Office, has said that the No. 1 policy decision that brought us to the need to prevent the nation from defaulting on our debt for the first time in history were the Bush tax cuts in 2001 and 2003." The CBO never actually said that, but data from a May 2011 CBO report can reasonably support Wasserman Schultz's position. The CBO found that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts resulted in the biggest revenue drop since 2001. Experts say the cuts were hefty enough they likely outweighed individual spending decisions.

pomt-13861	For 21 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, "we simply do not have data to say anything about trends in poverty."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/jul/07/morten-jerven/tracking-global-poverty-have-real-numbers/	The success story of aid groups in developing countries often includes a line about lifting people out of poverty. But what if the data behind such claims was suspect? That’s the contention of economist Morten Jerven at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences. Jerven, a noted skeptic of African development statistics, says it’s a case of the "PR department getting ahead of the knowledge department." For 21 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, for example, "we simply do not have data to say anything about trends in poverty," Jerven wrote recently. As fact-checkers, we at PolitiFact can be asked to rely on the data Jerven is calling into question. So we decided to put his claim to the test. It takes two data points to tango Jerven based his claim on a simple law about measuring things: If you want to spot a trend, you need to have a starting point and an end point. Importantly, you need to measure the same thing at both times. To give a crude example, if one year you ask people how much they earn and 10 years later ask them how much their entire household makes, you can see how it would be difficult to make comparisons and draw conclusions. The World Bank identified problems with the data points for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. "By 2012, only 27 of the region’s 48 countries had conducted at least two comparable surveys since 1990 to track poverty," a 2016 report said. Do the math, and you get Jerven’s 21 countries without a starting and an end point on poverty. Andrew Dabalen, lead economist in the World Bank’s Poverty and Equity Global Practice, doesn’t quibble with Jerven’s statement, at least not too much. He and his colleagues vet the data that comes out of Africa. In some countries, such as Liberia and Sudan, there’s just one survey. Somalia has none. Kenya has four, but each was too different from the others to make any firm conclusions. Where do surveys run into issues? They might not match because they drew from different areas -- say a national sample versus urban residents. Some had people fill out daily diaries, while others asked people after the fact to remember what they bought or produced for themselves. Simply taking a survey at different times of the year, harvest versus planting season, could radically change the results. "Based on the review using these criteria, we find that indeed 21 countries did not have at least two comparable surveys to say something about trends," Dabalen told us. Keeping things consistent is not a trivial issue, or a new one. In the mid 1990s, India shifted from asking people what they consumed in the past month to what they consumed in variety of time periods -- from as short as one week to as long as a year. Virtually overnight, the official number of people in poverty fell by about 200 million, a result that many analysts challenged. Even in the United States, scientists often fret anytime the U.S. Census Bureau debates or discusses changing the questions it asks, for fear that it will jeopardize useful data. Filling in the gaps Confronted with missing data, Dabalen and his colleagues have a few workarounds that can help in some places. Numbers for an entire nation’s economy, its gross domestic product, are generally available. Dabalen said you can use GDP trends to estimate household consumption, and from that, derive a poverty level. "Such a method has its issues, but it is used widely and under certain assumptions, it predicts reasonably well," Dabalen said. But it’s not perfect. Branko Milanovic, senior scholar and specialist in global inequality at the CUNY Graduate Center, said the most you can learn from GDP is how things changed on average. If most of the economic growth flowed to the wealthy, the poor might gain little. (The income gains of the top 1 percent to 5 percent in the United States in recent years is a good example.) "A change in the mean does not tell us anything about the change in the distribution," Milanovic said. Dabalen told us about other techniques that derive missing numbers from a range of surveys that can tie economic well-being to other measures such as spending on food, housing conditions or education levels. On a large scale, looking at an entire region, this statistical alchemy can at least show the direction of change. This World Bank chart tracks results for 48 Sub-Saharan nations. The blue line is based only on countries with solid, comparable data. The other lines rely on something less than that. So policy makers can have a sense of the trends in poverty, even if they can’t say for sure what the poverty level is. But again, that’s from a regional vantage point. For any single country with very limited data, these techniques get dicey. According to the World Bank, the use of alternative surveys to fill in missing information sometimes showed poverty going down, when based on more reliable numbers, it was actually going up. Steps are under way to deal with the larger data problem, but a lot of work remains. Oddly, the lack of hard data doesn’t necessarily mean that poverty is worse than we think. Dabalen and his colleagues wrote that a number of crosschecks of all the information "support the notion that poverty reduction may have been larger than assumed." Our ruling Jerven said that for 21 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, "we simply do not have data to say anything about trends in poverty." His number comes directly from a careful vetting of poverty surveys by the World Bank. That analysis described in detail the holes in the information needed to track poverty. Jerven pushed his point a bit too far by saying that we can’t say anything about trends. Alternative methods give a reasonably reliable picture of overall trends, even if they can’t tell policy makers what the actual poverty rate might be. But at the end of the day, the consensus among the experts we reached is that the gap Jerven talked about is real and rather than use workaround techniques, everyone would prefer solid data. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/26108662-dcbd-407b-aabe-b10379895175	None	Morten Jerven	None	None	None	2016-07-07T14:58:26	2016-06-29	['Sub-Saharan_Africa']
pomt-07493	"In 2009, we cut state spending in real terms for the first time in 150 years."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/12/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-said-2009-we-cut-state-spending-real-/	As part of his push for the presidency in 2012, Tim Pawlenty makes the case in his book Courage to Stand that he is a tested fiscal conservative. "Contrary to liberal rhetoric, spending cuts are not impossible. Take Minnesota, for example" he writes in his book’s conclusion. "I lowered the average growth of annual spending during my time as Governor to just under 2 percent and balanced the budget without raising taxes. In 2009, we cut spending in real terms for the first time in 150 years." Pawlenty was governor of Minnesota from 2003 to 2011, serving two terms. Here, we’re checking Pawlenty’s statement that he "cut spending in real terms for the first time in 150 years." Minnesota celebrated its 150th anniversary of statehood in 2008, but we should note it’s not possible to look at 150 years of state fiscal data. Minnesota Management and Budget, the state’s fiscal information agency, keeps stats only back to 1960. We asked the Pawlenty campaign whether they had more historical data, but we didn't hear back. Looking at those stats, we can see that the 2010-2011 budget cycle -- a two-year budget referred to as a biennium -- marked the first drop in state spending since 1960, when state spending declined 10.9 percent. Budget figures are available on an annual basis as well. By those numbers, the 2010 general fund budget year (which starts July 1, 2009), was not the first year spending dropped. Spending also dropped in 2009, 2004, 1986 and 1983, although it was up for the two-year cycles that included those years. Finally, we should note that the 2010-2011 budget biennium was helped by a few factors. Minnesota Management and Budget said the state had used several mechanisms to put off state spending. That included $2.3 billion from the federal stimulus and two separate postponements in spending on K-12 education that totaled $1.9 billion and $1.4 billion. Those fixes went away the next budget cycle, and the budget agency projects a significant spending increase of 29.3 percent for the biennium. In rating this statement, we find that Pawlenty did reduce spending for the two-year budget cycle for the first time since 1960. But there were several single-year decreases, two during Pawlenty’s tenure as governor (2009 and 2004), but also two before he was governor (1986 and 1983). The major reduction in the 2010-2011 budget cycle was achieved with a one-time infusion of federal dollars and measures that delayed state spending rather then permanently reducing it. Finally, we don't have 150 years of budget data to check. We only found data back to 1960, and Pawlenty's campaign provided no data to back up the claim covering the 100 years previous when we asked for it. If data emerges, we're willing to review the claim. But given the evidence at hand, we rate Pawlenty’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11313	"Fox News accidentally puts up a poll graphic that shows how they are the least trusted network."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/apr/13/blog-posting/No-Fox-News-did-not-put-up-graphic-showing-it-was/	Did Fox News accidentally put up a graphic showing it’s the least trusted network? That’s what bloggers claimed in a post that leaves out important context and details about the graphic. "Fox News accidentally puts up a poll graphic that shows how they are the least trusted network," said boinboing.net in an April 9 post. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Bloggers focused on a Fox News segment in which Howard Kurtz, host of Media Buzz, talks with Republican strategist and pollster Frank Luntz about President Donald Trump, the media and public trust. "When host Howard Kurtz asked for a poll to be put up on the screen that asks if the media reports fake news, viewers got a look at the wrong poll – one put out by Monmouth University that asks people which network they trust more, CNN, MSNBC, or Fox News," Boingboing.net’s post said. "Not surprising but a knee-slapper nonetheless, the graphic for the poll showed that people trusted CNN most, at 48%, followed by MSNBC at 45%. Fox came in last place with a mere 30% of those polled thinking that the network was trustworthy." Boingboing.net said Kurtz asked then quickly asked for the graphic to be taken down. Kurtz did request that the graphic be taken down — but the graphic did not indicate Fox News was the least trusted network. In fact, the graphic, based on a Monmouth University poll, asked "Who do you trust more?" But individuals polled were asked who they trusted more as a source of information (CNN or Trump, MSNBC or Trump, Fox News or Trump), or both equally. The Fox News graphic showed that 48 percent of people said they trusted CNN more, compared to 35 percent who trusted Trump more; 45 percent said they trusted MSNBC more, compared to 32 percent who trusted Trump more; 30 percent trusted Fox News more, compared to 20 percent who trusted Trump more. The question was not about the most trustworthy network and was not a direct comparison of CNN, MSNBC, or Fox News. The Washington Post on April 9 reported that Fox News pushed back on reports that its network was the least trusted among competitors. It said the Associated Press published a story headlined "Fox News mistakenly posts graphic showing it lags in trust." (AP’s new headline says "Fox News host: Graphic posted at wrong point of show.") The newspaper also noted that CNN’s Chris Cuomo tweeted a RawStory.com post headlined, "Watch Fox host Howard Kurtz panic after graphic shows Fox News is least trusted network." RawStory.com added an updated to its story saying it included a response from Kurtz and that the headline had been revised for accuracy. It's new headline reads, " ‘Take that down’: Howard Kurtz surprised after graphic pops up showing Fox News is least trusted network." Boingboing.net also added an update at the top of its post on April 12. The amended post said:"UPDATE 4/12/2018: Yes, Fox did accidentally put up the wrong poll graphic, but Fox has since pointed out that the confusing graphic wasn't actually showing that Fox is the least trusted network. Instead, what the graphic intended to do was to compare CNN, MSNBC and Fox News to Trump. The graphic asks who people trust more, CNN or Trump, MSNBC or Trump, and Fox News or Trump. When looking at it this way, people trust all three networks more than they trust Trump." Kurtz did elaborate on the graphic after his show — not because it was confusing, but because he said the Associated Press ran a story "that utterly distorts what happened." "The AP reported my request to take down the graphic and ended the story there, creating a false impression by not mentioning that I called for the very same graphic shortly afterward," Kurtz wrote in an April 9 Facebook post. "This echoed partisan chatter online that I had somehow panicked or didn’t want to show the poll graphic, which is flatly contradicted by reality." Kurtz wrote that the graphic was mistakenly posted early, while he was discussing fake news, but brought back later in the show. (AP ran a correction about that point.) Our ruling Bloggers said, "Fox News accidentally puts up a poll graphic that shows how they are the least trusted network." The graphic was based on a Monmouth University poll that asked people who they trusted more CNN or Trump, MSNBC or Trump, Fox News or Trump. It wasn’t a graphic for a direct question comparing the three networks.

pomt-03507	"The average student comes out of college hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jun/06/gina-raimondo/rhode-island-general-treasurer-gina-raimondo-says-/	It's not news that college is expensive. This past year, according to the College Board, cost for tuition, fees, room and board for one year averaged $17,860 for an in-state public four-year college, $30,911 for students who went to a public college outside their state, and $39,518 if they attended a private nonprofit college or university. So it's not surprising that some students end up in debt, even before their degree translates to a paycheck. Rhode Island General Treasurer Gina Raimondo talked about that problem as part of a May 29 story on the 5:30 p.m. newscast on WJAR-TV. The story was devoted to a looming rise in the interest rates for federal student loans. Raimondo said the higher rates would make a bad situation even worse. "The average student comes out of college hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt, and they can't afford these interest rates to go up," she said. An alert reader who caught the program wrote PolitFact Rhode Island to say, "I don't think it's anywhere near that." We decided to check. We called Raimondo's office to ask for her source. While we were waiting, we went to the College Board website and found its "Trends in Student Aid" report for 2012, which covers the 2010-2011 academic year. It tells a very different story. The average debt among graduates who borrowed to get a bachelor's degree was $25,300. (A second source, the nonprofit Institute for College Access & Success, through its Project on Student Debt, calculates a comparable average -- $26,600.) Forty percent of the degree recipients had not borrowed at all, so they had no debt, according to the College Board. If you factor them into the mix, its calculation of the average debt drops to $15,100. Even if you only look at private, nonprofit four-year colleges and universities, where the costs are higher, the average debt for graduates who had borrowed was $29,900. Thirty-four percent of graduates hadn't borrowed. Among all graduates from these schools -- borrowers and non-borrowers -- the average debt was $19,700. To put this in perspective, 10 years earlier, the average debt for graduates who had borrowed was $23,400, adjusted for inflation. If you include all graduates -- both borrowers and non-borrowers -- it was $14,600. The College Board also followed a group of students who enrolled during the 2003-2004 academic year to see how much graduates owed. Only 1 percent had more than $75,000 in debt. Another 1 percent had a debt level of $50,000 to $75,000. Locally, we also found that as of October 2012, Rhode Island graduates ranked fourth in student debt from public and private nonprofit four-year institutions, according to a state-by-state ranking by the nonprofit Institute for College Access & Success. The average Rhode Island debt among students who borrowed was $29,097. Viewed in another way, 69 percent of students in the Class of 2011 in Rhode Island had debt; only seven other states have a higher percentage of students who owed money. When we heard back from Raimondo's office, she acknowledged the error. Said spokeswoman Joy Fox, "Although the Treasurer and her husband personally came out of college with hundreds of thousands of dollars in student debt, she misspoke by saying this was the average amount of student loan debt. According to the Project on Student Debt, the average debt is more in the range of tens of thousands." We rate Raimondo's claim False.

pomt-12111	Gov. Roy Cooper has "filed nearly one lawsuit a month, with every single one of them an attempt to extend his own power."	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2017/aug/22/david-lewis/nc-rep-lewis-says-gov-cooper-has-filed-nearly-one-/	It’s no surprise that a Democratic governor and a Republican-controlled legislature are taking some of their fights to court. But it may take a scorecard to keep track of the legal battles between Gov. Roy Cooper and the North Carolina General Assembly, where Republicans hold supermajorities. At least one state lawmaker has lost track. Republican state Rep. David Lewis of Harnett County, upset that one of the lawsuits has stalled the elections process in Carteret County, recently wrote about Cooper’s legal challenges in a blog post on DavidLewis.org. Cooper, Lewis wrote, has "filed nearly one lawsuit a month, with every single one of them an attempt to extend his own power." In the post, Lewis didn’t list the lawsuits Cooper has filed or describe the context surrounding them. Cooper was sworn in Jan. 1, so he’s been governor for nearly eight months. According to his office, he’s filed three lawsuits against legislative leaders since voters elected him – one of those coming before his inauguration. PolitiFact North Carolina searched for additional lawsuits and found none. Lewis said Cooper is trying to extend his power. Cooper’s lawsuits are indeed related to the scope of the governor’s powers. But Lewis fails to mention on his blog that, after Cooper was elected but before he was sworn in, Republican legislators – including Lewis – and former Gov. Pat McCrory enacted new laws that alter or limit the responsibilities and powers of the governor. Lawsuit 1 Cooper filed the first lawsuit on Dec. 30, when he was still governor-elect, to block measures the legislature adopted that merge the state elections and ethics boards and remove Cooper's ability to create a Democratic majority on the State Board of Elections. Cooper amended the lawsuit in Wake County Superior Court on Jan. 10, challenging the legislature's action to make the governor's Cabinet appointments subject to state Senate confirmation. Judges issued a split decision in the case, ruling for Cooper on elections but against him on Cabinet confirmation. Lawsuit 2 Cooper’s second lawsuit, which he filed in April, is a follow-up to his first lawsuit. After the court ruled that the governor’s appointees should control the state elections and ethics board, the legislature passed a new law that allows him to select its members from lists compiled by the two major political parties. Cooper contended that the goal was the same, to hamstring the governor, and filed a new lawsuit. A court sided with the legislature. A panel of judges sided with the legislature. But the governor has asked the state supreme court to review that decision, on appeal. Lawsuit 3 Cooper filed the third lawsuit on May 26, accusing the legislative leaders of trying to strip him of power to appoint state Court of Appeals judges and N.C. Industrial Commission members. Cooper amended the lawsuit on Aug. 8, challenging the legislature’s budget over funding related to school vouchers, a legal settlement with Volkswagen, and more - an amendment that came after Lewis’s statement. Counting lawsuits Cooper’s office says it has filed three lawsuits and two amendments. Lewis’ office, after being questioned about the blog post, said it was counting the number of individual complaints in the lawsuits. Mark Coggins, Lewis’ policy analyst, broke down the lawsuit topics in an email. He said Cooper’s lawsuits touch on: Whether the state Constitution allows the General Assembly to combine the state elections and state ethics boards Who has the authority to dismiss certain state employees Who has the authority to appoint members to the state’s Industrial Commission Who has the authority to distribute certain federal funds Whether the state Senate has the authority to block Cooper’s Cabinet nominees Who has the authority to appoint members to "various boards and commissions." Whether Cooper has "additional authority over the statutory baseline over the position of executive director" of the ethics board. A ‘simplistic’ quote? Cooper is not the first North Carolina governor to sue the legislature. McCrory sued legislative leaders saying they overstepped their authority in trying to establish a new commission to regulate coal ash, and the N.C. Supreme Court ruled in his favor last year. Bob Orr, a former justice on the state Supreme Court, characterized Cooper’s lawsuits as part of power jockeying that’s happened for years. "The litigation we’re seeing by Gov. Cooper is an expansion of that inherent tension and conflict between the executive branch and legislative branch," Orr said. Orr, a Republican, critiqued Lewis’ quote as "simplistic." Cooper’s lawsuits are not frivolous power grabs, he said. "I can’t fault Gov. Cooper for challenging the acts that he feels violates the separation of powers. That’s a core constitutional principle," Orr said. Why make the claim? Rep. Lewis co-chairs the legislative committee leading the effort to redraw districts in the state House and state Senate that federal courts determined were unconstitutional gerrymanders. He’s one of the most influential state lawmakers. Lewis wrote the blog post on July 31 in reaction to a report by the N.C. Insider that elections board vacancies were preventing resolution of an elections complaint involving municipal elections in Morehead City. Lewis pointed out that elections boards are vacant because Cooper is challenging the elections law. Because the issue is tied up in the courts, some county boards can’t fill their vacancies, keeping them from reaching a quorum needed to hold meetings. The state elections board is aware of 16 county elections boards that don’t have a quorum. "Governor Cooper’s lawsuit regarding the Bipartisan Ethics and Elections Board has essentially frozen elections administration in place in many counties," Coggins, Lewis’ policy analyst, explained in an email. "Citizens should care that this lawsuit could undermine the conduct of this fall’s local elections," Coggins wrote. Lewis believes voters should blame Cooper for "filing lawsuits that undermine local elections." Our ruling Lewis said Cooper has filed "nearly one lawsuit a month, with every single one of them an attempt to extend his own power." In fact, Cooper had filed three lawsuits and an amendment over seven months when Lewis made his claim. Lewis gives the impression that Cooper has been wildly filing lawsuits to expand his powers. But the lawsuits primarily respond to reductions in power passed by Lewis’s party shortly before Cooper took office and afterward. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-08544	PolitiFact Texas says "Congressman Edwards' attacks on Bill Flores are false."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/oct/02/bill-flores/bill-flores-says-austin-american-statesman-has-cal/	PolitiFact Texas has gone prime time! In Bill Flores' new TV ad in his bid for a U.S. House seat held by Chet Edwards of Waco, titled "Austin Paper" — that would be the Austin American-Statesman — "truth" plays prominently. The narrator starts off: "The Austin newspaper says Congressman Edwards' attacks on Bill Flores are false." Just in case viewers miss that declaration on first pass, the narrator continues: "Edwards is not telling the truth about Bill Flores." Flores makes nearly the same claim in a radio ad posted on his website: "The Austin newspaper investigated Edwards' attack ads and found them to be false." We didn't know we'd done that. To date, Edwards has criticized Flores on a number of fronts, including his views on veterans health care, his voting record and his position on earmarks, most of which we haven't dug into. In April, we rated an Edwards statement to be True — that Flores has never voted in a general election in the House district. In September, we gave a False rating to Edwards' claim that an oil company Flores "helped run laid off over 3,000 workers and then paid off its top executives with millions." To our inquiry — what the hey? — Flores' campaign manager, Matt Mackowiak, counseled against being too picky about the wording of the ads. Mackowiak said Flores' ads don't say that every fact check we've done of Edwards returned a False rating. Mackowiak also said the TV ad clearly refers only to our September item on Flores' employment history, pointing out that the video "has the date of the PolitiFact article." We checked out that detail. At the time that a narrator is evoking "the Austin newspaper," the screen shows the "Austin American-Statesman" nameplate, the PolitiFact url and a date: "September 26, 2010." Oops: Our review of Edwards' statement appeared in print and online Sept. 15. We informed Mackowiak of the date conflict. He later told us that the campaign had fixed the date and sent new copies of the ad to the outlets running the ads. While the Flores campaign is changing the ad, we'd suggest a new line for the narrator: "The Austin newspaper also finds this message to be only Barely True." Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09412	St. Pete Beach's experiences are a "fair example" of what could happen if Amendment 4 passes.	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/mar/19/citizens-lower-taxes-and-stronger-economy/st-pete-beach-amendment-4-hometown-democracy/	A group fighting a statewide ballot initiative that would give voters direct say on land use decisions says people need look no further than the disastrous results of a similar initiative in tiny St. Pete Beach. In an Internet advertisement, a political action committee called Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy claims that St. Pete Beach's local version of Amendment 4 has cost the 10,000-person community. "Some people wonder what Florida would be like if Amendment 4 passed, but the people of St. Pete Beach already have the answer. They adopted a local version of Amendment 4 in 2006," says the ad, with sweeping images of St. Pete Beach's shoreline and its famous pink hotel, the Don Cesar. "St. Pete Beach has become a victim of lost jobs, the enormous costs, wasted tax dollars, endless litigation and economic gridlock," the 2-minute, 15-second ad says. "All because they approved a local version of Amendment 4." Amendment 4, which will appear on ballots in November, essentially would give citizens veto power over major development proposals and land use changes. We've previously explored two of the ad's claims about legal fees and property taxes. Now we want to step back and tackle the fundamental question: Are St. Pete Beach's experiences a valid comparison when voters consider Amendment 4? "If it looks like a duck and walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck. It's a fair example and a damning one," said Ryan Houck, executive director for Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy, which was formerly called Floridians for Smarter Growth. The group is being funded by Florida business groups, including Publix, homebuilders and U.S. Sugar. "Ryan's being very disingenuous," responds Leslie Blackner, an environmental attorney and president of Florida Hometown Democracy, the group advocating for Amendment 4. St. Pete Beach's story Blackner, who already has spent almost $750,000 of her own money supporting Amendment 4, says St. Pete Beach's process for dealing with major land use issues and the process proposed in Amendment 4 are significantly different. To start, let's look at what has happened in St. Pete Beach. In 2005, St. Pete Beach's five-member city commission was considering changing the town's road map for growth, the Comprehensive Plan. The commission was debating incentives to lure additional hotels that could increase the density of a development and change the allowed uses. The talk of change didn't sit well with many residents, who formed a group called Citizens for Responsible Growth. They collected enough petitions to get a series of city charter amendments on the city ballot that would require voter approval for height increases and other changes to land use plans. From there it got contentious. The city sued to stop the vote, saying the proposed charter amendments violated state land use law. A developer also sued saying the petition process was costing him money. The city lost its case on appeal, and in November 2006, voters narrowly approved most of the changes to the city charter. The results: St. Pete Beach became the first town in Florida where residents directly controlled development decisions. Voters also elected two members of Citizens for Responsible Growth to the city commission, giving them a majority. That prompted a pro-developer group -- Save Our Little Village -- to start its own petition drive and propose their own amendments to the city's comprehensive plan. The city's elected officials -- who had gone from being largely pro-development to anti-development -- tried to stop them. It got even more contentious. Save Our Little Village sued. The city's attorney resigned under pressure from the commission. Then, another election, another change of power, more lawsuits, and eventually, another referendum. This time, the pro-development side won. The upshot -- four years after city voters decided they wanted control over land use decisions, the entire process has been sidetracked and stymied by lawsuits and politics, petition drives and egos. Taxpayers have paid $734,000 in legal bills associated with the comprehensive plan changes, the city says. The guts of Amendment 4 Like in St. Pete Beach, Amendment 4 seeks citizen control over land use decisions. On that, the proposed constitutional language is clear: "Public participation in local government comprehensive land use planning benefits the conservation and protection of Florida’s natural resources and scenic beauty, and the long-term quality of life of Floridians. Therefore, before a local government may adopt a new comprehensive land use plan, or amend a comprehensive land use plan, such proposed plan or plan amendment shall be subject to vote of the electors of the local government by referendum, following preparation by the local planning agency, consideration by the governing body as provided by general law, and notice thereof in a local newspaper of general circulation. Notice and referendum will be as provided by general law. This amendment shall become effective immediately upon approval by the electors of Florida." Blackner walked PolitiFact Florida through how she believed the new process would work (we say "believe" because her opponents think the process is open to interpretation). Say a developer proposes an amendment to the comprehensive plan to build a condo high rise in the middle of town. Currently, an application would be submitted to the local government that has jurisdiction; the local government would follow its approval process -- two public hearings, etc.; and then the state Department of Community Affairs would be asked to sign off on the amendment. None of that would change. But if the developer gets his approvals, Amendment 4 would add one more step. Voters would either ratify or veto the developer's plans at the next regularly scheduled election. Amendment 4, which supporters also call Hometown Democracy, "is all about process. It is a neutral provision," Blackner said. "I don't claim to know how anyone would vote on any particular referendum. We think we need this added layer of voter accountability because too often elected officials don't represent the interest of citizens." Similarities and differences Let's look at this from each side. Proponents of Amendment 4 say the analogy between the statewide initiative and what's happening in St. Pete Beach is bogus. Yes, both processes deal with voter approval of comprehensive plan amendments. But that's pretty much it, they say. The case of St. Pete Beach is as much about one city's politics as it is a comprehensive plan. Moreover, the entire disagreement began with a citizen petition to change the city's charter -- an option to most any city regardless of Amendment 4's outcome. And what's critical to note in St. Pete Beach's case, supporters say, is that citizens themselves proposed amendments to the comprehensive plan -- an end-run of the development process that was established by state law. Amendment 4 doesn't deal with citizens' proposals to their local comprehensive plans. It allows people to vote on proposals either submitted by their government, or a developer. The counterargument from opponents like Houck focuses on the outcomes, instead of the process, in St. Pete Beach. Every attempt to amend the comprehensive plan via a referendum has so far resulted in a lawsuits. The most recent cases surround opponents claiming that ballot language was unclear. What's to stop a developer, then, from suing the city should its proposal fail via the Amendment 4 process by claiming the ballot language was deceptive? Blackner said she hopes a neutral group -- maybe the state's Department of Community2 Affairs -- would write ballot language to help combat potential lawsuits from unhappy developers. But, "I fully expect there will be fights over ballot titles and summaries," she admits. "Developers are the most litigious people I've ever seen. I'm sure there will be lawsuits over this." Houck also notes that pro-Amendment 4 organizers previously referenced St. Pete Beach as a symbol in their cause. In 2006, Ross Burnaman, vice president of Hometown Democracy, said St. Pete Beach is emblematic of "the broader purpose behind Hometown Democracy that people have at least some control over the long-term land use of their community." Then, there's the position of St. Pete Beach City Manager Mike Bonfield, who believes Amendment 4 is more far-reaching than what St. Pete Beach voters approved. St. Pete Beach's rules exempt some smaller land use changes from voter approval. "When they (proponents) say that Hometown Democracy is different than St. Pete Beach, in a very slight element it is," Bonfield said. "But overall the issue of voting on comprehensive plan amendments and our experience in voting on comprehensive plan amendments is the same, except in Hometown Democracy it's going to happen more often. "So it's not exactly identical," Bonfield said. "It's worse." Our ruling In trying to capsulize what is a complex issue, we read dozens of stories generated by the development brouhaha in St. Pete Beach, watched city commission meetings and spoke with people representing all sides. We unequivocally come to one conclusion: The situation in St. Pete Beach is a mess. After that, the analysis becomes less cut and dried. Here's how we see it. A group of St. Pete Beach residents, unhappy with the direction of their city government, successfully wrestled certain land use decisions out of the hands of elected leaders. The movement produced a backlash from both the government and pro-development forces, who then mounted their own political campaign to wrestle power back. The power struggle has continued for close to four years. That's a different storyline than what is envisioned under Amendment 4, where voters would act as a check on the decisions of local government. The amendment itself isn't designed to go around government the way the situation in St. Pete Beach played out. And it has nothing to do with citizens proposing amendments to the local comprehensive plan, like what has happened in St. Pete Beach. Now, are the same lawsuits and political maneuvering possible? Absolutely. And maybe that's enough to make the analogy valid. But voters should be wary in blindly believing that St. Pete Beach's experiences would be duplicated statewide should Amendment 4 pass. Opponents say St. Pete Beach's experience is a "fair example" of what could happen should Amendment 4 pass. We rate that claim Half True.

pomt-01178	"More than 70 percent of American adults have committed a crime that could lead to imprisonment."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/dec/08/stephen-carter/watch-out-70-us-have-done-something-could-put-us-j/	Conventional wisdom would tell us that most normal folks will never have an interaction with police like the one Eric Garner had that ultimately led to his death. Yale Law School professor Stephen Carter warned that might not necessarily be the case. Citing the work of Rutgers University law scholar Douglas Husak, Carter wrote on Dec. 4 that "70 percent of American adults have committed a crime that could lead to imprisonment." Carter noted that’s in part because there are 300,000 or more federal regulations that may be enforceable through criminal punishment. It's as though, Carter said, lawmakers tack on imprisonment to give a law heft. To paraphrase the old line, we are not just a nation of laws, we are a nation overrun by laws. Carter suggests reigning things in. The fact that 70 percent of people have committed a jailable offense is part of Carter's evidence. We wanted to know if other legal experts thought it was correct. They do. Before we get to their reasons, let’s be clear about what Carter and Husak are saying. By the way, Husak told us that Carter quoted him accurately. For Husak, the question wasn’t whether any court would be likely to put someone behind bars for a particular offense, but whether the law gives them the power to do so. Husak said one need look no further than the laws on prescription drugs. If a doctor gave you a prescription for the common painkiller vicodin and your spouse brings it to you as you lie in bed, "your spouse is dispensing a controlled substance without a license," Husak said. Would that ever be enforced? Not likely. But Husak said that is how the law is written. If that were not enough to get to 70 percent of adults, Husak factored in illicit drug use. According to a 2012 survey by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, over half of the people in every age group born after 1950 said they had used an illicit drug at some time in their lives, primarily marijuana or prescription drugs. That alone comes to about 84 million people, or 37 percent of all people over 20. While some legal experts we reached said they didn’t know how you could come up with an exact number, just about all said it would be no trouble to keep adding more. Sonja Starr at the University of Michigan Law School said many people drink and drive. "The Centers for Disease Control found 112 million self-reported incidences of drunk driving," Starr said, with the caveat that some drivers would report multiple offences. "And that’s just in a single year." Starr said you could easily get to the 70 percent mark. By and large, Starr’s counterparts at other law schools agreed. Bennett Capers, professor of law, Brooklyn Law School "This doesn't give me pause at all. There are thousands of criminal statutes on the books, criminalizing things that some of us do without thinking. This runs the gamut from the serious (in New Jersey, it is technically a crime to have sex without first receiving "freely given affirmative permission to the specific act of sexual penetration") to the routine (fudging tax returns) to the mundane (illegal downloads)." David Gray, professor of law, University of Maryland School of Law "70 percent seems low to me. Once you factor in illegal drug use, crimes of recklessness (which seldom are detected because no harm accrues), downloading, DUI, failures to report income, and the scores of relatively innocuous offenses that just happen to carry the possibility of jail time in some jurisdictions, I’d be surprised if the percentage wasn’t much higher than 70 percent over the course of most adults’ lifetimes." Jeffrey Fagan, professor of law and public health, Columbia Law School Fagan said he didn’t know the right percentage, but he could believe the 70 percent figure. "I’ve violated imprisonable offenses while fishing," Fagan said. Robert Weisberg, professor of law, Stanford Law School "The number is unknowable, but it strikes me as plausible." Laurie Levenson, professor of law at Loyola Law School Los Angeles "It does seem to exaggerate the likely number of Americans who are at actual risk of prosecution and imprisonment," Levenson said. "What we really need to pay attention to is the percent of Americans who commit crimes that are on the prosecutors' radar screens." Levenson’s point gets at a key ambiguity in Carter’s statement. Much depends on the interpretation of "could lead to imprisonment." In his article, Carter made it clear he did not mean that imprisonment was in any way likely. His point was simply that too many laws carry too hefty a penalty and in theory, anyone could become ensnared. Our ruling Carter said that more than 70 percent of American adults have committed a crime that could lead to imprisonment. Based on a strictly technical reading of existing laws, the consensus among the legal experts we reached is that the number is reasonable. Way more than a majority of Americans have done something in their lives that runs afoul of some law that includes jail or prison time as a potential punishment. That said, experts acknowledged that the likelihood of arrest, prosecution or imprisonment is exceedingly low for many of Americans’ "crimes." As such, we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-07291	"The Arab and the Muslim nations get twice as much money as Israel."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/may/21/ron-paul/us-rep-ron-paul-says-arab-and-muslim-nations-get-t/	Asked during the first debate of the 2012 presidential campaign about his concern that Israel will start a war with Iran, U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Texas shifted the focus to his position that the United States should stop sending money to other countries. "I don't want any of this foreign aid — Pakistan or anybody else — because the principle is wrong and because it doesn't achieve anything," the Lake Jackson Republican said during the May 5 debate. "If we stopped all the foreign aid, you say, ‘Oh, you're going to hurt Israel.’ But, you know, the Arab and the Muslim nations get twice as much money." We looked into Paul’s foreign aid comparison. Paul didn’t respond to our request for evidence, but he’s spoken frequently about his opposition to all foreign aid. Some background: A 2004 Congressional Research Service report lists several objectives of foreign aid, including economic development, poverty reduction and democracy promotion. Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, the United States has also established aid programs across the Middle East in an effort to deter radicalism. For our fact-check of Paul’s debate comment, we turned to a database of U.S. foreign assistance, including loans and grants, kept by the U.S. Agency for International Development. The database includes information on assistance that flows from the military, USAID, the State Department and the Agriculture Department. According to the latest year of available data, the United States distributed about $45 billion to more than 180 countries in fiscal 2009, which ran from October 2008 through September 2009. Israel received $2.4 billion, ranking second to Afghanistan, where the United States has ongoing military and reconstruction operations. Not knowing the countries Paul means by "the Arab and the Muslim nations," we zeroed in on those that could be identified as either Arab or Muslim based on entries in the CIA’s World Factbook, which presents information on countries throughout the world. Result: Seven of the top 11 recipients of foreign aid in 2009 can be described as Arab, Muslim or both: Afghanistan ($8.8 billion in aid), Iraq ($2.3 billion), Egypt ($1.8 billion), Pakistan ($1.8 billion), Sudan ($1.2 billion), the Palestinian territories ($1 billion), and Jordan ($816 million). Together, those entities received $17.7 billion. In addition, at least 30 other countries that can be considered Arab or Muslim received U.S. aid, including Somalia ($281 million), Morocco ($244 million) and Indonesia ($226 million). Collectively then, the 2009 aid to these nations was more than seven times the aid to Israel — not much of a surprise considering Paul’s comparison was between 40-plus countries and just one other, though that nation also has long been the prime U.S. beneficiary. From its founding in 1948 through 2004, Israel was the largest cumulative recipient of U.S. foreign aid, according to a September 2010 CRS analysis. It also was the largest annual recipient from 1976 until it was surpassed in 2005 by Iraq, which the U.S. invaded in 2003. Nearly all of Israel’s current U.S. aid is military assistance. According to a February CRS report, the close U.S.-Israel relationship has been "based on common democratic values, religious affinities, and security interests." Meanwhile, U.S. aid policy toward the Middle East has changed. A June 2010 CRS report says it "has gradually evolved from a focus on preventing Soviet influence from gaining a foothold in the region and from maintaining a neutral stance in the Arab-Israeli conflict, to strengthening Israel’s military and economy and using foreign aid as an incentive to foster peace agreements between countries in the region." Two top Arab recipients have signed peace agreements with Israel: Egypt in 1979 and Jordan in 1994. Let’s take a closer look at the numbers from the USAID database, calculated in inflation-adjusted 2009 dollars: From 2000 through 2009, Israel received $32.3 billion in U.S. assistance — 82 percent of which was military assistance. We compared that figure with the 10-year aid total for the seven major Arab or Muslim recipients. Their take during those years: $136.4 billion, more than four times Israel’s. Their military component: 42 percent. And before 2000? The relative shares of aid look different. From 1990 through 1999, Israel’s U.S. aid totaled $44.2 billion, while the seven Arab or Muslim nations got $35.2 billion. But other Muslim and Arab nations also received U.S. assistance during that decade, including Turkey ($6.1 billion) and Bangladesh ($1.8 billion). All together, the nations’ cumulative total was more than Israel’s but nowhere near twice as much. So where does that leave us? On the face of it, stacking one nation’s foreign aid dollars against 40 others may not be a meaningful comparison. Regardless, based on the most recent decade of U.S. foreign aid data, Paul’s statement is correct: Collectively, the 40-plus Arab and Muslim countries drew far more than double what Israel got. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2011-05-21T06:00:00	2011-05-05	['Israel', 'Islam']
pomt-11009	"Justice Kennedy quit because he and his son helped Trump launder illegal Russian money through Deutsche Bank."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/10/blog-posting/did-justice-kennedy-quit-due-family-ties-trump-and/	The New York Times detailed connections between the Trump White House and Justice Anthony Kennedy, searching for factors that might have inspired Kennedy to retire so abruptly before the November midterms. The newspaper examined a number of connections that the Trump family might have exploited to earn Kennedy’s trust: constant praise for his work, the routine promotion of his clerks, and visits from the president’s family. But some conspiracy-minded bloggers have honed in on two paragraphs, nestled in the middle of the article: Kennedy’s son, Justin Kennedy, had worked with Deutsche Bank when it loaned over $1 billion to Trump, even when other banks had become wary of him. In the New York Times article, this is just one piece of evidence to show that the Kennedy and Trump families were close outside of politics. However, liberal clickbait site Kwotable used the detail to suggest corruption on a much more massive, though unsupported, scale. Its June 30 headline read, "Justice Kennedy quit because he and his son helped Trump launder illegal Russian money through Deutsche Bank." The New York Times report didn’t go that far, so we decided to dig deeper into the Kwotable claim. Deutsche Bank and Trump Trump’s relationship with Deutsche Bank began in the late nineties when many other major lenders were unwilling to do business with him. Between 1991 and 1992, Trump declared bankruptcy four times, making him unpopular among Wall Street bankers, who referred to making deals with him as "Donald risk." Deutsche Bank opened up to working with Trump after launching its real estate division in 1998. Mike Offit, a newly-hired managing director, gave Trump a loan to renovate his building on Wall Street, and continued to work with him through the 2008 financial crisis. According to a 2017 report by the New York Times, Trump has done more than $4 billion in business with Deutsche since then, including the construction of Trump Tower in Chicago and the Trump National Doral in Miami. Justin Kennedy began working at Deutsche in 1998 as the managing director and global head of Real Estate Capital Markets, a role he held until leaving in 2009. Kennedy oversaw and approved major real estate loans given through the bank, including multiple loans made to Trump for his real estate enterprise. What about Russia? Trump’s connections to Russia are still being investigated by special counsel Robert Mueller. But Deutsche Bank’s relationship to the country is well-documented, and controversial. In early 2017, banking regulators fined the bank $630 million for its negligence in stopping a Russia-based money laundering scheme, in which Russian clients engaged in illegal "mirror-trading." (One client would purchase stocks in rubles through the Moscow branch, and then a conspirator would sell identical stocks for the same price, but through the London branch and in dollars. This money would be transferred to offshore accounts, effectively allowing traders to illegally transfer billions of dollars out of Russia. According to Reuters, this scheme began in 2011.) Between 2010 and 2014, the bank was also involved in the "Global Laundromat" scandal, which allowed over $20 billion to be funneled from Russia to other countries around the world. The Global Laundromat was a much larger operation than the mirror-trading. It involved top Russian oligarchs and criminals — including Igor Putin, cousin of President Vladimir Putin. The bank’s name has come up in the Mueller investigation as well, but not in the way the Kwotable article makes you think. In December 2017, Mueller’s team subpoenaed Deutsche Bank records connected with former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who had been indicted in October on suspicion of money laundering, among other crimes. However, there has been no evidence to date that Trump himself was involved with any of the money laundering — or that either Kennedy was involved. Democrats have called for more transparency in Trump’s banking history, but the bank has denied their requests, citing confidentiality concerns. The records would be released only in the event of a formal investigation. As for Justin Kennedy, he left Deutsche Bank in 2009, before investigators say the Global Laundromat or mirror-trading scandals began. He has not been formally investigated or accused of involvement in financial foul play. Kennedy and Deutsche Bank declined to comment for this story. Our ruling Bloggers wrote that Justice Kennedy retired last week because "he and his son helped launder illegal Russian money through Deutsche Bank." This story has all the buzz words to make a good conspiracy theory: Russia, real estate, billions of dollars, coincidence, corruption. But there is no evidence that Trump and Justin Kennedy ever had a relationship beyond Trump’s real estate loans. There is also no evidence that Kennedy was involved in Russian money laundering, as he left the bank before either of the major scandals happened, or that the Trump White House was blackmailing his father because of it.

pomt-05535	Says "at the state level we're spending more on tax expenditures than we are on public safety, health care and education combined."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2012/apr/10/jefferson-smith/does-oregon-spend-more-tax-breaks-public-safet-hea/	Jefferson Smith has his sights set on the Portland mayor’s office, but state issues seem to pop up in his campaign. Little wonder, given that he’s represented Portland in the Oregon House since 2009. One fact he’s taken to repeating -- first during a candidates’ forum hosted by Family Forward Oregon and Mother PAC and later during a Rotary Club meeting -- is that "at the state level we're spending more on tax expenditures than we are on public safety, health care and education combined." Tax expenditures is government-speak for what most of us call tax breaks. "I think we should think about money beyond tax breaks," he said, just before making his claim. "That is a handy tool. But it is a tool we've been using for years and years and years and years." Sure, tax breaks come in lots of different shapes and sizes -- seniors can deduct medical expenses, businesses can get breaks for green building improvements -- but could they really outweigh the amount the state spends on some of its core programs? We got to checking. Smith’s campaign wasn’t very helpful -- staffers had no source for his claim and his spokeswoman, Stacey Dycus, told us the idea was "a random remark he made when explaining something." We were on our own. Thankfully, we know our way around the state budget. Our first stop was the state’s 2011-2013 tax expenditure report. The report pretty clearly lays out the amount of tax expenditures -- or breaks -- for the current biennium. All told, the state gives about $12 billion in income tax breaks, $19 billion in property tax breaks and just over $100 million in others, for a grand total of $31.3 billion in forgone revenues. Getting those figures was the easy part -- the hard part was figuring out what to compare them to. See, the state’s budget can be diced and parsed in dozens of ways. Generally, though, we talk about the state’s general fund and lottery budget -- this budget deals with the money that the state has the most discretionary power over -- and the total funds budget -- the money that includes cash we get from the feds for, say, Medicare and Medicaid, as well as food assistance programs. Let’s start with the all funds budget. The current budget accounts for nearly $59 billion in total spending -- this is without the tax breaks. Of that, $13.5 billion goes to education and $3.6 billion goes to public safety. The health care figure is a little harder to come by. The best estimate we could dig up is the total funds budget for the Oregon Health Authority -- the executive bureaucracy that does the majority of the state’s health care work. That budget is just over $12 billion. If you add those three budget areas, you get $29.1 billion, about $2.2 billion short of the tax breaks the state gives. By this measurement, Smith is right. Now, the other way to do this would be to look at the general and lottery funds budget. This way might be somewhat fairer, given that so much of the total funds budget is made up of federal dollars. All told, the current general and lottery funds budget includes about $11.7 billion for health care, education and public safety. Obviously, that’s quite a bit less than the $31.3 billion in state tax breaks. The problem here is, you can’t directly compare those two figures. See, we said earlier that there’s a report that pretty clearly lays out the various tax giveaway, but what it doesn’t do is explain exactly how that money would be rerouted if it were being collected by the state. For instance, $19 billion of those giveaways are for property taxes. Most of that money would go to municipalities if it were collected -- not the state. There is an argument to be made that about 40 percent of the property tax revenue would go to local schools -- relieving a burden on the state and freeing up cash, but that’s all indirect. That said, about $12 billion of those giveaways -- the part that comes by way of income taxes -- would wind up in the state’s general fund budget. Again, that’s slightly more than the $11.7 billion the state pays on those three program areas. We wanted to add a little bit of context to all of this because tax policy is never so simple, so we made calls to folks in the state’s legislative fiscal and revenue offices and to the state’s chief economist. Paul Warner from the revenue office explained it the most clearly. Smith is "technically correct," he said, that there’s about $31 billion in lost revenue. But, he cautioned "there would be a lot of steps to try and collect those dollars." The revenue document itself gets at this, too. It notes that the dollar impact listed for tax breaks is not the amount of revenue you could gain if you wanted to repeal all of them. It gets very technical and somewhat boring here, so we’ll give you just one example: Federal land, which Oregon has a lot of, is exempt from property taxes. And, Warner notes, "there's federal law that prohibits us from taxing federal land." Certainly some of these tax breaks are up for grabs if the Legislature decided to mine a few of them for increased revenues. On the books are laws for home mortgage deductions along with tax cuts for green energy, and property tax exemptions for private aircraft. Smith knows that. Last year, he pushed for a package of bills that would have tamped down on some of these credits, including one that would put a sunset date on all income tax credits, subtractions and exemptions. Indeed, the Legislature has since instituted a six-year cycle in which all credits will get reviewed before being renewed. That’s a little beyond the point, though. As for our ruling, Smith’s claim is accurate. The state does spend more on tax breaks than it does on public safety, health care and education. This holds true whether you look at the larger all funds budget, or the smaller general and lottery funds budget. But there is some important context here, including the fact that many of those tax breaks are off limits to state lawmakers. We rate this claim Mostly True -- accurate but it requires some clarification. Return to OregonLive to comment on this ruling.

pomt-00944	"When did the decline of coal start? It started when natural gas took off … that started to begin in (President George W.) Bush’s administration."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2015/feb/23/scott-surovell/surovell-says-decline-caol-started-under-george-w-/	Del. Scott Surovell has had it with Republicans blaming President Barack Obama of waging a "War on Coal." In a Feb. 4 floor speech, Surovell, D-Fairfax, said Republicans should take blame for the pain in coal country because they’ve taken steps to bolster natural gas, a key competitor to coal. "When did the decline of coal start? It started when natural gas took off," Surovell said. "That started to begin in President (George W.) Bush’s administration." We drilled into Surovell’s claim to see if he was right about the timing and cause coal’s fall as well as his laying the blame on Bush. The relationship of coal and natural gas Among the documents Surovell sent us to back his statement was a 2012 report by the Energy Information Administration that examined the annual use of fossil fuels to generate power. It has a chart showing that the downward use of coal and the upward use of natural gas began during the mid 1990s -- before Bush’s presidency from 2001-2009. In the mid 90’s, about 75 percent of fossil power was generated by coal, 20 percent by natural gas and 5 percent by petroleum. In 2012, about 55 percent was fired by coal, 45 percent by natural gas and a negligible share from petroleum. The report cites several reasons why power companies began replacing coal with natural gas. In the mid 1990s, technology began cutting the cost of natural gas generation and an expansion of pipelines "decreased uncertainties around natural gas availability." The trend escalated in 2005 when fracking -- the process extracting natural gas from shale -- took off. Surovell also pointed to a 2012 report from the Analysis Group, an economic consulting firm, which said lower natural gas prices along with rising coal prices had contributed to coal company decisions to retire some of their older plants. Jonathan Cogan, a spokesman for the EIA, pointed us to figures showing that natural gas production started seeing strong growth in the mid-2000s and natural gas prices began a precipitous drop in 2008. The cost of coal, meanwhile, has been on the rise. Other EIA figures show coal consumption and production has generally trended downward since 2008. So the takeaway is that the recent surge in natural gas production and drop in natural gas prices started during the Bush administration and certainly impacted coal use. But to fully explore Surovell’s claim, we have to dig deeper. Did Bush policies cause the coal slide? There’s no doubt Surovell, in his speech, was holding Bush responsible for the rise of natural gas and the fall of coal. "You want to know who started the war on coal? Take a long good hard look in the mirror folks," Surovell told GOP lawmakers. "The leaders of the Republican Party in the mid 2000s they’re the ones that started this war on coal." Fracking involves fracturing shale with hydraulically pressurized liquid made of water, sand, and chemicals. Surovell pointed us to the 2005 Energy Policy Act, which Bush signed, that provided exemptions to the Safe Water Drinking Act for chemicals used in fracking. Several energy analysts told us that law did boost shale oil production, but added there were many other factors that led to the boom. Michael E. Webber, the deputy director of the Energy Institute at the University of Texas at Austin, said the "shale boom" evolved over many decades, propelled by research and development in fracking that began before the Bush II administration. "As one of the presidents during that timespan, George W. Bush deserves partial credit," Webber emailed. "However, taking the long view, the policy contributions from his administration are minimal compared to the policies of other presidents and compared with the role of market forces and technological disruptions." Kenneth B. Medlock III, senior director of the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University, told us that recent presidential administrations shouldn’t lay claim to the natural gas production boom. "The regulatory environment and laws governing mineral rights and property rights are responsible, and those tenets are more or less as old as the country," Medlock said. "They set the stage for entrepreneurial leadership and risk taking that fosters innovation, hence the shale revolution." On the coal side of the equation, Medlock said any "demise" of coal would have started about a decade ago as new environmental regulations discouraged construction of new coal plants. Dallas Burtraw, associate director of the Resources for the Future Center for Climate and Electricity Policy said the roots of the recent low prices lie in deregulation of the natural gas industry under former President Jimmy Carter. "It would be Carter who gets most of the credit for low gas prices today," said Burtraw, whose group is an energy think tank funded by government, non-profits and energy companies. Regarding coal, Burtraw sent us a chart showing that the number of coal jobs peaked in 1978 and has been falling steadily since, a trend he attributes partly to the emergence of natural gas, but mostly to technological changes in how coal is mined. Our ruling Surovell said the decline of coal "started when natural gas took off … That started to begin in President (George W.) Bush’s administration." No doubt, natural gas has been gaining ground on coal in generating electricity. The trend started in the 1990s but clearly gained speed during the Bush administration when the production of natural gas -- a competitor of coal -- picked up. But analysts give little credit or blame to Bush for that trend. They note that other factors, such as technological innovation, entrepreneurship and policies of previous administrations, had more to do with laying the groundwork for the natural gas boom. On balance, we rate Surovell’s claim Half True.	None	Scott Surovell	None	None	None	2015-02-23T00:00:00	2015-02-04	['None']

pomt-15050	The largest low-wage employer "is not McDonalds or Walmart but the U.S. government."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/29/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-federal-government-not-mcdonal/	Democratic presidential hopeful Bernie Sanders has been outspoken about his desire to raise the federal minimum wage. Last week, ahead of Pope Francis’ visit to the nation’s capital, the senator from Vermont joined low-wage federal contract workers during a strike to advocate for a higher wages. During his speech to protesters, Sanders compared the government to the two companies with the largest U.S. workforces: Walmart and McDonald’s. "There is no justice in America when the largest low-wage employer is not McDonald’s; it is not Burger King; it is not Walmart; it is the United States government," Sanders said. He later tweeted a shorter version of the statement, mentioning only Walmart and McDonald’s. We wondered whether Sanders was right that the U.S. government is the biggest employer of low-wage workers in the country. While Sanders can find some support in the data, he ignores some important qualifiers. By the numbers When we reached out to Sanders’ camp, policy director Warren Gunnels said the claim is based on this 2013 report from Demos, a liberal economic think tank. The report defines "low-wage" workers as those earning below $12 per hour. More critically, the report counts workers who are employed by federal contractors, not those directly employed by the government. Here is a summary of the report’s estimates, which we double-checked for accuracy. The report estimated the number of low-wage workers at McDonald’s by using the percentage of low-wage workers in the food-service industry more generally, while it used a University of California-Berkeley report to estimate the number of low-wage employees for Walmart. McDonald’s total U.S. employees (includes franchise employees): 859,978 McDonald’s U.S. low-wage employees: 580,485 Walmart total U.S. employees: 1,400,000 Walmart low-wage employees: 901,600 Total workers on federal contracts: 6,791,437 Low-wage workers on federal contracts: 1,992,000 So the number of federal contract workers, at nearly 2 million, exceeds the number of Walmart and McDonald’s workers combined, at 1.48 million. Jonathan Rothwell, a fellow at the Brookings Institution, said the difference is due to how large the government is in comparison with McDonald’s and Walmart. Indeed, if you look at the numbers as percentages, low-wage workers make up less than one-third of the total federal contract workforce. By comparison, the percentages for McDonald’s and Walmart are much higher -- 67.5 percent and 64.4 percent, respectively. "It is quite likely that the federal government is the largest vendor of just about every kind of worker -- high, medium, and low-wage workers included," Rothwell said. The government does not directly pay these workers Another problem with Sanders’ claim is his use of the word "employer." Employees on federal contracts are not directly employed by the U.S. government. Workers under these types of contracts work in a wide array of industries, ranging from construction to food service to health care. "The U.S. government does not employ contract workers in the legal sense of the word," Rothwell said. "(Contract workers) work for a firm, which contracts with the federal government." Multiple federal laws govern the pay of federal contract workers. The Davis-Bacon and Related Acts require federal contract workers involved in the construction and repair of public buildings and other public works to be paid "the locally prevailing wages and fringe benefits." More recently, President Obama signed an executive order in February 2014 that raised the minimum wage to $10.10 for all workers on federal construction and service contracts. Obama also signed an executive order in September to make federal contractors give workers up to seven days of sick leave per year. Still, advocates of higher wages for federal contract workers argue these laws aren’t enough. The National Employment Law Project calls federal contract workers "the hidden federal workforce." According to a 2013 report by the NELP, "low-bid federal contracting and exemptions to the Service Contract Act and Public Contracts Act mean that hundreds of thousands of workers paid by the federal government via contractors or similar arrangements work for sub-standard wages in poor conditions." David Neumark, an economics professor and director of the Center for Economics and Public Policy at the University of California-Irvine, agreed that the connection between federal contract workers’ wages and federal government policy is tenuous. "Presumably, the low-wage workers hired by contractors are low-skill workers," he said. "It may suck that low-skill people earn low wages, but that is a problem of the economy more generally. … The claim that we are ‘subsidizing’ low wages is a red herring. We are probably paying market wages. They just happen to be low." Government employees tend to be paid well The federal government directly employs about 2.7 million people, according to Drew DeSilver, a senior writer at Pew Research Center. We couldn’t find any exact statistics on how many of these workers make less than $12 per hour, but according to the Congressional Budget Office, federal government workers with no college degree "earned about 21 percent more, on average, than similar workers in the private sector." "When we look at those directly employed by the federal government, low-skilled workers tend to be paid more than they would get paid in the private sector," said Adam Ozimek, an economist at Moody’s Analytics. "The government actually tends to pay less for higher skilled workers." According to occupational employment statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 90 percent of workers across all levels of government make more than $12 per hour in half of the 50 states. Our ruling Sanders said that "the largest low-wage employer is not McDonalds or Walmart but the US government." Measured by the raw numbers, more federal contract workers make less than $12 an hour than workers at Walmart and McDonalds combined. But he is incorrect to suggest these workers are directly employed by the U.S. government, as they actually work for private companies. In addition, a much smaller percentage of federal contract workers make less than $12 an hour when compared to McDonald’s and Walmart. In terms of actual government employees, the U.S. government has historically paid low-skill federal civilian workers more than similar occupations in the private sector.

pomt-08031	Says he "led the effort to build a new (University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee) engineering campus in Wauwatosa."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/06/jim-sullivan/milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-jim-sullivan-/	Innovation Park, a campus the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee plans to build in Wauwatosa, is a proposal worth bragging about. The project calls for a graduate-level engineering campus and research efforts that supporters say could lead to new businesses. So far, UWM has agreed to pay Milwaukee County $13.6 million for land for the project. Wauwatosa, a Milwaukee suburb, has pledged to finance $12 million for improvements to the site, such as roads and utilities. And the federal government has given a $5.4 million federal grant for what would be the project’s first development -- a "business accelerator" that would house university and business research activities. But who exactly should be bragging about all of this? Former state Sen. Jim Sullivan, a Wauwatosa Democrat, hasn’t been shy. In the fall of 2010, during his unsuccessful re-election campaign, Sullivan mailed a flier to voters declaring he "led the effort to build a new (UWM) engineering campus in Wauwatosa." Sullivan is running for Milwaukee County executive in the April 2011 election, which makes his claim about landing a major project in the county all the more relevant. We wanted to know: What role did he play? Here is how the Innovation Park project came together: January 2007: UWM announces it wants to add two campuses, including one at or near the Milwaukee Regional Medical Center and the Milwaukee County Research Park. It would be home to a graduate-level engineering campus and "a collaborative research powerhouse." May 2009: The County Board agrees to sell 88 acres on the County Grounds in Wauwatosa -- near the medical center and research park -- to an affiliate of the UWM Real Estate Foundation, for $13.6 million. UWM says the Innovation Park project will draw more research funding, with business spinoffs creating jobs throughout southeastern Wisconsin. December 2010: The foundation says it has raised the $5 million it needs for the down payment on the land. The foundation also says it will ask the county to postpone for two years, until January 2014, the due date for a $5 million installment payment. Along the way, Wauwatosa approved zoning for the land and agreed to create the $12 million tax incremental finance district to pay for public improvements, such as roads. We asked Sullivan for support for his claim that he led the Innovation Park effort. His Senate staff provided seven documents Sullivan wrote, including letters he sent to city, county and state officials. In an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin, Sullivan said: "Within the Legislature, I was absolutely the champion for that project. That’s what ‘led’ means." Sullivan also acknowledged that "it is a group effort to get a major project like that done." The state Senate, however, had no direct role in Innovation Park. Those who were involved with the effort characterized Sullivan’s role as supportive. Here is what they said: Tom Luljak, UWM vice chancellor for university relations: Sullivan "was a very strong advocate," but "I don’t think there was any one single person who was the champion" of Innovation Park. Harold Mester, spokesman for Acting County Executive Lee Holloway: Sullivan supported Innovation Park, but was not involved in the land sale negotiations between UWM and the county. Wauwatosa Mayor Jill Didier: Sullivan was a "very well spoken" supporter, but the major players were UWM and county officials, along with the city. Didier added: "I think, in the world of politics, a lot of people want to take credit. But the reality is it takes a lot of hands to get the job done." Among those taking credit is Holloway, who is also running for county executive in the April election. He said in December that if not for his efforts, the county would have received only $7 million from UWM for the land, instead of $13.6 million. We rated that claim Barely True. We won’t do any bragging. We’ll just give you our assessment. In trying to retain his state Senate seat, Sullivan declared he "led the effort" to put a new UWM campus in Wauwatosa. The major work for Innovation Park, however, was done by UWM, Milwaukee County and the City of Wauwatosa; the state Senate never got involved. Those close to the project said Sullivan played a supportive role but certainly didn’t lead the effort. We rate his claim False.

pomt-01762	Says Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, "skipped an important VA reform hearing to attend three fundraisers."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/30/concerned-veterans-america/ad-says-bruce-braley-was-raising-money-during-vete/	Attackers say U.S. Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, skipped an important Veterans Affairs Committee hearing to raise money for his campaign, but Braley says that’s not true. Braley "skipped an astonishing 79 percent of veterans affairs committee hearings. He even skipped an important VA reform hearing to attend three fundraisers," says the television ad from Concerned Veterans for America, an advocacy group with funding linked to the Koch brothers. Braley is running against Republican Joni Ernst for the U.S. Senate seat held by Tom Harkin, and veterans affairs are in the news because of delayed access to health care. We looked at whether Braley skipped 79 percent of veterans affairs committee hearings. We rated that Mostly True, because Braley did miss close to that amount. However, Braley said he did not skip a hearing to raise money, so we’re checking that claim here. A matter of scheduling The ad refers to a Sept. 20, 2012, meeting titled, "Reviewing VA’s Performance and Accountability." According to the official record, Braley was not present. The hearing touched on a number of issues within the Veterans Administration, such as mental health and homelessness. The issue of delayed care came up in terms of mental health and acquiring prosthetics, but it was not the focus (though issues with wait times had already surfaced in 2012). We asked Braley’s campaign why he was absent, and they said he was at a House Oversight and Government Reform hearing about Fast and Furious, in which federal agents traced weapons sold and brought into Mexico. The Sept. 20, 2012, hearing examined a report issued by the Justice Department’s inspector general. Braley was then a member of the oversight committee, and the transcript from that day’s hearing says he was present. The two hearings took place at roughly the same time in different buildings. The oversight hearing began at 9:36 a.m., and the VA hearing started at 10:19 a.m. Some have pointed out that footage of the hearing shows Braley’s empty seat during the oversight hearing. And he did not make any comments at the hearing, according to the transcript. In this screenshot of hearing footage, Braley’s seat (bottom, far left of the screen) is empty at 10:17. It’s possible he was there for part of the time, though, because the camera was not always pointed at his seat. Braley’s campaign said he did attend three fundraisers that day, but they did not conflict with the hearings. One took place from 8:30-9:30 a.m., the next a noon luncheon (the Fast and Furious hearing ended at about 12:30) and the last a reception at 6:30 p.m. Even though it was a tight schedule, his fundraisers would not have stopped him from attending one of the hearings for at least part of the time. Our ruling An ad said Braley "skipped an important VA reform hearing to attend three fundraisers." He had three fundraisers the same day, but none overlapped with the veterans affairs committee hearing. He was counted as present at an oversight hearing about Fast and Furious that happened at the same time. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-12846	"Two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. … It didn't get covered"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/03/kellyanne-conway/fact-checking-kellyanne-conways-bowling-green-mass/	When White House counselor Kellyanne Conway appeared at a town hall event with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews, she mentioned "the Bowling Green massacre" -- a terrorist attack that, the social media world would quickly determine, did not exist. This exchange stemmed from her defense of President Donald Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order barring citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan and Libya from entering the United States for 90 days and putting Syrian refugee admissions on hold indefinitely. (We go over some of the key issues in this explainer.) Trump’s action inspired protests, but Trump and others in his administration cited as a precedent an action taken by the Obama administration. "My policy is similar to what President (Barack) Obama did in 2011 when he banned visas for refugees from Iraq for six months," Trump said. Specifically, the government instituted new background checks for visa applicants from Iraq and expanded screening for Iraqi refugees who had already settled in the United States. (We largely disagreed that the two actions were equivalent, so we rated Trump’s statement Mostly False.) So what does any of this this have to do with Bowling Green, a city in western Kentucky? The Obama-era action was taken after a failed plot by Iraqi nationals living in Bowling Green to send money, explosives and weapons overseas to al-Qaida. The two men were arrested by the FBI in May 2011 for actions committed in Iraq and trying to assist overseas terrorist groups. That’s the context in which Conway brought it up during a town hall at American University on Feb. 2, 2017. "I bet it's brand-new information to people that President Obama had a six-month ban on the Iraqi refugee program after two Iraqis came here to this country were radicalized and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre," she said. After some cross-talk between Conway and Matthews, Conway added that the incident "didn't get covered." So there was indeed a terrorism-related situation in Bowling Green, Ky., but it wasn’t a "massacre." No one died in Bowling Green. And before long, social media lit up with mockery of Conway, from reminders of a 2013 football blowout of Northern Illinois University by Bowling Green State University to a website for the mythical Bowling Green Massacre Victims Fund. Lots of wags added that it was no wonder that the media didn’t cover the massacre because … it didn’t happen. The next morning, Conway clarified matters on Twitter. She tweeted, "On @hardball @NBCNews @MSNBC I meant to say ‘Bowling Green terrorists’ as reported here." She also tweeted that "honest mistakes abound." So Conway has publicly acknowledged her error. Still, we thought it would be important to clear the air about what actually happened and what did not. The account below is largely taken from a fact-check we originally published on Sept. 23, 2014, in which we gave a False rating to the statement that, "In 2011, (the Islamic State) attempted to attack Fort Knox" in Kentucky. That was just one of a number of inaccurate statements circulating at the time about terrorist activities in and around Bowling Green, Ky. On Feb. 3, 2017, we ran our original fact-check by Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, and he said that our original account remains accurate. The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Iraqi nationals in Kentucky The details of the Kentucky case were indeed alarming. In September 2009, the FBI, based on a tip, launched an investigation into an Iraqi, Waad Ramadan Alwan, who was living in Bowling Green. A confidential source for the FBI started talking with Alwan in 2011. Alwan discussed how he previously worked as a bombmaker in Iraq. He boasted about blowing up American Hummers and targeting U.S. soldiers, claiming he used improvised explosive devices, or IEDs, hundreds of times, according to court documents. The FBI even matched a fingerprint from Alwan to an unexploded IED that was discovered by the military in 2005. (There’s a warehouse outside of Washington, D.C., that houses thousands of bombs found by the military). That enabled investigators to determine that Alwan had likely killed U.S. troops while in Iraq. The confidential source continued to meet with Alwan and recruited him to assist in an operation in the United States to send explosives, firearms and money to al-Qaida of Iraq. Al-Qaida of Iraq later morphed into the Islamic State or ISIS, according to terrorism experts. The sting On five occasions, Alwan helped procure and load money and weapons he believed were going to help al-Qaida of Iraq fight U.S. troops. In January 2011, Alwan recruited a friend to assist him — Mohanad Shareef Hammadi, another Iraqi who had moved to Bowling Green after first living in Las Vegas. Alwan and Hammadi entered the United States as refugees after lying about their past terrorism ties on paperwork. From January to May 2011, the two worked together on five missions to send grenade launchers, machine guns, explosives, sniper rifles, hand grenades, missile launchers and $565,000 to al-Qaida of Iraq. Of course, this was all a sting operation. While Alwan and Hammadi thought they were helping insurgents in Iraq, in reality, the FBI was monitoring all of their actions -- a common tactic for sting operations involving suspected terrorists. The weapons, which the FBI rendered unusable, were merely transferred from one location under FBI control to another. In May 2011, Alwan and Hammadi were arrested. In December 2011, Alwan pleaded guilty to a 23-count indictment, including conspiring to kill U.S. nationals abroad and multiple charges of weapons and terrorist activities. Hammadi pleaded guilty to a 12-count indictment, including attempting to provide material support to terrorists. For cooperating with authorities, Alwan received a reduced sentence of 40 years in prison followed by a lifetime under house arrest. Hammadi was sentenced to life in prison. The charges None of the charges filed against Alwan and Hammadi were for domestic terrorism plots. They were not convicted of any crimes related to domestic terrorism. All of the charges against these individuals were for actions committed while in Iraq or for trying to assist terrorist groups operating overseas. PolitiFact has combed through hundreds of pages of court documents that were available online. The only conceivable reference to any other terrorist activity is in Hammadi’s appeal of his sentence. There, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit wrote: "Hammadi and Alwan also plotted to murder a U.S. Army Captain whom they knew from Iraq." An ABC investigative report had a few more details: "Alwan had been caught on an FBI surveillance tape talking about using a bomb to assassinate an Army captain they'd known in Bayji, who was now back home — and to possibly attack other homeland targets." We should also note that while Alwan and Hammadi thought they were helping a predecessor of the Islamic State, al-Qaida of Iraq had no communication with them. At root, this was a case of two Iraqis with dangerous backgrounds who were duped by the FBI into believing they were helping Islamic insurgents fight Americans overseas. Conway’s statement So how does Conway’s original (and now inoperative) statement stack up? Most importantly, there was no "massacre" in or around Bowling Green that was either carried out or attempted. In addition, while the two men were charged with serious crimes and were sentenced accordingly, it’s important to remember that everything that happened was part of a sting operation by the FBI. This means that the people of Bowling Green were not endangered at any point, and that the entire incident can be viewed as a law-enforcement success. The fact that it was a sting undercuts Conway’s use of the word "masterminds." Conway also said the event "wasn’t covered" by the media. We used the Nexis database to search media reports from around the time of the arrest and found that it wasn’t a huge, newscycle-dominating story. But several major news outlets did cover the story when it broke, including CNN, CBS and the Associated Press. And they also covered the debate that followed — including the call by some members of Congress to send the Iraqis to the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the fact that it exposed a gap in the refugee screening process. In her tweet correcting her statement on MSNBC, Conway linked to a news story about the two Iraqis and other refugees, a 2013 article by ABC, headlined, "US May Have Let 'Dozens' of Terrorists Into Country As Refugees." Our ruling Conway said that "two Iraqis came here to this country, were radicalized and they were the masterminds behind the Bowling Green massacre. … It didn't get covered." Put simply, there was no massacre. While Conway admitted her mistake the following morning -- and we're happy she did -- it's important to make sure the record is crystal clear.

pomt-01874	"If you look at the states where soccer is most popular, they're overwhelmingly blue states, and the states where soccer is least popular are red states."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/10/peter-beinart/soccer-blue-state-game/	Peter Beinart is the anti-Ann Coulter. Responding to the conservative pundit’s assertion that America’s growing interest in soccer is "a sign of the nation’s moral decay," the City University of New York professor argued on the July 6 CNN’s Fareed Zakaria GPS that World Cup fever actually demonstrates a shift away from America’s sense of superiority. "Ann Coulter may see that as pessimism and defeatism and declinism," Beinart said. "But I actually think what it reflects is a more cosmopolitan temperament, a recognition that America has things to learn from the rest of the world." Beinart pinpoints this shift in three major demographics: immigrants from "soccer-mad nations" in South America, young people and political liberals. Or, as Beinart calls it, the "Obama coalition." "If you look at the states where soccer is most popular, they’re overwhelmingly blue states, and the states where soccer is least popular are red states," Beinart said. "The only difference between the soccer coalition and the Obama coalition is that African-Americans right now are not such big soccer fans." With the World Cup final around the corner, we wondered: Does soccer interest really split along party lines? In Beinart’s original response to Coulter -- a June 30 article in The Atlantic -- he cites an article by Estately, a real estate search site, that aggregates seven different measures of soccer’s popularity in each of the 50 states plus Washington, D.C., including Facebook and Google interest, the number of professional teams and youth soccer clubs per capita. The top-seven "soccer-enthused" states, according to Estately, were all states President Barack Obama carried in 2012, including Maryland, New York, Washington and Massachusetts. Texas -- a particularly Hispanic state full of large urban centers -- and Utah -- America’s youngest population -- were the only states Mitt Romney carried in 2012 to crack the top 13, ranking eighth and 10th, respectively. Regardless where you place the cutoff for "the states where soccer is most popular," seven out of the top seven and 11 out of the top 13 voting Democrat gets close to Beinart’s assertion that the most soccer-mad states are "overwhelmingly blue states." Similarly, out of the 10 states Estately ranked least enthusiastic, only Maine went to Obama in 2012; Alabama, Idaho, Arkansas, and Wyoming rank among both the most conservative and least soccer-enthused. There’s no perfect index, though, when it comes to measuring popularity. Ryan Nickum, who wrote the Estately article, agreed with Beinart that, for the most part, soccer-mad states are blue, and soccer-indifferent states are red, but Nickum attributed this largely to the urban/rural divide. "A good portion of the criteria in our data related to professional soccer teams," Nickum said. And professional soccer teams "are located in large cities, so more rural states will naturally score lower," Nickum said. "Even so, (Beinart’s) argument that soccer fans are made up of liberals, young people, and immigrants is probably accurate. These are also the people who inhabit cities in greater numbers." That’s one of the reasons why Texas and Utah rank high in Estately’s rankings; Utah has a Major League Soccer team, and Texas has two. Only one state without an MLS or National Women’s Soccer League franchise cracks Estately’s top 18. Florida, where two MLS teams folded in 2002 for financial reasons, is the outlier. Although many states that have professional teams also rank highly in several other of Estately’s indexes, it’s a subjective question whether the presence of a professional team indicates popularity. Andrei Markovits -- co-author of 2001’s Offside: Soccer and American Exceptionalism -- was skeptical of Beinart’s conflation of the public opinion on soccer and America’s sense of superiority, but he corroborated the claim we’re checking here. "I in fact know that soccer has been much more popular in blue states -- meaning on the two coasts and in the affluent but liberal suburbs of metropolises like New York, Boston, San Francisco, Los Angeles -- than in red states," Markovits said. He added that "this has -- tellingly -- changed during this World Cup where the watching of games has been huge across the land, pretty evenly distributed across red and blue states." "But the World Cup and soccer are two different things," said Markovits. "The World Cup has become Olympianized in the United States, meaning that soccer becomes huge every four years." The World Cup’s increase in popularity may be evenly spread between blue and red states, but, four years ago, overall viewership numbers weren’t. According to the Wall Street Journal, 11 percent of self-described liberals said they watched the 2010 World Cup, compared to 6 percent for conservatives. And even putting aside the World Cup and the presence of professional teams, the percentage of youth playing in soccer leagues is much higher in blue states than red. Seventeen of the 20 states with the highest percentage of youth soccer participation voted for Obama in 2010, and 16 of the 20 states with the lowest percentage of youth soccer participation voted for Romney, the Wall Street Journal found, citing private research by Experian Marketing Services. Our ruling On CNN, Beinart said, "if you look at the states where soccer is most popular, they’re overwhelmingly blue states, and the states where soccer is least popular are red states." Beinart seems to have had in mind a study by real estate website Estately. A variety of their metrics -- youth soccer participation, the presence of professional teams, and online interest -- strongly suggest that states where soccer is more popular were more likely to vote for Obama than Romney in 2012, and visa versa. Estately’s metrics, though, do skew toward larger urban centers that can support MLS franchises, and it’s a legitimate question how best to measure popularity. Experts may disagree on the reasons why liberal states tend to be more soccer-mad than conservative states, but Beinart’s claim accurately represents his source material. With the caveat in mind that measuring popularity is difficult, we rate Beinart’s claim Mostly True.	None	Peter Beinart	None	None	None	2014-07-10T14:52:43	2014-07-06	['None']

pomt-01396	Says Charlie Crist "is embroiled in a fraud case for steering taxpayer money to a de facto Ponzi scheme."	false	/florida/statements/2014/oct/13/republican-party-florida/republican-party-attacks-charlie-crist-digital-dom/	Gov. Rick Scott and his opponent Charlie Crist are having a heyday accusing each other of being corrupt. Crist and the Democrats have repeatedly attacked Scott for the $1.7 billion Medicare fraud fine against Columbia/HCA, a health care company headed by Scott before he stepped down in 1997 amid the federal investigation. Scott and the Republicans have attacked Crist for his friendship with a past campaign donor, Fort Lauderdale lawyer Scott Rothstein, who went to prison for a $1.4 billion Ponzi scheme in 2011. Crist was not implicated in the Ponzi scheme. A new TV ad by the Republican Party of Florida reminds voters about Crist’s Rothstein connection and then makes this claim: "And now Crist is embroiled in a fraud case for steering taxpayer money to a de facto Ponzi scheme," says the narrator. The text on the screen then states: "Florida lawsuit calls Digital Domain ‘de facto Ponzi scheme,’" citing a July 2014 article in the South Florida Business Journal. Digital Domain is a special effects movie company that took $20 million in state money under then-Gov. Crist before it went bankrupt in 2012. The state did file a lawsuit that called the botched deal a "de facto Ponzi scheme," but the ad omits crucial context about that lawsuit: It was filed recently by attorney William Scherer, a Scott supporter and frequent donor to GOP candidates. Crist’s campaign lawyer, Mark Herron, sent a letter to TV stations calling the ad "false" and urging them not to air it. We decided to fact-check Crist’s role in the Digital Domain deal and whether he was "embroiled in a fraud case for steering taxpayer money to a de facto Ponzi scheme." Digital Domain lawsuit Digital Domain California, created by director James Cameron, animated the scenes in Titanic and the Transformers movies. Despite its creative success, the company had debt problems. (For a thorough analysis of the Digital Domain fiasco, read this Palm Beach Post investigation.) Digital Domain Florida was formed in 2009 with hopes that it would get money here to settle debt from its California company. But that strategy wasn’t known to state officials at the time. After Enterprise Florida rejected a request for Digital Domain to get $20 million, the company sought another avenue. State Rep. Kevin Ambler, R-Tampa, inserted a budget amendment that included the $20 million. Crist signed off on the budget in June 2009. But in September 2012, the Port St. Lucie company announced it was closing its Florida operations, filing for bankruptcy and laying off more than 300 employees. The state hired Scherer to go after Digital Domain, and Scherer filed his lawsuit in the 19th Judicial Circuit in Port St. Lucie on July 22, 2014. The suit names Digital Domain executives and entities involved with the company as co-defendants, as well as Ambler, who was given a position on Digital Domain’s board in 2011 after he left the Legislature. Ambler’s son also got a job with the company. The lawsuit doesn’t name Crist as a defendant. However, Scherer’s lawsuit repeatedly points the finger at Crist and casts him as a key politician responsible for the state’s end of the deal. In fact, the lawsuit mentions Crist by name 35 times. The lawsuit portrays Crist as being wooed by Digital Domain executives starting years before the company got the state money. Scherer’s account of Crist starts in 2007 when an entrepreneur involved in Digital Domain, Sean Heyniger, invited Crist to a party in order to lobby Crist to give the company state money. Heyniger’s ex-wife, Kelly Heyniger, had been dating Crist at the time. The lawsuit says that Crist went to California to check out the project. A different picture emerges in the state inspector general’s report ordered by Scott after the company collapsed. That report says that no laws or rules were broken by state officials, though it generally raises concerns about the process for companies to get state incentive money. The report shows how several politicians and state officials -- not only Crist -- played a role in Digital Domain walking away with $20 million. It portrays Crist as making sure legislative leaders were involved by sending a letter to Senate President Jeff Atwater and House Speaker Larry Cretul asking for them to notify them of the funding before he approved it. (The report also stated that a lack of documentation and conflicting information hampered the ability of the inspector general to make a complete determination. Crist didn’t return a message by investigators.) So Crist did play a significant role in the company getting state money -- but he wasn’t the only political player who made that happen. The Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times wrote that the report showed that "several legislative power players said ‘Yes’ to a deal that later cost taxpayers dearly." That included Crist, Ambler, Crist’s economic development director Dale Brill and legislative power brokers, including then state Rep. David Rivera, who chaired the state’s legislative budget commission where the project was discussed before it received state money. Crist told the Palm Beach Post in 2013 that he signed off on the $20 million grant because he thought Digital Domain represented a promising opportunity for the state. "I was really supportive of trying to develop the film industry," Crist said. Was it a ‘de facto Ponzi scheme’? In the lawsuit, Scherer wrote, "Digital Domain California was a de facto Ponzi scheme. It was a serial borrower which constantly replaced old debt with new debt to keep the enterprise going." Digital Domain now faces allegations of fraud in a civil suit, but was it a ‘de facto Ponzi scheme,’ as the ad suggests? We interviewed Andrew Levi, a former federal prosecutor who prosecuted Ponzi schemers in South Florida and is now in private practice. "It definitely is not a classic Ponzi scheme," Levi said. "It's more of a debt scheme." In a classic Ponzi scheme, a business -- which may or may not include a legitimate practice -- solicits money from investors with promises of high returns. When the business can’t deliver on the returns, it seeks money from a second group of investors to pay off the first group. The scheme ultimately implodes when it can’t continue to pay off investors. According to Scherer’s lawsuit, Digital Domain California started up Digital Domain Florida with the intention of soliciting money and covering their debt from the California company. "It doesn’t mean that it’s not a fraud of some kind if the allegations are true, but it doesn’t fit into the common classic definition of a Ponzi scheme," Levi said. "It’s really a stretch to apply the term ‘Ponzi scheme.’ " A campaign spokesman for Crist, Brendan Gilfillan, described Digital Domain as a "business failure, not a crime, and Rick Scott’s own administration has said Gov. Crist did nothing wrong." Crist isn’t alone in handing out state money in exchange for jobs that failed to materialize. A Miami Herald/Tampa Bay Times investigation found that under Scott the state gave $266 million in tax breaks and other incentives in return for 45,258 new jobs, but only 5 percent of the jobs materialized. Our ruling The Republicans’ ad said, "Crist is embroiled in a fraud case for steering taxpayer money to a de facto Ponzi scheme," referring to Digital Domain getting $20 million in state incentives and then going belly up. But a state report, ordered by Scott, concluded there were no violations of law or rules by Crist or any other politician. The report also showed Crist was one of many political players who helped the company get the state money. A civil court could find that Digital Domain committed fraud. However, the company’s plan to pay off its debt in another state by getting money from Florida doesn’t meet the definition of a classic Ponzi scheme. Also, while Crist is mentioned in the court filing, he's not a defendant in the case. We rate this claim False.

pomt-02394	The economic "turnaround started at the end of my term."	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/mar/11/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-says-economic-turnaround-started-end/	The Republican Party has tried to boil down the comparison between Florida Gov. Rick Scott and his rival, former Gov. Charlie Crist, with four words: "Crist crash, Scott surge." Crist -- a Republican-turned-independent while serving as governor from January 2007 to January 2011, was indeed in office during the economic downturn. His successor, Scott, has been in office during the recovery. Crist, now a Democrat, wants his old job back -- and he argues that the economic recovery actually started on his watch, not Scott’s. He made that argument in a March 9, 2014, interview with CNN’s Candy Crowley: Crowley: "Can I get you in a yes or no to get you to tell me whether you think the economy is better than it was when the governor (Scott) took office?" Crist: "I think it is, yes. You can. And I'm always comfortable telling the truth but that turnaround started at the end of my term. And one of the reasons is I accepted the stimulus money, saved thousands of teachers’ jobs, law enforcement officers, firefighters, (is that) it was the right thing to do. … President Obama said, I want to help you, and I said yes as a Republican to a Democratic president. Not because it was political, but because it was right." We have previously fact-checked Crist’s claims about the stimulus. But PolitiFact’s Truth-O-Meter revs up when we hear candidates make a point of saying they’re "telling the truth." Here we will fact-check Crist’s claim that the economic turnaround started at the end of his term. The economy at the end of Crist’s tenure On CNN, Crist didn’t give a specific time period for the end of his term, but we focused on data during his final year in office -- 2010. (He officially left office in January 2011.) We contrasted that with Scott’s first year in office -- 2011. Here are some statistics that will shed light on the Florida economy during that period. The unemployment rate: In January 2010, the unemployment rate in Florida was 11.4 percent. During that year, it started to improve gradually, and by January 2011 it had dropped to 10.9 percent. Then, in 2011 under Scott, the unemployment rate continued to improve, dropping below double digits in October. By December, the unemployment rate was 9.5 percent, a drop of 1.4 percentage points. This measure provides Crist with some modest support: The unemployment rate did decrease in his final year -- though a decrease of 0.5 points is pretty small. Per capita real GDP: Per capita real GDP measures the inflation-adjusted economic activity per person in Florida. In 2009-2010, per capita real GDP dropped by 0.74 percent. In 2010-11, it continued to drop but by less: 0.23 percent, before climbing in 2011-12 to 1.05. By this measure, Crist is wrong because per capita real GDP continued to drop during his tenure, even though it was a smaller drop than earlier in the recession. Former state Sen. Steve Geller, an informal adviser to Crist’s campaign, told PolitiFact Florida in an email that per capita GDP had "turned around" because the decline had slowed down near the end of his term. However, we'll note that even though the decreases in GDP were smaller near the end of Crist's term, GDP was still shrinking -- not what we'd consider a turnaround. Per capita personal income: Per capita personal income refers to how much income was earned per person in the state. In 2009-2010, per capita personal income grew by 3.09 percent -- a turnaround compared to drops the two previous years. It continued to grow in 2011, by 3.64 percent. This measure gives Crist support, since per capita income growth turned from negative to positive during 2009-10. Payroll employment per month: By this measure, employment rose from about 7,143,900 jobs in January 2010 to 7,230,300 in January 2011. That’s a 1.20 percent increase -- but it came during a period when population in the state grew by 1.25 percent. Since employment growth did not keep pace with population growth, this is not a very strong piece of evidence for Crist. Industrial production: Industrial production is an index that measures the value of manufacturing output, compared to a "base" rate of 100. Under Crist, industrial production rose from 89.94 in January 2010 to 94.29 in January 2011. This measure is one of the strongest pieces of evidence for Crist’s claim. Economists we interviewed noted several caveats about the data: the GDP and personal income data starts mid-year, and personal income includes components such as dividends, which relate to the broader financial markets rather than state policies. Proprietary quarterly estimates by Moody’s also show mixed evidence for Crist’s argument. They show that real income per capita bottomed out in the fourth quarter of 2009 and rose throughout 2010. That’s good for Crist’s argument. By contrast, real GDP per capita, on the other hand, did not begin to recover by the end of Crist’s term. Chris Lafakis, a senior economist at Moody’s, said the evidence gives Crist a leg to stand on. "Taking the preponderance of data into consideration, I would agree with Crist’s claim that the economy started to recover while he was in office," Lafakis told PolitiFact Florida. But Sean Snaith, an economist at the University of Central Florida, said Florida’s economy in 2010 showed "a very weak pulse. The recovery strengthened slightly in 2011, but we were still limping forward." How much credit does Crist deserve? Another concern with Crist’s claim is whether he has a basis for crediting his own policies for a turnaround. Several economists told us that it is difficult to pinpoint much blame or credit on a governor for shifts in the state’s economy that were reflected in the national economy. While the national recovery officially started in June 2009, they said, Florida's recovery did not begin until some time in 2010, and the initial recovery was slow. "If he is taking credit for the recovery, does he also bear responsibility for the recession? I am not sure you can simultaneously take credit for the good things and eschew any responsibility for the bad," Snaith said. "The reality is that Florida's economic performance is a joint function of global and national factors influenced by national and state economic policies. It is difficult to try and deconstruct and then quantify what role each of these factors played in Florida's economy. But I don't suppose that will stop politicians from trying to do so." The timing of Florida’s recovery had a lot to do with the national recovery as well as a comeback in certain sectors such as tourism, said David Denslow, an economist with the University of Florida's Bureau of Economic and Business Research. However, Denslow did offer Crist "some credit, most importantly for trying to hold the line on government jobs, and accepting federal stimulus funds," Denslow said. While Crist’s decision to accept stimulus funds during the worst part of the recession mitigated the damage, "Scott’s decision to cancel the high-speed rail line from Tampa to Orlando cost the state thousands of jobs," Lafakis said. Mark Vitner, an analyst at Wells Fargo, said though the unemployment rate began to fall under Crist, "it was still extremely high, the recession began on his watch, and Florida’s economy hit rock bottom on his watch." It takes a while to start moving a big state such as Florida in a different direction, Geller said. "There is nothing magical about the inauguration date," Geller told PolitiFact Florida in an email. "Things that Charlie started continued to happen through the end of 2011. I believe that Charlie should get at least part of the credit for the 2011-2012 increase." Though much of the state’s economy is based on national trends, there are a few things governors can do to help the economy -- as Crist did by accepting the stimulus funds, Geller said. Likewise there are other factors a governor can’t control such as the oil spill in April 2010. Our ruling Crist said that the economic "turnaround started at the end of my term." During Crist’s last year in office, Florida’s economy experienced notable gains in personal income and industrial production, and more marginal improvements in the unemployment rate and in payroll employment. But GDP didn’t grow again until Scott took office. Economists say Crist deserves some credit for the economic turnaround because he accepted federal stimulus dollars, but they add that any state is inevitably buffeted by national and international trends far beyond their control. On balance, the evidence for an economic turnaround on Crist’s watch -- and for a significant role by him in a turnaround -- are mixed. So we rate his claim Half True.

pomt-10248	McCain voted 19 times against a minimum-wage increase.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/28/joe-biden/the-democrats-counted-correctly/	Team Obama has been trolling through John McCain's voting record in the Senate, and this nugget landed in vice presidential candidate Joe Biden's Aug. 27, 2008, convention speech: "He voted 19 times against the minimum wage for people who are struggling just to make it to the next day." (We'll give Biden a pass for skipping the word "raising," which was in his prepared remarks.) We combed through McCain's minimum wage votes and found that not all of 19 in opposition to increases were pure votes on the minimum wage, and some were procedural, as is the Senate's way. But McCain has voted repeatedly, 19 times, against Democratic attempts to raise the minimum wage. Most recently, McCain voted against a spending bill in March 2007 that included the wage hike. Earlier that year, he voted against stopping debate on a stand-alone wage-hike bill, which in Senate parlance is equivalent to voting no. Let's put an important caveat on this issue, however. McCain has often voted for minimum-wage increases. In 2007, he voted for passage of a bill that would have raised the minimum wage from $5.15 to $7.25, after it was packaged with business tax breaks designed to soften the blow of the wage increase. And a few months later, he voted for the final version of the bill that made that wage hike into law. It was packaged in a large spending bill with war funding that did not include a goal for withdrawing troops from Iraq, unlike the earlier bill that he voted against. To show how confusing Senate votes can get, Barack Obama voted against the final spending bill and wage hike because of the Iraq policy. Biden was one of 37 Democrats to vote for the bill. McCain has also voted for Republican-sponsored minimum-wage proposals that would have meant smaller increases than what the Democrats wanted. For instance, on June 21, 2006, he voted against an amendment from Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy that would eventually have raised the minimum wage to $7.25. But on the same day, McCain voted for an amendment from Wyoming Sen. Mike Enzi that would have raised the wage to $6.25. That sort of conflicting, confusing pile of votes is just the nature of the Senate. McCain has said he opposes Obama's proposal to raise the minimum wage and index it for inflation, telling a business group in June that it and other Obama proposals are "a sure way to add to your costs and to slow the creation of new jobs." Let's look at the big picture. Generally, on minimum-wage issues, McCain has been in the middle of the Senate Republicans. He's not one of the few GOP members who regularly vote for Democratic proposals. But he also wasn't one of the three conservatives who voted against the 2007 wage hike, even after the tax breaks were added. Biden, however, never made any claim about McCain's votes for minimum-wage bills or his overall record. All he said was that McCain cast 19 votes against raising the minimum wage, and that's True.

pomt-08761	"The seed of Muslim is passed through the father."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/26/franklin-graham/graham-said-seed-islam-passes-through-father-obama/	President Barack Obama has declared himself a Christian. He has worshipped in Christian churches, prayed with Christian ministers, and recounted how he knelt beneath a cross and felt God's spirit. And yet, a surprising number of Americans keep telling pollsters they believe he's a Muslim. The Pew Research Center last week reported that 18 percent of Americans believe Obama is a Muslim, up from 11 percent in March 2009. A Time magazine poll also released last week found even more -- 24 percent - said he was a Muslim. (Read our longer report on this issue.) The evangelical minister Franklin Graham said on CNN that it's because of Obama's background. "He was born a Muslim. His father was a Muslim; the seed of Muslim is passed through the father like the seed of Judaism is passed through the mother. He was born a Muslim; his father gave him an Islamic name," Graham said, adding later in the interview, "you can be born a Muslim. You can be born a Jew. But you can't be born a Christian." Graham added, however, that he did consider Obama to be a Christian today: "Now, it's obvious that the president has renounced the Prophet Mohammed and he has renounced Islam and he has accepted Jesus Christ. That's what he says he has done. I cannot say that he hasn't. So I just have to believe the president is what he has said." We wanted to check Graham's statement that "the seed of Muslim is passed through the father." But first, we should note Graham is right that Obama has Muslim ancestors. According to family accounts, Obama's paternal grandfather Onyango Obama was a Muslim. But it's not clear that his biological father, Barack Hussein Obama Sr., ever practiced the religion. By all accounts, Obama's Kenyan father was an atheist more interested in economics and government than religion. And the senior Obama had little influence on the future president because he left his American wife, Ann Dunham, shortly after Obama's birth in 1961. Dunham married again, to Lolo Soetero, an Indonesian man who was Muslim, and the family moved to Indonesia when Obama was 6 years old, where he attended a Muslim public school and a Catholic school at different times. But Soetero was not particularly devout, according to his daughter and Obama's half-sister, Maya Soetero-Ng. She told biographer David Remnick that Soetero "never went to prayer services except for big communal events." Obama described his religious upbringing this way: "My father, who returned to Kenya when I was just two, was born Muslim but as an adult became an atheist. My mother, whose parents were non-practicing Baptists and Methodists, was probably one of the most spiritual and kindest people I've ever known, but grew up with a healthy skepticism of organized religion herself. As a consequence, so did I." But when we looked into Graham's statement that "the seed of Muslim is passed through the father like the seed of Judaism is passed through the mother," we found a good bit of evidence to the contrary. We consulted several reference books on the Islamic religion, interviewed academic experts and consulted with Islamic groups. None of the sources we checked endorsed Graham's view as completely accurate. It's true that in Muslim cultures, the children of Muslims are generally assumed to be Muslim themselves, according to our research. But all of the sources we looked at described the Islamic faith as not belonging to any particular race, ethnicity or nation. Most of the sources said that whether one truly is a Muslim or not depends on the belief in Muslim teaching and the following of its practices, not whether one is born into the faith. Blain Auer, an assistant professor of Islamic studies at Western Michigan University, said the most prominent requirement is for believers to recite the shahadah, a statement of faith that affirms "I witness that there is no god but God and Mohammed is his Messenger." "Franklin Graham's statement is incorrect. Islam is an act of faith, not a genetic disposition," Auer said via e-mail. Representatives of Muslim groups in the United States also said Graham's description was inaccurate. "It's not something one inherits automatically or biologically. What is important is the self-identification, (regardless of the) background they may have been born into," said Sayyid M. Syeed, national director of the Islamic Society of North America. Another professor of Islamic studies, Frederick Colby, agreed that people are generally considered Muslim if they affirm that by reciting the shahadah. But it can get complicated, he added. "Defining religious membership is notoriously difficult," Colby said via e-mail. "Does it involve merely what the person believes? Is it what they do (e.g. ritual and practice)? Is it being a member of a particular organization? Many contemporary scholars of religion think that each of these elements plays a role in defining 'religion.'" Indeed, the reference book Islam: A Very Short Introduction, partly supported Graham's contention but it discusses just such complications. It states that the primary definition of a Muslim is someone who surrenders himself or herself to the will of God. "'Islam' in Arabic is a verbal noun, meaning self-surrender to God as revealed through the message and life of his Prophet, Mohammed," writes author Malise Ruthven. A secondary definition is "one born to a Muslim father who takes on his or her parent's confessional identity without necessarily subscribing to the beliefs and practices of the faith, just as a Jew may define him- or herself as 'Jewish' without observing the Halacha." (The Halacha is Jewish religious law.) But this secondary definition "is very far from being uncontested," Ruthven writes, adding, "Generally there is little consistency in the way such labels are applied." And even this definition is problematic since President Obama's father did not identify as a Muslim when Obama was born, said Ken Garden, a professor of religion at Tufts University who studies Islam. "If Obama's father became an atheist, then he would not have been a Muslim at the time of Obama's birth, so Obama would not have been, even technically, a Muslim," said Garden. Garden added that he was troubled that people would consider being a Muslim to be slanderous. "I think that for Graham to muse aloud about him maybe being a Muslim or not throws gasoline on that fire," he said. To be clear, we're fact-checking what Graham said, not whether any religion is any better or worse than another. In looking at most of the scholarly and objective descriptions of the Islamic faith, we found little to support Graham's statement that "the seed of Muslim is passed through the father," absent belief in the tenets of the religion. In fact, the vast majority of sources said that religious faith was based on the affirmation of Islamic beliefs. But we found a secondary definition that said people born to a Muslim father and identify as cultural Muslims could be considered Islamic, even if they don't have Islamic beliefs, though that was considered controversial. So we rate Graham's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06174	Says that according to one economist, $1 of unemployment benefits boosts the economy by $1.61.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/dec/15/lloyd-doggett/doggett-says-1-extended-unemployment-benefits-will/	Urging Congress to act quickly, U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett recently laid out his case for renewing "emergency" extended unemployment insurance for another year. In a Dec. 8, 2011, opinion piece on the Huffington Post website, the Austin Democrat quoted a little "Workin’ Man" from the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band and then listed bold-faced "Facts" including, "Fact: One economist estimates that for every $1 we spent on unemployment insurance benefits, we get $1.61 in economic activity back." That rang a bell. We were already checking a nearly identical statement on a Web page posted by the Democrats of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, and we’d found that another PolitiFact writer checked a similar claim in 2010. Were they all the same? Basically, yes, Doggett spokeswoman Sarah Dohl told us: All three statements relied on a single estimate from Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi. The factoid was used, then as now, as an argument for extending the federal Emergency Unemployment Compensation program, created in 2008 and originally set to expire in a year. It’s been extended eight times, and the current law providing support for up to 99 weeks expires Jan. 3, 2012. If it isn’t extended, most people who lose their jobs after that will get a maximum 26 weeks of state unemployment benefits. During a July 2010 Congressional standoff over renewing the benefits, PolitiFact rated U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen’s version of the statement Half True. She got Zandi’s number about right, PolitiFact observed, but other experts disputed the economist’s results. Dohl told us the $1.61 estimate came from Zandi’s testimony to the House budget committee on July 1, 2010. Next, we checked with Zandi to see if his $1.61 number still held. He told us that he updates such numbers every quarter and that his most recent figure, for the second quarter of 2011, is $1.55. Why the decrease? Zandi said new data are confirming suspicions that extending unemployment benefits means some workers just stay unemployed longer. "If they are not working, then less is produced and the economy is smaller," he said. This "disincentive" effect includes some fraud, Zandi pointed out. But it isn’t always dishonest -- sometimes the worker uses the time to find a better job, and if that worker is an unemployed rocket scientist who could earn $125,000 a year, it’s much better for the economy if he or she is earning and spending that cash instead of living on the minimum wage. We also asked Zandi how he generates such estimates in the first place. How might handing $1 to an unemployed worker make the nation’s gross domestic product eventually increase by $1.55? The basic idea is that Uncle Sam hands an unemployed person $1, and that person buys, perhaps, groceries with it; the grocery owner in turn will need to order more vegetables, and the dollar continues to change hands, losing a few cents in some transactions, perhaps gaining in others. Some value leaches away into transaction costs, taxes or savings; but the dollar can generate growth, too -- for example, if the grocery store owner has to hire more staff. Zandi said he uses a complex econometric model with hundreds of equations to determine whether a dollar spent on unemployment compensation drives the GDP up or down and how much. Essentially, he told us, you take a certain period of time, figure out how much was spent on unemployment insurance and how much GDP went up, and try to hold all the other factors equal. He also produces estimates on how much bang for the buck the U.S. government gets from many other spending options. That’s part of what he was telling the House committee: which policy options he believes can boost the economy most. A few examples from Zandi’s Aug. 26, 2011 report on the economy: • Spending $1 on unemployment insurance boosts GDP by $1.55. • Cutting corporate tax rates $1 will boost GDP by 32 cents. • Cutting taxes $1 across the board will boost GDP by 98 cents. • Spending $1 to increase food stamps temporarily will boost GDP by $1.71. In its most ridiculously oversimplified form, the equation to get that first number could be written as $1 times X equals $1.55. "X" is the multiplier -- and if the multiplier is larger than 1, your money goes up. If the multiplier is less than 1, your money goes down. So in this chart, Zandi’s stating that the multiplier for corporate tax rate cuts was 0.32; the multiplier for across-the-board tax cuts was 0.98; and the multiplier for increasing food stamps was 1.71. Doggett’s spokeswoman had also sent us a study, commissioned by the U.S. Department of Labor and others, that used Moody’s models (and some of Zandi’s work) to conclude that during the recession that began in 2008, every dollar spent on unemployment insurance boosted the gross domestic product $2. Different results are generated by different time periods, different equations and different data sets, as with the Labor study, but Zandi said the main thing to note here is that each multiplier is not a fixed point. "The multipliers depend on the state of the economy. If the economy is operating full-out, then the multiplier will be low and could even be negative. If the economy is very weak, then the multiplier will be large," he told us. But herein lies the foundation for one objection to Zandi’s models: Some economists believe it’s not realistic to predict any GDP increase. Harvard economist Robert Barro is prominent among them, writing Aug. 24, 2011 in the Wall Street Journal that "this idea — that one can magically get back more than one puts in — conflicts with what I will call ‘regular economics.’" So there’s one fundamental objection. PolitiFact reported more concerns last year, including: • An economist from the libertarian-leaning Cato Institute cited a survey of 10 scholars’ research -- using different methods -- indicating that $1 spent in tax cuts might increase GDP, but $1 in increased government spending would decrease GDP. That is, for tax cuts the multiplier is above 1, but for government spending the multiplier is below 1. • Some researchers say unemployment spending will drag the economy down long-term, because the government will eventually have to raise taxes in order to keep paying out. • Scholars from the conservative Heritage Foundation said it’s invalid to assume the unemployed person will rush out and spend the whole dollar. Zandi agreed that if the unemployment benefits are "financed by a larger deficit, then it will result in weaker long-term growth." But, he said, if it "helps avoid a more severe downturn in the economy now, then it could very well be worth the long-term cost." As to spending the whole dollar, Zandi said his view remains that "most unemployed workers will spend their unemployment insurance very soon after they receive it." If you give a dollar to Bill Gates, he said, the billionaire might not spend it at once, but "many people are living paycheck to paycheck, not thinking 10 years down the road." So, clearly, economists diverge on whether, and how much, spending on unemployment benefits might boost the economy. For more perspective, PolitiFact looked at estimates from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. In January 2010, the CBO estimated a dollar in unemployment aid would increase GDP between $0.70 to $1.90 -- so Shaheen’s $1.60 was at the high end, but still in the ballpark. A Nov. 15, 2011, CBO update says that a dollar in unemployment aid would increase the GDP between $0.40 to $1.90. Zandi’s latest estimate of a $1.55 increase in GDP falls toward the high end of that range. But that’s not the amount Doggett cited. He’s repeating $1.61, which makes the outcome look rosier than it might really be -- even setting aside other economists’ concerns with making such a projection. Our ruling Doggett cites an economist’s projection that the country gets a 61 percent return on each additional dollar in unemployment aid. But his "fact" overlooks another fact: Economists are divided over whether unemployment aid increases GDP. Also, Doggett’s statement specifies a figure from mid-2010 that’s been out of date for about a year. A failure to update it is like failing to update the national employment rates. The only certain fact here is that an economist did once estimate $1.61. Our sense is you can’t take Doggett’s statement to the bank. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-03365	Says if Texas abortion measure passes, "someone living in El Paso would have to drive 550 miles each way to San Antonio for something as simple as cervical cancer screening."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2013/jul/12/gilberto-hinojosa/gilberto-hinojosa-texas-abortion-cancer/	The Texas Democratic Party sent out an email blast July 3, 2013, seeking signatures on a petition calling (ultimately without success) for hearings to be held around the state on a legislative measure tightening restrictions on abortion in Texas. Signed by party chairman Gilberto Hinojosa, the letter said, "If this bill passes, someone living in El Paso would have to drive 550 miles each way to San Antonio for something as simple as cervical cancer screening at a clinic." House Bill 2, which a House committee approved the day Hinojosa’s email went out and was awaiting Senate consideration as we posted this article, would ban most abortions after 20 weeks and toughen standards for abortion clinics. Opponents have said a provision that clinics must upgrade to the standards of ambulatory surgical centers could lead 36 of 42 clinics that perform most Texas abortions to shut down. When we contacted the Democratic Party about Hinojosa’s claim, spokeswoman Tanene Allison told us by email that although the chairman’s San Antonio reference could be read as saying no El Paso facility would continue to provide such services, it was not intended that way. Hinojosa "does recognize that there may be other clinics open for these screenings in El Paso," Allison said. "Our intention was to say that if you go to the clinics that are covered under HB2, you would have to drive 550 miles to get some of the services that you normally get locally," Allison said. "We certainly could have been clearer and will be in future emails." Still, we checked on conditions in El Paso for ourselves. El Paso, a city with 672,538 residents as of 2012, is at Texas’ western edge, but it’s not isolated. It’s across the Rio Grande from the more than 1 million residents of Mexico’s Ciudad Juárez, and inside the U.S., it’s closer to Albuquerque, N.M. (population 555,417) and the nation’s sixth-largest city (Phoenix, population 1.5 million) than it is to San Antonio. Two El Paso clinics could shutter if the measure becomes law, according to a July 10, 2013, El Paso Times news story. The clinics appear on a Department of State Health Services list of abortion facilities we received by email June 25, 2013. Reproductive Services of El Paso, near downtown, provides cancer screenings and other services, while Hill Top Women’s Reproductive Clinic solely offers abortions and pregnancy tests, according to the clinics’ websites. We called both clinics, but did not hear back. So, if Reproductive Services were to shut down, would El Paso women have to drive 550 miles to get a test for cervical cancer? "That’s unbelievable. That’s not possible. I don’t even know where to start," said Adriana Valdes, co-director of outreach and case management at the Cancer and Chronic Disease Consortium, which manages El Paso clinics’ participation in the state’s Breast and Cervical Cancer Services program. "There are a lot of organizations and institutions here that can provide access to those services," Valdes told us by phone. Lawmakers "need to put all the facts together" before making decisions that could affect funding for women’s health "coming into needy communities like ours," she said. "Many towns and hospitals are committing their monies to diagnostic screenings and diagnostic services and none of them are providing abortion services." Valdes said she was not aware of the two clinics listed as abortion facilities, but said that any time a facility closes, it has a big impact on the women in the area who rely on its services. "We have central locations," she said. "Those are not long distances." Access to transportation is a concern, she said, but the biggest issue can be making sure women know the services are available, especially with patients who get used to going to a single facility for years and don’t know of other options. Education and advice for such women is a main function of her organization, which subcontracts with 12 to 14 clinics and some private health care providers to help women get breast and cervical cancer screenings at low or no cost, Valdes said, and gives ongoing assistance to women diagnosed with cancer. The clinics do not provide abortions, she said, and so would not be directly affected by the legislation, although it could mean more women would seek their "already overwhelmed" services. Access to cervical cancer screenings in El Paso decreased when Planned Parenthood clinics in El Paso closed, we learned from Valdes and Theresa Byrd, a professor at Texas Tech University’s Paul L. Foster School of Medicine in El Paso. According to the 2013 El Paso Times news story and another from June 27, 2009, all six Planned Parenthood clinics in El Paso closed in 2009 because of financial problems. Byrd, who helped develop a intervention program being tested now in El Paso and other cities to increase the prevalence of cervical cancer screenings among Mexican American women, told us that if the abortion measure became law, "the situation would stay about the same" in El Paso regarding cervical cancer screening. That is, such tests would still be available. Byrd said, "In El Paso, is it easy to get service? No. You might have to wait, and it’s probably not as easy as it would be in other communities" such as Houston. "But can you get them? Yes." For women who have health insurance, Byrd said, the path starts with a visit to the obstetrician/gynecologist or family doctor. "So many women in our community are uninsured that many of them use our federally qualified health centers," she said, naming El Paso’s three major providers in the state program: Centro San Vicente, Project Vida and Centro de Salud Familiar La Fe. Three or more health fairs held each year in El Paso also offer screenings, Byrd said, and cervical cancer tests are available in Juárez as well. Among health care options in El Paso is University Medical Center, which according to an online fact sheet is the largest public hospital on the U.S./Mexico border. Spokesman Jethro Armijo told us by phone that the hospital has seven outpatient clinics offering women’s health care including cervical cancer screenings. The clinics do not offer abortions and are located throughout the county, he said. Our ruling Hinojosa said that if the abortion legislation passed, an El Paso resident would have to make a 550-mile trip to San Antonio for simple services like a cervical cancer screening. That’s not so; such services will continue to be available in El Paso, local experts say. This statement misses the mark so badly, it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-03732	"We have the fewest people employed in this country since 1979."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/12/cathy-mcmorris-rodgers/rep-cathy-mcmorris-rodgers-says-fewer-now-working-/	During an interview with NPR, Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers, R-Wash., a member of the House Republican leadership, expressed concern about the state of working America. "We have the fewest people employed in this country since 1979," McMorris Rodgers told host Audie Cornish. "And the current path that the president has outlined ... is not getting people back to work. So it's going to take both parties engaging." It turns out that McMorris Rodgers is on the right track with her statistic, but she described it incorrectly. A look at the numbers According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 89.4 million Americans were working in March 1979, but by March 2013, that number had grown to 135.2 million. This number remains lower than the all-time high of 138.1 million in January 2008, which was around the time the most recent recession hit. But the number of employees nationally is slowly climbing back to that peak. McMorris, however, meant to refer to a different BLS number: the labor force participation rate. This is the percentage of the U.S. population who are considered to be "in the labor force." To qualify as being in the labor force, you have to either be working or actively looking for work. In March 2013, the labor force participation rate was 63.3 percent -- lower than in any month since May 1979. (A similar statistic known as the employment-to-population ratio has also fallen, though it’s at its lowest level since late 1983.) Riva B. Litman, a spokeswoman for the House Republican Conference, told PolitiFact that McMorris Rodgers phrased the statistic incorrectly and meant to refer to the labor force participation rate. "If we adjust for population growth, fewer Americans work than at any time since Jimmy Carter was president," Litman said. What does the statistic mean? Most economists agree that a decline in the labor force participation rate is worrisome. But it’s important to point out some nuances. "The trick is to determine how much of the drop represents the impact of a lagging economy, which is worrisome, and how much is due to non-worrisome factors, such as the aging of the adult population," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. As more adults begin moving into retirement age, the percentage of Americans who work is bound to decline. And that’s been happening in a big way as the baby boomers age. Using federal data, Burtless has calculated that the percentage of the adult population over 55 has risen from 27 percent in 1999-2000 to 32 percent in the 2011-12. The new retirees are showing up in the data. Burtless has determined that the two employment ratios would have fallen in recent years just on the basis of aging, even if there had been no recession. But the age-related decline has been worsened by high unemployment rates during the recession. Most troubling, economists say, is the decline among the core working ages of 25 to 55. In addition, the tight job market has convinced more people to opt out of the labor market, perhaps by becoming students or stay-at-home parents. Burtless has estimated that half to two-thirds of the recent decline in the labor participation rate has been due to the aging of the population, depending on the time period you look at. In general, economists like to see more people working because it generally helps economic growth, said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. But it’s also important to keep in mind that leaving the labor force can be a voluntary decision. "Perhaps people would prefer to have more time at home rather than more stuff," she said. Our ruling McMorris Rodgers said, "We have the fewest people employed in this country since 1979." That’s not correct -- far more people are working now than in 1979. But a different statistic that takes into account population growth, the participation rate, is indeed lower now than it’s been since 1979. It’s important to note that a significant portion of this decline comes from the aging of the baby boomers, rather than economic weakness. On balance, we rate her statement Half True.

pomt-04824	Claims Joe Biden said "coal is more dangerous than terrorists."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2012/aug/17/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-joe-biden-once-claimed-coal-was-m/	Ohio looms large in this year's presidential race, but Mitt Romney staged an Aug. 14 campaign rally in one of its smallest and poorest places, the village of Beallsville. Its population is about 400, the median household income is about $23,000, or roughly half the state average. It once gained fame for having the highest per-capita number of residents killed in the Vietnam War of any community in the country. Six men were killed, from its then-population of 475. Beallsville is also in the heart of southeastern Ohio's Appalachian coal country. With a group of miners serving as his backdrop, Romney accused President Obama of "waging war on coal" through his energy policies. "His vice president said coal is more dangerous than terrorists," Romney said. "Can you imagine that? This tells you precisely what he (Obama) actually feels and what he's done and his policies over the last three and a half years have put in place the very vision he had when he was running for office." Did Vice President Biden really compare coal to terrorism? PolitiFact Ohio was interested. Romney's campaign told us that the support for Romney's claim was s 2007 interview on HBO’s "Real Time With Bill Maher." The video clip has been making the rounds on the Internet for years. Maher asked Biden, who was then a candidate for the 2008 presidential nomination, what he thought "is more likely to contribute to the death of your average American: a terrorist strike or high-fructose corn syrup and air that has too much coal in it?" Biden responded: "Air that has too much coal in it, corn syrup next, then a terrorist attack, but -- that is not in any way to diminish the fact that a terrorist attack is real. It is not an existential threat to bringing down the country, but it does have the capacity, still, to kill thousands of people. But hundreds of thousands of people die and their lives are shortened because of coal plants, coal-fired plants and because of corn syrup." Biden was not volunteering a comparison between coal-fired pollution and terrorism, nor was he speculating about "danger." He was answering a direct question about likely causes of death. And, his comment about coal and air pollution was accurate. The American Lung Association issued a report last year, "Toxic Air," which documented the range of hazardous air pollutants emitted from coal-burning power plants. It called for the installation of cleanup technology as the most effective way to reduce them. "Coal-fired power plants produce electricity for the nation’s power grid, but they also produce more hazardous air emissions than any other industrial pollution sources," the report said. "Their emissions threaten the health of people who live near these plants, as well as those who live hundreds of miles away." The Lung Association report said, "Particle pollution from power plants is estimated to kill approximately 13,000 people a year." A similar report with essentially the same conclusion was issued six months earlier for a study commissioned by the Clean Air Task Force, a national nonprofit research and advocacy organization dedicated to air quality and environmental issues. "Fine particle pollution from existing coal plants is expected to cause nearly 13,200 deaths in 2010," the analysis found. "Additional impacts include an estimated 9,700 hospitalizations and more than 20,000 heart attacks per year." The comprehensive study was the third commissioned by the organization, which maintains that adding pollution control technologies to power plants "is not just good for public health; it is also good for the nation’s economy." Possibly because the latest study found that "coal plant emissions of key particle-forming pollutants like sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) have declined significantly over the last several years," its estimate of 13,200 deaths "compares to an estimate of nearly 24,000 deaths per year from existing plants in the 2004 study." The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimated that a proposed air-transport rule to curb sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide from coal-fired power plants would save 14,000 to 36,000 lives a year and help prevent 21,000 cases of bronchitis and 23,000 heart attacks. The lowest of those one-year estimates for the United States is larger than the 2011 worldwide total of deaths, 12,533, that the National Counterrorism Center attributes to terrorism, which U.S. law defines as "premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents." According to the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START) and its Global Terrorism Database (GTD), 2,997 people died in the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. More people died in the 9/11 attacks than in all other U.S. terrorist attacks from 1970 to 2010. Since the 9/11 attacks and through 2010, the most recent year with verified statistics in the GTD, "the total number of individuals killed in attacks in the U.S. is 32," the consortium told us. "Twenty-eight of the 32 were U.S. citizens. The nationalities of the others is unknown. "There were no fatalities (from) 2003 to 2007," the year in which Biden gave his comment. (High-fructose corn syrup is not relevant here. It was not part of Romney's statement, and it was grouped with air pollution as a single unit by the wording of Maher's question, "terrorist strike or high-fructose corn syrup and air.") What does this stack up to? There is an element of truth in Romney's statement. Biden did say -- accurately -- that coal-fired air pollution is more likely to contribute to the death of an average American than is terrorism. But Romney portrayed Biden’s remark as part of "waging war on coal." Rather, PolitiFact found that Biden previously has voiced support for "clean coal," calling for "carbon capture and sequestration technologies that will allow us to use coal cleanly" in the energy plan he released during his presidential campaign in 2007. "Clean coal" is not a type of coal; the phrase refers to a number of technologies, some in use and others early in the development stage, which would allow the burning of coal for energy without the harmful pollution that coal-fired power plants currently emit. Biden's statement was made in response to a question and he was addressing health impacts of coal-fired air pollution -- not making a statement about coal or coal energy. He was not making a comparison between terrorism and coal. Yet, Romney’s comment implies that was the case and portrays Biden’s comment was as part of an administration policy against the coal industry. Those are critical facts that Romney’s claim ignores would give the listener a different impression. On the Truth-O-Meter, that makes it Mostly False.

pomt-09949	Sotomayor thinks "that one’s sex, race and ethnicity ought to affect the decisions one renders from the bench."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/27/judicial-confirmation-network/Sotomayor-comment-Latina-women-versus-white-men/	If you've been following the story of Supreme Court nominee Sonia Sotomayor via cable news, you've undoubtedly heard this sound bite from a 2001 Sotomayor speech: "I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life." For many conservative detractors, the quote has formed the centerpiece of their opposition. In a released statement, Wendy E. Long, counsel to the Judicial Confirmation Network, a conservative nonprofit, said, "Judge Sotomayor is a liberal judicial activist of the first order who thinks her own personal political agenda is more important than the law as written. She thinks that judges should dictate policy, and that one’s sex, race and ethnicity ought to affect the decisions one renders from the bench." Previously, we have looked at the issue of Sotomayor's statement about judges making policy . Here we look at the claim that Sotomayor thinks "that one’s sex, race and ethnicity ought to affect the decisions one renders from the bench." A number of Republicans have expressed concern about the statement. Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., said that due to Sotomayor's comments, the Senate will need to weigh "her ability to rule fairly without undue influence from her own personal race, gender or political preferences." On his blog, Newt Gingrich wrote this about Sotomayor's nomination: "Imagine a judicial nominee said 'my experience as a white man makes me better than a Latina woman' Wouldn't they have to withdraw? New racism is no better than old racism. A white man racist nominee would be forced to withdraw. Latina woman racist should also withdraw." Asked repeatedly about Sotomayor's comments during the daily White House press briefing on May 27, 2009, spokesman Robert Gibbs admonished reporters not to make a judgment on an 8-second sound clip from a 40-minute speech. Gibbs said he was confident that when people looked at the totality of Sotomayor's speech, and the context of the comment in question, they would "come to a reasonable conclusion on this." So we read the whole speech, titled "A Latina Judge's Voice," which was delivered by Sotomayor at the University of California, Berkeley, School of Law in 2001, and was later published in the Spring 2002 issue of Berkeley La Raza Law Journal. The purpose of the speech, she said, was to "talk to you about my Latina identity, where it came from, and the influence I perceive it has on my presence on the bench." She described herself as "Newyorkrican," a born and bred New Yorker of Puerto Rican-born parents, and talked about her close affinity to the Puerto Rican culture as well as her love of America, and how being Latina helped to shape who she is. She then begins to discuss what it will mean to have more women and people of color on the bench. "While recognizing the potential effect of individual experiences on perception, Judge (Miriam) Cedarbaum nevertheless believes that judges must transcend their personal sympathies and prejudices and aspire to achieve a greater degree of fairness and integrity based on the reason of law," Sotomayor said. "Although I agree with and attempt to work toward Judge Cedarbaum's aspiration, I wonder whether achieving that goal is possible in all or even in most cases. And I wonder whether by ignoring our differences as women or men of color we do a disservice both to the law and society. Whatever the reasons why we may have different perspectives, either as some theorists suggest because of our cultural experiences or as others postulate because we have basic differences in logic and reasoning, are in many respects a small part of a larger practical question we as women and minority judges in society in general must address. I accept the thesis of a law school classmate, professor Steven Carter of Yale Law School, in his affirmative action book that in any group of human beings there is a diversity of opinion because there is both a diversity of experiences and of thought." "I further accept that our experiences as women and people of color affect our decisions," Sotomayor said. "The aspiration to impartiality is just that — it's an aspiration because it denies the fact that we are by our experiences making different choices than others." Sotomayor spoke briefly about the contributions of women judges and attorneys in race and sex discrimination cases, while acknowledging that Supreme Courts made up completely of white men have made seminal decisions on those issues. It's in that context that Sotomayor made the statement heard round the world via YouTube. "Whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences ... our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging. Justice O'Connor has often been cited as saying that a wise old man and wise old woman will reach the same conclusion in deciding cases. ... I am ... not so sure that I agree with the statement. First, as professor Martha Minnow has noted, there can never be a universal definition of wise. Second, I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived that life. "Let us not forget that wise men like Oliver Wendell Holmes and Justice Cardozo voted on cases which upheld both sex and race discrimination in our society. Until 1972, no Supreme Court case ever upheld the claim of a woman in a gender discrimination case. I, like professor Carter, believe that we should not be so myopic as to believe that others of different experiences or backgrounds are incapable of understanding the values and needs of people from a different group. Many are so capable. As Judge Cedarbaum pointed out to me, nine white men on the Supreme Court in the past have done so on many occasions and on many issues including Brown ." Sotomayor later concludes that "personal experiences affect the facts that judges choose to see. My hope is that I will take the good from my experiences and extrapolate them further into areas with which I am unfamiliar. I simply do not know exactly what that difference will be in my judging. But I accept there will be some based on my gender and my Latina heritage. ... I can and do aspire to be greater than the sum total of my experiences, but I accept my limitations. I willingly accept that we who judge must not deny the differences resulting from experience and heritage but attempt, as the Supreme Court suggests, continuously to judge when those opinions, sympathies and prejudices are appropriate." You can read the whole speech for yourself right here . Tom Goldstein, a partner at Washington law firm Akin Gump and the founder of ScotusBlog, a widely read blog on the Supreme Court, read the speech and concluded it amounted to little more than Sotomayor acknowledging that judges, like anyone, are products of where and how they grew up. "Having that context can be valuable for a judge," Goldstein said. "There are some cases, like cases of discrimination, where if you have been in someone's shoes, you can better understand it." By way of reminder, we are fact-checking the statement from the Judicial Confirmation Network that Sotomayor's statement shows that she thinks "that one’s sex, race and ethnicity ought to affect the decisions one renders from the bench." We think the key words in that sentence are "ought to." To the contrary, Sotomayor says several times that she agrees judges should aspire to "transcend their personal sympathies and prejudices." However, she acknowledges that we are all informed by our experiences and that "personal experiences affect the facts that judges choose to see." And, she concludes, when it comes to things like race and sex discrimination, that kind of diversity of experience can be an asset. In context, it's clear that Sotomayor isn't suggesting the intellect of Latina women is superior to that of white men, only that a greater diversity of experience and thought would be a valuable addition to the court system. And so we rate the Judicial Confirmation Network's statement Half True.	None	Judicial Confirmation Network	None	None	None	2009-05-27T14:20:33	2009-05-26	['None']

pomt-09520	President Barack Obama's "initial response when we heard about the Christmas underwear bomber" was to say that "this was the act of an isolated extremist."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/15/dick-cheney/cheney-says-obama-initially-said-christmas-day-bom/	In recent weeks, the Obama administration and its Republican critics have been sparring over how to deal with alleged terrorists. The latest round of arguments began Dec. 25, 2009, when a 23-year-old Nigerian national, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, allegedly tried to ignite explosives with material hidden in his underwear while sitting aboard a Northwest Airlines plane bound for Detroit. On Feb. 14, 2010, the former vice president and the current vice president -- Republican Dick Cheney and Democrat Joe Biden -- appeared on the Sunday morning talk shows. Terrorism was a major topic for both. Cheney has often criticized President Barack Obama for not being forceful enough in responding to terrorism, and he has accused Obama of not considering the U.S. to be at war against terrorists (a claim we rated Pants on Fire!). On ABC's This Week, Cheney brought up Obama's initial reaction to the news of the bombing attempt. Cheney charged that the president had at first hastily dismissed the Christmas Day bomb attempt as an "isolated" incident with limited relevance for the broader fight against terrorism: "Well, my reference to the notion that the president was trying to avoid treating this as a war was in relation to his initial response when we heard about the Christmas underwear bomber up in Detroit, when he went out and said this was the act of an isolated extremist. No, it wasn't," Cheney said. "And we found out over time, obviously -- and he eventually changed his assessment -- but that, in fact, this was an individual who'd been trained by al-Qaida, who'd been part of a larger conspiracy, and it was closer to being an act of war than it was the act of an isolated extremist. It's the mind-set that concerns me, John. I think it's very important to go back and keep in mind the distinction between handling these events as criminal acts, which was the way we did before 9/11, and then looking at 9/11 and saying, 'This is not a criminal act,' not when you destroy 16 acres of Manhattan, kill 3,000 Americans, blow a big hole in the Pentagon. That's an act of war." Here we're focusing on whether Cheney was correct to say that Obama's "initial response" to the incident was that it "was the act of an isolated extremist." Cheney was referencing Obama's first official statement after the bombing attempt, delivered to reporters on Dec. 28 while he was vacationing in Kaneohe, Hawaii. In it, the president sought "to take a few minutes to update the American people" on the incident and explain "the steps we're taking to ensure the safety and security of the country." He recounted what had happened on the plane, what his administration was doing to investigate the incident, and what immediate steps would be taken to tighten airport security. Toward the end of his statement, Obama praised the the passengers of the Northwest flight for their quick action in stopping Abdulmutallab. Obama said: "Finally, the American people should remain vigilant, but also be confident. Those plotting against us seek not only to undermine our security, but also the open society and the values that we cherish as Americans. This incident, like several that have preceded it, demonstrates that an alert and courageous citizenry are far more resilient than an isolated extremist. As a nation we will do everything in our power to protect our country, as Americans we will never give in to fear or division, we will be guided by our hopes, our unity, and our deeply held values. That's who we are as Americans. And that's what our brave men and women in uniform are standing up for as they spend the holidays in harm's way, and we will continue to do everything that we can to keep America safe in the New Year and beyond." Whether Cheney's claim is accurate or not depends on how you interpret Obama's reference to "an isolated extremist." Is the president explicitly labeling Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab "an isolated extremist"? Or is this part of Obama's statement a more general attempt to laud bravery by ordinary Americans who find themselves sitting with an "isolated extremist" in their midst? Cheney clearly argues that it's the former. And it's true that, when read literally, Obama did say that "this incident" -- that is, the one in Detroit -- involved "an isolated extremist." (When Obama refers to several other similar incidents that preceded it, we're assuming he's referring to the passenger-foiled "shoe-bombing" by Richard Reid in 2001 and possibly the fighting back by passengers aboard the hijacked United Airlines Flight 93 on Sept. 11, 2001.) Still, we see several pieces of evidence that suggest Obama's point was general and rhetorical, rather than an attempt to characterize the nature of the specific Christmas Day bombing plot. Earlier in the same Dec. 28 statement, Obama indicated that the investigation was still in an early phase. "We do not yet have all the answers about this latest attempt," he said. This call for caution undercuts Cheney's contention that Obama was using his statement to tell Americans that it was definitively "the act of an isolated extremist." Also, Obama said that "a full investigation has been launched into this attempted act of terrorism, and we will not rest until we find all who were involved and hold them accountable." The reference to "all who were involved" also undercuts the notion that Obama viewed Adbulmutallab as "an isolated extremist" without connections to terrorist networks. And it's worth noting that two days earlier, an unnamed White House official was quoted in the Wall Street Journal saying, "We believe this was an attempted act of terrorism." The White House official said the suspect had informed investigators hat he had been given the device by al-Qaida operatives in Yemen, along with detonation instructions. "This guy claims he is tied to al-Qaida, specifically in Yemen," the official said. "He claims he was on orders from al-Qaida in Yemen. Who knows if that's true?" Granted, the White House official expressed uncertainty about whether the claim was true or not. Still, the exchange amounts to an acknowledgment that the White House was considering the possibility that Abdulmutallab was connected to al-Qaida a full two days before Obama made his statement. That would seem to contradict the notion that Obama wanted his listeners to believe that the Christmas Day bomber was simply an "isolated extremist." Ultimately, Cheney is correct that Obama did use the words "an isolated extremist" in his first statement addressing the Christmas Day bombing attempt. But we think it's a stretch for Cheney to say that the phrase signals the president initially believed that Abdulmutallab had acted alone. Obama did expressly say that "we do not yet have all the answers," and he reported that an investigation had been launched that would hold accountable "all who were involved." So we find Cheney is right that Obama used those words, but we find he exaggerates their significance by failing to take into account the other things Obama said. We find Cheney's statement to be Half True.	None	Dick Cheney	None	None	None	2010-02-15T18:45:46	2010-02-14	['None']
pomt-04514	Says Barack Obama "put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/04/mitt-romney/romney-says-ipab-board-can-tell-people-ultimately-/	President Barack Obama’s health care law includes a mighty powerful board that will dictate treatment decisions for Medicare patients, said Mitt Romney at the Oct. 3 debate in Denver. When explaining why he opposed the health care law, Romney said Barack Obama "put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive." He also said this: "And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have." And later: "In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have." Obama refuted Romney’s remark, saying, "Let me just point out first of all this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given." For this fact-check, we will focus on Romney’s statement about whether the unelected board -- formally called the Independent Payments Advisory board, or IPAB for short -- can tell people what kind of treatments they can have. We’ve previously checked a whole slew of claims about the health care law and the IPAB. Many of the variations of Romney’s claim have been in false territory -- depending on the wording -- including a Pants on Fire for Pat Boone who said the board "can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments." (That was one of our Top 5 falsehoods on the health care law.) We gave a Mostly False to Paul Ryan who said that the "unelected, unaccountable" board created by the health care law "will lead to denied care for current seniors." We will note up front that Romney used somewhat softer words than some other critics of the board in that he didn’t use the words "ration" or "unaccountable." IPAB can’t ration care or make decisions for individuals We will borrow from our previous items to explain the board and Romney’s claim. Some of our information comes from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group that studies health care, which put out a primer in 2010 about the board and a longer paper in 2011. The health care law directs a new national board — with 15 members who are political appointees — to identify Medicare savings. It's forbidden from submitting "any recommendation to ration health care," as Section 3403 of the health care law states. It may not raise premiums for Medicare beneficiaries or increase deductibles, coinsurance or co-payments. The IPAB also cannot change who is eligible for Medicare, restrict benefits or make recommendations that would raise revenue. What it can do is reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services, reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of re-admissions or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. Some argue that because the IPAB can reduce the money a doctor receives, this could lead to an indirect form of rationing. But the board wouldn't make any health care decisions for individual Americans. Instead, as PolitiFact Georgia reported, it would make broad policy decisions that affect Medicare's overall cost. For this fact-check, a Romney campaign spokesman sent us a 2011 POLITICO article that largely focused on the challenges of filling the spots on the board, which the headline described as "Medicare cost-cutting job could be worst in D.C." The article mentioned that Republicans have portrayed it as rationing care, but that the law prohibits the board from rationing health care. The Romney campaign also cited the New York Times health care blog Prescriptions, which stated in 2010 that the drug industry, hospitals and doctors’ groups want to get rid of the board. "While the board is not supposed to be able to cut benefits, industry groups fear that its actions would result in rationing care," stated the New York Times blog. "The board, known as IPAB, could cut payments to health care providers." Our ruling When Romney was talking about the Independent Payment Advisory Board and Medicare, he said, Barack Obama "put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive." He avoided the more inaccurate and harsher wording of some other critics, who have falsely described the board as "rationing" care. But Romney’s claim can leave viewers with the impression that the board will sit around a table and talk about whether grandpa can get his bypass or not, and that’s not the case. The board can reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services, reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of re-admissions or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. And there are questions about whether that could lead to different treatment decisions, but Romney's comments give a misleading impression. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-10223	Palin had "executive experience" in the PTA.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/04/john-mccain/palin-was-a-member-but-not-an-officer-of-pta/	It's a line on Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin's resume that likely resonates with a lot of parents: one-time member, PTA. But we wondered if Sen. John McCain overplayed that credential in the days following the announcement that she was his running mate — particularly as questions were being raised about her experience relative to being vice president of the United States. In an interview on NBC's Nightly News , McCain included Palin's involvement with PTA as one of the examples of her "executive experience." "Well, let me just point out, facts are funny things," McCain said. "She's been in elected office longer than Senator Obama. She's been the chief executive of the state that supplies 20 percent of America's energy. She has balanced budgets. She's had executive experience as governor, as mayor, as a city council member and PTA." And in an interview with People magazine, McCain again cited Palin's experience with the PTA when asked what drew him to selecting her. "Obviously, I found her to be very intelligent and very well-versed on the issues," McCain said. "But I think the important thing was that she's a reformer. She's taken on special interests since she ran for the PTA and the city council and mayor. The courage, I guess, is what most impressed me." While admirable, we wondered how much executive experience Palin could actually claim to have gotten by serving on the Iditarod Elementary School PTA, let alone what special interests she may have taken on. Frankly, we were made to feel petty for even asking. Michael Goldfarb of the McCain campaign responded to our request for PTA details with this e-mail: "Of all the smears you could look into against Gov. Palin—that she supported Pat Buchanan (we actually ruled that False ), that she was a member of the Alaska Independence Party, that her baby was really her daughter's — you all want to investigate her career in the PTA? Don't waste our time." But since it was McCain and other campaign staffers who kept touting that service in the PTA, we felt it was fair to flesh it out. Was Palin a PTA president or treasurer? Did she run a successful fundraiser? We largely met with a wall of silence from school district officials. Iditarod Elementary Principal Raymond Marshall said district policy on student privacy prohibited him from confirming or denying that Palin ever served on the PTA there. To do that would confirm that one of her children attended the school, he said. Nevermind that the Palin for Governor Web site listed "Iditarod PTA" under her service organizations. A spokeswoman for the Matanuska-Susitna Borough School District was slightly more forthcoming. But only slightly. "She did serve, probably on more than one PTA," said Public Information Officer Catherine Esary. She said she could not be any more specific. So we called a couple of former Iditarod PTA officers. One former secretary of the Iditarod PTA refused to talk about Palin's PTA involvement saying she didn't want the media to distort anything she had to say. Former Iditarod PTA president Mary Van Buskirk says she remembers that Palin served on the school's PTA, but not as an officer. "She was just one of our members," Van Buskirk said. She did not want to say any more. Al Tamagni Jr., president of the statewide Alaska PTA, was at least able to be a little more definitive about Palin's PTA involvement. After tracking down paper records going back more than a decade, he said, they were able to confirm that Palin was a member of the Iditarod PTA for two years, during the time she served as the mayor of Wasilla. There is no record that Palin ever served as an officer, which is typically listed in the records as well, Tamagni said. "We wouldn't know if she chaired a committee or ran a big program," Tamagni said. For her part, Palin has only said that she "got involved in the PTA." And in her closely watched speech at the Republican National Convention she said, "I was just your average hockey mom and signed up for the PTA." James Martinez, a spokesman for the National PTA, said that parents serving at any level of PTA might get some executive experience. PTA groups follow parliamentary procedures, he said. They pass resolutions. They oversee budgets. Even rank and file members get involved in fundraisers and other school programs, he said. Besides, he said, "I think they are looking at it more from how she got involved with the community. Her community may have been very important to her, like how Barack Obama was a community organizer. It's grassroots advocacy in terms of public service. This was her window into public service." We agree PTA can be hard, important and often thankless work. And principals often credit parental involvement in PTA as crucial to the success of schools. But since it does not appear that Palin served as an officer in PTA (though we acknowledge it's possible she did and folks just won't say) we think it's wrong to count that as executive experience. Without any evidence to support McCain's statement, we rate this one False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-09-04T00:00:00	2008-08-31	['None']
pomt-10590	Mitt Romney previously believed "that abortion should be safe and legal in this country." Now he is "prolife."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/28/john-mccain/romney-has-changed-his-stand-on-abortion/	A new ad from John McCain makes the case that Mitt Romney has not always opposed abortion. Romney has acknowledged that this is the case. When Romney ran for office in Massachusetts — unsuccessfully for U.S. Senate in 1994 and successfully for governor in 2002 — he often said he supported abortion rights. McCain's ad highlights a few of those statements. "I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country," Romney said in a 1994 debate with Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy. In a 2002 debate, Romney said there was no difference between his views and that of his Democratic opponent, Shannon P. O'Brien. "I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose, and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard," Romney said. In 2007, Romney said his views have changed. "And I get tired of people that are holier than thou because they've been prolife longer than I have," he said at a Republican debate on Aug. 5, 2007. ( PolitiFact.com looked at Romney's abortion record previously; check out our stories here and here .) McCain's ad accurately conveys Romney's positions now and during the previous times Romney has run for office. The ad clearly labels which statements were made during which campaign.

pomt-11728	"In Missouri, there are still (FEMA) cases pending from floods that occurred in 2013."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2017/dec/13/vicky-hartzler/open-fema-case-remains-hartzler-exaggerates-amount/	Congresswoman Vicky Hartzler, R-Harrisonville, extolled the virtues of her FEMA Relief Improvement Act on Oct. 30 after it was signed into law by President Donald Trump. The bill’s goal is to increase the reliability of services by the Federal Emergency Management Agency after disasters. In a news release, Hartzler gave an example of the problems the bill attempted to prevent: "In Missouri, there are still (FEMA) cases pending from floods that occurred in 2013." Relentless rain ravaged several Missouri counties in August 2013. But are there really still pending cases from four years ago? The disaster The flooding Hartzler is referring to took place from Aug. 2, 2013, to Aug. 14, 2013. Residents across Missouri were hit by pounding rain, wind and flooding. According to the National Weather Service, rainfall levels reached 8 to 10 inches. Three people died and Interstate 44 was closed in both directions between Rolla and Jerome, which is in Phelps County. On Sept. 6, 2013, former President Barack Obama declared a major disaster in Missouri. This made public assistance available for emergency work and repair of facilities damaged by severe storms, straight-line winds, and flooding in 18 counties: Barry, Camden, Cedar, Dade, Dallas, Laclede, Maries, McDonald, Miller, Osage, Ozark, Phelps, Pulaski, Shannon, Taney, Texas, Webster and Wright. FEMA’s summary damage assessment noted that 381 residences were impacted by the storms: 37 were destroyed, 91 had major damage, 134 had minor damage and 119 were affected. Four years later, $18.5 million has been distributed and all of FEMA’s claims have been resolved except for one county: Pulaski. Pulaski County, the outlier Summoned by Gov. Jay Nixon, FEMA began preparing project worksheets to determine the cost of restoring the county’s damaged water crossings to pre-disaster conditions. The work was done between October 2013 and April 2014. FEMA’s Public Assistance Program helps with response and recovery following a disaster. It specifically assists with debris removal, emergency protective measures and permanent restoration of infrastructure. According to Michael Cappannari, FEMA’s external affairs director, Pulaski County appealed several projects originally denied by FEMA. Following the flooding in 2013, FEMA awarded the county $5.9 million. Pulaski County applied for additional funding again in September of that year. At the time, Pulaski County officials said at least 90 percent of roads were damaged by flooding. While other counties experienced 8 to 10 inches of rain, Pulaski saw 15. To begin the process for additional funding, Pulaski County was expected to submit design plans to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for reconstruction of county bridges. The corps denied the plans because they did not meet permitting requirements. So Pulaski County altered its requests. The Corps of Engineers was happy with the changes, but FEMA decided the plans cost too much. From October 2015 to June 2016, Pulaski County appealed the case. FEMA asked for more information and three alternatives to the plans, among other things. That didn’t work, either. FEMA found that Pulaski County had skewed its hydrological and hydraulic analysis and didn’t provide less costly alternatives. Appeal denied. The second appeal began in March 2017. In November 2017, FEMA granted the appeal for $4.4 million in federal share to the state of Missouri to assist Pulaski County in completing physical work such as bridge and road repair. While Pulaski County received additional funding in November, FEMA will continue the case until all physical repair work is completed. "As you can see, projects from 2013 are still being worked on at this time," said Steve Walsh, Hartzler’s press secretary. Our ruling Hartzler said: "In Missouri, there are still (FEMA) cases pending from floods that occurred in 2013." While most counties in Missouri have had their resolutions to their claims involving flooding in August 2013, Pulaski County has had a long battle with FEMA over funding in the last four years. The approval for the last round of funds went out after Hartzler’s news release at the end of October. Pulaski County is awaiting physical repairs, and FEMA does not close cases until physical repairs are completed. Although what Hartzler said is true, there is only one case that was still pending when she made her comment. Hartzler’s statement sounds as though there are multiple cases that FEMA had not responded to. Her statement is accurate but needs additional information or clarification. So we rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Vicky Hartzler	None	None	None	2017-12-13T20:55:22	2017-10-30	['Missouri']

pomt-03572	"Buono voted 154 times to raise our taxes -- like the sales tax, the income tax, health care taxes, even small business taxes."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/may/19/chris-christie/barbara-buono-voted-increases-taxes-fees-154-times/	The gloves are off. Chris Christie may be more popular than ever, but the Republican isn’t taking any chances with seeking re-election in a majority Democrat state. Witness a new TV ad released Monday by his re-election campaign, Christie for Governor. The ad starts off with pictures of Christie’s Democratic challenger, state Sen. Barbara Buono, as a narrator introduces her as former Gov. Jon Corzine’s budget chair. Buono chaired the Senate’s Budget and Appropriations Committee for two years during Corzine’s tenure. "Buono voted 154 times to raise our taxes -- like the sales tax, the income tax, health care taxes, even small business taxes," the narrator states as text in the commercial states she voted to raise taxes and fees. This ad is a variation on a theme mentioned previously by Christie, and it’s also right on target. First, some background about tax increases. During his State of the State address earlier this year Christie noted that New Jersey saw more than 100 increases in taxes and fees in the eight years before he became governor, which is similar to the new TV ad about Buono, the Democratic challenger in the November gubernatorial race. In addition, state Sen. Tom Kean Jr. (R-Westfield) made a similar claim in an Oct. 7, 2011 news release when he tied 115 votes for tax increases to jobs leaving New Jersey. Kean’s claim was rated Half True. For both previous fact-checks, Republicans provided us with a list that included tax and fee hikes as well as tax policy changes that occurred between fiscal years 2003 and 2010. Now let’s review the 154 increases. The Christie for Governor camp provided us with a list of the 154 increases they claim Buono supported both in the Senate and when she served in the Assembly. We reviewed each vote and found that the list given us mirrors the previous Republican-provided lists, plus additional votes. Although Democrats sponsored most of the bills in question, a few had Republican support. Democrats held legislative majorities in the eight years before Christie became governor. His predecessors during that time were Jim McGreevey, Richard Codey and Corzine. Among the increases were raising the sales tax from 6 percent to 7 percent and applying the tax to services such as tanning and limousine rides; increases in the cigarette tax; and allowing towns to impose parking taxes and surcharges. Also, the state twice increased the gross income tax on New Jerseyans with six-figure incomes: in 2004 for those with income exceeding $500,000 and again in 2009 for those incomes above $400,000. In addition to tax increases were hikes in dozens of fees, such as a new $1.50 fee on the sale of new vehicle tires; imposing fees on certain realty transfers; on hotel/motel occupancies; increases in the minimum casino hotel parking charge; and raising the fee to file for divorce. Overall, the lists provided by Republicans showed that there were dozens of increases in taxes or fees or other tax policy changes that could result in individuals or businesses paying higher taxes. We calculated the votes and confirmed that Buono did vote 154 times in favor of higher taxes and fees. After we shared the list with Buono for Governor spokesman David Turner, we received a list back pointing out cuts that Christie has made to various tax credit rebates and programs; legislation the governor signed resulting in assessments on ambulatory care facilities and insurers; and other legislation signed by Christie allowing government authorities to charge fees. "Barbara Buono has spent her life in public service fighting for New Jersey's middle class and working people," Turner said in an e-mail. "Throughout her career she has pushed to make large corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share and reduce the tax burden on New Jersey's working families. And she has consistently voted to hold lawbreakers accountable—if Governor Christie believes it was wrong to stiffen penalties for deadbeat dads, impose tougher fines on tax cheats and force polluters to help pay for damaging our environment and threatening public health, he should say so." Christie for Governor spokesman Kevin Roberts declined comment. Our ruling A Christie for Governor TV ad claims, "Buono voted 154 times to raise our taxes -- like the sales tax, the income tax, health care taxes, even small business taxes." Although a narrator only mentions tax increases, scrolling text in the ad also mentions fee increases. And in this case, the ad is accurate: Buono did vote on 154 bills that would increase fees and taxes on things ranging from the purchase of new vehicle tires to those New Jerseyans earning six-figure incomes exceeding $400,000. We rate the claim True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2013-05-19T07:30:00	2013-05-13	['None']

pomt-03400	"When I was growing up as a kid in the city of Milwaukee, if we averaged 4 homicides a year in the entire city that was a record number."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jul/03/david-clarke-jr/milwaukee-county-sheriff-david-clarke-says-4-homic/	At a Milwaukee forum entitled "The Second Amendment and the Black Community," two high-profile African Americans with opposing views on firearms spoke of an earlier time they vividly recall as a safer time. Longtime community activist and radio voice Earl Ingram Jr., a critic of concealed carry laws, said his first question to classrooms of city students is always: "How many of you know someone who’s been shot?" "I’ll tell you, 60 to 70 percent and maybe higher will raise their hand," Ingram told an audience at the Community Brainstorming Conference breakfast meeting on June 22, 2013. "And then I think about that question being asked to my generation. If one person raised their hand we would all look at them in disbelief." Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr., who urges citizens to arm themselves to ward off harm, offered his own memories. "When I was growing up as a kid in the city of Milwaukee, if we averaged 4 homicides a year in the entire city that was a record number," said Clarke, 56. "So a lot obviously has gone on since then." A good chunk of the sheriff’s childhood overlapped with the 20-year run of Police Chief Harold Breier as Milwaukee’s top cop. Breier called Milwaukee "the safest city in the nation" just months before retiring in 1984. Clarke went to work in Breier’s MPD as a patrolman in 1978 at the age of 21, and later worked his way up to homicide detective and various command staff positions. He was appointed sheriff in 2002 and has been re-elected since. Is Clarke right that homicides were a rarity when he was growing up? We took a walk back in time through Milwaukee Police crime stats and news stories to get an answer. Clarke declined to discuss his remarks. One of the first news stories we found from the era said that Milwaukee’s 1960 murder rate per capita was lowest of any major city. At the time, Milwaukee was the nation’s 11-largest city (population 741,324). But Clarke’s memory for the frequency of homicides was fuzzy. He recalled "if we averaged 4 homicides a year in the entire city that was a record number." Milwaukee’s lowest annual homicide total in Clarke’s childhood was 12 in 1956, the year he was born. Homicides tallied in the 20s in most of his first 10 years, and then picked up their pace, totaling 36, 46 and 51 before Clarke’s teen years began. And if you include his early teenage years as part of his time as a "kid," the count had risen sharply to 75 in 1973, when Clarke was 17. So, instead of coming in at record-setting lows, as Clarke recalled, homicide was doubling or tripling during his youth. As a point of reference, the figure of 75 was higher than the homicide total in both 2008 and 2009. At the same time, that figure looks low when compared with the early 1990s, when homicides hit 160 as crack cocaine and related violence took hold. The sheriff, we found, would have better made his point about changes in safety by citing per-capita figures and national rankings. PolitiFact Wisconsin ran those numbers in March 2013 when analyzing a dispute over homicide figures used by Clarke and Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn. The picture is much-changed compared with 1960, when that study put the city’s homicide ranking as lowest among the largest cities. For starters, the city’s population is now 598,916, a number that dropped it to the 30th-largest U.S. city. And nationally in 2011, Milwaukee’s homicide rate was fifth highestin the country among cities of 500,000 to 999,000 people. And it was 18th-highest of 73 cities, when cities of 250,000 or more were included. Just looking at Milwaukee over time, the city’s homicide rate in 1960 was eight times lower than the 2010 rate, we found. Our rating Speaking about changes in the crime picture over time, Clarke said, "When I was growing up as a kid in the city of Milwaukee, if we averaged 4 homicides a year in the entire city that was a record number." The sheriff’s memory misfired. In reality, homicides ranged from 12 to 75 during Clarke’s pre-adult years, accelerating at a steady clip. We rate his claim False.	None	David A.

pomt-08621	Roy Barnes "made Georgia dead last in education" and Georgia "led the nation in job losses."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/sep/21/republican-governors-association/tv-ads-clash-barnes-record/	Georgians can watch a new version of grumpy old men on their TV sets. In one version, two gray-haired men are sitting around a table with a red and white checkerboard tablecloth talking about former Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes. "Remember how [Barnes] made Georgia last, dead last, in education?" one says. "Yeah," the other man replies, shaking his head affirmatively. "And remember how Georgia led the nation in job losses?" the first man asks. "Yeah," the other man answers. The 30-second video premiered last week, paid for by the Republican Governors Association. The GOP governors obviously don't want Barnes, the Democratic Party's nominee for governor, back in the job. The big question for AJC PolitiFact Georgia: Are the claims the two men discuss in the ad correct? The Barnes camp obviously doesn't think so. It released a 30-second ad Monday that is clearly a response to the RGA. In the Barnes ad, two graybeards are sitting at a table with the same type of tablecloth dishing about Nathan Deal with the same music in the background. This ad contends Barnes "brought in 235,000 jobs as governor." (AJC PolitiFact Georgia ruled the claim he "created" 235,000 jobs Half True in June.) The men say Barnes reduced classroom sizes in an effort to combat the attack their candidate should get an F in education. "So this Washington guy Deal is lying?" one man asks. "He's slippery as a bag of snakes," the other man replies. They both laugh. Now that we've addressed the theatrics, let's look at the claims that prompted such a quick reply from the Barnes camp. Let's start with the first claim, that Georgia was "dead last in education" when Barnes was governor. Barnes was governor from January 1999 to January 2003. RGA communications director Mike Schrimpf said there were two explanations for the first claim. First, he pointed to a Manhattan Institute report published in 2001 that found Georgia had the lowest high school graduation rate of any state. We found the report and, indeed, it found Georgia was last in graduation rates. The report, however, was about students who graduated in 1998, which was the year before Barnes took office. (Note: The study's authors later noted an error in their graduation rate methodology and said it corrected the mistake.) We decided to look elsewhere for graduation rate data. The National Center for Education Statistics, which is part of the U.S. Department of Education, looked at graduation rates in 2001-02, which included Barnes' last full year as governor. That year, Georgia's rate was 61.1 percent, which ranked 47th, ahead of New York (60.5 percent), Tennessee (59.6 percent) and South Carolina (57.9 percent). Schrimpf noted that Georgia and Florida were tied for the lowest graduation rate among students who graduated in 2001, according to Manhattan Institute research. The RGA's second argument for claiming Georgia was "dead last" in education focuses on SAT scores. In 2002, Barnes' last full year as governor, Georgia ranked last among the nation's 50 states in the average SAT score. Some education scholars said at the time that there are several explanations for Georgia's woeful ranking. Other states had a higher percentage of their best students who took the exam, Gregory Marchant, an educational psychology professor at Indiana's Ball State University, wrote in an op-ed to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Marchant and others also noted warnings that state comparisons using SAT data are invalid. The College Board, which administers the SAT, told PolitiFact Georgia as much when we looked at a candidate's claim that Georgia's SAT scores were lower than neighboring Alabama. "Not all students in a high school, school district or state take the SAT. Since the population of test-takers is self-selected, using aggregate SAT scores to compare or evaluate schools, districts, states or other educational units is not valid, and the College Board strongly discourages such uses," the College Board said in a statement. On the ACT, the other test frequently used as an indicator of college potential, Georgia ranked near the bottom during Barnes' term, which began in 1999 and ended in January 2003. The Peach State was ahead of other Southern states such as Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina in each full year of Barnes' term. We gave outgoing Attorney General Thurbert Baker a Half True rating in June when he used Georgia's SAT scores to claim they "are right at the bottom." So what about the other claim, that Georgia led the nation in job losses? A front-page article in the AJC on Dec. 22, 2001, had the headline "Georgia leads nation in job losses." The story reported that Georgia lost nearly 80,000 jobs during a 12-month stretch, more than any other state, including New York, which suffered through the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. The bulk of Georgia job losses were in the service industry and manufacturing. So are the two men in the RGA commercial right? They were correct about the job losses. The claim about Georgia being "dead last" in education is more troubling. The RGA ad needs more context, such as the College Board's warning, to understand the importance of the SAT rankings. The ACT must also be considered when looking at Georgia's education standing. We rate the RGA commercial on Barnes as Half True.

pomt-12617	"A New York man has allegedly infected 240 people with the HIV virus by sleeping with men and women."	pants on fire!	/new-york/statements/2017/apr/02/blog-posting/story-about-man-spreading-hiv-more-200-people-fake/	A blog post widely shared on social media claims "a New York man has allegedly infected 240 people with the HIV virus by sleeping with men and women." We found the post on Obnoxioustv's Blog but it has appeared on other websites, too. The post says the New York City Police Department seeks to arrest Isaac Don Burks. "Burks, a black gay man from West New York, N.J., just outside Manhattan, who police say may have started his ‘mission to infect as many people as possible’ with HIV as far back as ten years ago, was described as ‘sick in the head’ by one alleged victim, who notes that Burks alluded to having possibly infected as many as 300 victims," according to the post on Obnoxioustv's Blog. "The victim, who did not wish to be publicly identified, recalls that Burks has been on a ‘downward spiral’ since the death of his mother, and plies his prey with drugs and alcohol, to ‘bring their guard down.’ " The post says authorities in New York City are offering up to $100,000 for anyone with information leading to an arrest. The post also claims the New York City Department of Health called this case "the first time a HIV infected individual has spread HIV to so many victims." The story has been shared on several different websites. Facebook flagged a link to the story on Obnoxioustv's Blog as a potential fake news story. The post, first published in 2013, has appeared again recently on social media sites. We could not find any coverage of the story on reputable news sites, and the website’s owner did not reply to our inquiry. Is the post correct that a man has infected as many as 300 people with HIV? The New York City Health Department The post quotes the New York City Health Department urging anyone who may be affected to seek help. We reached out to the department about the story. The department said both the quote and the story are fake. "We can confirm that this story is completely false," the department said in an email. Crime Stoppers The article provided a Crime Stoppers phone number for anyone with information to call. So we called. The number was, indeed, for Crime Stoppers -- but in South Carolina. The operator searched for the name of the alleged offender and his crime for us. A query led to the same article we set out to fact-check, along with a few others. The New York City Police Department runs New York City Crime Stoppers. The Police Department did not respond to our inquiry about the story, so we called the New York City Crime Stoppers line. The operator advised us not to share the article on social media. "We haven’t heard anything about that," the operator said. The New York City Crime Stoppers website has not listed anyone wanted by the name of Isaac Don Burks for at least the last six years. The organization has not sought anyone for a crime similar to the one alleged online. Our ruling A website alleges a man has set out to infect as many people with HIV as possible and has infected up to 300 people already. The article is fake. The New York City Health Department says it is made up. Authorities in New York City are not seeking Burks or anyone for such an allegation. It’s fake news. Pants on Fire! PolitiFact New York examined the origins of this claim as part of the inaugural International Fact-Checking Day, April 2, 2017. Organizers at Poynter.org describe the day as "not a single event but a rallying cry for more facts - and fact-checking - in politics, journalism, and everyday life."

pomt-10781	In 2006, Arizona had four ballot issues that were "very tough on illegal immigration... Forty-seven percent of the Hispanics in Arizona voted for them."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/16/tom-tancredo/well-hes-right-on-one-of-the-four/	Here's full quote from Rep. Tom Tancredo's interview: "In Arizona, in the last election, what we saw was a really amazing thing, that they had four issues on the ballot in Arizona, all of them were very tough on illegal immigration, one was an English only, I think, amendment of some sort. There were four issues, 47 percent of the Hispanics in Arizona voted for them. And by the way, they all passed overwhelmingly. So you cannot say that it is a monolithic voting bloc." The congressman goes beyond the facts at hand to make his point that not all Hispanics vote the same. This much is true. In the 2006 election, there were four issues on the ballot related to immigration. Politifact found that 48 percent of Hispanic voters in Arizona supported Proposition 103, which requires all formal state government action to be in English, with some exemptions. That's according to Edison Media Research, which conducts exit polling for the national election pool, including CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox and the Associated Press. But as far as the three other immigration measures on the Arizona ballot that fall, we don't know how Hispanics voted. Edison didn't poll on those, and neither did anyone else we could find. "He's taking our number and extrapolating to four propositions," said Joe Lenski, executive vice president of Edison Media Research. "We can't support that. . . . He's accurate on the one, but the other three he's guessing." Tancredo is correct that all four measures passed overwhelmingly, each by at least 71 percent of the overall vote. Tancredo's campaign offered no supporting information for his statement about how Hispanics voted on those issues, but suggested we call the Arizona Secretary of State's office. We did. Deputy Secretary of State Kevin Tyne said, "We're precluded from tracking that kind of information." But just to be sure there wasn't another source for Tancredo's numbers, we talked to Quin Monson, assistant director at the Center for the Study of Elections and Democracy at Brigham Young University; to John A. Garcia, a University of Arizona political science professor who has done extensive polling of Hispanics; to Earl de Berge, research director at the Behavior Research Center, a public opinion firm in Phoenix; and to Fred Solop, a Northern Arizona University political science professor and pollster. Not one knew of data to support Tancredo's statement. So, applying one correct statistic to four different ballot questions rates a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11700	Says Texas Department of Public Safety numbers show that 1.6 percent of crime is committed by unauthorized immigrants.	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/dec/21/lupe-valdez/lupe-valdez-says-unauthorized-immigrants-account-1/	Long before Democrat Lupe Valdez declared her candidacy for governor, she differed with Republican incumbent Greg Abbott over the change in law put in place by Texas lawmakers this year to bar local communities from harboring immigrants living in the country illegally. The state’s sanctuary cities bar, which as of December 2017 remained partially blocked by a federal judge’s ruling under state appeal, empowers local police officers to inquire into a person’s immigration status during routine encounters such as traffic stops. The law also requires local law enforcement to cooperate with federal immigration agents and to go along with detention requests placed on inmates suspected of illegal immigration. Senate Bill 4 imposes stiff fines and criminal charges on government officials who choose to ignore it. In July 2017, according to a Dallas Morning News story, Abbott defended the law before the Sheriff’s Association of Texas, saying it "would remove from the streets dangerous criminals, not detain hardworking families and innocent children. I appreciate the strong support the law has received from so many sheriffs across Texas," Abbott said. That story also quoted Valdez, then Dallas County’s fourth-term sheriff, calling the law a political tool to attack vulnerable Texans. "Throughout history, we've had a vulnerable group to pick on," Valdez said. "Now it seems to be Hispanics," Valdez said. Valdez further said that Texas Department of Public Safety numbers show that only 1.6 percent of crime is committed by unauthorized immigrants, according to the story. National research suggests that residents living in the U.S. without legal permission don’t account for a lot of crime. But we fell short of eliciting a full unpacking from Valdez about how she reached the 1.6 percent statistic nor did we independently find a way to confidently settle on a specific percentage. Seeking Valdez's factual backup After Valdez resigned as sheriff to launch her bid for governor, we asked how she reached the 1.6 percent figure. By email, a campaign aide, Kiefer Odell, pointed us to Valdez’s Dec. 10, 2015 testimony before the Texas House Committee on State Affairs. At Odell’s nudge, we watched the Texas Legislative Council’s video of the hearing, which opened with the panel chairman, Rep. Byron Cook, R-Corsicana, saying that according to the DPS, "there are over 176,000 criminal immigrants that have been booked into our local Texas jails between 2011 and 2015" on almost 500,000 criminal charges, Cook said, including homicide, sexual assault, kidnapping, burglary, theft and robbery "and," Cook said, "these are only those that are reported crimes. "Clearly this presents a public safety crisis in our state," Cook said before going on to say that legislators would focus in advance of the 2017 session on legislation to restrict sanctuary cities. Valdez challenged the need for such legislation while stressing that the Dallas County sheriff’s office was complying with individual federal requests to detain individuals suspected of living in the country without permission. "Jails should be for people we’re afraid of," Valdez testified, "not for people we’re upset with." She also said: "The undocumenteds are no more likely to commit crimes than our native-born citizens." A legislator asked Valdez to speak to her foundation for the latter statement. The sheriff replied: "Well, as you heard before, the director said 170,000 crimes were committed by undocumenteds in four years. That’s out of 11 million 100,000 and something. And when you bring that right down, it came out to 1.76 percent, and we rounded off to 1.8 percent of the crimes committed in Texas during the same time period. "So under 2 percent of the crimes were committed, that we have record of, for all, either documented or undocumented, it was 2 percent of the actual crimes," Valdez said. We asked Odell to share the source and significance of the 11.1 million figure offered by Valdez toward reaching her conclusion that less than 2 percent of Texas crimes from 2011-15 could be attributed to unauthorized residents. We didn’t hear back on that. DPS spokesman points to a web page We also queried the DPS about Valdez’s "1.6 percent" claim; spokesman Tom Vinger offered no comment though he pointed by email to an undated DPS web page, "Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data," lacking in information that in itself would confirm or invalidate Valdez’s claim. As of December 2017, the page said that more than 238,000 "criminal aliens" had been booked into Texas county jails from June 2011 through November 2017 and those booked individuals had, in their respective lives, accumulated 632,000 criminal charges. There was no data on the DPS web page about other arrested or convicted residents and no estimate of the share of arrests accumulated by unauthorized U.S. residents. A cautionary note about the DPS presentation: A "criminal alien," the Government Accountability Office notes, is a non-citizen convicted of a crime who may be lawfully or unlawfully living in the country. This definition makes it likely that not everyone described in the DPS summary was living in the U.S. illegally, which makes it hard to decipher what to make of the counts on the page. Rough calculations Hoping for other insights into the share of people living here illegally who commit crimes, we reached out to other criminal justice experts. By email, Austin-based Tony Fabelo, a researcher for the Council of State Governments Justice Center, offered a back-of-the-envelope approach to gauging Valdez’s claim using the posted DPS numbers. Fabelo wrote that annualizing DPS’s tally of more than 238,000 "criminal aliens" booked into jails over six-plus years, as posted as of December 2017, suggests a rate of 39,000 such bookings a year. "Not all arrests lead to a jail booking, but let us assume they do," Fabelo said. That in mind, he went on, the DPS for 2016 separately reported more than 758,000 adult arrests for criminal offenses in the state. So, Fabelo said, bookings of unauthorized residents may have accounted for about 5 percent of all such adult arrests--a figure exceeding Valdez’s declared percentage (though this rough figure, we noticed, also couldn’t account for the fact that not all "criminal aliens" are living in the country without legal permission). Next, we applied the same methodology to a figure that Valdez noted in her 2015 testimony. In the five years from 2011 through 2015, annual DPS crime reports indicate there were 4,389,998 adults arrested in Texas for criminal offenses--making it possible to say, we calculated, that the 170,000 Cook-described arrests of "criminal immigrants" amounted to about 4 percent of all the adult arrests in the state. Now if Cook was referring only to arrests from 2011 to 2015--his comment at the hearing was unclear on the timeframe--then we calculated that the 170,000 "criminal immigrants" may have accounted for 4.7 percent of 3,613,691 total adult arrests from 2011 through 2014. But absent expert analysis, we wouldn't brandish these conclusions as facts. National research Precise percentages aside, PolitiFact researchers have found that unauthorized residents don’t account for more crime than other residents. In August 2017, most recently, PolitiFact California followed on a 2016 PolitiFact fact-check and found Mostly True a claim that undocumented immigrants commit less crime than native Americans. That fact-check noted a 2015 National Academy of Sciences study that cited another outfit’s report including, we noticed, a 1.6 percent reference, though the figure in this instance reflected on male immigrants only. Let’s revisit it. The July 2015 report from the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant nonprofit, generally states that U.S. Census Bureau data support the conclusion that immigrants are less likely than native-born Americans to be behind bars, though the report doesn’t present figures limited to unauthorized residents. "According to an original analysis of data from the 2010 American Community Survey (ACS) conducted by the authors of this report, roughly 1.6 percent of immigrant males age 18-39 are incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born," the report says. "This disparity in incarceration rates has existed for decades, as evidenced by data from the 1980, 1990, and 2000 decennial censuses. In each of those years, the incarceration rates of the native-born were anywhere from two to five times higher than that of immigrants." The report also delves into crime in Texas cities: "The most thoroughly studied aspect of this phenomenon has been the drop in rates of violent crime since the early 1990s in cities that have long been ‘gateways’ for immigrants entering the United States, such as Miami, Chicago, El Paso, San Antonio, and San Diego. However, the inverse relationship between immigration and crime is also apparent in ‘new’ immigrant gateways, such as Austin, where rates of both violent crime and serious property crime have declined despite high levels of new immigration. Declining rates of property crime have also been documented in metropolitan areas across the country. Some scholars suggest that new immigrants may revitalize dilapidated urban areas, ultimately reducing violent crime rates." Walter A. Ewing, a senior researcher for the council, told PolitiFact in 2016 that immigrants come to the U.S. to build better lives for themselves and their children. "They are very motivated to not blow that opportunity by getting in trouble with the police," Ewing said. "This is especially so for unauthorized immigrants, who can be deported at any time for unlawful presence." We asked Ewing to speak to Valdez’s 1.6 percent claim. By email, Ewing said he didn’t know "of any source of information that would allow that precise of an estimate of the share of crime attributable to undocumented immigrants. If there is a solid source for those numbers, I’d love to know what it is," Ewing wrote. The council’s conclusion was echoed in a 2017 report from the libertarian Cato Institute stating, in part, that U.S. "immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than natives relative to their shares of the population. Even illegal immigrants are less likely to be incarcerated than native-born Americans," Cato said. To be specific, the report said that in 2014, per Cato’s analysis rooted in the ACS, illegal immigrants aged 18 to 54 were 44 percent less likely to be incarcerated than natives in the age group. That report also took note of a February 2016 Texas Tribune news story that drew on information obtained from the Texas Department of Criminal Justice to estimate that 4.6 percent of Texas inmates were illegal immigrants upon whom federal authorities had placed detainer requests. At about that time, the story said, an estimated 1.7 million illegal immigrants comprised 6.3 percent of the state’s population. We also asked Cato analyst Alex Nowrasteh to review Valdez’s claim. By phone, Nowrasteh said it looked to him like some figures may have gotten confused. The 11.1 million number Valdez offered at the House committee hearing, Nowrasteh said, might trace to a widely-cited estimate of 11 million illegal immigrants living in the U.S. in 2015, which was down from an estimated 11.3 million in 2009. Generally, Nowrasteh said, "the government has been stingy about releasing facts about immigrants and crime. There’s no excuse for not releasing all the facts and data. It should be easy for the public to look up." Our ruling Valdez said DPS numbers show that 1.6 percent of crime is committed by unauthorized immigrants. We didn’t find DPS figures or an understandable methodology to support a specific "1.6 percent" conclusion--nor did we work up what we’d consider a solid alternate estimate. Relevant data seems to be unavailable. Still, national research supports Valdez's point that people living in the U.S. illegally account for little crime. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-13218	"Zephyr Teachout says she is against Super PACs despite taking money from Super PAC donors"	true	/new-york/statements/2016/oct/20/national-republican-congressional-committee/some-teachouts-donors-also-gave-super-pacs/	Zephyr Teachout has been a vocal opponent of super PACs. For a short time last year the Democrat even headed a super PAC whose goal was to end all super PACs. But the National Republican Congressional Committee said that hasn’t stopped her from accepting contributions from those who gave to Super PACs. "Zephyr Teachout says she is against Super PACs despite taking money from Super PAC donors," the NRCC wrote in a blog post. Getting big money out of politics has been a central theme of her campaign to represent the 19th Congressional District, located in New York State’s Hudson Valley and Catskills regions, like it was when she ran for governor in 2014. Super PACs are able to accept and spend unlimited amounts of money in elections. Is the National Republican Congressional Committee right? Has her campaign accepted money from super PAC donors? Teachout’s donors The National Republican Congressional Committee names 16 people it says donated to Teachout’s campaign and to super PACs. We found the donors in Teachout’s campaign finance filings. Altogether, the 16 donors have given $67,300 to Teachout. That’s about 2 percent of the $3.2 million she has raised, according to her latest filing. The 16 Teachout contributors who gave money to super PACs contributed at least $61 million to super PACs. Two donated $10,000 or less to super PACs. In 2016, seven of the donors gave to super PACs. The other nine did not. Among the 16 donors are billionaire George Soros and members of his family. Super PAC support Teachout has received backing from one super PAC: National Nurses United. It reported spending almost $47,000 in digital ad buys for the Democrat this year. Teachout's campaign says Faso has received more help from super PACs. New York Wins reported spending close to $1 million in ads and mailers against his primary opponent. The group has not reported spending anything against Teachout. Another super PAC, Congressional Leadership Fund, spent more than $2.7 million against Teachout in mail and media placement since the June primary. "You know I’m running against John Faso, but we’re really running against super PACs," Teachout said at a campaign event in August. Our ruling In a series of blog posts, the National Republican Congressional Committee said "Zephyr Teachout says she is against Super PACs despite taking money from Super PAC donors." We cross-checked 16 donors to Teachout’s campaign with their donations to super PACs. We found all of them also donated to super PACs.

pomt-12980	"It is more difficult to obtain a Costco membership than it is to get a NYC Municipal ID"	pants on fire!	/new-york/statements/2016/dec/21/ron-castorina-jr/getting-costco-membership-not-easier-getting-nyc-m/	It takes a membership card to shop at a Costco warehouse store. There are 87.3 million Costco cardholders around the world - some of whom shop at the company’s New York City locations. Municipal identification cards are also common in the wallets of New York City residents. The New York City identification card gives them access to city programs and services and helps when it comes to renting an apartment, opening a bank account or complying with a police officer who asks for identification. So which card is harder to get? State Assemblyman Ron Castorina Jr., R-Staten Island, called the vetting process for a New York City ID card weak with "little to no integrity." "It is more difficult to obtain a Costco membership than it is to get a NYC Municipal ID," Castorina said in a press release. Castorina is one of two state lawmakers who filed a lawsuit to preserve supporting documents submitted to get New York City IDs. When New York City lawmakers created the municipal ID program last year, the statute allowed the city to destroy documents that could identify applicants. The aim was to protect undocumented immigrants from federal immigration authorities. Until now, the city has stored the information. But city officials say starting next year, ahead of the inauguration of President-elect Donald J. Trump, they will no longer hold on to documents submitted by applicants. Castorina and Assemblywoman Nicole Malliotakis, also a Republican from Staten Island, want the city to hold onto the documents because they may help law enforcement agencies in any investigations. So is Castorina right? Is it easier to get a Costco membership? To find out, we went through the application process. Signing up for Costco You can apply for membership online or in any of the company’s 723 warehouse stores around the world. We chose to apply online. The application requires your name, address, date of birth, email address and phone number. Members can share their membership with others in their households, but have to provide their name, dates of birth, and contact information as well. The online form takes less than five minutes to complete. After completing the form, applicants enter their credit card information to purchase the membership online. Membership options range from $55 to $110. Members pay to renew the membership each year. Once the payment is accepted, Costco sends an email with a membership number. This can take from 10 minutes to 24 hours, a company customer service representative said. After receiving the email, the customer copies the membership number down and brings it along on the first visit to the Costco store. Customers must bring a photo ID on their initial visit. Otherwise, the store will not hand over the membership card. Customers who opt for the business membership also have to bring either a business license or three pieces of business ID, which can include anything from a business card to an electric bill. Customers do not have to provide a proof of residency. The store’s customer service line says customers can complete the entire process in less than one day. Signing up for a New York City ID For a New York City ID, residents can either print out an application or fill one out at an enrollment center. Every borough has at least one center, and some have more. The one-page application asks for the resident’s name, address, date of birth, gender, eye color, height, and contact information. There’s also an option to register as an organ donor, select a preferred language, and designate an emergency contact. The form takes less than 10 minutes to complete. Applicants then must schedule an appointment at one of the enrollment centers. Most centers are not open every day, and at least one has appointments booked through the end of January according to the scheduling website. Residents can also call the city’s government 311 helpline to schedule an appointment. Residents have to submit up to four identifying documents with their application. One of the documents has to have a photo, one has to show the applicant’s date of birth, and one has to show the applicant lives in New York City. A representative from the city’s 311 helpline said a few forms of ID, like one from the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles, are enough to prove residency and identity. Homeless people or survivors of domestic violence who do not have a permanent address have to bring a letter from either the shelter where they are staying or from a city agency, nonprofit organization, religious institution, hospital, or health clinic. If the application is approved at the center, the staff will take the resident’s photo for the ID. If they have an address, they will get it in the mail less than two weeks later. If they don’t have an address, the ID will be sent to the enrollment center where they applied. Our ruling Castorina, the assemblyman from Staten Island, claimed in a press release that "it is more difficult to obtain a Costco membership than it is to get a NYC Municipal ID." Getting a membership at Costco requires an application and a photo ID on your first visit to the store. A municipal ID in New York City requires more documentation and takes longer to process. The only obstacle to getting a Costco membership that might make it more difficult for some people is the cost. The New York City ID card is free. A Costco membership starts at $55 annually.

pomt-03644	"The Internal Revenue code has ballooned to a 5,600-page, 4 million-word complicated mess that is seven times as long as the Bible with none of the good news."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/may/02/leonard-lance/leonard-lance-claims-federal-tax-code-contains-4-m/	The U.S. Internal Revenue code may make War and Peace read like a novella. That’s how onerous and confounding the nation’s tax code is, according to Rep. Leonard Lance (R-7th), who issued a news release April 15 calling for "meaningful tax reform" and blasting the complexity of the tax code. "The Internal Revenue code has ballooned to a 5,600-page, 4 million-word complicated mess that is seven times as long as the Bible with none of the good news," Lance said in the news release. But not all the news is bad for Lance. Let’s first review the size of the tax code and then compare that with the size of the Bible. A 2010 report by the Internal Revenue Service’s Taxpayer’s Advocate Office found that the tax code contained 3.8 million words. That calculation was made by downloading a zipped file of the code, unzipping it and running it through Microsoft Word’s word-count feature, according to a footnote in the report. A 2012 version of the report puts the number of words in the code at ‘about 4 million.’ We also reached out to CCH, the Riverwoods, Ill.-based publisher of the two-volume 2013 Winter version of the tax code and was told the best estimate of word length was 4 million. CCH is a Wolters Kluwer business. So Lance’s claim about the number of words is generally accurate. Next, let’s look at number of pages. Lance said 5,600, based on the same figure cited by articles in the Washington Post, the Harvard Business Review and other publications, according to Todd Mitchell, Lance’s chief of staff. Mark Luscombe, a principal federal tax analyst for CCH, said the publisher’s version of the tax code is 5,036 pages. "Private publishers do a print version of the Internal Revenue code, but then you’re looking at one private publisher’s version of the code," he said. "We do it in two volumes and we keep condensing it." The key point here? Letter size, font and spacing matter when counting pages in the tax code and even in the Bible. Dennis Olson, the Charles T. Haley professor of Old Testament Theology at the Princeton Theological Seminary said an approximation of 800,000 words for the Old and New testaments combined is fair. "The King James Version would be 823,156 while the more recent New Revised Standard Version would be 774,746 words," Olson said in an e-mail. Hellen Mardaga, an assistant professor of New Testament at Catholic University in Washington, said there’s no standard way to measure the size of the Bible, given its numerous translations and texts but said she, too, was aware of estimates that put the Bible at 800,000 words. Mardaga also noted that dividing 4 million – the number of words in the tax code – by 800,000 - would mean the tax code is five times longer than the Bible -- not Lance’s seven. We looked at versions of the King James and New American Standard versions of the Bible on Amazon.com, an online retailer of books and other merchandise. The four Bibles we looked at ranged in size from 512 pages to 1,112. Accordingly, Mitchell said he has seen numerous references comparing the size of the tax code with the Bible, ranging from 4 times as long to 10 times as long. Seven, he said, is in the middle. "It all depends on what version (of the Bible) you have in front of you," he said. "I’m not sure there’s a right or wrong answer to the question." Our ruling Lance said, "The Internal Revenue code has ballooned to a 5,600-page, 4 million-word complicated mess that is seven times as long as the Bible with none of the good news." It’s generally accepted that the code is about 4 million words in length, according to previous published reports and the publisher of the 2013 winter version of the tax code. Lance also based his figure of 5,600 pages on previous reports from publications such as the Harvard Business Review. Opinions also differ on the code’s length when compared with the Bible, given the many versions, translations and texts of it. And while the tax code isn’t seven times as long as the Bible, even given a standard word count for the good book, we get Lance’s overall point: the tax code is long and complex. We rate his claim Mostly True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.	None	Leonard Lance	None	None	None	2013-05-02T07:30:00	2013-04-15	['Bible']

pomt-07869	Twelve judges have thrown out legal challenges to the health care law because they rejected "the notion that the health care law was unconstitutional."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/08/barack-obama/president-obama-says-12-judges-have-rejected-notio/	Ever since a federal judge in Florida ruled the health care law unconstitutional, the White House has portrayed the opinion as an outlier made by an activist judge. Many other judges have come to a different conclusion, the argument goes. This was the tack President Barack Obama took in a pre-Super Bowl interview with Fox News' Bill O'Reilly, who asked about the recent Florida ruling. "Well, I think the judge in Florida was wrong," Obama said. "Keep in mind that we've had 12 judges said -- that just threw this case out -- the notion that the health care law was unconstitutional." Obama's point was clear: The Florida case got the headlines, but courts are still overwhelmingly ruling with Obama on the key question of constitutionality. We asked the White House for some backup on the claim about the 12 dismissed cases, and they provided a list that we've appended to the bottom of this article. The White House is correct they were dismissed, but they were dismissed for procedural reasons, often because the judges concluded the plaintiffs either lacked proper standing or jurisdiction to bring the lawsuit. The judges did not opine on the merits of these cases, such as whether the law is constitutional. They dismissed the cases for a variety of reasons: in some, the argument was that the plaintiff's lacked standing because the individual mandate portion of the law (which requires people to have health insurance) had not yet kicked in. It goes into effect in 2014. In other cases, the judges said the plaintiffs lacked standing because they did not establish that they would be injured by the law. Besides the judges who dismissed 12 cases on procedural grounds, four judges have ruled on the merits of various cases challenging the health care law. Two ruled in favor of the administration and two against: Thomas Moore Law Center vs. Barack Hussein Obama On Oct. 7, 2010, U.S. District Judge George Steeh, a Bill Clinton appointee to the Eastern District of Michigan, ruled that Congress has the right to impose the individual mandate portion of the health care law under the Commerce Clause of the constitution. "The health care market is unlike other markets," Steeh wrote. "No one can guarantee his or her health, or ensure that he or she will never participate in the health care market ... "In this case, the minimum coverage provision of the Health Care Reform Act contains two provisions aimed at the same goal," Steeh wrote. "Congress intended to increase the number of insureds and decrease the cost of health insurance by requiring individuals to maintain minimum essential coverage or face a penalty for failing to do so. Because the 'penalty' is incidental to these purposes, plaintiffs' challenge to the constitutionality of the penalty as an improperly apportioned direct tax is without merit." Score one for the constitutionality of the health care law. Liberty University vs. Timothy Geithner In an opinion handed down on Nov. 30, 2010, in the Western District of Virginia, U.S. District Judge Norman Moon, a Clinton appointee, also ruled the law constitutional under the Commerce Clause, the constitutional principle that allows the federal government to regulate commerce. "I hold that there is a rational basis for Congress to conclude that individuals' decisions about how and when to pay for health care are activities that in the aggregate substantially affect the interstate health care market," Moon wrote. "Nearly everyone will require health care services at some point in their lifetimes, and it is not always possible to predict when one will be afflicted by illness or injury and require care.… "Far from 'inactivity,' by choosing to forgo insurance, Plaintiffs are making an economic decision to try to pay for health care services later, out of pocket, rather than now, through the purchase of insurance. As Congress found, the total incidence of these economic decisions has a substantial impact on the national market for health care by collectively shifting billions of dollars on to other market participants and driving up the prices of insurance policies." So the first two decisions on the constitutional merits went Obama's way. But the next two did not. Commonwealth of Virgina vs. Kathleen Sebelius In a ruling filed on Dec. 13, 2010, U.S. District Judge Henry E. Hudson, a President George W. Bush appointee, wrote that "despite laudable intentions of Congress in enacting a comprehensive transformative health care regime, the legislative process must still operate within constitutional bounds." "Neither the Supreme Court nor any federal circuit court of appeals has extended Commerce Clause powers to compel an individual to involuntarily enter the stream of commerce by purchasing a commodity in the private market," Hudson wrote. "In doing so, the enactment of the Minimum Essential Coverage provision exceeds the Commerce Clause powers vested in Congress under Article I." Hudson struck down the individual mandate, but upheld the rest of the law. State of Florida vs. United States Department of Health and Human Services This ruling made the biggest headlines. In a case brought by 26 states challenging the health care law, Senior U.S. District Judge Roger Vinson of Pensacola, Fla., a Ronald Reagan appointee, issued a sweeping ruling on Jan. 31., 2011, that the individual mandate is unconstitutional and so entwined with the rest of the law that the entire thing should be thrown out. "In the final analysis, this Act has been analogized to a finely crafted watch, and that seems to fit. It has approximately 450 separate pieces, but one essential piece (the individual mandate) is defective and must be removed," Vinson wrote. "It cannot function as originally designed. There are simply too many moving parts in the Act and too many provisions dependent (directly and indirectly) on the individual mandate and other health insurance provisions -- which, as noted, were the chief engines that drove the entire legislative effort -- for me to try and dissect out the proper from the improper, and the able-to-stand-alone from the unable-to-stand-alone. Such a quasi-legislative undertaking would be particularly inappropriate in light of the fact that any statute that might conceivably be left over after this analysis is complete would plainly not serve Congress' main purpose and primary objective in passing the Act. The statute is, after all, called "The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act," not "The Abstinence Education and Bone Marrow Density Testing Act." The Act, like a defectively designed watch, needs to be redesigned and reconstructed by the watchmaker." There are other cases pending, as well as appeals on nearly all of the cases listed above. But here's the score so far: 12 cases dismissed for procedural reasons 2 cases in favor of the Obama administration on the merits (both judges had been appointed by Democrats) 2 cases against the Obama administration on the merits (both judges had been appointed by Republicans) All sides agree that the issue will ultimately be decided by the Supreme Court. Back to Obama's statement, "Keep in mind that we've had 12 judges said -- that just threw this case out -- the notion that the health care law was unconstitutional." The president's statement "very clearly implies the judges have said it's not unconstitutional," said legal commentator Stuart Taylor Jr. "This is highly misleading White House spin. A ruling on standing is never a ruling on whether the underlying law is constitutional or not." Avram Goldstein, a spokesman for Health Care for America Now, said the point is that despite all the media attention given to the Florida court decision, "This one case is not the be-all and end-all." The judges in the 12 cases listed by the White House may not have weighed in on the constitutionality issue, Golstein said, "but if a judge throws it out for procedural reasons, you lost." Kate Bedingfield, a spokeswoman for the White House, made a similar argument. "Twelve lawsuits challenging the law's constitutionality have been dismissed," Bedingfield said. "That’s a fact, and that is the point the president was making." We disagree. Obama said the 12 judges dismissed the cases because they disagreed with the claim that the health care law was unconstitutional. They did not. They dismissed the cases because of procedural grounds. We find his claim False. Appendix: 12 Cases Cited by the White House (PolitiFact added links to the cases and rulings that we could find online) Archer v.

pomt-03226	"According to a recent Congressional Budget Office report, under Obamacare, 7 million people will lose their employer-sponsored insurance."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2013/aug/19/ted-cruz/cruz-claim-about-fewer-americans-employer-backed-h/	Texas U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, who has championed Republican efforts to stop the Obamacare law from rolling out, says some workers will lose employer-supported health plans under the law. In an Aug. 12, 2013, commentary, Cruz initially noted that President Barack Obama, who signed the Affordable Care Act known as Obamacare into law in 2010, said that under the law, Americans who like their health coverage could keep it. But that’s not so, Cruz said, adding: "According to a recent Congressional Budget Office report, under Obamacare, 7 million people will lose their employer-sponsored insurance." By email, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said he was drawing on the non-partisan office’s latest 10-year budget outlook forecast. The CBO's report, issued Feb. 5, 2013, does not say how many workers are poised to lose employer-backed coverage. But a multi-tiered chart pointed out by Frazier indicates that as soon as 2017, the number of people who have employer-backed plans will be down seven million from the 162 million Americans who would have such coverage that year if Obamacare were not law. Similarly, three million fewer individuals will be enrolled in group health plans, including Medicare, that year than if Obamacare were not law, the chart indicates. More broadly, the chart also shows that fewer workers will have employer-supported plans in every year from 2014 through 2023 than if there had been no Obamacare law. Then again, the chart shows more workers having employer-backed plans in all but one year of the decade than the 154 million listed as having such coverage in 2013. Some 155 million people will have such plans through 2015, according to the chart, with 154 million people having one in 2016. A greater total of workers will have such coverage through 2019, according to the chart, when 167 million people will be so enrolled; the workers in such plans is predicted to decrease to 158 million in 2020 before edging to 160 million in 2022 and 2023. More broadly, the chart signals a surge in health coverage. By 2017, according to the chart, there will be 27 million fewer uninsured citizens than if the law had not changed. The same year, 11 million more people will be enrolled in Medicaid or state Children’s Health Insurance Plans than if Obamacare were not law, the chart says, and 26 million more people will have health plans purchased through insurance exchanges, lately called marketplaces. Under the law, individuals seeking coverage will be able to shop via online exchanges, or marketplaces, which are scheduled to debut in October 2013 before the law requires most citizens to have health coverage starting in 2014. By email, Frazier said the upshot remains that seven million Americans "will drop their current coverage" with the point "being that the people are losing their options and being thrown into exchanges that will not offer the same plans they have now." On Feb. 8, 2013, CNN posted a news story noting that the prediction that seven million people would lose or drop their employment-based coverage amounted to an increase from four million as estimated by the office in August 2012. The story said, though, that workers "who lose that coverage won't all be joining the ranks of the uninsured or the unemployed... Many are expected to shift into the health insurance exchanges. The number of people participating in those exchanges is projected to grow from seven million in 2014 -- the first year they'll be available -- to 24 million in 2016," CNN said, recapping figures in the CBO chart. The CBO report provides a little elaboration, stating that the increase to seven million from four million was largely due to a big decision made after its previous forecast: Congress and President Barack Obama extended, rather than letting expire, most tax cuts passed into law under President George W. Bush. A footnote to the report’s chart states the expected number of people with employment-based plans reflects the "net result of increases in and losses of offers of health insurance from employers and changes in enrollment by workers and their families." It’s complicated: "For example," the footnote continues, "in 2019, an estimated 12 million people who would have had an offer of employment-based coverage under prior law will lose their offer under current law, and another 3 million people will have an offer of employment-based coverage but will enroll in health insurance from another source instead. These flows out of employment-based coverage will be partially offset by an estimated 7 million people who will newly enroll in employment-based coverage under the Affordable Care Act." The report has a little more explanation. Lower income tax rates, it says, reduce the "tax benefits associated with health insurance provided by employers." Also, the report says, the greater predicted movement away from employment-based coverage reflects revised income projections plus higher projections of how many workers would have employer-based plans if Obamacare was not law. CNN’s story quoted James Klein, president of the American Benefits Council, a trade association for large employers, as saying that since employer-provided health insurance is not taxable, the CBO's theory is that the benefits aren't as valuable when tax rates are lower. So some workers -- particularly lower-income individuals -- may find it more desirable to forgo their employer's coverage, CNN said, and seek insurance in the exchanges, where they also may be eligible for a government subsidy. At the same time, CNN said, employers with large, low-wage workforces may find it financially advantageous to withdraw health coverage, even if they have to pay penalties set up by the law. Frazier did not comment on the report's other elements. She emailed: "The point is that President Obama promised Americans they could keep their plans under Obamacare. Millions won't be able to. This isn't an argument over who gets care, it's over who gets to keep their current plan." Our ruling Cruz said that according to the CBO, "under Obamacare, 7 million people will lose their employer-sponsored insurance." Not exactly. This claim is a refraction of the budget office’s forecast, which says that in four years--2017 and 2021 through 2023--seven million fewer workers will have employer-based plans than if Obamacare were not law. In any year, it makes sense to expect some workers to lose employer-backed coverage. Things change. But the office’s 10-year forecast does not estimate how many workers will "lose" employer-sponsored plans. Conversely, it indicates that compared to 2013, more workers will have employer plans in all but one year of the decade. This claim skews a single cherry-picked number from a multi-variable presentation. While there is an element of truth--fewer workers will have employer-supported plans than if Obamacare had not passed into law--the CBO report also indicates many Americans will obtain coverage from other sources.

pomt-08115	The state has "less employees this year than we did last year."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/dec/10/bill-montford/democrat-senator-says-state-already-cutting-jobs-c/	On the campaign trail, Gov.-elect Rick Scott promised to cut the state workforce by 5 percent. But now some Democrats are using a new state study to say the cuts aren't needed. The Department of Management Services released its annual state workforce report on Dec. 8, 2010. The report profiles the number of state employees and their salaries, and it offers comparisons to state government workers nationwide. That comparison is quite favorable, said state Sen. Bill Montford, D-Tallahassee. "We're getting a good deal from our state workers," Montford said after digesting the results of the report. "Facing the financial crisis that we are, I understand why anyone would say we have to cut back across the board, but we have less employees this year than we did last year," Montford told the Tallahassee Democrat. "We're already reducing the size of government." As part of Scott's "7-7-7" plan to create about 700,000 private sector jobs in seven years, Scott has said he wants to trim 5 percent of the state workforce. Scott says that the workforce reduction would save almost $300 million, and that history shows Florida's economy grows better when government spending is lowered. But Montford, like Democratic gubernatorial nominee Alex Sink, argues that the state government already is pretty lean. As proof, he says the state workforce is shrinking. That's the statement we're checking here. Highlights from the report Florida in 2009 had the lowest ratio among the 50 states of full- and part-time state employees to overall population, and the second lowest ratio of full-time equivalent employees to population (Illinois ranked ahead of Florida), according to DMS. Florida also had the lowest payroll expenditures per resident -- $38 -- in the country, the DMS found, using public payroll expenditures submitted to the United States Census Bureau. The national average was $72 per resident. A word of caution about both figures -- Florida, because of its large population, has a comparative advantage using these types of calculation when compared to states with smaller populations. Those states still have to provide most or all of the public services that Florida does, but just for fewer people. Delaware and North Dakota, for instance, both have nearly three times as many state employees per resident when compared with Florida, and spend three times more on payroll per resident. A couple of other interesting figures -- women occupy more than 56 percent of traditional state government jobs, but less than 40 percent of senior management positions, and women across the board make less on average than their male colleagues. Male employees in the state personnel system earn $45,715 on average while women earn $40,496. State employee count Montford, in his comments, focuses on the state employee count. There are a couple of different ways the state takes a head count. Most figures refer to employees in the state personnel system -- those are the traditional government workers from state departments and agencies. But university employees -- professors and researchers and others -- are technically state workers, too. So are all the state courts and judicial system. On top of that, the state measures the government workforce by both budgeted positions, and the actual number of employees. Luckily, regardless of how you classify the number of state employees, the results are generally the same. But not necessarily a ringing endorsement of Montford's point. The total budgeted state workforce as of June 30, 2010, stood at 167,797 -- 857 employees less than in 2009, and 5,689 employees less than in 2008. But the state in 2010 had 529 more employees than it did on Dec. 31, 2006, according to DMS. If you look only at the state personnel system employees -- those that work directly for the government in an agency or department -- the gaps shrink ever more. The state system budgeted for a total of 109,020 employees in 2010, 456 employees less than its 2009 total (a 0.4 percent decrease) and 154 more than at the end of 2006 (a 0.1 percent increase). So in budgeted head counts, the state cut back ever so slightly from 2009 to 2010, but still has a bigger workforce than it did four years ago. The actual employee figures track the same way. State personnel system employees dropped from 105,174 in 2009 to 105,031 this year (difference of 143 people, or a 0.1 percent decline). But the number of employees increased 0.6 percent overall from 2006 to 2010. We tried to contact Montford's office to see which figure specifically he was citing, but we did not hear back. Conclusion In arguing that Scott's plan to shrink the state workforce 5 percent may be illogical, Montford noted that the state already is cutting its head count. He's technically right -- a Department of Management Services report released on Dec. 8 found that the state workforce shrunk from 2009 to 2010. But hardly in a measurable or significant way. Sometimes we find a statement is accurate but still needing clarification or additional information, and that's the case here. The state workforce shrunk between 0.1 and 0.4 percent depending on how you calculate it in 2010. But the workforce is bigger than it was at the end of 2006. We think those two facts combined seriously shade Montford's statement. So we say Mostly True.	None	Bill Montford	None	None	None	2010-12-10T16:05:55	2010-12-08	['None']
pomt-05000	Every "major newspaper in Texas calls" David Dewhurst "a moderate."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/jul/18/club-growth/club-growth-says-every-major-texas-newspaper-calls/	A Washington-based political action committee, Club for Growth Action, calls Republican U.S. Senate candidate Ted Cruz a "champion fighter" in a radio ad titled "Time" while saying his July 2012 runoff foe, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, has advocated a wage tax and more spending. The super-PAC ad’s narrator says: "It’s no wonder every major newspaper in Texas calls Dewhurst a moderate." (Listen to the ad to the right.) We’ve poked into various tax-and-spending claims about Dewhurst. Dewhurst once supported a payroll tax though none made it into law. Contrary to Cruz claims, Dewhurst has never advocated a state income tax and has presided over cuts in state budgets. For this foray, we wondered if every major Texas newspaper "calls Dewhurst a moderate." On the hustings, Cruz has hammered his contention that Dewhurst is a moderate, perhaps mindful that runoff voters are likely to be conservative-leaning. In this vein, a February 4, 2012, Austin American-Statesman news article quotes Rice University political science professor Mark Jones as saying that conservative Republican officeholders face a conundrum. "Either they govern effectively and at times don't follow conservative principles to the letter, or they follow conservative principles and they don't get things done," Jones said. "For many Republican Party activists, compromise is a dirty word." The Statesman story goes on to say that the Texas Senate, over which Dewhurst presides, runs on compromise: "For a bill to be considered, two-thirds of the 31 senators must agree, and Republicans are two seats shy of the votes needed to muscle legislation through without compromising with Democrats." The Republicans have not held a two-thirds’ Senate majority in modern times. Club for Growth spokesman Barney Keller offered as initial backup to the group’s claim headlines from articles printed in the two biggest Texas daily newspapers in 2007 and 2009 plus an October 2010 piece in the liberal Texas Observer political journal, which we set aside; the Observer is not a newspaper. Keller said he considers only the two papers with the most circulation in each state to be its "major" papers. Using the Nexis search service, we fetched the newspaper stories, which turned out not to be straight news accounts. One was a reporter’s commentary, in which the writer floats personal ideas or analysis, and the other was an editorial, the form of writing by which newspapers stake out positions on pages devoted to expressions of opinion. Let’s recap them. The January 29, 2007, news commentary by Clay Robison, then Austin bureau chief for the Houston Chronicle, opens: "Around the state Capitol, (Dewhurst) is generally considered a more ‘moderate’ Republican than the other two members of the top leadership trio — Gov. Rick Perry and (House) Speaker Tom Craddick. But — shhh — don't talk about that too loudly, lest you spoil Dewhurst's effort to polish his image among the many Texas Republicans who are decidedly more conservative and who may hold the key to his political future." Robison’s commentary also says that for "all the convenience they afford political writers, labels can be dicey, and people at different ends of the political spectrum often don't agree on characterizations. There is little argument, though, that Dewhurst is part of a Republican leadership that is more conservative than the Democratic leaders of just a few years ago." His column suggests that unlike Republicans, Democrats would not have closed a revenue shortfall in 2003 solely with budget cuts and higher tuition and likely would have raised taxes to minimize disruptions to public services. "But Dewhurst and the Senate helped soften some of the spending cuts in 2003," the column says, "and during last spring's special session on school finance, they led the way to securing a modest teacher pay raise." Finally, the commentary says Dewhurst "has to seek consensus or compromise in the Senate because the body's operating rules give clout to the Democratic minority. According to friends and associates, the article says, he also is more moderate philosophically than many of the conservative voters and activists in his party," though Dewhurst also "has to cultivate the votes" of conservatives who dominate the Texas Republican primary. The Jan. 14, 2009, Dallas Morning News editorial, headlined "Dewhurst should avoid playing partisan hand," airs concern that Dewhurst’s ambition for higher office could cause him to court "hard-core conservatives" while negotiating differences with House Speaker Joe Straus. "Dewhurst often has served as a moderate Republican in his six years as the Texas Senate's leader," the editorial says, "so chances are he will like having a pragmatic conservative like Straus across the Capitol. They should work better than Dewhurst did with former Speaker Tom Craddick, an ironclad conservative who quarreled with Dewhurst on issues such as school funding." "So which Dewhurst will lead the Senate?" the editorial says. "The moderate conservative who has tried to rein in his party from becoming extreme on issues like budget cuts? Or the Dewhurst who's trying to win over staunch conservatives for another office?" Keller, asked if he had other examples of major papers calling Dewhurst a moderate, passed along headlines for what turned out to be commentaries published in smaller newspapers in 2003, 2005 and 2007. In the September 21, 2003, San Antonio Express-News, editorial writer Bruce Davidson said in his column that Dewhurst had described himself as a "pro-growth conservative populist." The commentary continues: "His earlier performance" as lieutenant governor "provided evidence to back up that description. The lieutenant governor's approach to vital budget issues was refreshing in a legislative session marked by the rest of the GOP leadership's stubborn stampede toward cuts that hurt the state's poorest residents. Dewhurst led the charge to find non-tax revenues to balance the budget with fewer cuts in the Children's Health Insurance Program than those advocated by other Republican leaders. He showed a willingness to tackle tough issues by proposing increased sales taxes to solve the public school funding crisis. The plan wasn't perfect, but at least Dewhurst was willing to lead instead of delay... For the next two years, Dewhurst remains the best hope for finding some political middle ground in Austin." In the January 16, 2005, Corpus Christi Caller-Times, editorial writer Nick Jimenez wrote that in restoring some benefits to the Children’s Health Insurance Program, open to families of the working poor, "Dewhurst comes out as the moderate. He wants vision screening, dental and mental health benefits restored. And he wants the families who qualify to stay eligible for 12 months" without having to re-enroll in intervening months. And in an opinion column in the February 4, 2007, Statesman, editor Rich Oppel wrote: "Dewhurst got off to a good start in his first term as lieutenant governor, adopting a moderate stance and building the confidence of the 31-member state Senate." So, five commentary or editorial items -- including pieces in the state’s four largest newspapers -- published from 2003 through 2009 described Dewhurst as a moderate. Next, we widened our look by considering references to Dewhurst in the five biggest Texas papers according to daily circulation tallies listed in the Texas Daily Newspaper Association’s 2012 online directory: the Chronicle (circulation 383,953); Morning News (238,869); Fort Worth Star-Telegram (167,364); Statesman (133,979); and Express-News (129,411). Searching the Nexis database for "Dewhurst" plus "moderate" delivered nearly 300 articles, though the vast majority of the stories reflect only Cruz or Cruz supporters characterizing Dewhurst. Among other stories, an October 16, 2010, Morning News news article states: "When Dewhurst was first elected lieutenant governor in 2002, he was viewed as a conservative, but more moderate in his approach than then-House Speaker Tom Craddick, a Republican from Midland who was often at odds with his Senate counterpart. Even Senate Democrats praised Dewhurst in his first session. "But since then," the story continues, "he has pushed harder for GOP-backed causes, such as voter ID legislation and abortion restrictions. And his leadership of the Senate is now seen by many as more partisan than when he came into office." In a January 1, 2007, opinion column, William McKenzie of the Morning News voiced hopes for that year’s legislative session and speculated that the ambitious Dewhurst might play to the center. "His moderate instincts could prevail," the column says. Most recently, J.R. Labbe, editorial director for the Star-Telegram, wrote a May 14, 2012, commentary on the paper’s decision to endorse another candidate over Dewhurst in the May Senate primary. Her commentary says: "The Ted Cruz campaign describes Dewhurst as an ‘establishment moderate’ every chance it gets. It's meant as a put-down, but that's what Dewhurst used to be -- and he was an effective lieutenant governor." Our ruling From 2003 through 2010, major Texas newspapers published a few stories referring to Dewhurst as a moderate. All but once, though, the references were made in editorial, opinion or commentary contexts, and usually to say that Dewhurst had been more moderate than another leader or to hope that he would show moderation. The single relevant straight-news reference to Dewhurst in this fashion says he was initially viewed as a conservative, though as more moderate than then-House Speaker Tom Craddick. That story also says Dewhurst had since advocated more GOP-backed causes and been seen as more partisan. Broadly, it's our sense that saying that every major Texas daily "calls" Dewhurst a moderate leaves the impression the newspapers -- either two or five -- have all done so routinely or lately and always without qualifying the descriptive. That’s not so. We rate the statement as Mostly False. Update, 3:01 pm, July 23,2012: This story originally gave the wrong title for the radio ad.

pomt-08789	"There’s a mosque inside of the Pentagon."	false	/florida/statements/2010/aug/19/kendrick-meek/kendrick-meek-theres-mosque-pentagon/	Plans to build a mosque two blocks away from Ground Zero in New York City have stirred a national debate over the site’s appropriateness, and politicians from New York City’s Mayor Michael Bloomberg to President Barack Obama are chiming in. So it seemed a timely question for Michael Putney, host of WPLG-10’s "This Week in South Florida," to ask Kendrick Meek and Jeff Greene about the mosque during a televised debate between the two Democratic Senate hopefuls on Aug. 15, 2010. When asked by Putney whether the location was the "right site" for a mosque and Muslim center, Greene responded, "Absolutely not." "I think that it may be legal," Greene added. "I support freedom of religion, freedom of speech, I understand that, but you know what, thousands of Americans died there, not just the victims in the building but how about all the rescuers and firefighters. I don't think when all the families have to go to mourn their losses, they should be looking at a mosque right there... It's insensitive to the victims." Meek wasn’t as direct in his response, noting that he wasn’t on the New York City Zoning Board and saying he was "not going to step in front of a decision that’s already been made in New York City." He added: "There should be some sensitivity there and I recognize it ... I might add there is a mosque inside of the Pentagon ... and also a chapel." Is there a mosque inside of the Pentagon? The official word from Pentagon spokesperson George Wright: "There is not, I repeat there is not a mosque inside of the Pentagon." "There is a non-denominational chapel ... about 20 steps from the center of impact," Wright told PolitiFact Florida, in a phone interview. The 80-seat interfaith chapel was opened in November 2002, part of a memorial to the 184 people killed on the flight and inside of the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, Wright said. American Airlines Flight 77 was one of four planes hijacked on Sept. 11. Two of the jets were crashed into NYC’s Twin Towers, and the other was brought down in a field in Pennsylvania, after passengers and the flight crew fought with the hijackers to regain control of the plane. The chapel was built during the reconstruction of heavily damaged portions of the Pentagon, where 125 employees died, in addition to the 66 passengers on board the flight. Inside a room with stained glass windows, a wooden altar and a standing American flag, various religious services are held throughout the week. There are services for Catholics, Jews, Hindus, Mormons, Muslims and various Christian denominations. Footage from inside of the chapel was recently aired on CNN for those interested in taking a peek. Wright said that Muslim employees gather for daily prayer services Monday through Thursday at 2 p.m., and attend a Friday worship service run by an imam from a local mosque. A storage room at the chapel keeps prayer rugs that Muslim followers roll out facing East toward the city of Mecca. We wondered what classified a space as a mosque according to Islamic tradition, so we asked Shafayat Mohamed, imam of the Darul Uloom mosque in Pembroke Pines, Fla. "The main thing that makes a mosque a mosque is the establishment of praying five times a day at that spot," Mohamed said. "If people pray five times per day, then it is considered a regular mosque." While the chapel does not meet that definition, because prayer only occurs there once a day, Mohamed said the room could be considered another sacred space known as a "mussallaah." A mussallaah, according to Mohamed, is a place where Muslims consistently performs their mid-day prayer when they do not have access to a mosque. Any place from a university classroom to an office break-room could be considered a mussallaah so long as it is the venue that is consistently being used for prayer. "It may not officially be a mosque," Mohamed said of the Pentagon's chapel. "But if it’s somewhere where they repeatedly go to pray, someone working at the Pentagon might consider it their mussallaah, a place where they can all pray." So back to the question -- Was Meek correct in stating there is a mosque inside of the Pentagon? No; the Pentagon spokesman is emphatic that it's not a mosque. While Meek later added in his statement that there was also a chapel, the two are one and the same. He was correct in identifying that there was a place of worship and daily prayer for Muslims, but misspoke when calling it an actual mosque inside of the Pentagon. We rate his claim False.

pomt-06732	Gov. Rick Scott "is trying to get a waiver under the federal health care law that would deny consumers in Florida the right to the $60 million in rebates they have from their own HMOs."	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/aug/29/scott-randolph/rep-randolph-says-gov-scott-wants-take-away-60-mil/	Under the leadership of Florida Gov. Rick Scott and the state's Republican-dominated Legislature, Florida has rejected at least $19 million to implement parts of the controversial federal health care bill, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. The decision shouldn't be much of a surprise. Scott, after all, spent millions of his own fortune to form Conservatives for Patients Rights to fight the health care law, and he then ran for governor on a platform of opposing the controversial legislation. (Florida also is leading a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of the law, which is expected to be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court.) But the state isn't only poised to turn down tax dollars, a Democratic state legislator now says. Rep. Scott Randolph, D-Orlando, told a nationwide cable audience recently that Scott is trying to prevent Floridians from accessing millions of dollars in rebates from their HMOs. Randolph -- whose wife Susannah Randolph heads up Florida Watch Action, a progressive group behind the Pink Slip Rick campaign -- made the claim during an interview with Al Sharpton on MSNBC on Aug. 11, 2011. "You've got a situation where Florida has the second-highest rate of uninsured," Randolph said. "We have one, obviously the highest rates of senior per capita, and here you have a governor that is absolutely determined to use to put ideology above the health of their own citizens. In addition -- I'm sorry, in addition to the money you already talked about, he also is trying to get a waiver under the federal healthcare law that would deny consumers in Florida the right to the $60 million in rebates they have from their own HMOs." Randolph made a couple of claims in his response to Sharpton, but we wondered if he was correct to say that Scott is trying to get a waiver under the federal health care law that would deny consumers the right to $60 million in rebates from their own HMOs. The $60 million Randolph is talking about Randolph was referring to a provision in the federal health care law known as "medical loss ratios," which require insurance companies to spend 80 to 85 percent of premiums on health care rather than on overhead starting in 2011. If insurers fail to meet that standard they must pay rebates to consumers starting in 2012. The federal government has provided this fact sheet about the new standard. The idea of medical loss ratios isn't new -- what's new here is the 80 percent threshold set up in the health care law. Currently, insurers in Florida must meet a 65 percent standard and HMOs must meet a 70 percent standard. As part of the law, states can apply to the secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services for a waiver to the new requirements. To receive a waiver, states must show that meeting the 80 percent standard may result in fewer choices for consumers. So far, HHS has granted a handful of waivers, but the majority of applications -- including Florida's -- were pending as of Aug. 23. The waivers are temporary -- all states must comply with the 80 percent standard by 2014. Florida's Office of Insurance Regulation applied for a waiver in March -- initially asking that the state be allowed to keep its current 65 percent and 70 percent standard. In June, OIR proposed phasing in the new 80 percent threshold: raising the standard to 68 percent in 2011, 72 percent in 2012 and 76 percent in 2013. In the state's application, Office of Insurance Regulation Commissioner Kevin McCarty argued that insurers may stop issuing new policies due to the threat of rebates, that four insurers have already notified the office that they intend to withdraw from the individual market as a result of the new rules and that the 80 percent requirement hurts companies trying to establish in Florida because administrative costs can be higher in the early years. "There is simply no way to build a growing company on that amount of money," McCarty wrote in the application. News articles cite the $60 million We found at least two news articles stating that if the waiver is granted, Florida's consumers would lose $60 million. "Floridians could miss out on an estimated $60 million in health-insurance rebates next year if state officials successfully block enforcement of spending rules in the year-old reform law," stated Health News Florida July 20. The article stated that about 340,000 Floridians would be eligible for the rebates. And the Palm Beach Post wrote on March 17: "Florida consumers would lose cash or insurance benefits worth about $60 million if Florida is allowed to opt out of a key element of health reform this year" -- the article attributed that conclusion to Citibank managed care industry analyst Carl McDonald. McDonald and a colleague wrote in a report to investors in March predicting that the federal government will deny Florida's application arguing that none of the six largest plans in the state -- which dominate the majority of the market -- will drop coverage in Florida if the 80 percent rule stays in place. McDonald sent us a copy of his 13-page report which states: "Based on the 2009 data, it appears consumers would have received around $60 million in rebates had minimum MLRs (minimum loss ratios) been in place last year, and given how favorable utilization was in 2010, it seems likely the rebates would have been even bigger last year." As part of its application for a waiver, Florida created two different scenarios. In the first scenario, they calculated how much insurance companies would have to pay in rebates under the new 80 percent standard using 2009 data. The figure? About $62 million (see column F). In the second scenario, the state showed the effect if the state's waiver request was granted -- allowing Florida to slowly ramp up to the 80 percent mark. In that case, insurers would be required to pay out about $4.8 million rebates (compared to $62 million in rebates without the waiver). What's critical to note in both scenarios is that the dollar figures are based on 2009 data, before insurers had to comply with the 80 percent threshold. More on that shortly. The state's response Setting aside the numbers for a moment, OIR spokesman Jack McDermott said it's wrong for Randolph to say Scott is trying to get the waiver. The application was actually made by Office of Insurance Regulation, which is overseen by Scott and the Cabinet acting as the Financial Services Commission. The Cabinet includes three Republicans, Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater, Attorney General Pam Bondi and Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam. On the numbers, McDermott notes that the $62 million figure is based on 2009 data -- at a time when insurers didn't have to meet the 80 percent standard but had to meet the state's 65 to 70 percent standard. Companies are now making changes in response to the new standard, he said. That's a flaw in trying to anticipate what the rebates might be. The $62 million assumes insurers would ignore the new standard and make no changes, exposing themselves to having to pay tens of millions of dollars in rebates. Like it or hate it, insurance companies -- and businesses -- attempt to make as much money as possible. So it's natural that if they're required to spend 65 to 70 percent of insurance premiums on health care costs (meaning the rest can be spent on overhead or kept as profits) that's what they are likely going to do. And if the standard is raised to 80 percent, they're likely to try and adapt -- out of fear of having to rebate premium payments. In this case it's the regulation that's influencing how a company operates, not free will. Will all companies move right in line with the new 80 percent threshold? Probably not. Will all insurers do absolutely nothing? Probably not. McDonald, in a rebuttal, acknowledged that the money won't necessarily be paid out in rebates. But dollars that aren't going to rebates, he said, are in theory helping lower health care costs or improving health care coverage. For example, if United knows it needs to get to an 80 percent medical loss ratio, it has choices: It can pay a rebate to get to the 80 percent threshold, it can lower their prices for customers by the same amount or it can offer additional health care coverage. "One way or another consumers benefit." Conclusion Randolph said Scott "is trying to get a waiver under the federal health care law that would deny consumers in Florida the right to the $60 million in rebates they have from their own HMOs." The statement has a few flaws. Technically Scott isn't seeking the waiver -- the Office of Insurance Regulation (an office overseen by Scott and the Cabinet) is. But that's a minor point. More importantly, the waiver wouldn't necessarily deny consumers $60 million in rebates. At most, the waiver would phase in possible rebates over three years. And while rebates are possible, they are not a given. That's because the dollar figure is based on how insurance companies operated before prior to having to meet the new 80 percent standard. We won't know to what extent insurers will make changes to meet that new 80 percent standard yet, but it's safe to assume that they will try to avoid paying out tens of millions of dollars a year in rebates. However, it is clear that Scott is supportive of getting a waiver for a program that was designed to be pro-consumer by resulting in either lower rates or better coverage. On balance, we rate this claim Half True.	None	Scott Randolph	None	None	None	2011-08-29T11:13:40	2011-08-11	['None']
pomt-02713	Protesters in La Crosse blocked an exit and surrounded a State Patrol car carrying the governor and were "beating on the windows and rocking the vehicle." When the car was "extricated" from the crowd, a truck blocked a second exit.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/dec/23/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-protesters-surrounded-his-ca/	The title of Gov. Scott Walker’s new book is "Unintimidated." So, it makes sense that it would be filled with details about how he stood up against his opponents. The book describes death threats against the governor and his family, protests outside the governor’s residence and -- of course -- the massive protests at the Capitol in Madison in the wake of Walker’s move in early 2011 to curtail collective bargaining for most public employees. One of the incidents has stood out, both for PolitiFact Wisconsin readers who have asked us to look into it and for those who have interviewed Walker as he has made the rounds promoting his book -- a face-to-face meeting with "hundreds of angry protesters" after a Feb. 15, 2011, appearance at a La Crosse factory. Here is how Walker describes it in the book: "As we prepared to leave, the state troopers saw that the protesters had physically blocked the entrance we had used to come onto the property. So they turned the squad car around and headed toward the other exit. We watched in disbelief as the throng of people rushed toward the second exit to block our path. As we tried to pull out, they surrounded the car and began beating on the windows and rocking the vehicle. "Just as we extricated ourselves from their grip, a truck pulled up and blocked our path, playing a game of chicken with the troopers. They turned the lights and sirens on and warned him to get out of the way. Eventually he backed up, and we sped off. "It was a lesson in how much our circumstance had changed in a matter of a few days. We were dealing with people who were so blinded by their anger that they were not in the least bit afraid to storm and shake a police car. We had never seen anything like it in Wisconsin before." Walker goes on to say that the incident, among others, prompted the addition of security officers and procedures for him and his family. The La Crosse visit underscores a central theme of his book that he stood up against increasingly aggressive protests. To be sure, it has been documented that Walker received death threats, including against his family, and emotions on both sides were high as Senate Democrats fled to Illinois to block a vote and Republicans maneuvered to pass the measure. Walker critics, meanwhile, have largely argued that protests were orderly and a straightforward exercise in democratic action. The most common refrain: "This is what democracy looks like." This item is not meant to settle that disagreement, but to look at one incident that keeps getting mentioned in the national media. One example, from a Nov. 23, 2013 appearance on the "700 Club" show hosted by conservative talk show host Pat Robertson: Robertson: "They were banging on your car. You were in danger of your life -- is that the way it was?" Walker: "Oh, it was; no doubt about it. We, at one point, coming out of a manufacturing business in La Crosse where they were literally shaking one of our squad cars that the State Patrol was in with me." So, is Walker right? Did protesters in La Crosse surrounded a State Patrol car carrying him and beat and rock the vehicle? Did a truck block the exit so they could not leave? The situation at the time The La Crosse incident came days after Walker surprised the state with his proposal to curb collective bargaining. The visit -- like the large protests in Madison and in other cities that Walker visited -- received considerable media coverage. That coverage from the time is a good starting point and one we will give extra weight. Why? News coverage or a document generated at the time -- say a police incident report or an internal email -- is less likely to be skewed by spin or memories. It is more likely to be accurate than a recollection from years later, particularly one that may well have been put into writing by another person entirely. In this case, Walker’s co-author, Mark Thiessen. As written, the incident is about more than angry protesters. It depicts an organized effort to prevent Walker from leaving -- one exit is blocked by the crowd, the windows "beaten" as the car is "rocked." Once "extricated," the car turns toward another exit which is immediately blocked by a truck "playing a game of chicken" with state troopers. The crowd rushes there as well. This does not describe an orderly protest. It describes chaos. Indeed, if an incident like this happened, it almost certainly would have been widely covered. At the time, both sides were actively portraying the other as extreme and unreasonable. Any incidents by protesters, in particular, became a talking point on conservative blogs and talk radio. We searched for details about the La Crosse story, specifically that protesters blocked and rocked the car in which Walker was riding, and found nothing. We could not locate any news report from the time that indicated Walker himself was physically threatened in such a way. We turned to Walker spokesman Tom Evenson and asked for details about what happened that day. He referred all questions to the book’s publisher, Penguin Group. Penguin spokeswoman Jacquelynn Burke offered a one sentence response: "The Wisconsin State Patrol confirms that this event took place." When we turned to the State Patrol, they didn’t offer much more detail. "I did connect with somebody in our dignitary protection unit and they were able to confirm for me that there was an incident," said Peg Schmitt, a spokeswoman for the Department of Transportation, which includes the State Patrol. We asked for any reports related to the incident, a copy of any dash-cam video, or for interviews with the troopers or staff involved. Anything with details. Schmitt said there was no formal report filed, and that no further information about the incident would be made public. The State Patrol viewed what happened in La Crosse as a routine incident, she said, adding the most important concern was "moving the governor to safety." She said no interviews or additional information would be provided because it could compromise the State Patrol’s ability to provide security in the future. What was reported at the time Looking for more information about the nature of the car incident, we turned to those involved in La Crosse, including local police, executives with the company Walker visited, the news media, and those involved in the protest. Walker’s visit was covered by the La Crosse Tribune in a story published the following day. The story noted that hundreds of protesters lined the street leading to Ted Mannstedt & Son, a structural steel manufacturer that employs about 25 people. "Chants of ‘Hey hey, ho ho, Walker’s got to go’ bled through the walls" and could be heard inside the company, the story said. The story included coverage of Walker’s speech, quoted protesters and included a photo of Walker’s car with protesters in the background. There was no mention of any altercation involving the car. La Crosse Tribune editor Chris Hardie said reporter Chris Hubbuch and photographer Peter Thomson covered Walker’s visit and watched his car leave the plant. "Both Chris and Peter were standing outside when the governor left," Hardie said. "Neither of them remembers any kind of car rocking or the car being surrounded, that kind of thing." The journalists reviewed a Google satellite view of the property and refreshed their memories about where they were standing in relation to Walker’s car, Hardie said. "They would have noticed if they were blocking and beating on his car," Hardie said. He noted, too, that the journalists would have also been alerted if they had seen flashing police lights or heard a siren from Walker’s car -- something else the governor described. They witnessed nothing of the sort. The view from La Crosse police The La Crosse Police Department had officers at the scene because the crowd had grown to several hundred and was in the street and on private property. "We were assisting by blocking off the streets and so forth," said Officer Lisa Barrix, department spokeswoman. She said there was no record of misbehavior by the crowd, including interfering with the car during Walker’s departure, and no arrests. No mention, either, of a truck blocking an exit. "There was nothing out of control," Barrix said. "We don’t have any record of any type of disturbance that I can locate." Two officials with the company, including owner Brad Mannstedt, recalled a large, noisy crowd. "There was at least a good 500 people on the street," said Mannstedt. He said protesters moved toward Walker’s car as he was leaving, and said it was possible some got close enough to swat at the vehicle with rolled up posters. "I don’t think there was any real malicious attempt to get at him. They were trying to get his attention," Mannstedt said. "It’s as if you were to take a newspaper, roll it up and slam it on your desk to get somebody’s attention." Bob Sandvick, a quality control supervisor at the firm, said he was paying close attention to the crowd to make sure the protesters did not trespass onto company property. Asked if he knew anything about protesters surrounding Walker’s car, he said "I’m not aware of that." Ward Keil of Onalaska, who was in the crowd, said the "mood of the crowd was a little belligerent." People screamed at cars that they believed were carrying Walker, but didn’t do anything more aggressive than that, he said. Also, he said, it seemed that authorities used a "dummy car" so protesters didn’t know which car the governor was in. Finally, local television news coverage of the governor’s visit included a video snippet of the governor’s car leaving the plant. The crowd is several feet away from the car, and the car pulls out of the parking lot and turns onto the street without pausing. There’s no evidence of a truck blocking the way. More from the Walker side We circled back to Walker’s office and asked to interview staff members or anyone else with first-hand knowledge of the incident. Former Walker communications director Chris Schrimpf, in an email, offered a description similar to that in the book. "I remember the day well because the hatred on the protesters' faces as they banged on the car and shook it was jarring. I remember they ran toward the car like an angry mob (because they were one), we were blocked by the other car, and we were stuck." Schrimpf declined to be interviewed about what happened. When pressed on what other evidence he could provide, Schrimpf pointed to a change in how travel around the state for media appearances was handled. He said that after the La Crosse visit, Walker stopped traveling by car. Instead, they flew and did appearances in airplane hangars. Walker’s schedule confirms the switch to air travel. That switch may be evidence the La Crosse visit signaled issues that required a security change, but the switch alone is not confirmation of the specifics as described by Walker and supported by his former aide. Remember: We are not checking whether Walker -- and Schrimpf -- were startled by the protesters, or even if they were frightened by them. Or whether the State Patrol was ready for what it encountered that day. We are looking at whether the exits were blocked and the car rocked. We are examining the words used in the book, ones that depict a direct and physical threat to the governor of Wisconsin and disregard for state troopers and local authorities. Walker gives an updated view With the story in the news, Patrick Anderson, a reporter for the Tribune, asked Walker about the incident when the governor appeared Dec. 6, 2013, in La Crosse for a bill signing. Walker described it this way: "As we came out, literally tons of the, a whole bunch of the protesters ran down to the other exit and got out in front of the exit and literally blocked the car and got around the car and were kind of banging on the sides," Walker said, according to a transcript of the interview the newspaper provided to PolitiFact Wisconsin. That’s pretty close to the language in the book, but then things start to differ a bit. In the book, Walker describes lights and sirens and the truck blocking the way. In the interview, he said a state trooper in the squad "rolled the window down and said pretty sternly, you need to move back from the car." Asked about being afraid (Robertson, in the TV interview, phrased it as being "in danger of your life", a statement Walker agreed with), Walker said: "I was concerned. It was, it was something that I had never experienced before. I don’t know if afraid is the right word but it certainly was jarring, is probably the better word than fear." Asked about the car rocking, Walker said: "Yeah they shook a little bit. ...signs were banging and that." The governor also addressed the police report question. "Of course there’s no police report. No tickets were issued, no arrests were made. The whole use of the (dignitary protection unit) … is that if you’re in a situation like that you get out. … The last thing you want to do is heighten it. But it was a pretty big wake up call." Our rating Walker says protesters in La Crosse blocked an exit and surrounded a State Patrol car carrying the governor and were "beating on the windows and rocking the vehicle." When the car was "extricated" from the crowd, a truck blocked a second exit. Yet we could find no mention of the car rocking incident before the book came out Nov. 19, 2013. Beyond the book itself and related public statements, there was no concrete evidence provided by Walker’s office, despite numerous inquiries by PolitiFact. Local police, journalists at the scene, and people from the company and the crowd do not recall seeing Walker’s car rocked or banged upon. And no one involved in news coverage, local law enforcement or witnesses reported seeing a truck blocking the car from leaving. Finally, in a recent interview, Walker toned down his description of the incident. Based on the available information, we think the book’s depiction of what happened -- an organized effort to prevent Walker from leaving that placed him in direct danger -- is False.

pomt-12376	"Texas leads the country in animal deaths by sodium cyanide M-44s."	true	/texas/statements/2017/jun/02/ann-hudspeth/austins-ann-hudspeth-says-texas-leads-nation-anima/	A toxic bomb that kills wild animals and sometimes even pets should be banned, an Austin resident urged in a letter to the editor of the Austin American-Statesman. Ann Hudspeth stirred our curiosity by writing: "Fourteen states are using cyanide bombs to kill wildlife — and Texas leads the country in animal deaths by sodium cyanide M-44s." Her April 2017 letter continued: "Thousands of coyotes, foxes, possums, raccoons and skunks meet their end this way in our state. According to figures from the Humane Society of the United States, last year seven Texas dogs were killed by these bombs." She closed her letter by advocating for a proposed national ban on sodium cyanide M-44s, pointing out legislation introduced in March 2017 by U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., to ban the use of sodium cyanide and another compound for predator control. A 2010 U.S. Department of Agriculture leaflet, from its Animal Health and Plant Inspection Service, calls sodium cyanide M-44s, which are placed with the permission of ranchers and landowners by the agency’s Wildlife Services branch, "an effective and environmentally sound wildlife damage management tool." The leaflet specifies how it works: "The spring-activated device delivers a dose of cyanide powder to targeted animals," who draw the poison into their mouths by tugging on baited capsule holders. According to a 2012 Sacramento Bee news series, the service’s roots reach to 1915, when Congress – hoping to increase beef production for World War I – allocated $125,000 to exterminate wolves, starting in Nevada. "Popular among ranchers, the effort was expanded in 1931 when President Herbert Hoover signed a law authorizing the creation of a government agency – later named the Branch of Predator and Rodent Control – ‘to promulgate the best methods of eradication, suppression or bringing under control’ a wide range of wildlife from mountain lions to prairie dogs," the Bee reported. Reader cites society research Hudspeth, describing herself as a Congressional District 10 Texas volunteer with the Humane Society of the United States, told us by email that she based the claim on a humane society "data sheet." The undated sheet, which she provided, has a chart indicating that in 2016, Texas ranked first among 14 states with 4,865 animals killed by sodium cyanide M-44s. According to the sheet, the animals felled in Texas included 4,210 coyotes, 521 gray foxes, 56 red foxes, 40 raccoons, 25 opossums, 7 dogs and 6 skunks. Oklahoma placed second, per the sheet, with 3,930 such animal deaths, with New Mexico third at 901 such deaths: SOURCE: Document, "Wildlife Services, M-44 Data by Species and State," 2016, the Human Society of the United States, undated (received by email from Ann Hudspeth, Austin, April 28, 2017 and confirmed by email, Wendy Keefover, carnivore protection manager, Wildlife Department, the Humane Society of the United States, April 30, 2017) We spot-checked and confirmed the society’s presented totals for the top three declared states from USDA-posted data. By email, we heard back from a service spokesman, Andre Bell, that the death counts by state are annually updated. Rates of animal deaths We recognized, too, that Texas was by far the most populous of the states with M-44 deaths. When we adjusted for population differences, using U.S. Census Bureau estimates, we found Oklahoma leading the 14 states with 10 such animal deaths for every 10,000 residents. By this metric, Texas ranked No. 8, with nearly 2 such deaths per 10,000 residents--higher than the rates for Nevada, Virginia, Idaho, Oregon, Utah and Colorado and lower than the rates for Oklahoma, North Dakota, Wyoming, Montana, New Mexico, West Virginia and Nebraska. We also tried ranking the deaths by state by adjusting for each state’s total area in square miles as posted by the bureau. By this sort, West Virginia had the highest rate of M-44 animal deaths per square mile--with Texas second, followed by Nebraska, North Dakota, Virginia, New Mexico and Oklahoma. Human exposures Hudspeth put us in touch with Wendy Keefover, a manager for the Humane Society of the United States, who guided us to news accounts of human and pet dog exposures to the sodium cyanide explosives intended to kill predators. A 1971 Sports Illustrated story described the 1966 death of Texas surveyor Raymond Medford, 49, near Fort Stockton due to accidental sodium cyanide exposure from a predecessor predator-control device to the M-44. Keefover wrote that through a Freedom of Information Act request to the Environmental Protection Agency, the society drew reports of four other Texans exposed to sodium cyanide, none fatally, all in connection with M-44s, from 1998 into 2011. Keefover also noted an April 20, 2017, National Geographic news story stating that according to the EPA, "an average of 30,000 M-44s, deployed by the federal government in concert with Western states and counties, are triggered each year. Baited to entice animals, they’re indiscriminate in their victims," the story said. Also noted: Wildlife Services reporting that in 2016, 12,511 of 76,963 coyotes killed for livestock protection were felled with M-44s. Most recently, Keefover noted, a March 2017 incident resulted in a boy and his dog briefly getting exposed to an M-44’s contents. According to an Idaho State Journal news story noted by the fact-checkers at Snopes.com, 14-year-old Canyon Mansfield was walking with his dog when he noticed what he thought was a sprinkler head protruding 6 inches from the ground. "Like many curious teenagers would, he bent down and touched the pipe, which erupted with a loud popping noise that knocked Canyon off his feet," the story said. "A hissing sound ensued and Canyon noticed his clothing and face were covered with an orange, powdery substance," the story said, which the boy washed off in nearby snow; his dog, though, shortly died. The story said Wildlife Services issued a statement referring to the dog’s death as a regretted "unintentional lethal take." Humane Society stands by claim Reminded that Texas falls far short of No. 1 in animal deaths due to M-44s once the federal counts are adjusted for each state’s population, a national Humane Society official, Carol Misseldine, replied by email that Hudspeth and the society intended a different emphasis. "Texas ranks number one in total numbers of animals killed by these cyanide bombs and we stand by our numbers," Misseldine wrote. Our ruling Hudspeth wrote: "Texas leads the country in animal deaths by sodium cyanide M-44s." Texas would have ranked lower if each state’s tally were adjusted for population or land area, but Hudspeth’s claim was only that Texas had more animal deaths than any other. We rate her claim True.

pomt-07274	Compact fluorescent light bulbs are "toxic" and "not environmentally friendly."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/24/ameripac/group-opposed-light-bulb-law-claims-consumers-are-/	A fundraising letter making the rounds from a conservative political action committee draws a political line in the sand over light bulbs. "The Democrats have already voted to BAN our conventional lights bulbs (that you and I use even today!) in favor of DANGEROUS fluorescent light bulbs," writes Alan Gottlieb, chairman of AmeriPAC, a political action committee that largely supports conservative Republican candidates. In another fact-check, we looked at the first half of this claim, that Democrats voted to ban incandescent light bulbs (and rated it Pants on Fire). In this item. we'll address safety issues regarding the curly-shaped compact fluorescent light bulbs and whether the small amount of mercury contained in them presents an environmental hazard in homes. First, let's take a look at the arguments in the AmeriPAC letter and attached arguments from the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise Action Fund. The letter claims people will be required to "throw away" their existing incandescent light bulbs when the new law takes effect (a claim we rated Pants on Fire), and replace them with more expensive (a claim we rated Barely True) compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) bulbs that are "supposedly" "environmentally safe." "I say 'supposedly' because the one thing the CFLs are not is 'environmentally safe,' " wrote Ron Arnold of the Center for the Defense of Free Enterprise. The letter then relays an anecdote that has made Maine housewife Brandy Bridges a poster child of the anti-CFL movement. "Just ask Ellsworth, Maine housewife, Brandy Bridges, who dropped and shattered a compact fluorescent light bulb on the carpeted floor in her daughter's bedroom," the CDFE letter states. "Aware that CFLs are potentially hazardous, Bridges called the local Home Depot store to ask for advice. Home Depot told her that the CFL contained mercury and advised her to call the Poison Control hotline. Now remember, this is the replacement to the electric light bulb you've used for your whole life. You know...you drop one on the floor. It breaks. What do you do? Get a broom and dust pan and sweep it up. What happened when Brandy Bridges called the Poison Control hotline? "The hotline had her contact the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. The DEP sent Andrew Smith, a toxicologist, to her home. He sealed the room with plastic and told Bridges it would cost about $2,000 to clean up the mess from the one toxic $3 CFL device that broke on her floor." But when a CNN reporter followed up on her story in Sept. 3, 2009, he concluded that the fear engendered by the story was largely overblown. Maine officials said they gave Bridges some bad advice and eventually came to her house and cut out the carpet. "When contacted about the Bridges case, Maine officials said the advice to get a professional hazardous waste cleaner and remove the carpet was given before a policy on fluorescents was fully developed," the CNN story states. "They no longer tell people to call a hazmat crew or remove rugs, unless the homeowner is particularly concerned." Maine environmental officials, who continue to be enthusiastic supporters of CFL use, also studied the issue of mercury emissions from broken CFLs and published recommendations on how to clean them up if they break. For example, they recommended using index cards or playing cards to pick up broken pieces of the bulb (don't vacuum it up, as that can spread the mercury dust). Then, place the waste in a glass jar and take it to a recycling center. They also recommend ventilating the room for several hours by opening windows. "Our advice, if you have one of them break, just clean it up and get it out of the house," said toxicologist Dr. Deborah Rice of the Maine Center for Disease Control and Prevention. "There's no question that mercury is a toxic substance. But the amount of it in CFLs is very small." She also tells people not to put CFLS in rooms where a small child might be likely to knock over a lamp. The CDFE letter also cites an April 3, 2011, San Jose Mercury News story that begins: The nation's accelerating shift from incandescent bulbs to a new generation of energy-efficient lighting is raising an environmental concern -- the release of tons of mercury every year. The most popular new light -- the curlicue, compact fluorescent light bulb, or CFL -- accounts for a quarter of new bulb sales and each contains up to 5 milligrams of mercury, a potent neurotoxin that's on the worst-offending list of environmental contaminants. Demand for the bulbs is growing as federal and state mandates for energy-efficient lighting take effect, yet only about 2 percent of residential consumers and one-third of businesses recycle them, according to the Association of Lighting and Mercury Recyclers. "If the recycling rate remains as abysmally low as it is, then there will certainly be more mercury released into the environment," said Paul Abernathy, executive director of the Napa-based recycling association. "Until the public really has some kind of convenient way to take them back, it's going to be an issue." However, CDFE does not include a later passage in the Mercury News article that presents a counterweight to concerns raised about small levels of mercury in CFLs: Even with mercury worries about CFLs, they still ultimately lead to fewer mercury emissions than incandescent lights, according to the California Energy Commission. Although the old-style bulbs contain no mercury, they're often powered by coal-fired electricity plants -- which release mercury as a pollutant. The end result is about 40 percent less mercury emissions per bulb when using energy-efficient CFLs, according to EPA figures. The fact is that incandescent light bulbs result in much more mercury being introduced into the environment, because they require four times as much electricity to operate, and much of that electricity comes from coal-fired power plants that emit mercury into the air, said Noah Horowitz, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council. "If you are really concerned about mercury," Horowitz said, "you should really be buying CFLs even though they have small amounts of mercury in them." Claims about CFL safety concerns are "wildly exaggerated," he said. "They have extremely low levels of mercury, that's true," Horowitz said. "But it is still in the bulb when you use them. When you are finished with them you should recycle them." And there are now many more places to recycle spent CFLs than there were just two years ago, he said. For example, Home Depot and Lowe's both allow people to bring their spent CFLs there for free recycling, even non-customers. And, he said, CFLs generally have about half as much mercury in them as they did just a few years ago. Besides, he said, there is nothing in the law that requires people to buy CFLs. Light bulb companies have also developed halogen incandescent bulbs that meet the new efficiency requirements; and LED technology is another option. Neither of those types of bulbs contain mercury. It's misleading to warn about the small amount of mercury in CFLs without also noting that less efficient bulbs require more electricity and result in more mercury in the environment, said Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. "They tell, shall we say, part of the story," Nadel said. The tone of the letter is clearly designed to heighten fears about CFLs in an effort to bolster an argument about government over-regulation. Mercury is, in fact, a toxic substance, and CFLs contain a small amount of mercury (a fraction of the amount contained in a mercury thermometer). But government and environmental officials say the risk they pose is very small, particularly if the light bulbs are disposed of properly and cleaned up properly if one shatters. Moreover, the warnings fail to acknowledge that there is a price to pay for sticking with less efficient traditional incandescent light bulbs. Those bulbs require far more electricity to operate, and, if they are powered by coal-fired power plants, result in even more mercury emitted into the environment. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-00516	"The party in the White House" is responsible for "a massive tax increase on the middle class."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/23/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-obama-caused-massive-tax-increase-middle-/	After six years with a Democrat in the White House, middle-class Americans face a bigger tax bill than they did before, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said in a speech launching his 2016 presidential campaign. "The party now in the White House is planning a no-suspense primary, for a no-change election," he said in his June 15 remarks in Miami. "They are responsible for the slowest economic recovery ever, the biggest debt increases ever, a massive tax increase on the middle class, the relentless buildup of the regulatory state, and the swift, mindless drawdown of a military that was generations in the making." The claim that President Barack Obama and the Democrats have significantly raised taxes is bound to come up frequently in the 2016 election, so we decided to take a whack at it now. When we asked Bush’s campaign specifically what tax increases he was talking about, they pointed to the Affordable Care Act. It's a claim we heard before, and one that is flawed. Bush is correct that the Affordable Care Act raises taxes. But pinpointing the middle class as the recipient of "a massive tax increase" is misleading. It's the upper-class that is feeling the brunt of the impact. And health care subsidies, in some cases, may be offsetting tax increases. A note: The term "middle class" is hard to define, but for the purposes of this article, we are roughly looking at a generous threshold that comprises households making up to $250,000 a year. Health care taxes Let's get the big number out of the way. The health care law is expected bring in more than $1 trillion in new taxes over 10 years, according to a 2013 Joint Committee on Taxation report. The revenue is coming in through 21 new or increased taxes. Of those 21, 12 could affect households making less than $250,000 a year, according to the Tax Foundation. We’ve looked at this list of 12 before. Some primarily target the middle class, others could hit certain people within the middle class, and others are debatable. Bush’s campaign specifically sent us a list of the conservative Americans for Tax Reform’s "top-five" Obamacare middle class tax increases. The five Bush cited are all included in our larger list of 12. A couple of the taxes are obvious, direct taxes on individuals -- such as a tax on indoor tanning services and the penalty for not complying with the individual mandate to have insurance. These only apply to select individuals. Many more are applied to companies, such as the excise tax on certain medical device manufacturers or the so-called "Cadillac tax" on high-cost health insurance plans. Many economists anticipate that companies will pass these taxes along to consumers in the form of higher premiums or more expensive products. In any case, none of these taxes affects every single member of the middle class. It’s possible there are individuals who will incur most of these additional costs, while others face a couple. Whether or not these taxes are -- as Bush put it -- "massive" increases on the middle class depends on individual circumstances, said Kyle Pomerleau, a Tax Foundation economist. "I would say that the tax increase in total was large and that some of it definitely hits the middle class in some way," he said. "The degree to which individuals are impacted depends on their situation." For some perspective, total federal revenues are estimated to be about $40 trillion over 10 years. Tax revenue from the health care law, about $1 trillion, accounts for about 2.5 percent. Looking at the revenue just from the 12 that might affect middle-class taxpayers (as well as those in other income brackets), it’s about 1.25 percent of overall tax revenue. "Almost certainly, yes, taxes have gone up for lower- and middle-income people," said Roberton Williams, a fellow with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. "But have they gone up a lot? Probably not." "If I were pulling words out of the air, ‘massive’ is not the word I would pull," Williams said. Many of these taxes tend to affect more people at the upper-end of middle class, because people with lower incomes are less likely to opt for the taxed services -- such as optional medical procedures or flexible savings accounts, Williams said Conversesly, some middle-income households might even see tax benefits of the Affordable Care Act -- namely, insurance premium subsidies -- outweigh any tax increases, he added. Premium tax credits will save taxpayers about $19 billion in 2015, while the five taxes cited by Bush and the Americans for Tax Reform list are worth much less, said Laurel Lucia, health care program manager at University of California Berkeley’s Center for Labor Research and Education. In total, those five taxes are worth about $11 billion per year, she said, citing congressional research. "I certainly agree Obamacare has increased taxes on the middle class," said University of California Los Angeles law professor Eric Zold. "But it is not clear that the middle class as a group are not better off by the combination of Obamacare costs and benefits." Other tax policies It's worth noting, of course, that the health care law isn’t the only policy that has impacted taxes in the last few years. Some changes have had a positive impact on the wallets of the middle class. Some changes have had a negative impact. Soon after taking office, Obama signed a bill raising the sales tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products to support the State Children's Health Insurance Program. Less than 20 percent of the population smokes, though polling shows that the percentage of the population that smokes decreases as income increases. In terms of tax cuts, Obama extended the Bush-era tax cuts for people making below $250,000, as well as an array of beneficial measures for small businesses. Additionally, he signed off on several stimulus tax measures to assist with the 2008 economic recovery -- such as a temporarily reduced payroll tax and an increased earned income tax credit. Some are still around, but others have phased out. It's fair to say that under Obama, for the most part, taxes have decreased for lower-income people and increased for upper-income people, Williams said. And it's a mixed bag for the middle class. Our ruling Bush said, "The party in the White House" is responsible for "a massive tax increase on the middle class." Bush pointed to the Affordable Care Act, which certainly does involve tax increases -- some of which affect the middle class, though not exclusively. It’s not accurate to call the tax increases for the middle class "massive." Some individuals might see their tax bill go up, while others see the tax benefits of the health care law outweigh the costs, and some might experience a change so small they don’t notice it. Looking only at the health care law also ignores other pieces of tax policy that have affected the bottom line for the middle class. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-04640	On U.S.-Israeli relations, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "set the record straight — he said, our two countries have 'exactly the same policy' (and) 'our security cooperation is unprecedented.'"	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/sep/13/john-kerry/john-kerry-says-netanyahu-praised-us-israel-relati/	Responding to Republican complaints that President Barack Obama has not been fully supportive of Israel, Democrats are launching a strident defense. U.S. Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., chair of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and his party’s 2004 presidential nominee, defended Obama’s policies at the Democratic National Convention on Sept. 6. "Barack Obama promised always to stand with Israel to tighten sanctions on Iran—and take nothing off the table. Again and again, the other side has lied about where this president stands and what this president has done," Kerry said. "But Prime Minister Netanyahu set the record straight—he said, our two countries have ‘exactly the same policy…’—’our security cooperation is unprecedented...’ When it comes to Israel, I'll take the word of Israel's prime minister over Mitt Romney any day." Kerry’s remarks seemed to answer criticism from Romney’s acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa. There, Romney said that Obama "has thrown allies like Israel under the bus." Both parties are clamoring for the Jewish vote in this election. Although Jewish Americans overwhelmingly voted for Obama in 2008, even a slight decrease in November could make a difference in crucial swing states such as Florida. We wanted to see if Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu actually said what Kerry claimed and if it supported his overall point in rebutting Romney’s criticism. Romney’s criticism of Obama on Israel Romney has criticized Obama and his administration with respect to Israel on multiple fronts. Most often, he’s said that Obama hasn’t done enough to stop Iran’s alleged quest to obtain nuclear weapons. But he’s also criticized Obama for not visiting Israel as president (we rated that True) and not recognizing the country’s capital as Jerusalem (we rated that Half True.) Obama later got the Democrats to reinsert language in their party platform that says Jerusalem is the capital. It’s not clear from Romney’s criticism that his policies would be different from Obama’s, a point we’ll look at more closely in just a bit. But Romney regularly criticizes the administration for not being supportive enough of Israel. Our research shows that the relationship between the United States and Israel is generally strong, although there have been some tensions between Obama and Netanyahu that have grown more prominent as election day nears. In fact, one of the quotes Kerry invoked came from just such a time, going back to 2011 when Netanyahu and Obama exchanged public remarks on how the Middle East peace process should proceed. "Our security cooperation is unprecedented" In a speech at the State Department on May 19, 2011, Obama expressed support for two states, adding, "The borders of Israel and Palestine should be based on 1967 lines with mutually agreed swaps." Obama’s idea wasn’t new -- the New York Times reported that President George W. Bush and Bill Clinton directed their staff to pursue the same idea -- but his comments angered Israeli officials. The New York Times noted that the 1967 border issue "has always been privately understood, not spoken publicly, and certainly not publicly endorsed by a sitting American president." A day after Obama’s comments, the two leaders met at the White House. Here’s how the Washington Post reported the meeting: "After the president's brief welcome, the prime minister leaned into him with cameras catching every moment. He suggested bluntly that Obama had little, if any, understanding of how peace efforts and the broader Middle East worked. "’I think for there to be peace, the Palestinians are going to have to accept some basic realities,’ Netanyahu told him. Publicly calm, Obama was privately irate at the treatment." Then Netanyahu made his own speech on May 23, 2011. "Yesterday, President Obama spoke about his iron-clad commitment to Israel's security," Netanyahu said. "He rightly said that our security cooperation is unprecedented." That’s the line Kerry quoted. Netanyahu also thanked both American political parties and said the two countries "stand shoulder to shoulder fighting common enemies, protecting common interests" and were cooperating in science, technology and other areas. But near the end of his speech, Netanyahu said this: "Tomorrow in Congress, I'll describe what a peace between a Palestinian state and the Jewish State could look like. But I want to assure you of one thing. It must leave Israel with security. And therefore, Israel cannot return to the indefensible 1967 lines." The news from Netanyahu’s speech wasn’t that he said something nice about America’s president and the U.S. The news was about the 1967 border spat. Our two countries have "exactly the same policy" The other line Kerry quotes came from Netanyahu’s remarks of March 2012 when he said that the U.S. and Israel have "exactly the same policy" with respect to Iran: "I want to explain why Iran must never be allowed to develop nuclear weapons," Netanyahu said. "U.S. President Barack Obama has reiterated his commitment to prevent that from happening. He stated clearly that all options are on the table, and that American policy is not containment. Well, Israel has exactly the same policy. We are determined to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons; we leave all options on the table; and containment is definitely not an option...." But in the same speech Netanyahu also said diplomacy and sanctions haven’t worked: "I appreciate President Obama’s recent efforts to impose even tougher sanctions against Iran. These sanctions are hurting Iran’s economy, but unfortunately, Iran’s nuclear program continues to march forward. Israel has waited patiently for the international community to resolve this issue. We’ve waited for diplomacy to work. We’ve waited for sanctions to work. None of us can afford to wait much longer." As we were preparing this report, Netanyahu was again complaining about U.S. actions on Iran. "Those in the international community who refuse to put red lines before Iran don’t have a moral right to place a red light before Israel," he said. Policy differences between Obama and Romney We asked Aaron David Miller, a former State Department advisor on Arab-Israeli affairs for Democrat and Republican Secretaries of State, about the differences between Romney and Obama on Israel. Miller wrote an article debunking myths about Israel and U.S. foreign policy published in the Jewish Journal the day after the conventions. He had criticisms for both political parties. He said it's a myth that Obama is hostile to Israel, and that Romney’s comment that Obama has "thrown Israel under the bus" is "ridiculous." But he also noted that Obama supporters are wrong to claim Obama is just as pro-Israel as Clinton or Bush. "Combined with a tendency to see the conflict through the more detached unemotional filter of American national interests, Obama doesn’t have the instinctive emotional attachment to Israel of Bill Clinton or George W. Bush," Miller wrote. If Romney won, "he’d probably give more slack on the issues of settlements and the peace process," Miller wrote, and would be "personally sympathetic to the notion of bombing before accepting an Iranian bomb." "The fact is, with the exception of the peace process that isn’t right now, Romney’s policies toward Israel would be much more rhetorically supportive but not that much different than Obama’s. The tone of the relationship would change — more warmth and good cheer — but I would bet that within a year Netanyahu would find some way to begin to annoy even his best friend Mitt Romney." Netanyahu and Romney have known each other since they worked together in Boston in the 1970s. Our ruling During his speech at the DNC, Kerry answered Romney’s criticism of Obama’s Israel policy with these words: "But Prime Minister Netanyahu set the record straight—he said, our two countries have ‘exactly the same policy…’—’our security cooperation is unprecedented...’" Kerry did accurately quote Netanyahu’s remarks in 2011 and 2012. But Kerry omitted any discussion of the real tensions that exist between Obama and Netanyahu, particularly about Obama’s 2011 comments on Israel’s 1967 borders.

pomt-08946	"The Department of Health and Human Services is providing $160 million to the state of Pennsylvania to set up a new high-risk insurance pool program that would cover any abortion legal in the state."	false	/ohio/statements/2010/jul/23/john-boehner/john-boehner-gop-claims-federal-taxpayers-will-fun/	As Congress struggled to pass health reforms earlier this year, anti-abortion groups and members of Congress fretted the legislation would permit taxpayer dollars to be used for the controversial procedure, overturning years of precedent that banned use of federal money for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or to save a mother’s life. To ease those fears, President Obama signed an executive order that reaffirmed the bans would continue in health insurance programs developed under the new bill. Obama’s gesture was needed to win support from key anti-abortion Democrats, including Bart Stupak of Michigan, Marcy Kaptur of Toledo and Steve Driehaus of Cincinnati. But Republicans still weren’t convinced. "Make no mistake, a ‘yes' vote on the Democrats' health care bill is a vote for taxpayer-funded abortions," House GOP Leader John Boehner of Ohio said at the time. As states prepare to implement a part of the law that encourages them to create temporary high risk plans for people with pre-existing medical conditions who have trouble finding affordable insurance, Republicans like Boehner and anti-abortion groups like the National Right to Life Committee are claiming the new high risk insurance pools will provide a backdoor way for the federal government to fund abortions. Pennsylvania was among the first states to put together a plan, and publicize its details. "The Department of Health & Human Services is providing $160 million to the state of Pennsylvania to set up a new high-risk insurance pool program that would cover any abortion legal in the state," Boehner said in a news release July 13. "This is the boldest admission yet from the Obama administration that the President’s Executive Order on taxpayer-funded abortion was a sham," Boehner said. "The fact that the high-risk pool insurance program in Pennsylvania will use federal taxpayer dollars to fund abortions is unconscionable." Ohio’s eight GOP members of Congress have kept up the chorus. On July 15, Rep. Jim Jordan of Urbana claimed the Pennsylvania high-risk insurance program would include abortion coverage and demonstrate that Kaptur, Driehaus and Obama violated their promise that "ObamaCare would not allow tax dollars to be used to take the life of unborn children." "The Stupak-Kaptur-Driehaus executive order, signed by President Obama was not worth the paper it was printed on," Jordan’s statement said. "It was merely a ploy to give so-called pro-life Democrats an excuse to vote for a federal takeover of health care that allows taxpayer funding of abortion.." Then on July 19 the group of eight – Boehner, Jordan, Steve LaTourette of Bainbridge Township, Patrick Tiberi of Genoa Township, Jean Schmidt of Loveland, Michael Turner of Centerville, Bob Latta of Bowling Green and Steve Austria of Beavercreek – wrote to Gov. Ted Strickland expressing concern that other states’ high risk health plans will cover elective abortions, and urging Strickland to make sure that doesn’t happen in Ohio. "Your voice as Governor is needed to help ensure that not a dime of the $152 million in federal funds Ohio is set to receive for its high-risk pool plan goes toward covering abortions," their letter said. At Strickland’s request, Ohio Department of Insurance Director Mary Jo Hudson replied with a letter that insisted the high risk pool the state plans to launch on Aug. 1 will comply with federal law, and not cover abortion services "except in the cases of rape or incest, or where the life of the woman would be endangered." Will these new plans actually permit individuals with pre-existing medical conditions to get federally funded abortions? Boehner’s statement is nearly identical to one made by the National Right to Life Committee that we analyzed. They said that the Obama administration will give Pennsylvania $160 million to pay for health insurance plans that cover "any legal abortion." Here’s what we found when we analyzed that statement July 16. Pennsylvania’s 60-page proposal outlines a standard health care plan that says this about abortion: "Includes only abortions and contraceptives that satisfy the requirements of 18 Pa.C.S. § 3204-3206 and 35 P.S. §§10101, 10103-10105. ... Elective abortions are not covered." Those statute numbers refer to Pennsylvania's abortion laws, where abortion is, for the most part, legal. The code says that abortions may be performed if a doctor determines that "in his best clinical judgment, the abortion is necessary." The only mention the statute makes of forbidding an abortion is when it is "sought solely because of the sex of the unborn child." Douglas Johnson, National Right to Life Committee’s legislative director, said those statute numbers mean that the proposal is meant to include any legal abortion. "We know how this stuff works," Johnson said. "He'll say 'It's not elective, it's necessary.'" The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services responded in a statement issued July 14: "In Pennsylvania and in all other states abortions will not be covered in the Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) except in the cases of rape or incest, or where the life of the woman would be endangered." Pennsylvania’s insurance department, issued its own statement July 15: "Pennsylvania will – and has always intended to – comply with the federal ban on abortion funding in the coverage provided through our federally funded high risk pool. This program will provide much-needed assistance for the sickest of the sick. The likelihood that any of those covered will seek abortion services is remote, but if they do need such services, they will have to pay for them out their own pocket." The Department of Health and Human Services is still developing regulations for many aspects of health care, and they're trying to do it with some haste. New Mexico, for example, submitted a plan for the Pre-existing Condition Health Insurance Plan that explicitly included abortion services, but then withdrew it quickly when it learned that the federal government would forbid the services, Associated Press reported. The Obama administration has clearly stated it won’t allow abortion to be covered under the new plans, save for cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother. State officials in Pennsylvania and Ohio have insisted their new programs will comply with the federal ban. The high-risk plans in question are designed to cover older people with chronic health conditions rather than the healthy young women most likely to seek elective abortions. We find Boehner’s statement to be False. Comment on this item.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2010-07-23T11:30:00	2010-07-13	['Pennsylvania']

pomt-05374	The Obama White House recognizes a "baby that has not been born" for security purposes.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/08/national-right-life-committee/obama-white-house-security-unborn-babies/	The National Right to Life Committee cried foul on Tuesday after it obtained an email from an Obama administration aide asking future White House visitors to provide information about their unborn babies. In a news release, the anti-abortion group said the policy was hypocritical because of the Obama administration's support for abortion rights. "Obama White House recognizes ‘baby that has not been born’ for White House security purposes, but tolerates legal abortion to moment of birth in District of Columbia," the May 8, 2012, news release said. The release was a response to an early-morning email from the White House Visitors Office detailing how to record the personal information of babies still in utero. "Crazy as it may sound, you MUST include the baby in the overall count of guests in the tour. It’s an easy process," Visitors Office director Ellie Schafer wrote to congressional staffers, specifying that nine zeros should be filled in for the infant’s Social Security Number. We confirmed that the email really did come from Schafer and is unaltered. But its meaning was wildly misconstrued. The National Right to Life Committee headline suggested that fetuses were being screened for security at the White House gate, while a Washington Times story said, "The pro-choice Obama White House requires pregnant visitors to count their unborn child as a person for tours of the executive mansion." Numerous conservative websites also picked up the story. Creative Minority Report ran it under the headline "Pro-Abort White House Counts Unborn as People on Tours." The email The confusion began with an early morning email to staffers on Capitol Hill. Schafer wrote that her office has received "a number of calls regarding how to enter security information for a baby that has not yet been born." She provided detailed instructions on how to fill out the security information: The baby’s security information should be entered as follows: LAST NAME: The family’s last name FIRST NAME: "Baby" as a first name MIDDLE NAME: NMN as in No Middle Name DOB: Use the date you are submitting the request to us as their birthday GENDER: if the parents know put that gender down if not, you can enter either M or F as we’ll ask you to update it at the time of birth SOCIAL: As they will not have a SSN and are under 18, you will not need to enter this field. Again if the spreadsheet asked for a social enter 9 zero’s (not the word nine zeros but 000000000 and yes it happens!) CITIZEN/CITY/STATE: The citizen, city and state should be entered the same as the parents Once the baby is born, you should send an email to the VO inbox with the tour request ID number, the baby’s given name, their actual birthday and gender. We can then update the newborn guest’s information within our system. Please note that any changes to security information for newborns must be made at least 48 hours in advance. She closed saying, "Keep being awesome!" The Right to Life Committee and some conservative websites said the email indicated the White House was recognizing that fetuses were relevant for security. The Right to Life Committee’s legislative director, Douglas Johnson, said in the press release, "It is ironic that President Obama's staff recognizes the existence of unborn babies for purposes of providing security within the White House -- yet, there is no indication that President Obama has any problem with the fact that throughout the District of Columbia, abortion is now legal for any reason up to the moment of birth," Johnson said. "Notably, the newsletter provides no guidance on what the staff should do if an unborn baby is first registered for security purposes, but then aborted." But is the Right to Life Committee correct that an unborn child has been recognized for security purposes? In other words, does a pregnant woman count as two at the White House? Ed Donovan, spokesman for the U.S. Secret Service, said people misunderstood the email. Schafer’s email, he said, was an explanation of how to fill out information for pregnant women who will bring their new baby on future White House tours. "This refers to a pregnant woman providing information for a tour in the future that will include the new family member. So when a 7-month pregnant woman is providing information for a tour that is 4 months in the future, there is a ‘place holder’ for the new baby," Donovan wrote in an email. In a phone call, he acknowledged the procedure may seem "a little anal." "I know people are construing it as an unborn child, but the visit isn’t occurring (now). If a pregnant woman shows up at the White House, we don’t count two people. It’s sort of a way of expediting (the process) so no one gets hung up at the gate," he said. Our ruling The National Right to Life Committee said that the White House recognizes a "baby that has not been born" for security purposes. It collects that information, but not for the reasons Right to Life suggests. The White House policy does not confer personhood status on fetuses, and it doesn’t count them if their mothers take a tour while pregnant. The policy helps pinpoint the headcount for future tours.

pomt-10444	"If you are driving on average in America this summer, you'll save — according to Department of Energy figures — about $70."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/06/hillary-clinton/only-if-you-are-a-family-of-four/	Sen. Hillary Clinton has urged a three-month gas tax holiday as a way of lightening the load on drivers this summer. The gas tax is 18.4 cents a gallon for gasoline — and even higher at 24.4 cents for diesel — so a cut could help consumers. Clinton has said consumers will save $70 from the holiday. Sen. Barack Obama, who opposes the holiday as a political gimmick, says it will only save $28. Who's right? The Clinton campaign referred us to Energy Department numbers that show a family of four with two cars uses 1,519 gallons of gas a year. (The exact average is 2.3 vehicles per family.) Take a quarter of the 1,519 gallons to represent the three months of summer, and you would see a savings of $69.87 on gas taxes. The number and the math are correct, and since driving tends to increase in the summer, it may be a little low. Barack Obama, on the other hand, arrived at $28 by calculating per-vehicle savings. We examined his statement in depth and rated it Mostly True. We'll note here that many economists think it will be even less than that because the entire tax cut won't be reflected in the price at the pump. Certainly, oil companies and retailers could decide to keep part of the money for themselves. But a cut in prices will also stimulate demand by making people more willing to use their vehicles. Increased demand is likely to send prices up, eating away at the 18.4 cents a gallon. The problem we have with Clinton's number is that she left out the reference to a family of four when she talked about it on This Week with George Stephanopoulos on May 4, 2008. "But if you are driving on average in America this summer, you'll save — according to Department of Energy figures — about $70," she said. And it wasn't the only time she left out the family-of-four qualifier. We found Clinton made the following statements the day after the appearance on This Week. "By our numbers, the Department of Energy suggests that it would save consumers on average $70," she said on Fox News' Fox & Friends. To Katie Couric, on the CBS Evening News , Clinton said she is "trying to give folks, on average it would be $70. For a lot of people it would be a lot more." "So here's what I believe, is let's give you a break this summer. For the average person it would be about $70," she said at a campaign event in Greenville, N.C. We'll say it again: You only get to $70 by calculating the savings for a family of four, which has two vehicles. Leaving out that qualifier makes a big difference. In fact, if $70 is the savings for a family of four with at least two vehicles, it seems likely that the average savings for an individual would be closer to half of $70 than the $70 Clinton claims. We rate her statement False.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-05-06T00:00:00	2008-05-04	['United_States']

pomt-04832	Says "a Republican hasn't won [an election] for a presidency in New Jersey since 1988."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/15/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-mitt-romney-isnt-counting-new-/	Mitt Romney can rely on the vote of at least one New Jerseyan in November: Gov. Chris Christie. But even Christie, a top Romney surrogate tapped to deliver the keynote address on Aug. 28 at the Republican National Convention, admits the rest of the state isn’t likely to swing in favor of the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. "I don't think Mitt Romney's counting our electoral votes in his column. I believe the overwhelming likelihood is that President [Barack] Obama will win New Jersey. I think all the polls indicate that," Christie said during an Aug. 7 press conference "A Republican hasn't won [an election] for a presidency in New Jersey since 1988. And so it's a been a long haul. Could it happen? Sure, it could happen. But I think if Mitt Romney wins New Jersey he's probably going to win in 45 other states," Christie said. PolitiFact New Jersey can’t check Christie’s electoral prediction, but we can test his claim about the state’s past votes on the Truth-O-Meter. Was 1988 the last time New Jersey went red in a presidential election? It’s true: a majority of voters in the Garden State cast votes in 1988 for the then-GOP presidential candidate George H. W. Bush. That wasn’t an aberration at the time. Republican nominees had won New Jersey in every presidential election since 1968. Bush took New Jersey in 1988 with more than 56 percent of the vote, defeating Democratic rival Michael Dukakis to secure a spot in the White House. But four years later, New Jersey voters decided against sending Bush back to Washington for a second term. Bill Clinton edged out Bush in New Jersey in 1992, grabbing nearly 43 percent of the state’s vote. Bush lost the state with more than 40 percent of the vote. Since then New Jersey has voted for the Democratic presidential candidate in every election cycle. Here’s a breakdown of New Jersey’s presidential voting history: Presidential Election Year Democratic Votes Republican Votes 2008: Obama vs. McCain 2,215,422 1,613,207 2004: Kerry vs. Bush 1,911,430 1,670,003 2000: Gore vs. Bush 1,788,850 1,284,173 1996: Clinton vs. Dole 1,652,361 1,103,099 1992: Clinton vs. Bush 1,436,206 1,356,865 1988: Dukakis vs. Bush 1,320,352 1,743,192 1984: Mondale vs. Reagan 1,261,323 1,933,630 1980: Carter vs. Reagan 1,147,364 1,546,557 1976: Carter vs. Ford 1,444,653 1,509,688 1972: McGovern vs. Nixon 1,102,211 1,845,502 1968: Humphrey vs. Nixon 1,264,206 1,325,467 1964: Johnson vs. Goldwater 1,867,671 963,843 1960: Kennedy vs. Nixon 1,385,415 1,363,324 Our ruling Christie said "a Republican hasn't won [an election] for a presidency in New Jersey since 1988." When Bush took on Dukakis in 1988, a majority of New Jersey voters cast a ballot for the Republican candidate, helping send Bush to the White House.

pomt-04893	Says U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV passed "only one bill" in seven years.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/aug/06/american-bridge-21st-century/group-says-connie-mack-has-passed-only-one-bill-co/	Woody Allen once said 80 percent of success is showing up. And that’s the point American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic super PAC, makes in a farcical online video that criticizes U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV for a shabby attendance record, and for not getting much done. "Connie Mack: Only one bill passed in seven years," says the video, which features a bummed out Florida family (presumably actors) unable to find Mack in Washington. "You think we’ll see him next time, pa?" says a disappointed child. "Connie Mack: If he doesn’t show up for work now, why elect him senator?" the video continues. Mack’s missed votes have made news for several months as he prepares for a likely November face-off with U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. PolitiFact found that although he’s not the most representative representative (sorry!), his attendance record is better than opponents have claimed. But did Mack really pass just one bill since he was elected in 2005? Here comes the fact-check. Mack sponsored only one bill -- during the 110th Congress in 2007-08 -- that was signed into law, according to the Library of Congress. The measure corrected a faulty map of Florida’s Coastal Barrier Resources System, which protects coastal landforms that conserve wildlife. The bill was passed "under suspension," which means it was so noncontroversial Congress didn’t put it through committee for vetting. Most of the other 46 bills Mack sponsored died in committee. "In this case, he didn’t have to jump through the normal hoops," said Norm Ornstein, a congressional expert and a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "That may be very nice for Florida, but it’s certainly not major policy." Yet, the numbers game often isn’t a fair assessment of legislators’ efficacy, Ornstein said. Some of history’s best lawmakers rarely saw their names attached to legislation. "It’s not just the number, it’s the quality. You could pass a whole bunch of bills that would be renaming post offices, commemorative resolutions, etcetera," Ornstein said. That’s one reason why accusations about attendance and effectiveness, which surface often in elections, are usually ripe for rebuttal. In fact, the video itself is a parody of one put together by former Gov. Charlie Crist when he ran for governor in 2006 against then-U.S. Rep. Jim Davis. "This ad used the same standard the Crist campaign used for the Davis ad," said American Bridge spokesman Matt Thornton. "There was some discussion in the media, but the consensus was that the ad was a fair." The American Bridge video doesn’t mention that Mack co-sponsored 700 bills since 2005, about 50 of which passed. But co-sponsorship is not a good measure of efficacy, Thornton said, because bills often have hundreds of sponsors who sign on for purely political reasons. "Anyone can co-sponsor anything," he added. Case in point: Mack was one of 308 cosponsors for a measure by Jacksonville Democratic Rep. Corrine Brown that awarded the congressional gold medal to the Montford Point Marines, a nonprofit veterans group. Brown’s office said that, while Mack was kind enough to sign on to the measure, he didn’t help move it through Congress. Still, it’s possible Mack was instrumental in some of the bills he cosponsored. And he also might have passed some of his proposals by tacking them on to other bills as amendments. Both scenarios are difficult to track, and Mack campaign spokesman David James gave vague responses to questions intended to pin down the congressman’s specific accomplishments. Mack’s record only proves that he focuses on repealing bad bills rather than passing new ones, James said. "Connie has run successfully four times for the Congress representing Southwest Florida on the platform of reducing government, not growing it," James wrote in an email. Also, he said, Mack has a plan to balance the budget -- known as the Penny Plan -- that has attracted support in Congress. Our ruling American Bridge is right to say Mack only passed one bill in seven years. However, they leave out that Mack cosponsored about 50 bills that were written into law and didn’t consider that some of his bills may have passed as amendments. Also, it's important to note that the number of Mack bills that became law is only one measure of his overall record -- and one that can be misleading when viewed in isolation.

It has to be very specific to the matter at hand."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/dec/01/bill-de-blasio/new-york-city-mayor-says-president-cant-defund-san/	New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio isn’t backing away from policies that protect immigrants living illegally in the country, even if that means cuts to his city’s budget. President-elect Donald Trump has said he will block federal funds to cities with policies or laws that limit their assistance to immigration authorities. New York is among jurisdictions considered a "sanctuary city." The Democratic mayor was asked on WNYC’s The Brian Lehrer Show how funding would be affected if Trump follows through on his promise. "I think the first thing is to recognize that from what I know so far because of a decision by the Supreme Court, no president's in a position to cut off funding across the board. It has to be very specific to the matter at hand," de Blasio said. "If we disagree in one particular policy area, there may be opportunities for the federal government to say, ‘well we are not going to fund you in that policy area,’ but not across the board." As other mayors across the country stand behind their immigrant-friendly policies, we wondered about de Blasio’s comment on how much is at stake. Can funding be restrained in certain areas but not "across the board," as de Blasio said? A key Supreme Court case The mayor’s press office told us he was referring to the 1987 landmark case South Dakota vs. Dole, which the mayor’s press office concluded "that federal conditions have to be reasonable and related to the programs they are attached to." South Dakota vs. Dole examined whether Congress exceeded its spending powers and violated the 21st Amendment (allowing states to regulate alcohol) by setting conditions for states to receive federal highway funds. Congress in 1984 enacted legislation that allowed the secretary of the Transportation Department to withhold 5 percent of federal highway funds from states where the minimum drinking age was below 21. South Dakota allowed 19-year-olds to buy alcohol. In a 7-2 decision, the Supreme Court determined that Congress within constitutional bounds "acted indirectly under its spending power to encourage uniformity in the states' drinking ages." The court also said spending power must be in pursuit of "the general welfare." Conditions set by Congress for the disbursement of funds must also be unambiguous, related to the national project or program, not lead to unconstitutional actions and not be coercive, the court affirmed. Constitutional law experts told us de Blasio’s comment is generally sound, but noted that the Dole case is specifically about congressional spending power, not presidential authority. "If Trump was referring to the possibility of congressional legislation that would make continued funding contingent on cooperation with federal immigration policy, then we have a possible Dole situation," said Christopher W. Schmidt, a law professor and co-director of the Institute on the Supreme Court of the United States at Chicago-Kent College of Law, Illinois Institute of Technology. Imposing across-the-board spending cuts for "sanctuary cities" would run afoul with at least one of the criteria set in the 1987 Supreme Court case — that conditions on spending be related to the national program that Congress is seeking to advance, said Franita Tolson, a professor at Florida State University College of Law. For instance, if the federal government gives New York money for mass transit, and New York doesn't want to participate in a federal initiative for education, the federal government can't in turn threaten the mass transit funds, said Richard Primus, a law professor at the University of Michigan. Trump’s administration "can’t cut off any federal grants to sanctuary cities unless it can show that those grants were clearly conditioned on cooperation with federal deportation policies," Ilya Somin, a law professor at George Mason University, wrote in an opinion piece published by the Washington Post. Conditions for funds also cannot be so great that the threat of losing federal money amounts to coercion, Primus said. Scholars pointed to the 2012 Supreme Court case National Federation of Independent Business vs. Sebelius, in which seven of the nine justices said it would be unconstitutionally coercive for Congress to withdraw Medicaid funds from states refusing to participate in the Medicaid expansion under the Affordable Care Act. "One might argue that the larger the amount of money at stake (or the ‘broader’ the threatened cut), the more coercive the condition, but there are other factors to be taken into account as well," said Lana Ulrich, associate in-house counsel at the National Constitution Center. In the case of sanctuary cities, spending power might be interpreted differently, Ulrich said. At issue might be the extent to which Congress may condition grants or whether Congress has the discretion to withhold funds for cities that are not in compliance with federal law," Ulrich said. Trump has not outlined extended details on his sanctuary city proposal, but he said that cities that refuse to assist federal authorities "will not receive taxpayer dollars." Our ruling In a discussion about Trump’s plans to cut federal funding to sanctuary cities, de Blasio said, "because of a decision by the Supreme Court, no president's in a position to cut off funding across the board. It has to be very specific to the matter at hand." It’s not as settled by law as de Blasio makes it sound, but experts say generally that the mayor is correct. The Supreme Court, in South Dakota vs. Dole, concluded that Congress could not coerce local governments to act based on the threat of withholding federal funds. Also, any funds that are withheld must be germane to the reason they are being withheld. The court ruling dealt with Congress, however, and not the executive, and there is ambiguity about both what tactic Trump might pursue and the legal precedence behind it. De Blasio's statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-13580	Milwaukee police use deadly force at a rate that is "among the lowest" in the country.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/aug/19/edward-flynn/milwaukee-police-rarely-use-deadly-force/	The day after a sniper killed five Dallas police officers, Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn held a news conference to share his reaction and to comment on policing in his city. He made an important claim that would become even more significant in the weeks to come. The chief stated: "We stand ready to be judged by the standards of our own training, our own selection criteria, our own highly limited use of deadly force -- among the lowest rates in the country -- as well as the remarkable examples, time after time, when police officers in this city are justified in the use of deadly force, but do not use it." Flynn made the statement on July 8, 2016. Five weeks later, on Aug. 13, one of his officers fatally shot an armed man during a foot chase in an incident that touched off two days of violence that made national news. (It was the third such fatality in Milwaukee in 2016.) So, do Milwaukee police use deadly force at a rate that is among the lowest in the country? It’s a broad statement that is supported by national data for 2015. But there simply isn’t national data to compare cities for prior years. Data is limited To back the chief’s statement, a Milwaukee police spokesman directed us to a fatal police shootings database for 2015 created by the Washington Post. Criminologists regard it as the best current source of information on fatal shootings committed by police. But since 2015 is the only full year of data available, it is a "snapshot of one year," University of Missouri-St. Louis criminologist David Klinger told us. Nationwide, according to the Post, there were 990 people shot and killed by police around the country in 2015 (as well as nearly 600 so far in 2016). A quick breakdown of the 2015 figures: 50 percent of the people killed were white and 26% were black. In 74 percent of the cases, there was some type of an attack in progress when police fired the fatal shots. There were signs of mental illness in 25 percent of the cases. Eleven of the 2015 fatal shootings occurred in Wisconsin, but just one in Milwaukee. Tyrone Ryerson Lawrence, a 45-year-old black man, was shot inside a home. He refused to drop a knife and an officer shot him, fearing that Lawrence would stab his wife, according to police. There’s no question that one is a low number -- particularly for a city with a population of 600,000. The bigger picture But Flynn made a general claim about Milwaukee having a low rate in the use of deadly force, not a claim about a single year. And numbers can vary relatively significantly in a given year. In 2013, for example, Milwaukee police fatally shot four people. We found that based on population, some cities had a much lower rate than Milwaukee that year: San Francisco police killed one person, while the number was three in Austin, Texas (which serves 842,000 people), San Jose, Calif. (982,000), and Las Vegas (nearly 1.5 million). To be sure, the raw numbers haven’t ranged widely in Milwaukee -- 2012 -- 1; 2013 -- 4; 2014 -- 2; 2015 -- 1. But without national figures for anything but 2015, we don’t know how Milwaukee’s rate compares. Our rating Flynn said Milwaukee police use deadly force at a rate that is "among the lowest" in the country. Flynn bases his claim on the best data currently available, which show Milwaukee police killed one person in 2015. But 2015 is the only full year for which data are available on a national level; we simply don’t know how Milwaukee’s rate would compare in prior years. Our definition of Half True is a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important information. That fits here. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3cbfca12-12cf-483a-925a-473d75049360	None	Edward Flynn	None	None	None	2016-08-19T09:00:00	2016-07-08	['None']

pomt-06352	Says that under his tax plan, "no matter where you are in the stratosphere, you're going to be getting a tax cut."	false	/texas/statements/2011/nov/07/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-under-his-tax-plan-everyone-will-b/	Talking up his flat-tax plan, Texas Gov. Rick Perry told Neil Cavuto of the Fox News Channel that every taxpayer should be happy because of its simplicity. Plus, he said, it’s "a tax cut for every group out there. No matter where you are in the stratosphere, you're going to be getting a tax cut." Everyone? Perry, seeking the Republican presidential nomination, spoke to Cavuto on Oct. 25, 2011, the day he’d announced he wanted to offer Americans the choice of continuing to pay taxes under the existing progressive income tax or shifting to a 20-percent flat tax with a few wrinkles. For people who opt for the flat tax, his plan calls for a standard deduction of $12,500 per individual and dependent in a household and preserves deductions for mortgage interest, state and local taxes and charitable donations. Perry also proposes to eliminate taxes on estates, certain dividends and capital gains, as well as Social Security benefits. He also wants to cut the corporate tax rate to 20 percent. His speech outlining his plan included a claim less sweeping than what he later told Cavuto: "Taxes will be cut across all income groups in America." When we inquired with his campaign, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said an Oct. 31, 2011, analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a joint effort by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution, supports the conclusion that, compared to current law, "Americans of all income groups are better off under the governor's tax plan." She said in another email response: "Americans across every income group will see a tax cut." We’d already consulted the center’s analysis in checking MSNBC commentator Rachel Maddow’s claim that under Perry’s plan, the rich would get huge tax cuts while everyone else would see big tax increases. We rated that Mostly False. Rich taxpayers would see sizable cuts, the center’s analysis indicates, but some others -- even low-income taxpayers -- would get tax cuts. Also, no one would be forced into an increase because everyone could continue under the current system. In a telephone interview, the center’s analyst, Roberton Williams, said the wealthy would enjoy big tax cuts under Perry’s plan because the 20 percent income-tax rate would require considerably less from them than the current maximum tax rate of 35 percent. Also, he noted, exempting capital gains and dividends from the income tax would help wealthier taxpayers. Capital gains and dividend income are currently subject to rates of up to 15 percent. "These are substantial cuts," he said. Those results aside, he said, "it is definitely not the case that everyone will get a tax cut." The center’s analysis says that compared to current law, Perry’s plan would deliver a tax cut in 2015 of an average $267 to about 25 percent of the nation’s poorest 20 percent of households, with annual earnings up to $19,342. This means three in four of households in this earnings group would not get cuts. About 45 percent of the next-poorest quintile of households, earning up to $39,862, would get a cut averaging $695, the analysis says. This means 55 percent would not get cuts. Most Americans earning more would get tax cuts, the analysis suggests. Compared to current law, Williams said, Americans earning more would fare better under Perry’s plan. At least three in four households earning $39,863 to $69,074 would experience a tax cut, averaging $1,722, with 94 percent or more earning $69,075 to $119,546 seeing cuts averaging $3,872, according to the center’s analysis. The very wealthiest 0.1 percent of households, earning more than $2.87 million a year, would get average tax cuts of more than $1.9 million, the analysis says. Williams said the center’s definition of current law presumes that tax cuts put in place since 2001 under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama will expire after next year, which will happen unless lawmakers intervene. Frazier told us the Perry plan presumes current tax laws would remain in place until the Perry plan passes into law. An Oct. 31, 2011, Wall Street Journal news article, states the presumption that the tax reductions put in place will expire means that under Perry’s approach, "a lot of people would actually face a tax increase compared to current tax levels." Frazier, Perry’s spokeswoman, replied to our inquiry about the center’s analysis indicating lower-income Americans would not get a tax cut by echoing Perry’s announcement of his plan: "Americans in every income group will receive a tax cut." True, some households at each quintile of earnings -- from the poorest to richest -- would get tax cuts under Perry’s plan, which promises tax cuts to the vast majority of households annually earning $39,863 or more. But it’s not the case that no matter where you are, you're going to be getting a tax cut. We rate Perry's statement False.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2011-11-07T06:00:00	2011-10-25	['None']

pomt-03162	Salaries for URI faculty are second to last among New England land grant universities and in lowest 20 percent of major U.S. research institutions	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/sep/07/frank-annunziato/uri-faculty-union-director-frank-annunziato-says-p/	For years, officials at the University of Rhode Island have complained that the state has underfunded the university, leaving academic salaries stagnant and forcing excessive tuition hikes. Frank R. Annunziato, executive director of the URI chapter of the American Association of University Professors, touched on the former issue in an interview with The Providence Journal in August. "If you look at the other land grant universities in New England, we are last [in faculty salary] except for the University of Maine in Orono," he said. "Our national organization does a survey every year. Of all the major research institutions, we are in the lowest quintile (20 percent) across the board. It’s a dire situation here." In effect, Annunziato doubled down on something URI president David Dooley had said. In April 2012 PolitiFact Rhode Island ruled True on Dooley’s statement that URI salaries on average were second to last among major public universities in New England. The source of the data is the same this time as it was then: an authoritative annual survey by the AAUP made public in its magazine, Academe. AAUP gets its information by surveying the leadership of the institutions, not its member chapters. The most recent survey, for the 2012-13 fiscal year and published in the March-April issue of Academe, broke down the average full-time salaries by position for 1,251 U.S. institutions of higher education. The positions include full, associate and assistant professors, and, for institutions that have the position, instructor. When we broached the subject to Annunziato, he said that he was talking about averages for individual academic ranks as well as across ranks. And he said he was merely quoting Dooley from our previous fact-check on university salaries. We’ll break Annunziato’s statement into two parts. First, is it still correct -- about 1½ years after Dooley’s representation -- to say URI salaries on average are second to last among public land grant universities in New England? The short answer is yes. URI is one of six public land grant universities in New England. For those states with multiple campuses and varying salaries for each, salaries at the campus where faculty is the highest paid were used for comparison. The AAUP database for 2012-13 shows URI’s salaries at each teaching level are lower than all the other New England institutions except for the University of Maine. That also holds true for the average salary for all ranks combined. At URI, according to the AAUP, full professors are paid an average of $105,100; associate professors, $78,700; assistant professors, $67,400; and instructors, $61,400. For all ranks, the average salary is $83,000. The highest salaries are paid at the University of Connecticut: $136,800 for full professor, $91,900 for associate professor, $73,900 for assistant, $67,900 for instructor, and for all ranks, an average of $101,400. (We should note that even though Annunziato relies on the AAUP data to make his argument that pay at URI is too low, he complains that the AAUP overstates average pay at URI because its survey omits "lecturer" -- the university’s lowest-ranking teaching position.) As for the second half of Annunziato’s statement, he said that he derived his conclusion that URI’s salaries ranked in the bottom 20 percent among major research institutions from the AAUP data. Annunziato said that when he mentions "major research institutions," he is referring to so-called Category I institutions in the AAUP data. John W. Curtis, national AAUP director of research and public policy, told us that Category I includes major research institutions but is "quite a bit broader than that." The AAUP categorizes universities according to the number and variety of Ph.D.s the universities award. Annunziato also acknowledged that he cited all Category I institutions, including public and private, for his comparison. In effect, that would broaden the pay gap because private institutions generally pay better than public ones. When we looked at the data, we found that URI actually is in the 20 percent to 40 percent range in average salary in Category I institutions -- not, as Annunziato contends, the lowest 20 percent. The AAUP’s Curtis confirmed our finding. Admitted Annunziato, "I will stand corrected." Our ruling Frank Annunziato said salaries for URI faculty are second to last among New England land grant universities and in the lowest 20 percent of major U.S. research institutions. He is right on the first point and wrong on the second. The judges rule Half True. (Editor’s note: In the interest of full disclosure, the author’s wife is a URI faculty member.)

pomt-15034	The Benghazi probe is "the longest-running congressional investigation ever."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/02/hillary-clinton/clinton-campaign-benghazi-probe-congress-longest-i/	Critics of the House of Representatives’ Benghazi investigation have recently begun to make a strong claim -- that it is officially the longest congressional investigation in history. The Select Committee on Benghazi came into existence in May 2014, charged with investigating the 2012 terrorist attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in the Libyan city that left four Americans dead. Costing $4.5 million so far, with no final report in sight, critics see the committee as a waste of taxpayer dollars and a partisan witch hunt aimed at Democratic presidential candidate and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Clinton is slated to testify before the committee later in October. In recent days, the claim that this is the longest-running investigation ever has gone somewhat viral. We saw it in The Hill, Salon, The New York Times, Esquire, MSNBC, ABC News and, notably, a Twitter account belonging to Clinton’s campaign. The Briefing -- an arm of the Clinton campaign that aims to counter what it considers misinformation in the public sphere -- tweeted on Sept. 30 from its account: "It's the longest-running congressional investigation ever. It's cost taxpayers $4 million. And what's it about?" Most outlets reporting this factoid have measured the length of the Benghazi investigation by how long the select committee has been in existence -- 72 weeks, or roughly 17 months. They note in particular that this is now longer than the Watergate investigation in the 1970s -- that committee existed for about 16 months -- and also longer than probes into Pearl Harbor and Hurricane Katrina. When we contacted the Clinton campaign, they pointed to some of those news reports as evidence. However, we found numerous examples of congressional committee investigations that have lasted much longer than the Benghazi panel's 17 months. Here are some examples, covering the period from when the investigation was launched to when a final report was issued: • House Select Committee on Assassinations, 30 months: In September 1976, the House established this committee to investigate the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., as well as the government's response. The committee issued its report January 1979. • Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor-Management Relations, 38 months: This committee looked into racketeering in the labor industry from January 1957 to March 1960. • Joint Committee on the Conduct of the War, 40 months: This committee had a broad charge to investigate the conduct of the Civil War, starting December 1861 and producing a final report May 1865. • Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program, 90 months: This committee examined questions about the awarding of defense contracts during World War II, running from 1941 to 1948. This panel brought national attention to a previously obscure Democratic senator, Harry Truman. These four investigations were -- like the one on Benghazi -- conducted by a special committee dedicated solely to that investigation. We found other investigations that also lasted longer than Benghazi but were conducted by permanent committees rather than special panels. For example: The Senate’s permanent government affairs committee spent nearly 30 months investigating the 2007-08 financial crisis. The House ethics committee spent about two years -- from 2008 to 2010 -- looking into allegations of misconduct by Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y. And a former permanent Senate panel, the Committee on Public Lands, spent more than two years, from 1922-24, investigating the infamous Teapot Dome scandal. The difference between select (or special) committees and permanent committees is important, because the latter have a variety of responsibilities that can affect how long it takes them to finish a single investigation, said Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute and an expert in congressional procedure. There’s also some room for disagreement over when an investigation actually starts and ends, said Douglas Kriner, a Boston University political science professor writing a book on congressional oversight. For example, the 1940s National Defense Program committee investigation could have several possible end dates, including the committee’s official closing in 1948 or the date that its first chair, Truman, was elevated to vice president in 1944. It’s also worth noting that before the Benghazi committee started the official probe, Congress held a variety of hearings on the attacks. But this is the case for many of these investigations -- and even if you take the questionable step of starting the clock with some of the earlier congressional Benghazi investigations, several probes through history still lasted longer than the ones on Benghazi. "On most metrics, reasonable people can agree that other investigations have been longer than (Benghazi)," Kriner said. Our ruling Clinton’s campaign said the Benghazi probe is "the longest-running congressional investigation ever." The clearest way to measure this is to look at when a special congressional committee dedicated to a specific investigation officially began and ended. By this measure, this claim is wrong. While the Benghazi investigation has lasted about 17 months, we found other investigations that lasted 30, 40 and even 90 months. And the number of longer investigations only goes up once probes by permanent committees are included. We rate the claim False.

pomt-08604	It's "not true" that since he's been the president, executions in Iran have increased by four times.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/23/mahmoud-ahmadinejad/iranian-president-mahmoud-ahmadinejad-denies-execu/	In an interview on ABC's This Week, host Christiane Amanpour asked Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad if he was aware that "since you've been the President executions in Iran have increased by four times." "That is not true at all," Ahmadinejad responded. "Not at all. Not at all." "So you deny that?" Amanpour asked, noting that the statistic came from independent human rights groups. "How do they know?" Ahmadinejad said. "They haven't come to Iran." The Iranian government doesn't keep statistics on executions. Or, at least, it doesn't make them public. But a couple of human rights groups outside Iran keep tallies on executions based largely on official or "semi-official" news accounts in Iran. Amnesty International, which opposes the death penalty, issues an annual report on executions in Iran and elsewhere around the world. According to Amnesty International's tally, there were at least 94 people executed in Iran in 2005, including at least eight aged under 18 at the time of the crime. Ahmadinejad became president in August of that year. That same year, 94 percent of all known executions took place in China, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the U.S. (which had 60), the report states. In contrast, Amnesty International recorded at least 388 executions in Iran in 2009 (the U.S. had 52). The report states, "the death penalty continued to be applied in political cases, in which individuals are commonly accused of 'enmity against God.'" In addition, the report states, a "sharp increase in the rate of executions was registered in the eight-week period between the presidential election on 12 June and the inauguration of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad for a second term as president on 5 August. Many of those executed were convicted in flawed legal proceedings, some after having made televised 'confessions.'" So that's where Amanpour got her fourfold estimate (94 in 2005 when Ahmadinejad was elected; and 388 in 2009). Without official government statistics, where does Amnesty International get its data? "Information about the vast majority of these executions comes from official Iranian sources: newspapers and provincial judiciary websites," said Ann Harrison, a researcher at Amnesty International in London, in an e-mail exchange with PolitiFact. "Very few come from other sources such as local human rights groups or family members of those executed. However, we believe that the true number of executions is likely to be higher, as the authorities do not publish official statistics on their use of the death penalty, and we always later receive reports of other executions, which were not known about at the time." Amnesty International isn't the only human rights group that keeps tabs on executions in Iran. Since 2001, the Abdorrahman Boroumand Foundation, a group that promotes human rights and democracy in Iran, has scoured 50 to 60 newspapers, websites and blogs on a daily basis looking for information on executions. Most of the sites are "official or semi-official state news agencies and prison websites," said Roya Boroumand, executive director and co-founder of the foundation. The foundation documented 127 executions in 2004 (the year before Ahmadinejad took office); 65 in 2005; 132 in 2006; 468 in 2007;381 in 2008; and 399 in 2009. "I can't swear to you that's an exact number," Boroumand said. "This is more or less what's reported." The foundation keeps detailed and well-sourced databases to substantiate their figures. Boroumand shared a spreadsheet for 2007, as an example. The spreadsheet lists the names of those executed, their crimes (most were for drug trafficking, murder or sex crimes), and the source of the information (such as the state news agency or a police office website). Boroumand warned not to assume the charges listed are accurate, however, as Iranian authorities do not allow the independent investigation and monitoring of cases in which the death penalty is enforced. While the totals are not exact, she said, they have used the same method of data collection every year. Their tally shows executions "have increased several times in recent years," Boroumand said. But they are not the highest number in modern history, by any means. In 1990, for example, there were about 900 executions, she said. But the number of executions dropped off in the late 1990s and early 2000s before increasing again the last several years, she said. Boroumand attributes the rise to "a more military-oriented government...So they are more arrogant." The United Nations does not track the exact number of executions in Iran, but an October 2008 report notes that the U.N.'s Human Rights Committee "expressed grave concern over the extremely high number of death sentences, many resulting from trials in which the guarantees of due process of law had not been properly applied." The report also says the "continuing high incidence of executions remains an ongoing concern, with a sudden surge of executions reported in recent months, which the authorities argue are part of efforts to combat drug trafficking." The report notes, for example, that on July 27, 2008, there were reportedly 29 executions, 18 for drug-related offenses. We asked Gary Sick, a senior research scholar at Columbia's School of International and Public Affairs who served on the National Security Council under Presidents Ford, Carter and Reagan, what he thought of Ahmadinejad's denial of rising executions under his presidency. "Ahmadinejad doesn't like to be reminded Iran is one of the leading countries in the world in terms of executions," Sick said. "And to avoid the issue, he lies about it." Again, the Iranian government does not publicly release statistics on executions, but we think the human rights reports provide convincing evidence that executions in Iran have risen dramatically during Ahmadinejad's presidency. The reports are meticulously documented, and are mostly sourced to government websites and government news agencies within Iran that have reported specific cases. And, while even the human rights groups acknowledge their numbers are imprecise (and likely under-reported), the same method for gathering the data has been used for years. That seems the best way, under the circumstances, to establish a trend. And so we rule that Ahmadinejad's denial of an increase in executions during his presidency is False.

pomt-11688	"(Fritz) Kaegi managed a fund that invested nearly $30 million in private prisons."	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2017/dec/29/joe-berrios/joe-berrios-reaches-too-far-attack-fritz-kaegi/	In a recent cable TV ad, Cook County Assessor Joseph Berrios accused his Democratic primary opponent, Fritz Kaegi, of profiting from the private prison industry during his tenure as an investment analyst at Columbia Wanger Asset Management. "Kaegi personally managed a fund that invested nearly $30 million in private prisons," the ad stated. "Prisons where women refused food to protest abusive guards, immigrant children as young as 5 were held and detainees died suspiciously. But Kaegi only saw profits." Berrios also aired a similarly worded radio ad. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The for-profit prison industry has long been the focus of animus for Democrats nationally, and the very concept of private prisons has been a source of controversy generally, so connecting Kaegi to it could score political points for Berrios. Investment funds like those managed by Kaegi contain dozens of stocks covering a diverse array of industries. We took a look to see if private prisons were in the portfolio on Kaegi’s watch. Timeline trouble Kaegi spent 13 years as an investment manager at Columbia Wanger Asset Management, where he oversaw the Columbia Acorn Fund with two other analysts. He gave up management duties of the fund and left Columbia Wanger on March 13 to begin his campaign. Our first call was to the Berrios campaign to find out the basis for the ad’s allegation. Campaign spokeswoman Monica Trevino provided a quarterly Securities and Exchange Commission filing from March 31 that showed the Columbia Acorn Fund contained 926,513 shares in CoreCivic, a Nashville-based company that manages 91 prisons and related facilities across the country. The shares are valued at $29,111,038, according to the filing. Trevino also sent an amendment to the Columbia Acorn prospectus dated March 13 that showed Kaegi’s oversight of the fund would end on March 14. Because the quarterly report includes time when Kaegi was one of three managers of the fund, he’s connected to the CoreCivic investment, Trevino said. "Kaegi has not (provided) any definitive evidence that when the investment was made he wasn’t there," Trevino said in an email. Virtual paper trail Interestingly, Kaegi provided the same March 13 document in defending himself. He said it shows he was not active in the fund’s management after that date and that CoreCivic and other stocks were added to the portfolio between March 14 and March 31. Kaegi explained he ran the fund with two other managers — lead portfolio manager Matthew A. Litfin and co-manager P. Zachary Egan — and no investments were made without agreement from all three. "If one person was against buying, you didn’t buy," Kaegi said. Kaegi consistently had blocked investment in CoreCivic and a few other stocks, but that ended when he stepped down as manager on March 13, he said. Neither Litfin nor Egan responded to our requests for comment. "I always thought these were bad companies" that "try to dress themselves up as real estate companies," said Kaegi, adding that he believes changing attitudes on mass incarceration make private prison stocks a risky investment. That’s in addition to ethical concerns over privatizing correctional facilities, he said. In a press release issued shortly after Berrios’ ad appeared, Kaegi’s campaign provided links to all of the fund’s quarterly reports from 2015 and 2016, none of which show CoreCivic (or Corrections Corporation of America, as it previously had been known) among its holdings. Kaegi also produced a summary from Feb. 28, 2017 — just two weeks before his management ended — that does not show CoreCivic among Columbia Acorn Fund’s holdings. "This is just about the most controversial stock you can imagine," Kaegi said. "Why on earth would I do that when I’m about to step down to run for this office?" A comparison of the Feb. 28 summary and the March 31 quarterly report shows several stocks — Bioverativ, Blackline, Brunswick Corp., Copart, CoreCivic, Credit Acceptance Corp., Pool Corp., Q2, Tractor Supply and TransUnion — that were added after Feb. 28. Kaegi campaign spokesman DeRondal Bevly said TransUnion was the only stock that was added while Kaegi still managed the fund. Our ruling Berrios said his primary challenger "managed a fund that invested nearly $30 million in private prisons." Columbia Acorn Fund, of which Fritz Kaegi was one of three managers, reported $29.1 million in stock of the private prison operator CoreCivic on its March 31, 2017, quarterly report. But Kaegi’s active management of the fund ended March 13, as documented in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing. Kaegi said the CoreCivic investment came after he was gone, and points to two years of quarterly reports and a Feb. 28 holdings summary to back his point. We were unable to confirm from Kaegi’s co-managers, but a scenario in which Kaegi during his final two weeks as a fund manager decides to invest in a controversial private prison stock as a last act before challenging an opponent in a Democratic primary in Cook County borders on absurd. Berrios’ statement contains an element of truth — the quarterly report on March 31 shows a $29.1 million investment in CoreCivic. But it ignores the critical fact that Kaegi didn’t manage the fund as of March 14 and that as recently Feb. 28 CoreCivic was not part of the portfolio. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-06431	"During my tenure as governor, Wisconsin’s overall tax burden went DOWN."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/23/tommy-thompson/thompson-says-wisconsins-tax-burden-went-down-whil/	Battered by some conservatives for supporting tax hikes as Wisconsin governor, Tommy Thompson is fighting back as he launches his U.S. Senate bid. When he announced his candidacy in early October 2011, the Republican signed a pledge to oppose higher income tax rates. Thompson said that over his 14 years as Wisconsin’s chief executive, he "always fought to get the long arm of government out of the pockets of working families." "In all, I cut taxes 91 times," Thompson wrote in a campaign fundraising email on Oct. 4. "And I’m extremely proud of the fact that I saved taxpayers $16 billion through my tax reform initiatives, and during my tenure as governor Wisconsin’s overall tax burden went DOWN." Thompson said he "cut income tax rates not once…not twice…but THREE times! Once we started cutting taxes we didn't stop." We’ll tackle a variety of claims about Thompson’s record on taxes and spending in the weeks and months ahead, but thought we’d start with his overarching statement that during his tenure from 1987 until his departure for the Bush administration in February 2001, "Wisconsin’s overall tax burden went down." That’s a hefty claim. Thompson is pointing to a measure ("tax burden") that goes beyond just the trend in total state and local taxes collected. Those collections roughly doubled during his time as income tax payments soared due to a robust economy for many of those years. "Tax burden" takes those total collections -- including property, income, sales, corporate and other taxes -- and divides them into all personal income earned in the state. It does not reflect what every individual experienced; it’s a composite measure of the composite statewide tax bite, or burden. The "burden" measurement is considered the gold standard for measuring tax impact. On tax burden, Thompson’s campaign pointed us to a 2011 study by the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based research organization. It put Wisconsin’s tax burden at 11.7 percent of the state’s personal income in Tommy’s first year, and down to 10.5 percent in his last. That’s a noteworthy drop. For perspective, let’s look at what some studies and measures show. Thompson said the burden went down, but for whom? Most significantly, were there tax increases in the 12 years in between his first and last that added up to a cumulative tax hike? First, a few important statistical notes. The basis of all relevant studies we found is the U.S. Census Bureau’s estimates of state and local tax collections. The Tax Foundation study cited by Thompson tries to adjust the census numbers to account for so-called tax exporting -- taxes on oil in Alaska, for example, are collected there but paid in large part by residents of other states. The group also estimates tax collections in years the census does not do so. Most tax studies we found, including state-by-state comparisons assembled by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, stick to the original Census Bureau numbers, citing uncertainties with estimating "tax exporting." The two methods produce numbers that agree on much of what happened under Thompson, with some exceptions we’ll note below. Neither reveal a consistent easing of the tax burden in the Thompson era. Take a look: The Tax Foundation study ranked Wisconsin’s burden the second-highest in the nation in 12 of Thompson’s 14 years -- but the state fell to a No. 7 ranking in his last year, fiscal 2001. The other studies showed some early progress but basically flat at No. 4. Here’s a closer view: Ten years after Thompson took office, the overall tax bite was the the same or virtually identical as in year one, according to both types of studies. But major tax cuts in Thompson’s last budget pushed the tax burden down at the tail end, compared with the first year. In the 12 years in the middle, the tax bite went up four times based on the Tax Foundation accounting, and nine times in various other studies. Income tax burdens -- largely because of major tax cuts under Thompson and state lawmakers in the 1997 and 1999 budgets -- dropped when comparing his first and last years. The burden surged up in most years, but then fell dramatically, settling in to a drop of 2.7 percent compared with his first year. Property tax burdens swung up in the first half of Thompson’s governorship, then began a major, sustained decline thanks in large part to state property tax relief programs and limits on taxes. In the end, that burden was down 5 percent when he left office. National rankings: Wisconsin was a top-10 tax state when Thompson started -- and when he departed. (In the most recent comparison available, Wisconsin’s total tax burden was 13th in most rankings based on the latest census estimates, but the Tax Foundation put it at sixth.) It’s worth noting that "tax burden" includes taxes levied at the local level, not just by the state. But it’s the best guage of a governor’s record because the state has mighty influence over local property taxes through state aid. A final word on the figures. There’s actually a hole in the census data for Thompson’s final fiscal year, July 2000 to July 2001. That’s a potential problem in judging Thompson’s record, because the drop in tax burden comes toward the end of his tenure. But researchers are mostly untroubled, saying the big income tax cut approved under Thompson took effect -- in part -- the year after he left. So Thompson should get some credit for the drop in the tax burden reflected in fiscal 2001-02, when Scott McCallum was governor. "The tax burden fell during (fiscal years) ‘02 and ‘03, the last two years covered by the 2001 budget bill, which was jointly developed by Governors Thompson and McCallum," said John Koskinen, chief economist, Wisconsin Department of Revenue. And don’t forget the Tax Foundation study does cover his last year, by estimating based on the previous year’s census figures. Finally, using the 2001-’02 year as a proxy for Thompson’s final one, we crunched the numbers on his cumulative record -- not just comparing year one to his last year. We found a net drop in the tax burden (9 or 10 percent) over the course of his time, depending on which methodology is used. Our conclusion Thompson told would-be donors to his Senate campaign that he’s "extremely proud" that during his time as governor, "Wisconsin’s overall tax burden went down." The drop in the tax bite came late in the Thompson era, and some particular levies such as income taxes were on a wild roller-coaster ride. Further, data weaknesses prevent a precise judgment of the trends. But Thompson referred specifically to the overall tax burden, a measure that is commonly cited in multiple studies. And based on frequently cited studies, our own calculations and observations by experts, his claim is on target with some clarification. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-01519	In 2012, "Wall Street" gave Scott Brown "more campaign contributions than any other candidate -- $5.3 million."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/sep/19/jeanne-shaheen/jeanne-shaheen-says-wall-street-gave-scott-brown-m/	As the race between Democratic Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and Republican challenger Scott Brown heats up, the attacks are growing more intense. In a recent radio ad, Shaheen accused Brown of being too friendly with Wall Street when serving as a senator from neighboring Massachusetts from 2010 to 2012. Here’s the 60-second ad’s narration: "Wonder why Scott Brown lost re-election in Massachusetts? Well, he was working for Wall Street, not the people. Scott Brown blocked a major financial reform bill until he could water it down and save Wall Street $19 billion. Scott Brown really delivered for Wall Street, said the Boston Globe. Even after the bill passed, news reports show Brown was ‘secretly serving the interests of Wall Street, working behind the scenes to help the big banks, not consumers.’ "Wall Street thanked Scott Brown by giving him more campaign contributions than any other candidate -- $5.3 million. Now, Scott Brown wants New Hampshire to send him to Washington. Wall Street’s once again spending millions to help. Scott Brown says he really cares about New Hampshire. Come on, don’t be fooled. No matter where he lives, Scott Brown will always put Wall Street first. And that’s good for Scott Brown, but not New Hampshire." That’s a lot to chew on. PolitiFact New Hampshire already checked a claim by a pro-Shaheen group that Brown’s actions had saved "big banks $19 billion in taxes," rating it Mostly False. But what about the ad’s claim that "Wall Street" gave him "more campaign contributions than any other candidate -- $5.3 million"? We decided to take a closer look. The Shaheen campaign pointed us to calculations by the Center for Responsive Politics, whose opensecrets.org website tracks a wide variety of campaign-finance data. It’s a trusted source that we’ve used many times in the past. The Shaheen campaign’s $5.3 million figure refers to how much Brown received in the 2012 campaign cycle -- when he lost his seat to Democrat Elizabeth Warren -- from donors categorized as being part of the finance, insurance and real estate sector. Their dollar figure is correct -- as is Brown’s No. 1 ranking among all Senate candidates for donations from that sector -- but Shaheen’s ad stretches a bit when it calls this "Wall Street." Most "finance" firms have a reasonable claim on being part of Wall Street, but a lot of the insurance and real-estate sectors fall outside that category. Also, not everyone working at these firms is a financial mogul, but their individual donations still count towards the total. So we decided to drill down a little deeper. We found a few sub-categories of "finance/insurance/real estate" that are a closer fit to "Wall Street." They include: • Securities and investment: Brown ranked first among Senate candidates in the 2012 campaign cycle with $2,682,872. • Private equity and investment firms: Brown ranked first with $556,092 in donations. • Hedge funds: Brown ranked first with $306,800 in donations. • Venture capital: Brown ranked first with $262,081 in donations. This provides support for the notion that Brown ranked No. 1 in these types of donations. But he ranked a little lower in two other categories: • Finance and credit companies: Brown ranked ninth with $54,450 in donations. • Commercial banks: Brown ranked third with $297,539 in donations. Meanwhile, Brown’s total haul from these six categories was about $4.2 million, or about one-fifth lower than what the ad said. This is not the first time that Shaheen’s campaign has used somewhat loose language in describing Brown’s donors. When a previous Shaheen ad claimed that "Big Oil gave Scott Brown $454,260," we rated that claim Half True, noting that only about 11.5 percent of Brown’s haul came from companies and individuals affiliated with the biggest multinational companies -- what most viewers would consider "Big Oil." When we contacted Brown’s staff, spokeswoman Elizabeth Guyton said, "Scott Brown’s fundraising is no different than Jeanne Shaheen’s in that they both accept contributions from the financial services industry. The only difference is that Jeanne Shaheen is hypocritically attacking him for it." However, in the 2012 election cycle -- when Brown was receiving $5.3 million from the finance/insurance/real estate sector -- Shaheen accepted just $64,139 from the same sector, ranking 65th among all Senate candidates. In the current cycle, she has accepted $565,935 from the finance/insurance/real estate sector, ranking her 21st among Senate candidates. Our ruling Shaheen’s ad said that in 2012, "Wall Street" gave Scott Brown "more campaign contributions than any other candidate -- $5.3 million." If you put together six categories that might reasonably be considered "Wall Street," Brown received about $4.2 million in all, and he finished first among Senate candidates in four of those six categories. However, the total amount is short of the $5.3 million claimed in the ad. The statement is generally accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-01975	Says Jeanne Shaheen "voted for a measure that would have amounted to a new national energy tax."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/jun/18/scott-brown/scott-brown-says-jeanne-shaheen-voted-new-national/	As he traveled across New Hampshire in early June 2014, Republican candidate Scott Brown sounded an alarm on U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen’s views on energy policy. Brown warned that Shaheen, a Democrat who faces re-election in the fall, is pushing for a "national energy tax." The claim was repeated on Brown’s website and in a series of press releases from his campaign, and was reiterated in an op-ed published during his "making energy affordable" tour. Brown said he supports a variety of measures to make energy more affordable without passing "Sen. Shaheen’s national energy tax." With the New Hampshire Senate race drawing national attention, it wasn’t long before Brown’s comments were scrutinized. Judy Reardon, Shaheen’s chief counsel, issued a challenge to Brown’s campaign on Twitter, asking the former Massachusetts senator to provide evidence that Shaheen supports a "national energy tax." "Please cite the vote," she wrote in a June 9 message. Brown’s campaign manager, Colin Reed, shot back in a press release that he found it troubling Shaheen’s staff didn’t remember Shaheen’s votes in Congress. "The simple fact is that one year ago, Sen. Shaheen voted for a measure that would have amounted to a new national energy tax which would have a disastrous impact on New Hampshire’s economy," Reed said. With Brown and Shaheen sparring on energy policy, we decided to delve deeper into the issue. We were curious about whether Shaheen’s record indeed showed support for an energy tax or carbon tax, as taxes on oil, gas and coal usage are sometimes called. The logic behind the tax is that by making natural resources costlier for individuals and businesses to use, a carbon tax would encourage the use of alternative energy sources. Most economists agree that a carbon tax would be effective, but the issue hasn’t gained much political traction. We began by asking Brown’s campaign to explain his statements. Brown campaign staffer Elizabeth Guyton pointed us to Shaheen’s vote on a 2013 budget resolution put forth by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., who has expressed support for implementing a carbon tax. The resolution stipulated that revenue generated by any future carbon tax must be given back to the public in some form. Shaheen voted in favor of the budget resolution, though nothing in that amendment would actually enact a carbon tax. Rather, the amendment offered a rough framework for how money generated from such a tax, if one were enacted, would be put to use. "I think that ultimately a fee on carbon pollution is inevitable, and the purpose of that amendment was to begin a discussion on that and begin the discussion about when that happens, what the best way to use the proceeds of the fee are," Whitehouse told reporters in September. "So from that point of view, I didn’t view it as binding anybody on a carbon fee, but I did view it as an assessment of the best way of using carbon fee proceeds." Although she was allying herself with a carbon tax supporter’s amendment, Shaheen’s vote wasn’t directly in support of a carbon tax. The second piece of evidence offered by Brown’s campaign concerns an amendment proposed by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Mo. Blunt has emerged as a persistent carbon tax opponent in the Senate. In 2013, Blunt proposed an amendment that would have increased the threshold for passing a carbon tax framework within the budget resolution to 60 votes. Shaheen voted against this amendment, even as some of her Democratic colleagues from energy producing states voted for it. Still, by voting against Blunt’s measure, Shaheen wasn’t directly expressing support for a carbon tax. Shripal Shah, a spokesman from Shaheen’s Senate office, said that Shaheen has never supported a carbon tax. In an email, Shah wrote that Shaheen supports "market-driven solutions" to address pollution, such as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. This statement seems to fall in line with the position Shaheen took when she first campaigned for the Senate in 2008. During a roundtable discussion at Seacoast Energy Alternatives in Somersworth, New Hampshire, Shaheen said she would prefer a cap-and-trade program over a carbon tax because it’s "easier to sell to the population" and "puts the onus" on the polluters. When it comes to the legislative record, Shaheen’s efforts to influence energy policy since taking office have been focused largely on boosting energy efficiency. Shaheen partnered with Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, to craft an energy efficiency bill that would launch a federal training program for energy-efficient building design and operation and establish a loan program for energy improvements to homes and small businesses, among other initiatives. The bill has twice died in the Senate. The most recent effort failed on May 12, 2014, when supporters failed to reach the 60 votes necessary to close debate on the bill and proceed to a final vote. Shaheen took to the Senate floor after it became clear the measure would not pass to remind her colleagues that energy efficiency is the cheapest, fastest and cleanest way to address the country's energy demand. "One of the things that I like about energy efficiency is that it doesn’t matter whether you support fossil fuels or whether you support alternative sources of energy," she said. "Everyone benefits from energy efficiency." Our ruling Brown’s campaign said that Shaheen voted for a measure that would have amounted to a new national energy tax. The campaign cited Shaheen’s support for a 2013 amendment that would have established guidelines for any future carbon tax. They also pointed to Shaheen’s vote against legislation that would have made it harder to pass a carbon tax framework. Shaheen’s campaign told us Shaheen has never supported a carbon tax, and we didn’t find any evidence to contradict that. One of her major legislative efforts, the Shaheen-Portman bill, focused on energy efficiency. Brown has a point that Shaheen voted for a revenue plan offered by a carbon tax supporter and shrugged off a proposal from a carbon tax opponent. Still, neither of those positions is the same as voting for a new energy tax. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Scott Brown	None	None	None	2014-06-18T11:45:59	2014-06-10	['None']
pomt-12162	Untaxed corporate earnings used to be "$2.5 trillion … I guess it’s $5 trillion now. Whatever it is, it’s a lot more. So we have anywhere from 4 (trillion) to 5 or even more trillions of dollars sitting offshore."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/03/donald-trump/are-there-over-4-trillion-untaxed-corporate-earnin/	President Donald Trump said U.S. companies have anywhere from $4 trillion to $5 trillion in offshore accounts — a substantial increase from just last year. Trump blamed the large sum of money on what he (inaccurately) considers the highest tax rate in the world in a July 25 Wall Street Journal interview obtained by Politico. "We’re the highest-taxed nation in the world, essentially, you know, of the size," Trump said. "But we’re the highest-taxed nation in the world. We have — nobody knows what the number is. I mean, it used to be, when we talked during the debate, $2.5 trillion … I guess it’s $5 trillion now. Whatever it is, it’s a lot more. So we have anywhere from 4 (trillion) to 5 or even more trillions of dollars sitting offshore." We’ve already rated Trump’s previous claims that we’re the highest-taxed nation in the world False. This time we took a look at the amount of U.S. money sitting in offshore accounts. How much untaxed foreign revenue is out there, and could the figure have doubled since Trump cited the $2.5 trillion figure during the 2016 campaign? The White House did not provide information for this fact-check. We’ll start off by saying there is no public estimate on untaxed earnings overseas, as there is no law requiring they be reported. Researchers can instead look at the indefinitely reinvested earnings on financial statements of publicly traded companies. Indefinitely invested earnings aren’t making their way back to the United States anytime soon, which lets them off the hook for taxes and thus fatten after-tax profits. They might go to overseas factories, prospective acquisitions or other investments. Other companies may instead take on a deferred liability, which entails a future tax bill -- but while currently untaxed, most go undisclosed, so they aren’t counted in the researchers’ figures. The nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation can provide a fuller picture, because the committee has access to total untaxed foreign earnings. However, that information is only turned over to members of Congress. The last time the committee made its findings public was in an August 2016 memo to two congressmen. In 2012, the committee said, $2.3 trillion of foreign earnings went untaxed. Using predictive models, they estimated the number at $2.6 trillion for 2015. The committee cited Audit Analytics, a third-party research service, to corroborate these findings. Audit Analytics found $2.4 trillion in indefinitely reinvested earnings. There was a $200 billion difference between the JCT’s estimate of untaxed foreign earnings and Audit Analytics’ calculation of indefinitely reinvested ones, which is what experts estimate the current discrepancy to be. Audit Analytics ran its latest numbers for us. The company found $2.8 trillion of indefinitely reinvested earnings are sitting overseas, as of July 2017 — far short of what Trump described. "It is possible that analysts are still working on entering information from small companies, but it would not change the number from the rounded-off figure of 2.8 trillion," Audit Analytics research director Don Whalen said. We also turned to the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which found that Fortune 500 companies — a slightly smaller pool — report $2.6 trillion offshore. ITEP included total untaxed earnings, not just indefinitely reinvested ones, in their studies of Apple and Pfizer, as these companies provide a disclosure allowing for a fuller estimate of their untaxed offshore income and generate a significant amount of earnings through this mechanism. "There is no reason to believe that this figure is substantially higher than what companies report and certainly not double the reported amount as President Donald Trump has contended without citing any source," said Taxation and Economic Policy senior policy analyst Richard Phillips. So what else could cause the discrepancy? Edward Kleinbard, the Robert C. Packard Trustee Chair in Law at the USC's Gould School of Law, said that firms double down their offshore tax planning when they expect a tax holiday, which is when they get to bring back offshore earnings while paying little to no taxes on them. "It’s plausible that people have accelerated their gamesmanship in the anticipation that in tax reform there will be another tax holiday," Kleinbard said. "But it’s not plausible to think the number could be as high as the 2 trillion-dollar difference between the data and what the president said." Another possibility is for Trump to have counted tax inversions, which is when a small foreign company in a lower taxed country acquires a larger U.S. company and thus reduces their taxes. But that would entail a change in the definition of untaxed revenue. And even if we were to make that calculation, Kleinbard said the number wouldn’t expand by so much in such a short time span. Our ruling Trump described untaxed corporate earnings in overseas accounts as growing monumentally, from around $2.5 trillion to "anywhere from 4 (trillion) to 5 or even more trillions of dollars sitting offshore." The highest reported number of offshore earnings is $2.8 trillion. That could be off by a couple hundred billion dollars due to undisclosed untaxed earnings. But experts agreed the discrepancy could not add up to Trump’s $4 trillion or $5 trillion estimate. Business optimism and altered definitions of untaxed revenue couldn’t bridge that gap either.

Today, it is a sprawling compound of over 400 buildings housing about 3,200 beds. Those numbers clearly mean a lot to management because on the hospital’s website, right under its name, is the statement "The world’s third-biggest hospital, in South Africa." That’s not quite right, according to our colleagues at Africa Check. Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital says it trails only West China Hospital, affiliated with Sichuan University in the city of Chengdu, with about 4,300 beds, and Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, which lists about 9,000 beds. But Africa Check found an additional hospital that edges out the Soweto health center. The Clinical Centre of Serbia in Belgrade has 3,470 beds available. So Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital ranks at least fourth, not third. It’s actually not even a close fourth because repairs and renovations have trimmed the number of beds open right now. A hospital spokesman told Africa Check that a more accurate current total is 2,888. For the curious, New York Presbyterian has 2,328 beds, Florida Hospital Orlando has 2,247 beds and the Hospital das Clinicas with the University of Sao Paulo Medical School has 2,200 beds. Our ruling Administrators of the Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital in Soweto, Johannesburg, said theirs is the third-largest in the world. Today, the hospital has 2,888 useable beds. A hospital in Belgrade, Serbia, has 3,470. The Chris Hani Baragwanath Hospital is large, but not as large as it believes. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-10936	"I’m the first Democrat to ever lead Scott Walker in an election year."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jul/26/tony-evers/evers-boast-beating-walker-poll-short-finish-line/	Is a blue wave going to hit Wisconsin come November? It’s a question that has been heavily debated since the election of President Donald Trump in 2016 -- and the wave of Democratic candidates who have won elections across the country in the months since. Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who was first elected in 2010, has warned about complacency and the prospect of Democrats winning the office in the fall. The race as of July is a still-dense field of Democratic candidates challenging Walker, who withstood challenges by Democrats Tom Barrett in 2012 and Mary Burke in 2014. State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers has been leading the field of Democrats in the polls, and in a June 27, 2018, campaign email made a claim we want to check: "I’m the first Democrat to ever lead Scott Walker in an election year." Is he right? The Evers poll When asked for backup, Evers’ campaign team did not point to any independent polling that confirmed a lead over Walker. Instead, they pointed to an Evers-financed poll that was conducted from May 9 to 10, 2018, by the privately-owned, Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling. Those who participated in the automated telephone interviews were not informed of who paid for the poll, and Evers’ campaign had nothing to do with the poll other than paying for it, said Jim Williams, an analyst with the firm. Respondents were asked: "If the election for Governor were held today and the candidates were Democratic Wisconsin Superintendent of Public Schools Tony Evers, and Republican Governor Scott Walker, who would you vote for?" The result: Evers received 49 percent, while Walker had 45 percent, with 6 percent undecided. According to a news release regarding the poll, the firm questioned 644 registered voters in Wisconsin. The poll had a margin of error of nearly 3.9 percent -- or, roughly the same amount Evers led by. Other polling in the 2018 race Of course, many campaigns do their own polling -- though they typically only release results that offer the most positive spin. Meanwhile, the Marquette University Law School poll has done a set of head-to-head matchups between Walker and Evers (and Walker vs. other candidates) in June. The poll showed the opposite of what Evers’ poll found: As of June, Walker led by a margin of 4 percent: 48 percent favored Walker and 44 percent favored Evers. Walker also led the rest of his potential opponents in head-to-head matchups. In the most recent poll, released July 18, 2018, voters were not asked about direct matchups with Walker, but Evers led fellow Democratic contenders, with 31 percent of voters choosing Evers. Still, about 38% said they did not know who they plan to vote for in the August primary, and it is not yet clear that he’d bode well against Walker if he does proceed to the November election. In the July poll, Walker’s approval rating was 47 percent, with 45 percent disapproving. So, the internal poll cited by Evers is at odds with the main public poll released during this cycle. But, the main question is whether his claim holds up when looking at past Walker runs. Polls in past gubernatorial races When asked to support his claim, the Evers’ campaign referred to past Marquette Law School polls during Burke’s run against Walker in 2014 and Barrett’s run in 2012, as well as a New York Times compilation of independent pollsters regarding the 2010 election between Walker and Barrett. (The Marquette poll did not exist in 2010.) At the same time, the campaign sought to refine the original statement. "There is no other proof of a Democratic candidate beating Scott Walker by four points in an election year," Maggie Gau, Evers’ campaign manager, said in an email. Now, it may be true that no candidate was leading Walker by exactly four points. But there is evidence of other candidates pulling ahead in some polls -- though not many. Let’s look at the elections. 2010: In a Marist poll that involved 811 registered voters in October 2010, Barrett led Walker by 3 points, 44 percent to 41 percent. The poll was performed by the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, a survey research center in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. That is the only instance Barrett pulled ahead of Walker during that election season. 2012: In a February 2012 Public Policy Polling poll of 900 registered voters, Barrett led Walker 49 percent to 46 percent. Another Democratic candidate in the race at the time, Kathleen Falk, also led Walker in the poll, 48 percent to 47 percent. Unlike the PPP survey Evers referenced in his claim, this poll was not paid for by any candidate in the race. Also like the Evers PPP poll, those results are within the margin of error of +/- 3.27 percent. A May 2012 Marquette poll also showed that among registered voters Barrett led Walker 47percent to 46 percent. However, the one-point advantage was the opposite among likely voters, who preferred Walker 48 to 47 percent. 2014: Polls showed the race between Burke and Walker as a tight one. According to a Marquette poll from August 2014, Walker led among registered voters 47.5 percent to 44.1 percent, but Burke led among likely voters 48.6 percent to 46.5 percent. Another survey, by Rasmussen Reports in October of that year, found Burke led Walker 49 percent to 48 percent. The survey pool included 973 likely voters. Our rating In a campaign email, Evers said "I’m the first Democrat to ever lead Scott Walker in an election year." He cited a single internal poll -- one at odds with public polling in the race. But there were two instances in which Burke led Walker -- however slightly -- in 2014, and one poll in which Barrett led Walker in 2010. We rate Evers’ claim False. (Editor's note: On July 26, 2018, after this item was published, an NBC-Marist College poll was released that showed Evers leading Walker 54 percent to 41 percent. That does not change this item, as Evers' claim related to past elections.)

pomt-07247	"There's a 1.5 percent to 2 percent overhead in Medicare. The insurance companies have a 20 percent to 30 percent overhead."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/30/barbara-boxer/barbara-boxer-says-medicare-overhead-far-lower-pri/	Amid a fierce debate over the future of Medicare, Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., recently compared the administrative costs for the government-run program with the costs for private insurers. "There's a 1.5 percent to 2 percent overhead in Medicare," Boxer said during an interview with MSNBC’s Chris Matthews on May 24, 2011. "The insurance companies have a 20 percent to 30 percent overhead." The issue is timely because Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., has proposed reducing the government role in Medicare for people now younger than 55. They would receive financial support to buy coverage on the private market. Supporters say such a plan is needed to keep the program fiscally solvent, while detractors say it would gut longstanding protections and promises to seniors. Boxer’s comment cuts to the core of whether a government-run program like Medicare has advantages over one in which private insurers take a primary role. First, we should define "overhead." People may think of it as things such as rent and electricity. But in health care, the term typically refers more broadly to administrative costs, including expenses that are not strictly medical, such as marketing, customer service, billing, claims review, quality assurance, information technology and profits. To measure the administrative costs for Medicare, we first turned to the 2011 Annual Report of the Boards of Trustees of the Federal Hospital Insurance and Federal Supplementary Medical Insurance Trust Funds -- the document prepared by Medicare’s fiscal overseers. The trustees’ summary listed total Medicare expenditures of $522.8 billion for 2010, of which $7 billion was characterized as "administrative expenses." That works out to 1.3 percent -- not far off from what Boxer stated. For the private insurance market, we turned to a 2008 study by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress. CBO cited data, compiled by the McKinsey Global Institute, that estimated administrative costs for private insurers at 12 percent. That’s quite a bit lower than the 20 percent to 30 percent Boxer cited. A different measurement by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services pegged the amount for private insurers at 11.1 percent for 2009 -- in the same ballpark. However, the administrative burden for private plans get more complicated the deeper you dig. There are large variations between different types of insurance plans. The data cited by CBO found that administrative costs were about 7 percent for employers with at least 1,000 employees, but 26 percent for firms with 25 or fewer employees. Meanwhile, in the individual insurance market -- that is, plans secured by individuals on their own, rather than through an employer -- the rate was nearly 30 percent, CBO said. A big reason for this variation, CBO and others have concluded, is that bigger plans can spread costs over a larger number of people. When we asked Boxer’s office for their source for the 20 percent-to-30 percent statistic, spokesman Andy Stone told us that prior to passage of the Democratic health care bill in 2010, health plans in California were only required to spend 70 percent of premiums on medical care, with insurers able to spend up to 30 percent on profits and administrative costs. He also cited some opinion and news articles that cited figures in the 20 percent to 30 percent range, and even higher. We don’t doubt that there are cases in which overhead reaches or exceeds 30 percent, but those cases are both anecdotal and at the high end of the range. The averages cited by CBO and CMS are significantly lower -- 11 percent to 12 percent -- and many of the bigger plans undercut even that level. There are a few other factors to consider: Is Medicare’s administrative cost really that low? A lively academic debate has broken out over whether Medicare’s administrative costs are really as low as 1 percent or 2 percent. The difference stems from whether Medicare essentially freeloads off other parts of the federal government for services that private insurers have to pay for on their own. Adjusted estimates for Medicare’s administrative costs cited by the Urban Institute, a think tank that does research on issues such as poverty and economics, range from 3.6 percent to 5 percent, rather than the 1.3 percent using the data in the trustees’ report. But Edwin Park, a health policy specialist at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said that the differences are overblown, since Medicare’s administrative cost total already includes payments to other agencies for such services. We won’t settle this question, but we will point out evidence that even when you control for the differences, Medicare is still considerably more cost-efficient. In one study, CBO found that privately run Medicare plans had 11 percent overhead, compared to 2 percent for traditional Medicare. Are "overhead" costs a useful way to measure the efficiency of a health plan? Not necessarily. As the insurance industry often says -- and independent experts generally agree -- the right kind of administrative expenses may actually lead to cost savings and improved outcomes. These include disease management, wellness programs and quality improvement programs. CBO notes that a heavily managed insurance plan may spend more on overhead but may end up with lower premiums and better outcomes, whereas a lightly managed program may spend less on overhead but end up charging its policyholders more, with less positive results. By this logic, a higher-overhead plan might actually be preferable. In addition, Henry Aaron, a health care specialist at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution, suggested that over the long run, Medicare could benefit financially from having higher administrative costs in at least one area -- anti-fraud enforcement. In other words, measuring overhead is worthwhile, but it has its limitations. Our ruling There is some disagreement over how much Medicare pays in overhead. It could be a few percentage points higher than the 1 to 2 percent that Boxer cites. But Boxer’s numbers are defensible since they come straight from the Medicare trustees’ report. Meanwhile, Boxer’s 20 percent-to-30 percent figure for the private sector is more squishy. Some plans have overhead rates that high, but only a fraction do, and the industry-wide average is quite a bit lower -- 11 to 12 percent. We’re convinced that Boxer’s underlying point -- that private plans have higher overhead than government plans -- is correct, if for no other reason than that profits matter only for private insurers. But for most plans and patients, the difference between Medicare overhead and private-sector overhead is not as great as she suggests. So we rate her statement Half True.

pomt-00558	Millennials "will be 75 percent of the workforce in the next 10 years."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2015/jun/15/mark-warner/warner-says-millennials-will-have-75-percent-jobs-/	The dominance of millennial workers -- the generation born from the early 1980s to the late 1990s -- is fast emerging in the United States, according to Sen. Mark Warner, D-Va. "Millennials are now 80 million strong. They pushed folks like me, the baby boomers, off the stage in terms of the percentage of the workforce. They’ll be 75 percent of the workforce in the next 10 years," Warner said during a June 4 interview on CNBC. Warner repeated the figure in a speech the same day to the New America Foundation in Washington. In both instances, he used it to illustrate what he said is a need to address the economic security of millennials who are coming of age in a "gig economy" where they earn a living doing short term projects rather than relying on a steady job with retirement benefits. We wondered whether Warner’s figure is correct. Rachel Cohen, the senator’s spokeswoman, sent us links to articles in The Washington Post, National Journal, Wired and other publications that used the 75 percent statistic. A quick Google search of our own found many other citations. But there were problems: None of the materials identified the original source of the figures and we couldn’t find it on our own. On the other hand, we came across an article last November in The Wall Street Journal that crunched projections by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and found the 75 the percent claim is a sham. We came to the same conclusion after examining the BLS data. The Pew Research Center defines millennials as those who are now aged 18-34. Using that age definition for millennials means the generation, in 2025, will be 28 to 44 years old. The BLS projects that 10 years from now, there will be 73.9 million people aged 25-44 in the U.S. workforce. They’ll make up 44 percent of a total labor force of 168.7 million. The Journal noted in its analysis that even if younger people in the generation after millennials -- unofficially dubbed generation z -- are included, the proportion still wouldn’t hit the three-quarters mark. The millennials and generation z workers would comprise 56 percent of the workforce in 2025. That said, there’s no doubt that the millennials are coming of age. Pew recently reported that during the first three months of this year, they became the largest group in the labor force, with 53.5 million workers, or 34 percent. Generation X has 52.7 million workers, also 34 percent, and 44.6 million baby boomers were working, or 29 percent of the workforce. Our ruling Warner says millennials will make up 75 percent of the workforce a decade from now. Projections show that they’re on track to make up about 44 percent of the workforce in 10 years. Clearly, the millennials are rising, but nowhere near the pace Warner describes. We rate his statement Mostly False.	None	Mark Warner	None	None	None	2015-06-15T00:00:00	2015-06-04	['None']

pomt-05052	Sixteen thousand new Internal Revenue Service agents will be "empowered to enforce" the new health care legislation.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2012/jul/10/tom-price/price-16000-irs-agents-will-enforce-obama-health-c/	Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has let President Barack Obama’s signature health care law stand, Republicans are grousing like it’s 2009. The law’s foes are dusting off 3-year-old talking points they used in their unsuccessful attempt to squelch it in Congress. U.S. Rep. Tom Price, a Republican from Roswell, recently revived this retro claim about Internal Revenue Service agents as he emphasized the court’s finding that the bill is constitutional under the federal government’s taxing powers: "This is indeed a tax. We talked about it at the time with the 16,000 IRS -- new IRS agents -- that will be empowered to enforce this new tax," Price said during a C-SPAN call-in show June 29. Sixteen thousand new IRS agents? That claim sounded awfully familiar to us here at PolitiFact Georgia. As presidential hopefuls, Ron Paul, Jon Huntsman and Michele Bachmann used versions of this claim, as have other politicians, including Georgia’s own U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss. Even the most accurate versions of this talking point earned mediocre ratings on the Truth-O-Meter. They ranged from Pants on Fire to Half True. Did this claim improve with age like a fine wine? We contacted Price’s office, dug through past PolitiFact research and looked at a recent IRS budget request. The main reason that past claims earned low Truth-O-Meter ratings is that the number comes from a partisan estimate based on squishy assumptions. This is how the IRS talking point came to be: On Dec. 19, 2009, the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan referee on budget questions, released an analysis of the Senate version of the health care bill that became the basis for the health care law. The CBO wrote that it had not completed cost estimates for the IRS and other federal agencies responsible for implementing the law. But it did say the IRS "would probably" need to spend "between $5 billion and $10 billion over 10 years." The CBO suggested nothing about how those costs would translate to jobs, PolitiFact National found. Republicans with the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee, which handles federal tax legislation, used the high end of the IRS’ rough budget number to estimate 16,500 employees might be hired to implement the bill. PolitiFact ruled that Republicans cherry-picked the high number to favor their case. Also, even Ways and Means Republicans acknowledged that the figure could be less than 16,500 new jobs. Their calculations do not take into account the possibility that some of the money would buy things such as desks and office supplies for new workers. In other words, it’s fair to assume the IRS will need to hire new employees. It may need thousands of them. But using such a specific figure suggests a degree of certainty that does not exist. Furthermore, Ways and Means Republicans did not find that the IRS would have to hire 16,000 or more new "agents," as Price and other Obama health care bill foes have said. That number was for "employees," a broader category that can include other workers such as administrative assistants, phone operators and staff attorneys. Now the IRS is hiring staff to implement these changes. Price spokesman Ryan Murphy told PolitiFact Georgia that current hiring numbers suggest that the 16,000 estimate is reasonable. We took a look at the IRS budget requests to check out this assertion. For the current fiscal year, the IRS requested funding for more than 1,250 employees to prepare for the health care tax changes, according to its budget proposal. Most would fill support roles in areas such as information technology or customer service. Fewer than one-quarter would be agents. For next fiscal year, the IRS requested funding for nearly 860 employees. Fewer than 10 percent would be agents. This places the agent tally for fiscal years 2012 and 2013 near 375. How do we rule? Price said that 16,000 new "agents" would be empowered to enforce the health care law. His claim carries a kernel of truth. The IRS will have to hire agents to implement these changes. But his statement misstated the findings of a partisan estimate. Ways and Means Republicans said that about 16,000 "employees," not "agents," may be hired to enforce the bill’s provisions. They also acknowledged that the actual number of hires may be lower. IRS budget requests for the 2012 and 2013 fiscal years show they asked for about 375 more agents so far -- far less than 16,000. And like other pols who have used versions of this talking point, Price used such a specific figure that he suggests a degree of certainty that doesn’t exist. Price therefore earns a Mostly False.

"I thought these were people who were proud to sacrifice for their country," Obama continued. "I wasn't asking for blood, just money. With the country facing the worst financial crisis in its history, I'd have thought that the patriotic thing to do would be to try to help reduce the nation's deficit. I guess I underestimated the selfishness of some of my fellow Americans." The problem is Obama never said these words. They actually come from the humorist John Semmens, who writes satire on the news. Semmens wrote his report in March 2009 after the White House abandoned a plan to bill veterans' private insurers for their war-related injuries. It was intended as a cost-savings measure, to save the Veterans Administration $530 million a year. Veterans groups opposed the plan, and the White House scuttled the idea. Press Secretary Robert Gibbs issued a press release on the matter on March 18, 2009: "The President demonstrated his deep commitment to veterans by proposing the largest increase in the VA budget in 30 years and calling VSO (Veterans Service Organizations) and MSO (Military Service Organizations) leaders into the White House for an unprecedented meeting to discuss various aspects of the budget proposal," Gibbs said. "In considering the third party billing issue, the administration was seeking to maximize the resources available for veterans; however, the President listened to concerns raised by the VSOs that this might, under certain circumstances, affect veterans and their families' ability to access health care. Therefore, the President has instructed that its consideration be dropped. The President wants to continue a constructive partnership with the VSOs and MSOs and is grateful to those VSOs and MSOs who have worked in good faith with him on the budget proposal." This chain e-mail is still going around even though our friends at the other fact-checking organizations -- Factcheck.org and Snopes-- have both already debunked it. It also contrasts sharply with Obama's actual attitude toward the troops. Look at this excerpt from recent remarks he made to troops in Afghanistan on March 28, 2010. "You are part of the finest military in the history of the world, and we are proud of you. And so I want you to know that everybody back home is proud of you. Everybody back home is grateful. And everybody understands the sacrifices that you have made and your families have made to keep America safe and to keep America secure in this vital mission," Obama said. "You've been there for us, tour after tour, year after year, at a time when too many American institutions have let us down, when too many institutions have put short-term gain in front of a commitment to duty and a commitment to what's right," he added. "You've met your responsibilities, you've done your duty -- not just when it's easy. That's why you've inspired your fellow Americans. That's why you inspire me. That's why you've earned your place next to the very greatest of American generations. And all of you represent the virtues and the values that America so desperately needs right now: sacrifice and selflessness, honor and decency. That's why you're here today. That's what you represent." The chain e-mail that purports to be Obama's comments on troops is maliciously false. But it's not the first time we've seen satire re-purposed for a chain e-mail, and it probably won't be the last. We rate this one Pants on Fire!

pomt-13554	"In Congress, (Cresent Hardy) voted to defund DACA."	half-true	/nevada/statements/2016/aug/25/ruben-kihuen/daca-funding-ruben-kihuen-oversimplifies-votes-tak/	Democratic congressional candidate Ruben Kihuen is accusing his Republican opponent of voting to defund programs that protect millions of people not legally in the country from being deported. At a recent press conference celebrating the fourth anniversary of President Barack Obama’s signing of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, the state senator directly accused incumbent Republican Rep. Cresent Hardy of voting to defund the program. "In Congress, he voted to defund DACA," Kihuen said. "He voted to get rid of the DACA program." Hardy represents one of the nation’s few true swing districts. We decided to check this claim because the topic of immigration reform is critical in a district with a huge Latino population. Reviewing Hardy’s voting record and public statements on the topic of DACA funding presents a more complex picture than the one Kihuen asserts. DACA funding Kihuen’s claim refers to House amendments on a 2015 Department of Homeland Security funding bill. The debate turned into a political fight over Obama’s immigration executive orders. Several amendments sought to block funding to DACA and similar programs. Then-Speaker John Boehner said the measures were in response to Obama "unilaterally" rewriting immigration law through executive orders. But Hardy and fellow Nevada Republicans Joe Heck and Mark Amodei broke with their party, joining 23 other Republicans in voting against an amendment defunding the original 2012 DACA program. It still passed on a 218-209 vote. The three Nevadans fell back in the party fold on a separate amendment blocking funding of Obama’s expanded DACA program and a separate executive order shielding parents of U.S. citizens or lawful residents from deportation (commonly known as DAPA). That amendment passed on a larger 237-190 vote margin. At the time, Hardy’s office said his votes represented a desire to not take away rights already granted to people in the program, but he was still opposed to what he called the president’s "executive overreach" in creating the programs. Hardy (and the other Nevada House Republicans) voted in favor of the final funding bill that included the amendment defunding DACA. The final bill languished in the Senate (Hardy signed on to a letter demanding the measure be taken up) until nearly reaching the point where the department would run out of funds. Republican leadership eventually stripped out the contentious immigration riders attached to the funding bill. Hardy voted in favor of the "clean" spending bill, joining Democrats and 74 other Republicans to pass the measure and send it to President for approval just hours before the funding deadline. In a statement at the time, Hardy decried the "unacceptable, unconstitutional and temporary" immigration executive orders, but said voting for the funding bill was necessary to ensure that the department didn’t fall victim to a "political stalemate." "Funding for the Department of Homeland Security should always be a top priority and not used as a political football," Hardy’s campaign manager Ross Hemminger told PolitiFact Nevada in an email. So is Kihuen right to say that Hardy voted to get rid of DACA? The answer really depends on which vote is highlighted — the Republican technically voted for a version of the funding bill that included language defunding the program, but he voted against that amendment in particular and went against the majority of House Republicans to vote for the "clean" version of the legislation. Hardy’s stance Hardy initially took a tougher stance on DACA before taking office. In an interview with the Las Vegas Review-Journal’s editorial board before the 2014 election, Hardy said he would have voted for a bill ending the initial DACA program but still wanted young undocumented workers to be able to stay in the country and apply through citizenship. He told the Las Vegas Sun soon after being elected in 2014 that he would oppose any executive action "granting amnesty" to the millions not legally in the country. More recently, Hardy joined with fellow House Republicans in voting to allow Republican Speaker Paul Ryan to file an amicus curiae brief in a state-driven lawsuit over the expanded DACA and DAPA programs. That case only dealt with the expansion of DACA and the DAPA program, which are consistent with Hardy’s votes. The DACA expansion and DAPA are stalled after a 4-4 Supreme Court ruling left a lower court’s injunction in place. Our ruling Kihuen said Hardy "voted to defund DACA" while in Congress. Kihuen oversimplifies Hardy’s record on DACA, which is more mixed than the claim lets on. Hardy did vote for a version of a bill that included an amendment defunding DACA. But Hardy also voted against that specific amendment when it came up on the floor, and he broke with the majority of his party to send the final bill to the president. There’s some truth here, but Kihuen is gross oversimplifying the matter and taking things out of context. We rate his comments as Half True.

pomt-08850	Allowing all Bush income tax cuts to expire on Dec. 31 "will amount to the largest tax increase in the history of America."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/08/johnny-isakson/isakson-warns-end-tax-cuts-will-result-historic-in/	In Washington, a simmering political battle is boiling over this hot summer. Some say it could hurt the checkbooks of virtually every American. The topic is taxes, specifically what will happen if the tax cuts approved under the presidency of George W. Bush expire at the end of this year. U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., offered his theory in a guest column in the July 28 edition of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. "Now, these tax cuts are set to expire on Dec. 31, and allowing them to do so will amount to the largest tax increase in the history of America," Isakson wrote. Republicans are pushing to continue the tax cuts in all income categories. President Barack Obama has called for the cuts to end, but only for high-income Americans. The tax cuts would end for individuals making more than $200,000 and couples making more than $250,000. Many Democratic leaders in Congress have publicly stated they support the president's proposal. Neither Democratic leaders nor Obama have said they want all of the tax cuts to expire. Some loyal AJC PolitiFact Georgia readers asked us to investigate some of the claims in the column by Isakson, who is running for re-election this November against Democrat Michael Thurmond, Georgia's outgoing labor commissioner, and Libertarian Chuck Donovan. We decided to focus on the claim whether it does amount to the largest tax increase in U.S. history, since other politicians are repeating it. PolitiFact's national website this week gave former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin a "Pants on Fire" ruling because she implied in a televised interview that eliminating the tax cuts for only high-income Americans would amount to the largest tax increase in U.S. history. Isakson, however, was more inclusive in his statement, which assumed all of the Bush tax cuts for all income groups could be eliminated. His argument was different than Palin's. Here's some background on the tax cuts. In 2001 and 2003, the Republican-led Congress approved a series of cuts that reduced the income tax rate in several categories. If the tax cuts expire, the 25 percent, 28 percent, 33 percent and 35 percent tax brackets will revert to 28 percent, 31 percent, 36 percent and 39.6 percent, respectively, according to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Isakson's office argued in an e-mail to AJC PolitiFact Georgia three reasons its statement is correct. The senator's office says it's the largest in terms of dollar amount, the largest in terms of how many taxpayers are affected and largest in terms of revenue effect as a percentage of the national gross domestic product. There's little research about the impact of ending the tax cuts in comparison with past tax increases or cuts. Jim Nunns, a former U.S. Treasury Department official who is now a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, shared some Treasury data with AJC PolitiFact Georgia. He included a 2006 report called "Revenue effects of major tax bills." The report includes a chart that shows revenue estimates of tax increases and cuts as a percentage of the gross domestic product. Most economists say that measuring taxes as a percentage of GDP is the most accurate way to compare tax increases that were passed years apart. The measure takes into account how large the taxes are in relation to the economy in which they are levied, and it eliminates the effects of inflation. The 1942 tax increase, approved to help fund America's fight during World War II, was 5 percent of the gross domestic product, according to Treasury Department data. Treasury officials say the end of all of the current tax cuts would result in 2 percent of the gross domestic product. Our own analysis also found it would be about 2 percent. Isakson's office said the 1942 tax increase should be viewed with caution because the data are inconsistent with later tax information. The 2006 Treasury Department report says a consistent source of revenue estimates was not available for all bills between 1940 and 1967. Isakson's office believes the better comparison is to a tax increase in 1982 that resulted in 0.53 percent of the gross domestic product in the first year and 1.23 percent by the fourth year, according to its analysis of Congressional Budget Office data. CBO estimates show allowing the three main provisions of the Bush administration tax cuts to expire would result in an additional $209.6 billion in fiscal year 2012 and $251.7 billion by fiscal year 2014. The 1942 tax increase resulted in billions coming in to federal tax coffers in inflation-adjusted dollars, according to the 2006 Treasury Department report. That total would be about $115 billion in today's dollars. Nunns, of the Tax Policy Center, said it's fair to compare the 1942 tax increase with what would happen if the tax cuts expire. The 1942 estimate came from the Congressional Record, which is the official record of the U.S. Congress. "If you look at the current dollar measure, you can see that would be an accurate statement," Nunns said of Isakson's statement. "If you look at it from the size of the economy, then it's not." Georgia State University economics professor Sally Wallace said she worked with Nunns and Jerry Tempalski, the author of the 2006 Treasury Department report, and thinks it's fair to compare the 1942 tax increase with the end of the tax cuts. "An overly conservative take on the early Treasury data would still lead to the conclusion that the 1942 act had a substantially larger impact on the economy, measured via GDP [than the end of the Bush administration tax cuts]," said Wallace, chairwoman of the economics department. The numbers show Isakson has a strong case that allowing these tax cuts to expire would result in more revenue than at any point in U.S. history. The senator's case concerning why it is a larger percentage of the gross domestic product than the 1942 tax increase is weaker. The 2006 Treasury Department report said a consistent source for the revenue estimates was not available. It did not say that the estimates were unreliable. The GDP is considered a more accurate way to measure the economy. Isakson's statement is misleading when you base his statement on the GDP. Therefore, we rate his statement as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-11956	North Carolina has "the strictest anti-gerrymandering standards in the entire country."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2017/oct/05/phil-berger/berger-says-nc-has-strictest-anti-gerrymandering-s/	North Carolina Republicans in 2011 redrew districts for members of the N.C. General Assembly that federal judges later ruled were gerrymandered to diminish the power of African-American voters. Fast forward six years. The legislative districts are still under the microscope of federal judges. The General Assembly has drawn new maps. And North Carolina’s new Attorney General, Democrat Josh Stein, says he won’t personally defend Republicans’ latest maps in court – delegating the defense to his staff. Enter state Senate leader Phil Berger, the most powerful senator and a Republican, to defend the newest maps while accusing Stein of a political stunt. Berger’s office on Sept. 15 released a joint statement with state House Speaker Tim Moore. "If Josh Stein’s partisan political bias has blinded him to the fact that our maps abide by the strictest anti-gerrymandering standards in the entire country, then perhaps it’s best that he is personally recusing himself," the two legislative leaders said. Berger previously boasted of North Carolina’s standards in a Senate floor speech, according to a copy of the remarks on Berger’s website. The claim on Berger's website is more specific, claiming that North Carolina's rules are the strictest among states where legislatures draw election maps. That disclaimer wasn't mentioned in the statement about Stein. Federal judges on Sept. 19 described NC’s 2011 legislative maps as "among the largest racial gerrymanders ever encountered by a federal court." So Berger’s claim definitely raised eyebrows. But let’s set the maps aside for a moment. We wondered what anti-gerrymandering standards Berger was referring to, and whether they’re the "strictest" in the entire country. (We’re putting Berger on the Truth-O-Meter because he has been more visible on the issue and because it was his office that released the joint statement.) To support his claim, Berger points to the redistricting guidelines in the state Constitution and a court ruling from 2002 that gives specific instructions for how North Carolina should carry those guidelines out. The state Constitution says legislative districts "shall represent, as nearly as may be, an equal number of inhabitants … Each representative district shall at all times consist of contiguous territory; No county shall be divided in the formation of a representative district." The Stephenson vs. Bartlett ruling from 2002 — in which, as Berger points out, a judge scolded North Carolina over maps drawn by Democrats — further strengthens the compactness provision by encouraging the state to use a specific formula to create compact districts, Berger says. What is gerrymandering? The term "gerrymandering" was coined in 1812 after Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry, a Democratic-Republican, approved a redistricting map that diluted the influence of the opposing Federalist Party by placing many of its voters into a select few districts. Mapmakers drew districts with oblong shapes to increase the number of Democratic-Republican leaning districts. Gerry’s hometown district resembled a salamander, prompting a local newspaper editor to call it a "gerrymander." The term is now often associated with election maps that have oddly-shaped districts that stretch across multiple regions. North Carolina’s 12th Congressional District, for example, was for years known for boundaries that slithered like a sidewinder down Interstate 85 from Winston-Salem to Charlotte. But gerrymandering can occur in several forms – regardless of district shapes – such as when a district favors one political party over another, dilutes the influence of minorities or other groups, or blatantly protects or targets an incumbent. There are multiple strategies for trying to prevent gerrymandering. Each state is required to abide by the Voting Rights Act and other federal laws. Otherwise, states have some freedom in choosing who draws legislative districts, as well as how many rules they want their map-makers to follow. There’s no perfect system for preventing gerrymandering, said Wendy Underhill, director for elections and redistricting for the National Conference of State Legislatures. Government can make laws and impose a system of checks and balances – but that doesn’t mean mapmakers will follow them. "It’s not clear what is better," Underhill said. "How do you know what’s better than another? The guideline is, is it constitutional?" Experts told PolitiFact some states do a better job than others of ensuring the map-drawing process is politically neutral. One way is by reducing the influence elected officials have over the map-drawing process. Who draws districts? Most states allow the legislature to draw legislative districts. This structure, as the Harvard Political Review noted, can lead to problems. "Allowing partisan legislators to redraw their own districts creates a clear conflict of interest, and historically the temptation to game the system has proven too great to resist for the majority party," the review says. About 13 states use commissions. Depending on the state, the commission can include members of the legislature and/or play merely an advisory role. Six states use independent commissions that are run by people who aren’t elected officials but are chosen by the legislature and/or governor. Experts often point to Iowa, Arizona and California as having some of the best structures for creating fair legislative districts. Iowa’s legislature has final say over the maps. But its governor has veto power, the state’s geography makes it hard to gerrymander and the legislature relies heavily on Iowa’s Legislative Services Agency. In Arizona and California, the map-making process is placed in the hands of independent commissions. In each state, Republicans and Democrats have equal say in choosing commissioners. One study, pointed out by Berger’s office, suggests that maps drawn by independent commissions may offer as much protection to incumbents as maps drawn by legislatures. Additionally, experts like Hans von Spakovsky of the Heritage Foundation cast doubt on the idea of commissions as impartial map-drawers. He doesn’t like that the commissions move the mapmaking process further from the traditional political arenas. "When a legislature does redistricting and voters don't like what they've done, they can always vote the legislators out of office," von Spakovsky said. "With these independent commissioners, if you don't like what they've done, you can’t vote them out of office." Republicans control NC Debates over commissions aside, other legislatures do a better job of including both political parties and have more structural checks and balances than North Carolina does. Connecticut, for example, requires supermajorities for approval of maps. In most of the states where legislatures draw the maps, the governor is involved in the map-drawing process and may have veto power, according to Justin Levitt, a redistricting expert at Loyola University. Levitt, who started allaboutredistricting.org, expressed concern about North Carolina’s maps in the 2013 and 2015 gerrymandering cases. He signed what’s known as a "friend-of-the-court" brief with other election law professors and redistricting experts. In North Carolina, the legislature (where Republicans currently have a supermajority) draws the districts and the governor (currently a Democrat) doesn’t have veto power over the proposed legislative maps. In fact, excluding states with independent redistricting commissions, North Carolina is one of only five states — along with Connecticut, Florida, Maryland and Mississippi — where the governor has no veto over the maps, Levitt said. In North Carolina, the party that controls the most seats in the legislature can control the entire redistricting process. "The biggest protection against gerrymandering are provisions that require that both parties have a role in approving maps," said Michael Li, senior redistricting counsel for the NYU School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice. "Single-party control is the biggest factor that correlates with extreme gerrymanders of the type that we've seen in North Carolina and Pennsylvania this decade," Li said. "If you take away the ability of one party to make all the decisions, you are virtually guaranteed to eliminate gerrymandering." Rules for drawing States can also prevent gerrymandering by adopting strict redistricting rules. Rules for mapmakers vary state-by-state. They regulate things like a district’s population, shape, partisan bent, inclusion of minorities and whether it favors an incumbent. This is where Berger’s argument comes in. He mostly focuses on the shape of districts, saying in online remarks and through his spokeswoman, Amy Auth, that the 2002 court decision prompted the General Assembly to incorporate strict metrics for measuring compactness. "The criteria also included a mathematical standard for measuring compactness … a mathematical standard which had never been adopted before in North Carolina or in many other states," Auth said. Experts place value in compact districts because they keep communities – often identified by city or county boundaries – intact. They say it’s unfair to include communities with unique populations and problems into one voting bloc. The influence of voters in, say, a farming community might be greatly reduced if the community was included in a district where the majority of voters were from an urban area. Experts acknowledge that North Carolina’s mathematical standard for measuring compactness can help keep communities intact. However, they say North Carolina’s rules don’t necessarily set the state apart. For one, the mathematical compactness standard isn’t written into the state constitution. While the redistricting criteria adopted this year by the legislature says districts "shall" be contiguous and "shall" keep county groupings as required by the 2002 court case, the criteria says mapmakers "may" use the mathematical compactness equation "as a guide." And, like NC, other states use formulas to regulate district compactness and contiguity, according to Levitt, the Loyola professor. He said Arizona uses part of the same test for compactness, known as the Polsby-Popper test, as North Carolina uses. He says Michigan also uses a compactness formula that's a variant of the Reock test, which NC uses, whenever there are multiple districts within a city or township. Meanwhile, "Iowa has three different formula for requiring that its districts be ‘reasonably compact,’ measured by comparison with regular polygons, by comparison of length and width, and by total perimeter," Levitt added. So let’s focus on state constitutions. North Carolina appears to be one of several states — including California, Oklahoma and Hawaii — where the state Constitution tells mapmakers to keep districts compact, populations even and counties as whole as possible. Charts published by the National Conference of State Legislatures and the Brennan Center for Justice, part of New York University’s School of Law, offer comparisons of each state’s map-drawing rules. Shapes aren’t everything District shapes may indicate whether an election map is gerrymandered, but they’re not the determining factor. Eric McGhee, a public policy fellow at University of California-Berkeley, said Berger may be right about North Carolina’s compactness formula being unique. But he emphasized that geographical guidelines alone aren’t enough to prevent gerrymandering. "If you're just talking about shapes, there's truth to it," McGhee said. "But if you’re saying there’s no advantage for either party, that's not necessarily true." McGhee and Nicholas Stephanopoulos, a law professor from the University of Chicago, created a new measure known as the "efficiency gap" -- the difference between the two parties' wasted votes, divided by the total votes cast -- which is a focal point in the partisan gerrymandering case from Wisconsin that was argued at the U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday. "You can have pretty districts and still deliberately, severely, and durably disadvantage the other side," Stephanopoulos said. "Your pretty districts are irrelevant to whether the map is a partisan gerrymander." Nate Persily, a law professor at Stanford University, noted that other states, such as Florida, have constitutions that bar mapmakers from drawing districts to favor one party over another. "The restrictions in the Florida initiative passed several years ago are stricter (than North Carolina) because they prevent drawing districts for the benefit of a party or incumbent," Persily wrote in an email. NC as ‘the strictest?’ PolitiFact found no evidence that North Carolina is considered among the states with the strictest anti-gerrymandering protections. Experts not only pointed to other states with similar standards, some scoffed at the notion that North Carolina’s protections might be among the nation’s strongest. Stephanopoulos called the claim "preposterous." He said, "It's true enough that NC (like many states) requires preserving counties, but I don't know how one could possibly jump from that fact to the claim that NC has the country's strictest anti-gerrymandering requirements." Theodore Arrington, professor emeritus of political science at UNC-Charlotte, also knocked Berger’s claim, noting that North Carolina ended up in court despite having compactness and contracting with prominent redistricting mapmaker Tom Hofeller. "What restrictions there are in the law are easily worked around given the use of sophisticated GIS software and the use of an experienced map drawer hired by the majority," Arrington said. And von Spakovsky, the Heritage Foundation expert, couldn’t say whether redistricting experts had ever considered North Carolina as having some of the strongest protections. "It may hold a record for being before the Supreme Court more than any other state," von Spakovsky said. "That doesn't mean the state standards aren’t good ones." Our ruling Berger claimed in a press release that North Carolina has the strictest anti-gerrymandering protections in the entire country. North Carolina may have strict rules for grouping counties and a unique formula for measuring compactness. But the legislature didn’t require themselves – at least on paper – to use that compactness formula, and other states have similar rules for the shapes of districts. Furthermore, experts consider other states to do a better job of promoting fairness by mandating the inclusion of both parties or, in a handful of cases, strictly prohibiting mapmakers from favoring one party over another. Perhaps most tellingly: PolitiFact couldn’t find, and Berger’s office couldn’t point to, an expert or ranking system that puts North Carolina’s redistricting standards among the nation’s best.

pomt-01448	"I’ve been involved in prosecuting a terrorist member of ISIS."	false	/texas/statements/2014/oct/03/greg-abbott/unsupported-greg-abbott-says-he-helped-prosecute-t/	Republican Greg Abbott let fly a statement of seeming international significance in the Sept. 19, 2014, gubernatorial debate in the Rio Grande Valley. Abbott, the state attorney general, defended his decision not to ease public knowledge of where explosive fuels are stored before saying: "We’ve seen the rise of terrorism. I’ve been involved in prosecuting a terrorist member of ISIS." Democrat Wendy Davis didn’t challenge his prosecutorial claim. But we wondered. The Islamic State group, believed to have tens of thousands of fighters, wants to see the Middle East cleaned of Western influence and put under ultra-conservative religious law. Since June 2014, it’s beheaded hostages (including journalists) on camera, conducted mass executions, captured American weapons caches, demolished ancient shrines and laid deadly siege to ethnic communities. Our look into Abbott’s actions led us through his state office to a federal indictment, news stories and an interview of the wife of the Austin-area suspect at issue. Ultimately, Abbott’s statement struck us as lacking in factual footing -- including whether the cited individual can reasonably be judged a terrorist. In July 2013, PolitiFact identified no ironclad agreed-upon definition of terrorism, which has been defined differently across think tanks and federal agencies. That story noted Bruce Hoffman, Georgetown University expert, wrote in 2006 that terrorism is "the deliberate creation and exploitation of fear through violence or the threat of violence in the pursuit of political change." His logic was that "all terrorist acts involve violence or the threat of violence. Terrorism is specifically designed to have far-reaching psychological effects beyond the immediate victim or objects of the terrorist attack. It is meant to instill fear within, and thereby intimidate, a wider ‘target audience’ that might include a rival ethnic or religious group, an entire country, a national government or political party, or public opinion in general." Abbott’s backup information By email, Abbott’s state spokesman, Jerry Strickland, told us Abbott was referring to 23-year-old Michael Todd Wolfe of Round Rock, who was arrested at a Houston airport on June 17, 2014, as he boarded a flight to Toronto, Canada. Ten days later, Wolfe pleaded guilty to charges he’d concealed a plot to provide resources to terrorists. According to a June 27, 2014, FBI press release, Wolfe had admitted in court "he planned to travel to the Middle East to provide his services to a foreign terrorist organization, namely, the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham/Syria (ISIS)." As of early October 2014, he was imprisoned and awaiting sentencing. According to a June 18, 2014, FBI press release, Wolfe’s arrest resulted from a Central Texas Joint Terrorism Task Force investigation conducted by the FBI in cooperation with 11 other public entities including the Office of the Texas Attorney General and extending to local police agencies and even the state department that regulates liquor sales. According to the release, the FBI investigated "together with the Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation, United States Citizenship and Immigration Services, United States Army Intelligence, Austin Police Department, Round Rock Police Department, Killeen Police Department, University of Texas Police Department, Travis County Sheriff’s Office, Texas Department of Public Safety, Office of the Texas Attorney General and the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission." Mindful the attorney general’s office doesn’t typically focus on criminal prosecutions, we asked Strickland to specify how Abbott and his office pitched in, fielding no reply to repeated inquiries. We also asked how Abbott concluded Wolfe was an Islamic State terrorist. By email, Strickland pointed out mentions of "jihad" and "battle" in the criminal complaint against Wolfe, which was signed by an FBI agent. Federal complaint According to the indictment, Wolfe violated a law (Title 18, United States Code §2339A) written in the PATRIOT Act of 2001. The law states anyone who "conceals or disguises the nature, location, source, or ownership" of "material support or resources" that are intended to prepare for or carry out acts of murder, kidnapping or maiming can be sentenced to up to 15 years in prison. Also on file in U.S. District Court in Austin: A 12-page sworn complaint against Wolfe signed by Blake Crow, an FBI agent who wrote that he was relying on testimony from agents whose identities couldn't be revealed. In the complaint, Crow describes multiple conversations with Wolfe touched off by Wolfe’s wife, Jordan Furr of Austin, when she spoke to an undercover agent about Wolfe’s desire to fight with "his brothers" in Syria, saying Wolfe "just wants to hop into Syria. He’s ready to die for his deen. He’s ready to die for someone, for something," the complaint said. Deen is an Arabic word meaning religion. Here’s our summary of key portions of the complaint: A different agent met Wolfe almost three months later, on October 26, 2013, and they discussed "violent jihad overseas." Five days later, the agent offered to help Wolfe organize a trip to the Middle East. Subsequently, agents met with Wolfe or his wife at least 15 times. On at least six occasions, between April and June 2014, agents phoned Wolfe to develop a travel plan. In one phone call the complaint describes, Wolfe expressed reluctance to go to Syria. When an agent called Wolfe on May 19, 2014, "Wolfe utilized coded language as he expressed concerns about traveling to join Jabhat al-Nusra based on information he’d learned about the group’s recent activities. Wolfe indicated he was more in line with another group." In a footnote, Crow, said he "believes the other group referred to by Wolfe is the Islamic State of Iraq in Syria (ISIS)." The agent called again on May 23, 2014, and told Wolfe that a man who would join them, another agent introduced to Wolfe as an experienced jihadist, "already had the respect of the brothers because he had referrals and recommendations." Wolfe, using coded language, "explained that, given the demographics of their group, it would make sense to go to the other ‘performance." In a footnote, Crow said he "believes that Wolfe’s discussion of the other "performance" was a reference to the Islamic State of Iraq in Syria (ISIS)." At the end of the phone call, "Wolfe indicated he had struggled with whether to stay or go, and stated, ‘...but now...I’m back to going, so I’m kinda like scrambling...’ with respect to financial issues." There were two more conversations between Wolfe and the agent in which Wolfe agreed to meet the agent in Denmark before they ventured together to Turkey. Crow said he "believes that Wolfe intended to ultimately intended to travel to Syria through Turkey, and engage in violent jihad." Another view Furr, in her first interview on this matter, gave a conflicting interpretation of the described events. The man who turned out to be an FBI agent, she said, encouraged her husband to go to Syria, via Turkey. Furr said Wolfe wouldn’t have agreed to do so without the agent’s pushing. Wolfe also didn’t plan to enter combat, she said, and didn’t agree to join the Islamic State group. Asked if Wolfe was a member of the Islamic State group, Furr said, "No, no, laughingly no. He doesn’t know anybody over there." But Wolfe pleaded guilty to the charges he planned to join the group, Furr said, because the FBI had insinuated the government would prosecute his friends and family if he didn’t. Membership in the Islamic State Weeks after Wolfe’s arrest, the Austin American-Statesman spoke with experts about homegrown terrorists. National "security experts cautioned against hyping up a terrorist threat in the United States, saying most defendants who have faced similar charges nationwide have been unorganized amateurs with little to contribute to armed conflicts abroad," the July 2, 2014, news story said. It’s not necessarily easy to tell if someone is a member of the Islamic State group, experts agreed. By phone, Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, director of the Washington D.C.-based think tank Center for the Study of Terrorist Radicalization at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, called the Islamic State group "an open network." "In part whether you’re a member ...depends on whether you call yourself a member," he said. However, he said, the Islamic State group "has a central command" based in Syria and Iraq that directs the group. "It’s not clear if someone is arrested as an" Islamic State group "member in Texas if they were acting on orders of central command or if central command is even aware of them," he said. By email, Henri Barkey, professor of International Relations and a Near East expert at Lehigh University, said he didn’t know at what point an individual could be considered a "member of ISIS." Barkley suggested we ask the person in question. We spoke briefly by phone with Wolfe’s court-appointed attorney, Horatio Aldredge, who declined to talk about Wolfe. Our ruling Abbott said he helped prosecute "a terrorist member of ISIS." Given Abbott’s silence on what exactly he or state lawyers did in connection with this case, we have no evidence to back up his declaration aside from a press release crediting a range of agencies including the attorney general and extending to the Killeen Police Department and Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. That release doesn’t say any of the agencies prosecuted Wolfe. Abbott’s statement also relied on a broad definition of "terrorist" and "ISIS member." The federal complaint suggests that Wolfe may have sought to be those things but does not offer evidence that he had become either a terrorist or ISIS member. We rate the claim False.

pomt-08129	"150,000 (oil spill) claims have been filed by Floridians, but only 40 percent of them have been paid."	true	/florida/statements/2010/dec/08/alex-sink/alex-sink-says-bp-claims-administrator-slow-respon/	In her last meeting of the Florida Cabinet, state Chief Financial Officer and unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate Alex Sink took BP claims administrator Ken Feinberg to task for failing to live up to his promise to swiftly respond to oil spill claims from Floridians and Florida business owners. Sink, who has been critical of BP and the handling of the claims process, said Floridians are having their claims denied without being given a reason, that people in similar situations are having their claims processed differently, and that Feinberg has been "incredibly unresponsive to Floridians and to Florida business owners. "It just reveals that this process continues to be inefficient," Sink said near the end of a five-hour Cabinet meeting on Dec. 7, 2010. "One hundred, fifty thousand claims have been filed by Floridians, but only 40 percent of them have been paid, a third of them have been denied ... and then we have 20 percent that are still in limbo land." Now, more than seven months after the initial Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion, we wanted to see if Sink is describing the speed of the claims process correctly. To recap, President Barack Obama selected Feinberg to manage the disbursement of $20 billion provided by BP to compensate spill victims through something called the Gulf Coast Claims Facility. Feinberg has been criticized by politicians at the state and national level for months for what some politicians have called a much too slow response. Sink spokesman Kevin Cate pointed us to the Gulf Coast Claims Facility's own analysis as evidence of the slow claims process. Cate used the latest statistics available for Dec. 7. Claim figures Claims Number Percent Total filed 153,360 100 Paid or approved for payment 65,676 42.8 Denied 59,799 39 Under review or needing more documentation 27,885 18.2 We should note that as of Dec. 7, Feinberg has awarded more than $900 million to Floridians and Florida business owners. Almost all of the money paid out is compensation for lost earnings or profits. You can read the latest report for yourself here. In lashing out against BP claims administrator Feinberg, Sink noted that of all claims made in Florida following the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, only 40 percent had been paid. She's just about right on. So far, about 43 percent of claims submitted by Floridians or Florida business owners have been paid, another 39 percent have been denied and a little more than 18 percent are still under some type of review. We rate Sink's claim True.	None	Alex Sink	None	None	None	2010-12-08T17:50:46	2010-12-07	['None']
pomt-08856	Rob Portman has taken more than $125,000 from "Big Oil."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/06/lee-fisher/lee-fisher-accuses-rob-portman-taking-big-contribu/	"Big Oil" is emerging as the Halliburton of the Democrats’ 2010 campaigns, a convenient villain that conjures images of spoiled beaches and oil-covered birds. And since a BP deep-water well in the Gulf of Mexico began spewing crude after an April 20 explosion, "Big Oil" has become a synonym for "big industry that needs a whipping." That’s why Lee Fisher, the Ohio lieutenant governor running for U.S. Senate, is highlighting the "Big Oil" campaign donations that his opponent, Rob Portman, has received. Fisher, a Democrat, wants BP to pay for all damages and losses, and he suggests that Portman prefers lenience for BP. By noting the money the Republican’s campaign has received, Fisher implies that Portman will do BP’s bidding. In a June 16 statement, the Fisher campaign said: "To date, Congressman Rob Portman, who spent 20 years in Washington and has taken more than $125,000 from Big Oil for his Senate campaign, has remained silent on the BP spill, the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history." There are legitimate differences between the two candidates, and at the time Fisher’s campaign issued this statement, Portman’s views on BP weren’t known. But Portman subsequently told Ron Ponder, a Canton-area radio host, on June 30 that "I agree that they are responsible. I agree they ought to be paying not just for cleanup but for the economic damage that's been done." Still, Fisher’s statement on Portman’s silence appeared to be accurate when the claim was made. But what of the other part of the claim? Has Portman taken at least $125,000 from the oil industry? We checked first with CQMoneyLine, which sorts contribution information that the campaigns report to the Federal Election Commission. CQMoneyLine data shows that political action committees representing the energy and natural resources industries have donated $122,400 to Portman’s campaign. That’s awfully close to $125,000 -- but the individual contributions within that category include companies that are not in the oil or even natural gas exploration businesses. Several of those donations came from utility companies including the PACs of FirstEnergy Corp. and American Electric Power. Call them Big Electricity, but don’t call them Big Oil. Other donations came from PACs for nuclear energy, coal and even copper mining interests. So those should be taken out. In the spirit of generosity, we’ll leave in PAC contributions from firms such as Koch Industries and Halliburton, which conduct an array of oil and non-oil businesses, and we’ll even leave in those from natural gas companies that have only a small portion of their business in oil exploration or production. Even so, we found that at least $46,000 of that $122,400 had nothing to do with "Big Oil." That didn’t make Fisher wrong, however, because other groups aggregate the data differently and CQMoneyLine only measured PAC contributions, excluding donations from individuals who work for oil and gas companies. So we turned to the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent group that tracks campaign contributions. That’s where the Fisher campaign says it got its figure, in fact. The center’s website, www.opensecrets.org, puts Portman’s current political take from the oil and gas industries at $132,008. The figure is higher than Fisher’s claim of $125,000 because the data has been updated since the Fisher campaign first made the statement, according to a Fisher spokesman. An even higher figure for the oil and gas will probably emerge as new FEC filings are tallied. We wanted to drill down further, so the center gave us more detailed information than it has on its website, and we did some additional checking of lobbying records and original FEC filings from the Portman campaign. It appeared that Fisher’s claim about the sum of Portman’s "Big Oil" claim was largely correct. We then took out the PAC contributions of companies like Koch and Halliburton, since those companies engage in other businesses as well as oil, just to see how the numbers would change. That took us to $122,008, which is pretty close to Fisher’s $125,000 claim. But there are two caveats: Of the $132,008 listed by the Center for Responsive Politics, $58,000 came from the PACs of oil-related companies and $74,008 came from individuals. It appears that most of the individuals were top executives or officers of the companies, but there was inadequate information to know about every single one. In a spot check, we found an accountant and a human resources officer, for example. Without knowing the motives and politics of every single contributor, it is impossible for us – or for Fisher – to know whether accountants and personnel executives contributed to Portman because they want to further the aims of "Big Oil." That gets us back to BP, since BP’s spill and liability provided Fisher’s line of attack. Fisher suggested that Portman was ducking the hard questions on BP and, by citing the "Big Oil" contributions, Fisher implied that campaign money could be a reason. But BP has had only one contribution to Portman, according to the Center for Responsive Politics as well as CQ MoneyLine. It actually comes from the BP Corporation North America PAC. And it is for only $1,000 and was made on March 19, a month before the oil spill began. Fisher’s number is essentially correct, but it’s important to note that the the bulk of the contributions came from oil industry employees, not the companies themselves. So we rate Fisher’s claim Mostly True. Comment on this item.	None	Lee Fisher	None	None	None	2010-08-06T08:00:00	2010-06-16	['None']
pomt-02750	Says he would have "almost twice the actual experience practicing law" Greg Abbott did on becoming attorney general of Texas.	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/dec/16/sam-houston/sam-houston-private-practice-longer-greg-abbott-wa/	The only Democrat running for Texas attorney general claims more experience in practicing law than the incumbent started the job with. Sam Houston, a Houston lawyer unrelated to the historical figure of the same name, includes this on his campaign website: "As a practicing Texas attorney with 26 years of experience, Sam Houston would enter the Attorney General’s office with almost twice the actual experience practicing law than did Greg Abbott." It’s an all-lawyer field bidding to replace gubernatorial hopeful Abbott, though state law doesn’t require that the attorney general be a practicing lawyer. The Republicans running in the March 2014 primary are state Rep. Dan Branch of Dallas, who chairs the House Higher Education Committee, who got his law license in 1983, according to the State Bar of Texas’ website; freshman state Sen. Ken Paxton of McKinney, vice chair of the Senate Transportation Committee and former House member licensed to practice law in 1991; and Texas Railroad Commission Chairman Barry Smitherman of Austin, licensed in 1984. Houston told us by phone that though he’s not addressing his potential opponents’ experience with this claim, he is making a statement about elected officials holding the position. "What I think is wrong with the AG’s office is it’s been politicized," he said. "I frankly think litigation experience is extremely important," he said, naming skills such as deciding which cases to pursue and advising clients. The attorney general acts as the state’s chief lawyer, whose duties as identified in the Texas Constitution include representing Texas in state Supreme Court cases, preventing corporations from exercising illegal powers or collecting illegal taxes and giving legal advice to state officials. Both Abbott and his predecessor, John Cornyn, were judges before becoming attorney general, Houston noted. "It’s a fine thing to be a judge, but that’s a different skill set," he said. Abbott and Houston both got bachelor’s degrees at the University of Texas; Houston’s law degree is from Baylor University and Abbott’s from Vanderbilt University in Nashville, Tenn. According to the bar association, Abbott’s law license is dated Nov. 8, 1985, and Houston’s Nov. 6, 1987. News stories from Texas papers covering Abbott’s past campaigns and positions said he started his law career at Butler and Binion in Houston. There, the Dallas Morning News wrote Oct. 22, 2002, Abbott "focused on tort litigation, doing work for banks and defending hospitals against malpractice claims." Abbott was elected a state trial judge in Harris County’s 129th District Court in 1992 and served three terms. Appointed by then-Gov. George W. Bush to the Texas Supreme Court in 1995, Abbott started there in 1996 and won election twice to stay there. He resigned in June 2001 to run for another office, the news stories said, meantime becoming an appellate lawyer at Bracewell and Patterson in Austin. Human resources assistant Vira Santellena at the Houston office of the firm, now called Bracewell and Giuliani, told us by phone that Abbott was employed there from August 2001 through November 2002. In November 2002, Abbott defeated Democrat Kirk Watson, now a state senator from Austin, and was sworn in as attorney general Dec. 2, 2002. Judging by the dates involved, Abbott lawyered for Butler and Binion seven years, from about November 1987 through November 1992, then a year and a half at Bracewell and Patterson. That’d round up to nine years of private practice. Mary Bell, a spokeswoman for Houston, told us by phone, "What we’re saying is if you add up his private practice, that’s nine years." As she emailed us career information on both men, she added, "If you were to include" Abbott’s "time on the bench as time he was a practicing attorney, the total years is 17. Sam enters this race as a candidate with 26 years as a practicing attorney." Houston’s career is easier to sum up because he’s worked since 1992 for a firm he helped start -- Shepherd, Scott, Clawater and Houston, formerly Cruse, Scott, Henderson and Allen. The firm changed its name in April 2010, office administrator Regina Thompson told us by phone. After law school, according to news stories and Bell’s information, Houston began in 1987 at Andrews Kurth in Houston. Thompson said he started with Cruse, Scott on the firm’s first day, June 1, 1992, and is now a co-managing partner. A Feb. 25, 2008, Houston Chronicle news story about Houston’s 2008 state Supreme Court bid said Houston had been doing "mostly civil defense work, but he also has represented plaintiffs." Starting the clock in November 1987, Houston’s lawyering experience will total 27 years by the 2014 election. To count or not to count Abbott’s nine-ish years on the bench? We can see one school of thought might be that most people think of "practicing law" as representing clients. Then again, the state Supreme Court counts years on the bench toward the requirement that its justices must have practiced law for 10 years (district judges need only have been licensed in Texas for four years). Houston asked us to look at specific parts of the state’s codes of judicial conduct and the law governing the Texas bar. The code of conduct says a Texas judge "shall not practice law except as permitted by state law or this code"; exceptions we saw mostly allow judges to give legal advice to or draft documents for their own families and teach or write about law. State law on what constitutes "unauthorized conduct of law" says, "In this chapter the ‘practice of law’ means" preparing a plea or other document in response to legal action, managing such an action or acting on behalf of a client in court, as well as services outside court such as giving advice or drafting wills and contracts. In addition, reference librarian Ruth Harrison at the Texas State Law Library found us the Black’s Law Dictionary definition for "practice of law," which makes no mention of judicial experience: The professional work of a duly licensed lawyer, encompassing a broad range of services such as conducting cases in court, preparing papers necessary to bring about various transactions from conveying land to effecting corporate mergers, preparing legal opinions on various points of law, drafting wills and other estate-planning documents, and advising clients on legal questions. Our ruling Houston, who’s nearing 27 years of private practice, said he would have "almost twice the actual experience practicing law" that Abbott did on taking office. That would require Houston to have 18 years’ experience if only Abbott’s private practice is tallied, but 34 years if Abbott’s time as a judge is counted We rate Houston’s claim as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-12465	"Nobody dies because they don’t have access to health care."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/08/raul-labrador/raul-labradors-claim-no-one-dies-lack-health-care-/	What Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, told a restive town hall audience in Lewiston, Idaho, was destined to go viral. And it did. At the May 5, 2017, event, questioners asked the congressman about the Republicans’ vote the previous day on a major health care overhaul that would roll back many aspects of President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act, including limits on expanding Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the poor. "You are mandating people on Medicaid accept dying," one audience member said. To which Labrador responded, "No no, you know that line is so indefensible. Nobody dies because they don’t have access to health care." The crowd howled in protest, and the comment drew immediate national attention. Writing in CNN, political commentator Chris Cillizza awarded his "Worst Week in Washington" award to Labrador, saying that the congressman had essentially handed Democrats a video clip that was "a ready-made attack line against every vulnerable House Republican." Given all the attention to Labrador’s comment, we decided to fact-check it. It’s not our first time looking at a similar question. Because of varied results from academic papers, we have struggled since 2009 about how to rate claims that a specific number of people die every year because they were uninsured -- a common talking point for Democrats. We found it difficult to pinpoint a specific number. However, Labrador’s statement put a different twist on the question. Rather than saying that a specific number of people had died due to lack of health insurance, Labrador said that no one had. Could that be right? Labrador’s explanation When we contacted Labrador’s office, his staff pointed us to a Facebook post where he explained his remark the following day and accused the media for only focusing on a few seconds of a longer discussion. "During ten hours of town halls, one of my answers about health care wasn’t very elegant," Labrador wrote. "I was responding to a false notion that the Republican health care plan will cause people to die in the streets, which I completely reject. ... In the five-second clip that the media is focusing on, I was trying to explain that all hospitals are required by law to treat patients in need of emergency care regardless of their ability to pay and that the Republican plan does not change that." (Here’s the full exchange as posted by Labrador’s office.) However, even if you buy the argument that emergency room care would protect the uninsured, that leaves out a whole range of chronic and potentially deadly diseases -- from heart disease to diabetes -- that can be prevented only through long-term access to physicians. A literature review We found at least seven academic papers that detected a link between securing health insurance and a decline in mortality. In general, these papers present a stronger consensus that having insurance saves lives. • In 2002, a panel of more than a dozen medical specialists convened by the federally chartered Institute of Medicine estimated that 18,000 Americans had died in 2000 because they were uninsured. In January 2008, Stan Dorn, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, published a paper that sought to update the IOM study with newer data. Replicating the study’s methodology, Dorn concluded that the figure should be increased to 22,000. • A 2009 American Journal of Public Health study concluded that a lack of health insurance "is associated with as many as 44,789 deaths in the United States, more than those caused by kidney disease." • Three studies looked at state-level expansions of Medicaid and in each case found "significant" improvements in mortality after such expansions of coverage. These include a 2012 New England Journal of Medicine study of New York, Maine, and Arizona by Harvard researchers, and a 2014 study of Massachusetts by researchers from Harvard and the Urban Institute. • A 2014 study published by the health policy publication Health Affairs looked at states that, at the time, had declined to expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. It estimated that the 25 states studied would have collectively avoided between 7,000 and 17,000 deaths. • A 2014 study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology found improved survival rates for young adults with cancer after securing insurance under the Affordable Care Act. • A 2017 study in the journal Medical Care looked at a provision of the Affordable Care Act that allows young adults to be covered under a parent’s policy. The study found a decline in mortality among this population from diseases amenable to preventive treatment. (Mortality from trauma, such as car accidents, saw no decrease, as would be expected.) Any contrary views? We found two papers that might conceivably provide support for Labrador’s position. But as we’ll see, even the papers’ authors did not agree with Labrador. • A paper published in April 2009 in HSR: Health Services Research. In it, Richard Kronick of the Department of Family and Preventive Medicine at the University of California (San Diego) School of Medicine, raised questions about the conclusions of the seminal Institute of Medicine study from 2002. Kronick’s study adjusted the data -- as the IOM had not -- for a number of demographic and health factors, including status as a smoker and body mass index, and found that doing so removed the excess number of deaths found in the original study. • A 2013 paper in the New England Journal of Medicine co-authored by Katherine Baicker of Harvard University compared about 6,000 patients in Oregon who got coverage through a 2008 Medicaid expansion and about 6,000 who didn’t. While the study found improvements in out-of-pocket medical spending and lower rates of depression among those who got coverage, key benchmarks for physical health -- including blood pressure, cholesterol, and blood sugar -- did not improve in such patients. So we asked both of these papers’ authors whether their papers could be used as justification for what Labrador said. "Rep. Labrador is misinformed," Kronick said. "Common sense, as well as the accumulated weight of evidence is sufficient to convince any reasonable analyst that lack of health insurance results in excess morbidity (that is, sickness) and mortality." Baicker, too, said she sees "strong evidence" that Labrador’s statement "is false. I agree that the exact number is up for debate, but the fact that it is more than zero seems clear to me." Every other health policy analyst who responded to us for this article agreed that Labrador was wrong. Some saw common sense as equally persuasive as the peer-reviewed research. "I was just at a physicians’ meeting where people described patients they had treated who had died because of a lack of coverage," said Harold Pollack, an urban public health researcher at the University of Chicago. "Everyone who does this for a living has personally experienced it in one way or another." Our ruling At the town hall, Labrador said, "Nobody dies because they don’t have access to health care." Extensive research over the previous decade generally points to tangible reductions in mortality after patients obtain health insurance. Two papers found more equivocal results, but we reached authors of both papers, and they agreed that their findings do not support Labrador’s remark. While the exact number of deaths saved by having health insurance is uncertain, the researchers we contacted agreed that the number is higher than zero -- probably quite a bit higher.

pomt-00420	"When the law stopped Tony Evers from revoking a teacher's license for viewing pornography, Tony worked with lawmakers from both parties to change the law so offenders could be kicked out of the classroom."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/29/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/hitting-back-group-defends-dem-governor-candidate-/	Who would have thought an 8-year-old case of a Madison-area teacher viewing pornography would become, prominently and repeatedly, a flashpoint in the 2018 campaign for governor? Three times, the state Republican Party has run attack ads against Tony Evers, the Democratic nominee, tying him to the teacher. (In fact, as we were preparing this fact check, the GOP released another, though broader attack ad, tying Evers to that case and two others.) None of the first three GOP ads fared well in our assessments. All of our fact checks in the governor’s race. Now, the liberal Greater Wisconsin Committee is coming to the defense of Evers, the state schools superintendent, in the Madison-area teacher case. Its TV ad, released Aug. 20, 2018, makes this two-part claim: When the law stopped Tony Evers from revoking a teacher's license for viewing pornography, Tony worked with lawmakers from both parties to change the law so offenders could be kicked out of the classroom. On the first part of the claim, the ad’s use of the word stopped goes a bit too far. Meanwhile, the ad partially undercuts itself on the second part. While the narrator is saying Evers "worked with lawmakers" to change the law, which is a fair characterization, words on the screen go too far in declaring: "Evers changed the law." Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. The case The ad alludes to the case of Andy Harris, a middle-school science teacher in the Middleton-Cross Plains Area School District, west of Madison. He was fired in 2010 for viewing images of nudity on his school computer and showing at least one of them to a female co-worker. Harris got his job back after an arbitrator ruled he had been improperly fired. The arbitrator concluded that Harris’ behavior did not endanger any students — a necessary factor under state law at the time. The decision to give Harris back his job was upheld by two courts. All our fact checks in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race. Evers’ role Evers did have the discretion on whether to go through license revocation proceedings, which Harris could have challenged. But Evers decided against seeking revocation after concluding, as the arbitrator did, that the teacher’s behavior didn’t endanger kids, as defined by the law at that time. In other words, in the view of Evers’ department, there was no legal basis to take away Harris’ license. The law At the time, state law defined immoral conduct in such cases as "conduct or behavior that is contrary to commonly accepted moral or ethical standards and that endangers the health, safety, welfare, or education of any pupil." After the Harris case, the law was changed so that immoral conduct includes "the intentional use of an educational agency’s equipment to download, view, solicit, seek, display, or distribute pornographic material." That is, the part about endangering students was removed, a change that was backed by Evers and signed by Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who Evers will face in the general election. GOP state Rep. Steve Kestell, who authored the bill, told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that Evers’ Department of Public Instruction did not push the bill. The Greater Wisconsin Committee did not respond to our requests for information to back the statement in the ad. But emails provided to the Journal Sentinel, and to us, by Evers’ department show the department worked with lawmakers in the sense that the department’s legislative liaison discussed the legislation with Kestell as it was being drafted. And department officials testified at hearings in favor of the legislation. But while Evers played a supportive role he did not, despite the words on the screen in the ad, change the law himself or even take the lead in doing so. Our rating The Greater Wisconsin Committee says: "When the law stopped Tony Evers from revoking a teacher's license for viewing pornography, Tony worked with lawmakers from both parties to change the law so offenders could be kicked out of the classroom." On the first part of the claim, the state law in place at the time didn’t actually stop Evers from trying to revoke the license who viewed pornography at school. Evers could have initiated revocation proceedings, which the teacher could have challenged. But Evers concluded that the law didn’t allow for a revocation because the teacher’s behavior didn’t endanger children. The same conclusion had been reached by an arbitrator. And two courts upheld the arbitrator’s decision. Moreover, the fact that Evers’ department backed, and Walker signed, a change in the law supports the idea that the law didn’t favor revocation at the time. On the second part of the claim, Evers did work with lawmakers to change the law, as the narrator states in the ad, but he didn’t change the law as words on the screen in the ad claim.

pomt-03082	"One out of four corporations doesn't pay a nickel in (federal income) taxes."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/26/bernie-sanders/sanders-one-out-four-corporations-pay-no-taxes/	The taxes paid, or not paid, by corporations is a perennial topic in Washington. There is broad agreement that the current rules should be changed but no consensus on what those changes ought to be. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., pulled out a dramatic statistic during a Sept. 24, 2013, back-and-forth with Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., on CNN’s Crossfire. "One out of four corporations doesn't pay a nickel in taxes," Sanders said. The two senators were talking about federal income taxes, and we decided we should check to see if Sanders’ claim is accurate. In the context of his debate with Graham, the implication is that if it weren't for special deals in the tax code, these companies would be writing checks to the Internal Revenue Service. Sanders' office pointed us to a Government Accountability Office study from 2008. The GAO conducts analysis for Congress. In one sense, that study found that Sanders understated the situation. For all corporations, about two-thirds, or about 1.2 million, paid no federal income taxes in 2005. But many of those firms are quite small -- an owner and a couple of employees. For large U.S.-controlled corporations, those with at least $250 million in assets or $50 million in gross receipts, one out of four paid no taxes, as Sanders said. The total revenues for those large companies was about $1.08 trillion. That, however, is not the end of the story. Why they owe no taxes We will focus on the large corporations because those seemed to be the ones Sanders had in mind. The GAO study found that 80 percent of those firms reported no income at the point in their tax return when they subtracted salaries and wages and took other deductions. That is, they showed a gross profit based on selling items for more than it cost to produce them, but they had additional expenses after that, such as payroll and tax deductions, which drove their taxable income to zero. The GAO lumped together firms that paid no taxes because they failed to turn a profit and those that were profitable but used additional wrinkles in the tax code to avoid paying the government. Distinguishing between those two groups sheds light on the situation. Citizens for Tax Justice is a research group that has as one of its goals "requiring the wealthy to pay their fair share." It has written in defense of Sanders’ positions before, but its most recent study of corporate tax payments suggests that the one-in-four statistic might be less significant than it seems. Steve Wamhoff, the group’s legislative director, said their 2011 report started with the Fortune 500 companies and culled the ones that met two criteria: they had three consecutive years of profitability from 2008 to 2010, and they provided enough information to do an accurate analysis. Of the 500, 220 did not meet those standards. With some notable exceptions, such as Google and Microsoft, the primary reason those 220 companies fell off the list was they had real losses. "We get the fact that if you have profits one year but not the next year, you would carry your losses forward," Wamhoff said. "We get that, but if you’ve been profitable for three years straight, those are the ones who really should be paying taxes." Of the 280 consistently profitable corporations that remained, the study found that 22 paid no taxes in 2008, 49 paid none in 2009, and 37 paid none in 2010. Across all three years, there were 30 corporations that had a tax rate of zero or even a negative rate. The negative rate meant they might get a rebate check from Washington or have a tax credit they could apply to future earnings. Many familiar names show up in this list, such as Wells Fargo, Boeing, Verizon and General Electric. In the study’s three-year span, those 30 companies had pre-tax profits of about $160 billion, but their direct contribution to the federal treasury was zero. Citizens for Tax Justice pointed the finger at the rules for accelerated depreciation and stock options. The report said these and various other deductions allowed the firms to avoid hefty tax bills. However, those policy matters fall outside the scope of this fact check. A lack of profits tends to reduce the tax bill For fact-checking purposes, the Citizens for Tax Justice findings are interesting for another reason. If pre-tax losses explain why a large number of firms would not owe the government money, then the meaning of Sanders’ claim begins to look quite different. We would not expect a firm without profits to pay taxes. The GAO study did not probe this deeply. The Citizens for Tax Justice did, albeit for a smaller group of corporations. In rough terms, out of the original 500 corporations, 220 or about 40 percent were dealing with losses. The study found 78 consitently profitable companies, or about 15 percent of the original 500, that paid no taxes in at least one year. That is less than one out of four; it’s closer to one out of six. If we look at the 30 that paid nothing in any year, the ratio drops to one out of 16. Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center, generally seen as a centrist think tank, cautions against reading too much into the 2008 GAO study. In a blog post written shortly after it was released, he called it "interesting and suggestive, though also not conclusive." Toder noted that most corporations are quite small with gross receipts of less than $250,000. They report no income because the money turns up as paychecks to the owner and employers where it is subject to the individual income tax. He agreed that some large corporations use "aggressive techniques to shift reported profits to low-tax jurisdictions," but even those end up paying some U.S. taxes. Toder’s bottom line on the one out of four statistic? "Whatever the technical factual basis of the statement, it isn’t terribly meaningful or revealing." William McBride, chief economist at the Tax Foundation, a group that promotes lower taxes, finds Sanders’ ratio "misleading." McBride, as do the other analysts we contacted, pointed to the costs of doing business. His list included salaries and wages, interest, depreciation, rent and other taxes. "You cannot legitimately deny these businesses these write-offs," McBride said. Our ruling Sanders said that one out of four corporations doesn’t pay a nickel in taxes. The statement reflects a 2008 study from the Government Accountability Office. However, the GAO study did not distinguish between firms that had losses in the normal course of business and those that reported losses solely through the use of the tax code. Groups along the political spectrum give much weight to the costs of doing business that can lead to a bad year. There is wide agreement that losses in one year can be carried forward and that salaries are an unavoidable expense, to mention just two factors. Special tax breaks and abuses of the tax code exist but even an analysis from a group that shares many of Sanders’ perspectives pointed to a ratio that was, at most, one out of six and possibly as small as one out of 16. The one out of four statistic fails to take into account many relevant factors. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Bernie Sanders	None	None	None	2013-09-26T17:58:01	2013-09-24	['None']
pomt-07139	"Anywhere in the world, when someone uses a mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet or GPS, they are enjoying the benefits of the American miracle."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/jun/15/marco-rubio/rubio-says-mobile-phone-email-internet-gps-stem-am/	U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio used his first speech on the Senate floor, on June 14, 2011, to evoke the American dream. The so-called maiden speech is a "big deal for a senator," said fellow Florida Sen. Bill Nelson — and Rubio went for big ideas. "America is not perfect," said the freshman Republican, the child of Cuban immigrants. "... But since her earliest days, America has inspired people from all over the world. Inspired them with the hope that one day their own countries would be one like this one. Many others decided they could not wait. And so they came here from everywhere, to pursue their dreams and to work to leave their children better off than themselves. And the result was the American miracle." As he held the floor for nearly 15 minutes, Rubio highlighted rags-to-riches stories that he said happen "only in America," describing the founders of Nordstrom, Mattel and eBay. When he finished, Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., commended him, saying, "No one expresses American exceptionalism better than Sen. Rubio." Rubio traced America’s role in the 20th century, from two world wars to the Cold War and the defeat of communism. Then he turned to other contributions: While our military and foreign policy contributions helped save the world, it was our economic and cultural innovations that helped transform it. The fruits of the American miracle can be found in the daily lives of people everywhere. Anywhere in the world, when someone uses a mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet or GPS, they are enjoying the benefits of the American miracle. Anywhere in the world, when a bone marrow, lung or heart transplant saves a life, they are touched by the value of the American miracle. And on one night in July of 1969, the whole world witnessed the American miracle firsthand. For on that night an American walked on the surface of the moon, and it was clear to the whole world that these Americans… could do anything. We briefly considered wading into fringe conspiracy theories about whether astronauts actually walked on the moon, but got control of ourselves. We were more curious about his other technology claims. Were Americans truly the ones responsible for innovation of the mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet and the global positioning system? We dropped a line to Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos, who provided us with links about inventors of the mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet and GPS. Indeed, stories from The Telegraph (via Huffington Post), NPR, the Internet Society, PBS and MITnews identify American origins for all four technologies. But these are complex systems that have developed over time. We wondered: Was there more to the story? Mobile phone A lot fits under the umbrella "mobile phone" -- including, say, early radio technology that led to car phones by the 1940s. But Rubio’s spokesman pointed to the inventor of the first portable cellular phone, which is fine by us. (Did you think of dawn-of-the-1900s ship-to-shore communication when Rubio said "mobile phone"? We didn’t think so.) Martin Cooper worked for Illinois company Motorola as it developed the DynaTAC phone and the cellular network behind it in the early 1970s. The lead engineer for the team that developed the phone, Martin made the first wireless call from Manhattan in 1973. The FCC approved the phone -- the world’s first commercial portable cell phone -- for regular folks in 1983. Now, Japan and some European countries were quicker to deploy cellular networks, in the late ‘70s and very early ‘80s. But Paul Levinson, a Fordham University professor who wrote the 2004 book "Cellphone: The Story of the World's Most Mobile Medium and How It Has Transformed Everything!" says it’s the phone that matters. "That was the breakthrough," he said "There were several different companies and scientists working on it. … But no one believed that it could be done. … So everything that came afterwards was based on that first breakthrough." An American breakthrough. Score one for Rubio. Internet & E-mail We read the work from the Internet Society and PBS that Burgos sent our way, then exchanged messages with Stephen Stein, who teaches the history of technology at the University of Memphis. Computer networks that led to the Internet we know today include Arpanet , a 1970s project of the U.S. Department of Defense, and NSFnet, created by the National Science Foundation in the 1980s. These projects, with their indisputably American roots, provided two cornerstones of the modern-day Web: the TCP/IP protocol and a major communications backbone. But Stein pointed out that the way we interact with the Internet owes much to the work of Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist who worked for CERN, the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Switzerland. It was there -- in the late ‘80s as NSFnet was being developed in the United States -- that Berners-Lee "developed the whole concept of the World Wide Web," Stein said. (There’s more on this in a PBS article related to the one Burgos sent.) HTTP? HTML? Both Berners-Lee. "So, yes, Americans developed the Internet, but Berners-Lee made it user-friendly," Stein said. Meanwhile, Virginia Tech scholar Janet Abbate says in her 1999 book "Inventing the Internet," published by MIT Press, that even in the expansion of Arpanet , Americans enlisted the help of computer experts from England and France. She also points to Berners-Lee’s contributions, saying, "The history of the Internet is not … a story of a few heroic inventors; it is a tale of collaboration and conflict among a remarkable variety of players." The origins of e-mail, as you might expect, are entwined with the Internet. Electronic mail was part of the development of Arpanet in the early ‘70s, according to Stein, Abbate and others. American programmer Ray Tomlinson gets credit (and tongue-in-cheek blame) for the first working network mail program, picked up by users of Arpanet sites. Here's what Abbate told us when we asked her about Rubio's claim. "I think it's an overstatement to call the Internet a purely American product. Certainly other countries were building their own computer networks (and inter-networks) in parallel with the U.S.; these other networks eventually became part of the Internet," Abbate said. "Also, the Internet itself (as opposed to the earlier Apranet) was a collaborative effort with input from computer scientists in France and elsewhere, and I argue in my book that the diversity of input made the resulting system stronger. I do think the U.S. did a remarkably good job with the Internet design and expansion, maybe better than anyone else would or could have done. But if the resulting Internet hadn't suited other countries' needs, they were perfectly capable of creating their own networks (indeed, for a while there were a number of different competing network systems before TCP/IP eventually became the standard). "And of course, the World Wide Web was invented at CERN, not in the US or by an American. So does that mean we in the U.S. are enjoying the benefits of the "Swiss miracle" every time we use the Web?" GPS The satellite technology that puts some of the smart in your smart phone and informs your car’s navigation system is a system of satellites funded by taxpayers and operated by the U.S. government. So calling the global positioning system an "American miracle" is no stretch. The technology was born at Aerospace Corp., a military research contractor in El Segundo, Calif. Its founding president was New York native Ivan Getting. That isn’t to say there aren’t foreign navigation satellites. The United States cooperates with Australia, China, the European Union, India, Japan and Russia on global navigation satellite systems, sometimes referred to as GNSS. But Rubio said GPS, and the history there is fairly clear -cut. The ruling What to make of all of this? Rubio's basic point, that the technology behind mobile phones, e-mail, the Internet and GPS all have American roots, holds up. It’s true "in a general sense," said Sherry Turkle, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who writes on our relationship with technology. Or, as the University of Memphis professor, Stein, put it: "The statement is superficially correct, but there is (as usual) more to the story." Stein was most concerned about the non-American role in the development of the Internet, especially the substantial contribution of England's Berners-Lee. It’s also important to note in the context of Rubio’s "only in America" rhetoric that while the United States led, it wasn’t alone in its innovation. Other nations’ researchers contributed to the early Internet; commercial mobile phone networks were available overseas before they were in America; other nations operate satellite navigation systems. But in these areas and many others, Americans can claim primacy. We rate Rubio’s statement, that "when someone uses a mobile phone, e-mail, the Internet or GPS, they are enjoying the benefits of the American miracle," Mostly True.

pomt-02234	More "25- to 34-year-olds are moving to Austin than any other city in America."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2014/apr/15/will-wynn/austin-area-slips-no-5-among-major-metro-area-numb/	Former Austin Mayor Will Wynn, who often speaks on urban growth, suggested that Austin’s attractiveness to retirees and young Americans helps explain demand for downtown housing. "As our society ages, and as boomers start retiring by the millions, we’re going to see a dramatic increase in the demand for dense urban multifamily housing, with a broad mix of uses nearby," Wynn told the Austin American-Statesman for a March 30, 2014, news story headlined "Austin’s rebuilding boom." "Couple that with the fact that more 25- to 34-year-olds are moving to Austin than any other city in America," Wynn said, "and you’ve got yourself a hell of a strong demand for urban housing. I tell people that by any way you possibly measure it — quality of life, public safety, environmental sustainability, public health and fitness, economic — mixed-use density is literally the answer." Density preferences aside, is Wynn right that more young adults are moving to Austin than to any other U.S. city? Wynn recalls a newspaper story By phone and email, Wynn said he learned of Austin’s draw from a Statesman news story citing U.S Census Bureau research. He didn’t have the story handy, but we found a March 30, 2013, Statesman news story stating that analyses of U.S Census Bureau data by William Frey, a senior demographer at the Brookings Institution, found that from 2009 through 2011, the Austin metro area drew more Americans in the cited age span than any other U.S. city--just as the area did the previous three years, the story said. Frey, the newspaper said, measured rates for annual average net migration (including people who left Austin) of young adults ages 25 to 34 and young adults with college degrees. "Austin hits the trifecta," Frey said then. "It's got jobs, cachet, it's got people who see that it's a pathway to careers, either because they go there to get an education or to use an education." Frey further said jobs typically are the top reason people move. Twenty-somethings traditionally have the highest rates of mobility, and college graduates typically are more willing to move out of state for jobs because they tend to compete for them in national markets, Frey said then. Updated analysis places Austin-Round Rock fifth But there's been a change in the rankings, according to Frey’s Nov. 15, 2013, analysis of more recent census data. The Austin-Round Rock metro area placed fifth among 51 major metro areas as a draw on "millennials," adults in the cited age group, from 2009 through 2012, according to a chart posted online by Brookings. Over those three years, the Austin-Round Rock area had an average annual gain of 8,061 25- to 34-year-olds, Frey wrote. Washington, D.C., ranked first among major metro areas with an average annual gain of 12,583 people in the age group, he wrote. Also, the Denver, Portland, Ore., and Houston areas netted greater gains than the Austin area, according to Frey’s breakdown. On the Brookings site, Frey described the D.C. results as a "renewal of young adults in the post-recession period… compared to the loss of young adults during the recession. The existence of both government and non-government employment opportunities in a highly educated ‘millennial friendly’ environment make the nation’s capital an attractive destination until migration flows to a broader group of areas emerge. "A few other areas, including San Francisco and Minneapolis, have showed a rising post-recession young adult boom as well," Frey wrote. His chart shows the San Francisco area ranked sixth among major metro areas with an average annual gain of 7,688 such young adults in the three years. The Minneapolis area, 11th among major metros, had an average annual gain of 3,708 adults in the age group, according to the chart. Researcher says No. 5 isn't so bad To our inquiry, Frey said by email that while Austin’s rank fell between the cited time periods, there is another way to compare--by the rate of change in such adults settling in major metro areas. By that measure, Frey added, the Austin-Round Rock area’s 2.7 net gain per 100 25- to 34-year-olds placed it second among major metros only to the Denver area, which had a 3.0 rate, he said. Still, Frey said he considers numeric gains to be a more accurate measure of where migrants are going. Numeric gains, he said, are "not affected by the size of the destination population In other words, among all the places in the country, which places are gaining the biggest aggregate numbers of migrants? The rate, is more of an ‘impact’ measure: how are recent migrants affecting the destination population?" Generally, Frey said, the Austin area "has both educational and employment opportunities relevant to young people who are looking to advance -- especially during a period when many other places have taken sharp employment hits. Even if young people coming to Austin are not getting their dream jobs right away, they will be networking with others who might make that happen. This will not be the case in many other places." We wondered why Austin’s rank slipped. Frey said that as the economy "slowly revives elsewhere, there will be competitors, but being number two or number five" isn’t bad, he wrote. Wynn, apprised of the Austin area’s latest ranking, speculated by email that Austin by itself, rather than the metro area, draws more young adults than any other U.S. city. Our ruling Wynn said more 25- to 34-year-olds are moving to Austin than any other city in America. Wynn did not offer nor did we find data specific to individual cities. But four major metro areas, led by Washington, D.C., netted more new residents in the cited age group in the latest three years checked by Brookings demographer James Frey. The Austin area ranked fifth among the nation’s major metros. We see no basis for currently declaring Austin No. 1, but Wynn's claim has an element of truth; the Austin area was the biggest draw for young adults in some recent three-year periods.

pomt-09711	There is majority support for the Democrats' health care plans.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/02/valerie-jarrett/jarrett-claims-obama-has-majority-support-health-c/	As Democratic health care reform bills move toward votes in the House and the Senate, supporters and opponents alike have tried to harness public opinion polls to bolster their own arguments. One recent example came during the Nov. 1, 2009, edition of ABC News' This Week with George Stephanopoulos , during a question-and-answer session with White House senior adviser Valerie Jarrett. STEPHANOPOULOS: "Our latest polling shows that there is not majority support for the president's health care plans." JARRETT: "Well, we actually think that there is. And I suppose it depends upon what poll you're looking at." We decided to put Jarrett's claim to the test by looking at roughly the last six weeks of public opinion polls that asked questions related to general support for, or opposition to, health proposals put forward by the president or by Democrats generally. We chose the past six weeks to keep the data fresh in this fast-changing debate. Before looking at the data, we should explain which polls we have decided to include, and not include, in our study. Our main starting point for polling information was the Web site pollster.com , a nonpartisan site affiliated with National Journal magazine that maintains a constantly updated database of poll releases. We tried to stick to questions that focused on general support or opposition to the plan, rather than more specific details such as whether to offer a government-run "public option" for health insurance, because the number of possible poll questions would quickly get out of hand. In addition, we decided to include only independently sponsored telephone polls and exclude Internet-based polls. Making this distinction hurts the president's cause somewhat, because one Internet poll -- the Economist /YouGov poll -- has on several recent occasions shown a small majority of respondents in favor of the Democratic plan. But we have decided to exclude Internet polls to remain consistent with mainstream professional opinion, which does not yet consider Internet polling to be as trustworthy as telephone polling. We are, however, including telephone polls conducted by machines rather than live humans. Also, since Jarrett specifically referred to "majority support," we will not count in the White House's favor polls unless the support breaks the 50 percent barrier. Using the pollster.com database, we found three polls conducted in October -- all done by live telephone interviews -- that reported true majority support for the Democratic proposal, though hardly by supermajorities. They are: -- A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. poll taken between Oct. 16 and Oct. 18 asked, "What do you think would be better for the country -- if Congress passed a bill to change the country's health care system along the lines of what Barack Obama has proposed, or if the current system were left in place with no changes?" The survey found that 53 percent said it would be better to pass a bill, while 44 percent said to leave the current system intact. The poll had 1,038 adult respondents and a 3 percentage point margin of error. -- A Kaiser Family Foundation poll conducted between Oct. 8 and Oct. 15 asked, "Do you think the country as a whole would be better off or worse off if the president and Congress passed health care reform, or don't you think it would make much difference?" In this poll, 53 percent said the country would be better off, 28 percent said it would be worse off and 12 percent said it would not make much difference. The poll had 1,200 adult respondents and a 3 percentage point margin of error. -- A Gallup poll taken between Oct. 1 and Oct. 4 asked, "Would you advise your member of Congress to vote for or against a health care bill this year?" To this question, 51 percent said their lawmaker should vote for it and 41 percent said their lawmaker should vote against it. This poll interviewed 1,013 adults, with a 4 percentage point margin of error. (Technical note: The results for this question are a little more complicated than most. On the interviewer's first pass, 40 percent of respondents said they'd advise a vote in favor, 36 percent advised a vote against, and 25 percent said they had no opinion. Then, the interviewer asked the undecideds a second question to see how they were leaning; those answers were added to the initial totals to come up with 51 percent advising passage and 41 percent advising rejection.) Most of the time, though, similar questions have found opponents outnumbering supporters. Just to cite a few examples (there are too many to list them all): -- An NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll taken between Oct. 22 and Oct. 25 asked, "From what you have heard about Barack Obama's health care plan, do you think his plan is a good idea or a bad idea? If you do not have an opinion either way, please just say so." On this question, 38 percent said it was a good idea and 42 percent said it was a bad idea. In the five NBC/ Wall Street Journal polls going back to April 2009, the answer "good idea" never exceeded 39 percent. - - An ABC News/ Washington Post poll taken Oct. 15 to Oct. 18 asked, "Overall, given what you know about them, would you say you support or oppose the proposed changes to the health care system being developed by Congress and the Obama administration?" On this question, 45 percent said they support the changes while 48 percent said they oppose them. In two previous ABC/ Post surveys that asked the same question, opponents always outnumbered supporters, with supporters never breaking 46 percent. -- A Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll taken between Oct. 13 and Oct. 14 asked, "Based on what you know about the health care legislation being considered right now, do you favor or oppose the plan?" The pollsters found that 35 percent favored it and 54 percent opposed it. In four prior polls going back to July 2009, the survey never found supporters leading opponents, and supporters never exceeded 38 percent. -- Finally, a series of Rasmussen polls, which were conducted by machines rather than live interviewers, have consistently found strong opposition to the Democratic health care proposal. The most recent of these, taken between Oct. 30 and Oct. 31, asked, "Generally speaking, do you strongly favor, somewhat favor, somewhat oppose or strongly oppose the health care reform plan proposed by President Obama and the congressional Democrats?" It found that 42 percent favored the plan either strongly or somewhat, while 54 percent opposed it strongly or somewhat. Most polls have had "little change over the course of the year," said Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst with the conservative American Enterprise Institute. "It is certainly fair to say that no poll shows solid majority support" for the Democratic plan. So why did three scattered polls buck the general trend? The most likely factors are two issues often raised in conjunction with polling methodology: the nature of the population sampled, and the way the questions are worded. On the sampling question, the Fox and Rasmussen surveys sampled registered voters and likely voters, respectively, rather than all adults, as the other polls did. Interviewing only registered voters and -- especially -- likely voters weeds out Americans who are relatively disengaged with the political scene. This can be helpful in measuring support for candidates during election season, but when applied to the issue of health care, it can skew the pool of respondents against the White House. "Polls that screen for registered or likely voters tend to get fewer of the younger and minority voters that have been Obama's strongest supporters," said Mark Blumenthal, who runs pollster.com. And not surprisingly, those polls showed the strongest opposition to the Democratic plan. As for wording, it appears that how a question is phrased -- always a key issue in producing the most accurate survey results -- is especially important when asking broad questions related to the current health care debate. For instance, "those that describe it as only an Obama plan seem to get more support than those that emphasize the 'Democrats in Congress,' " Blumenthal said. And when the CNN poll asked, "What do you think would be better for the country -- if Congress passed a bill to change the country's health care system along the lines of what Barack Obama has proposed, or if the current system were left in place with no changes," it framed the Democratic plan squarely in opposition to the current health care system, whose shortcomings are apparent even to the president's critics. That wording may help explain the relatively large support for the president in that question. Let's summarize. Recent polls that asked general health care reform questions have found consistent opposition to the Democratic plan. In polls of all adults, it has often been opposition by a modest margin, while polls of registered or likely voters have found more intense opposition. But independent pollsters have produced three surveys in the past six weeks that found supporters narrowly cracking the 50 percent barrier. So part of what Jarrett said -- "I suppose it depends upon what poll you're looking at" -- is undeniably true. On balance though, those poll-verified majorities are the exception rather than the rule. We rule her statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Valerie Jarrett	None	None	None	2009-11-02T15:56:43	2009-11-01	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-08757	"(Jeff) Atwater's bank was so weak that just a few months ago it was shut down by the FDIC."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/27/loranne-ausley/loranne-ausley-attacks-jeff-atwaters-banking-ties-/	A web ad by the Democratic nominee for chief financial officer has her Republican opponent crying foul. Loranne Ausley is trying to tie state Senate President Jeff Atwater to a Florida bank that was shut down by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in April 2010. The ad, called "Can Florida Afford Jeff Atwater?," opens with a picture of Atwater inside an elaborate frame, like it's a painted portrait. "Jeff Atwater wants to be Florida's next chief financial officer. But here is what he doesn't want you to know," a narrator says, as the video first cuts to an image of a safe, then a second image of Atwater and a bank. "Jeff Atwater was an executive vice president at Riverside National Bank, which was rated one of the seven weakest banks in all of Florida. In fact, Atwater's bank was so weak that just a few months ago it was shut down by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. But not before Atwater's bank cost the FDIC $491 million dollars." Then the video cuts back to the image of the safe, then the Atwater portrait. "So ask yourself, can Florida really afford Jeff Atwater as our next CFO?" The ad produced this reaction from Atwater's campaign: "In another sign that her stagnant campaign is completely devoid of a positive vision for Florida, liberal Loranne Ausley has launched a mudslinging attack on the web that lies about Jeff Atwater's professional experience," Atwater spokesman Brian Hughes said. Lies? In a political campaign? Could it be? PolitiFact Florida wanted to get to the bottom of this. For the purpose of this fact-check, we're focusing on this statement: "Atwater's bank was so weak that just a few months ago it was shut down by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation." First, let's establish Atwater's role and time at Riverside. Atwater's background at Riverside Atwater, of North Palm Beach, oversaw business development at Riverside Bank's Palm Beach County branches from 2002 to February 2009. When he left the bank, it had more than 60 branches and more than 1,000 employees in Florida. Atwater told PolitiFact Florida he left the bank to focus on his responsibilities as Senate President. In newspaper articles, Atwater had been listed as Palm Beach County president of Riverside National Bank. But a bank spokeswoman told the Palm Beach Post that Atwater functioned as a "regional business development manager" at the bank's Palm Beach County branches. Atwater's 2008 pay from Riverside was $199,833 and he listed his title as "EVP" on his 2009 financial disclosure statement. Atwater spokesman Hughes says that stands for executive vice president. "The reality is it's a local community bank, one in which his title was vice president," Hughes said. "But his day-to-day responsibility was almost that of a regional branch manger. He worked with a few local branches." So Atwater was definitely a manager at the bank, and likely one of its higher-paid executives. He was not a member of the board of directors, however, and maintains he had no direct say in the bank's loan-making process. Bank finds itself in trouble On May 27, 2009 -- about three months after Atwater left Riverside -- the bank was one of seven in Florida that failed to hold the amount of money required by regulators, according to the St. Petersburg Times. And the Palm Beach Post reported on May 29 that Riverside was ranked among the weakest in the nation, according to TheStreet.com. Fast forward to April 16, 2010, almost a year later. The FDIC announced that it was closing Riverside National Bank and that TD Bank was taking over its accounts. Riverside, and two other Florida banks, were closed in order "to protect depositors," according to the FDIC. In its announcement, the FDIC said the cost to the FDIC's insurance fund to guarantee the bank's obligations was $491.8 million. The Post documented the bank's closure this way: FORT PIERCE — Beset by steep losses and unable to raise much-needed capital, Riverside National Bank was closed by federal regulators Friday. Its business was taken over by TD Bank, the U.S. arm of Toronto-Dominion Bank. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Riverside's failure is expected to cost the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund $492 million. Riverside, a stalwart of St. Lucie County’s business community, was the second-largest of the 25 Florida banks shuttered by the FDIC since August 2008. Riverside had 58 offices from Palm Beach County to Volusia County. Its $3.4 billion in assets made it the seventh-­largest bank headquartered in Florida. Riverside posted huge losses in the past two years, including red ink of $138.9 million in 2008 and $131 million in 2009. "This was a dead bank walking," said Miami banking analyst Ken Thomas. "The question is why has the FDIC let them flail away for so long." The article noted that Riverside was hit hard by the collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008, rendering Riverside's securities in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac worthless. Loan losses escalated. Atwater isn't mentioned in the story. Back to the ad Ausley's ad makes three basic claims. First, that Atwater worked as an executive at Riverside National Bank. That's true. Second, that the bank was rated one of the weakest in Florida. That's true. And third, that Riverside eventually was shut down by federal regulators. Also true. But the problem is the 30-second spot splices together those three events like they happened within weeks of each other, when really they were separated by 14 months. Why is that important to know? Because Atwater was no longer working at Riverside when the bank was either rated weak, or shut down. That alone doesn't mean Atwater can't be culpable. And we imagine he had to at least be aware of the bank's financial problems, considering it posted a $138.9 million loss in 2008. But the ad's references to "Atwater's bank" are misleading, because it's more accurately described as "Atwater's former bank." Naturally, the question of culpability is harder to determine -- and one we're not ruling on. We can, however, rule on the specific claim in Ausley's ad. She said, "Atwater's bank was so weak that just a few months ago it was shut down by the FDIC." At the time, it wasn't Atwater's bank. It may have been his former bank, or best yet, it was a bank where he used to work as an executive vice president. For the misleading timeline, we find the claim Half True.

pomt-10780	"First, he said he would leave residual forces in Iraq, and now he says he wouldn't."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/17/joe-biden/richardson-now-opposes-residual-troops/	Before he declared his candidacy for president, Bill Richardson said in an interview that the U.S. should leave residual troops in Iraq. Speaking to Chris Matthews of Hardball in October 2006, Richardson said America needs a plan for "responsibly supporting and representing our security interests in the region, and not just leaving without some kind of residual force or some transition force." But by April 2007, when he was running for president, Richardson said he would leave no residual forces in the country. In fact, he's stated that position over and over in debates and on his web site as a way to distinguish himself from the Democratic frontrunners. So we'll take him at his word that he's opposed to residual forces. But what is Richardson's definition of a residual force? Biden's attack cites a Richardson interview with George Stephanoupoulous on April 15, 2007. In that interview, Richardson said, "I would station some in the region. I would put a majority of them in Afghanistan, where al Qaeda and the Taliban are really, right now, resurrecting. But I would not put them in Iraq. I believe I would leave Marine forces to protect our embassy and other vital American installations. But the point here is, leaving a residual force is going to invite more violence and make our troops targets." Based on that statement, it seems Richardson doesn't consider Marines guarding an embassy to constitute a residual force. But Richardson's web site www.getourtroopsout.com states that Richardson would leave "zero" troops in Iraq. His campaign didn't respond to a question on the embassy issue. Based on the 2006 Hardball interview, though, Richardson seems to have genuinely changed position on residual forces. And that's the charge that Biden is making.

pomt-07999	"On average, Americans spend less than 10 percent of their disposable income on food. Compare that to folks in Mexico, who spend 22 percent, China, 28 percent and Russia, 37 percent."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/jan/15/todd-staples/agriculture-commissioner-todd-staples-says-america/	Noting that Americans are "blessed with bargains at the grocery store," state Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples writes that "right now, on average, Americans spend less than 10 percent of their disposable income on food." "Compare that to folks in Mexico, who spend 22 percent, China, 28 percent, and Russia, 37 percent," he says in an op-ed column posted on the San Antonio Express-News website Dec. 29. Bryan Black, a Texas Department of Agriculture spokesman, initially pointed us to the U.S. Department of Agriculture website to buttress Staples' claim. A table created by the USDA's Economic Research Service outlines the proportion of an individual's disposable personal income spent on food from 1929 through 2009, when individual adults and families reportedly spent 9.5 percent of their total disposable personal income on food — 5.5 percent eating in and 3.9 percent eating out. According to the table, the percentage of disposable income spent by Americans on food has dropped over the decades. In 1929, it was 23.4 percent. Since 2000, the share of such income spent on food has run between 9.4 and 9.9 percent. Every year, the Economic Research Service uses data primarily from the the U.S. Department of Commerce and U.S. Census, which collects data from all retailers that sell food, to measure total food expenditures in the United States and estimates how much food is eaten at and away from home. (Go here for more details about the USDA's food-expenditure number-crunching.) Ephraim Leibtag, a USDA senior economist, told us the percentage of income individuals in the U.S. spend on food has dropped because "as income and wealth rises in a given country, less of that income needs to be spent on food in percentage terms." Black also pointed us to a July 2006 article on Salem-News.com, a website that describes itself as the "most unique and interesting news group in the nation" and "the first exclusively Web news organization in the world." The article lists "the percentage of disposable income spent on food at home" in various countries, statistics the article attributes to the USDA. According to the article, consumers in Mexico spent 21.7 percent of their disposable income on food at home, in Russia, 36.7 percent and in China, 28.3 percent. But we noticed that these statistics for foreign countries, which aren't dated in the article, focus only on money spent on food prepared at home, whereas the USDA data also accounts for money spent eating out. The statistics on the Salem-News website are also at least three years older than the USDA's most recent measure of how much disposable income Americans spend on food. We followed up with the Texas Agriculture Department about these distinctions. Black said in an e-mail: "USDA's ERS numbers are constantly changing, so there are many different sets of statistics floating around." He also sent USDA data comparing U.S. food costs to those of other countries. In 2005, according to the ERS table cited by Black, food accounted for 7 percent of total household expenditures for goods and services, incurred by U.S. households. For households in Mexico, food expenses were 24 percent, Russia, 33 percent and China, 36 percent. Separately, USDA economist Annette Clauson noted more recent data comparing the same food costs. In 2009, U.S. households spent 6.9 percent. In Mexico, households spent 24 percent; Russia, 28 percent and China, 32.9 percent. Those figures look similar to the ones cited by Staples when he compared how much of their disposable income American households spend on food versus how much households in other countries spend. But it appears that the USDA only looks at total household expenditures — not disposable income — when comparing relative food costs in foreign countries. That's not an apples-to-apples comparison. Still, available indicators support the thrust of Staples's statement, which is that Americans spend less than 10 percent of their disposable income on food, and the other three countries spend two and three times as much. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Todd Staples	None	None	None	2011-01-15T06:00:00	2010-12-29	['Mexico', 'Russia', 'China', 'United_States']

pomt-08528	Said that his batting average with Congress is higher than every other president since Dwight D. Eisenhower except Lyndon Johnson.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/oct/05/jimmy-carter/carter-said-record-congress-better-most-presidents/	Thirty years since losing the White House after a single term, Jimmy Carter is at ease with his presidential legacy. In his recent book "White House Diary," Carter released excerpts from a journal he kept as president. In its afterword, he acknowledged it may be his last chance to comment on the work he and his team carried out, and he is "proud of what we accomplished." This pride extends to what he described as a winning record with the U.S. Congress, according to his Sept. 20 interview with NBC anchor Brian Williams. "And as you probably know, I had the highest batting average with Congress than any president in modern days except Lyndon Johnson," Carter said. "Better than John Kennedy, better than anybody else. Despite the fact that we had some highly controversial things. So I had a very successful term." The Carter Center uses his success rating (batting average) from Congressional Quarterly, a leading authority on Congress. They calculate percentage of votes that go a president's way during his term. It's also based on a University of Virginia essay on his presidency. But wasn't Carter famously at odds with Congress? How could he possibly have been "successful"? We looked at Carter's "White House Diary," where he elaborated more carefully on his track record in commentary accompanying Carter's April 19, 1977, entry: "Despite the controversial and often unpopular nature of my proposals to the Congress, I had remarkably good success in congressional approval of bills I supported. The Congressional Quarterly reported that since 1953 Lyndon Johnson, John Kennedy and I ranked in that order in obtaining approval of legislation proposed to Congress. The Miller Center reported that my record exceeded Kennedy's." CQ Almanac publishes vote studies each year that determine how often the president took a clear position on a vote in Congress, and how often they went his way. The almanac lists success rates by term of Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower through George W. Bush. If you average those rates for each president, Carter is third. He got his way 76.6 percent of the time. That's right behind Kennedy at 84.6 and Johnson at 82.2. That seems simple enough, but things get complicated from there. We also looked at the Miller Center of Public Affairs' website, which he cited for saying he was second only to Johnson. The book's afterword quoted the site directly: "Carter gained a reputation for political ineptitude, even though his actual record in dealing with Congress belied that image. His success rate in getting presidential initiatives through Congress was much higher than that of Bush [...] Carter was also close to Johnson's success rates, and higher than Kennedy's record." The problem is that the website has since been revised since the book was published. Carter's CQ scores contradict it, so it was changed to avoid confusion, a Miller Center spokeswoman said. The Miller Center's assessment that Carter's congressional record is much better than it is perceived still stands, the spokeswoman emphasized. We located no study that found Carter was second only to Johnson. Still, even if he's third behind Kennedy, who did not serve a full term, the change does not make that big of a difference, said Steven H. Hochman, director of research at the Carter Center. "The difference was just Kennedy. Was he before or behind Kennedy? And it's not too much of a difference," Hochman said. Now for the tough part. There are many ways to assess a president's legislative success. Scholars think CQ's measure is helpful, but it does not take into account whether the president manages to turn his proposals into law. For instance, a tax package might pass the Senate but fail in the House. CQ would count the Senate vote as a success even though the overall effort failed. Furthermore, it may not be fair to compare the average of a two-term president with Carter's single term, one scholar noted. Second-term scores tend to be lower and drag a president's overall average down. If you compare first terms only, Carter drops to fourth behind Dwight D. Eisenhower. And if you look at how many of Carter's initiatives actually were enacted, his record is unexceptional. According to an analysis by Andrew Rudalevige, a political science professor at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pa., who has studied presidential legislative successes, only 44 percent of his initiatives became law. This puts him behind Johnson, Bill Clinton, Eisenhower, George H.W. Bush and Kennedy, in that order. (Eisenhower and George H.W. Bush are tied.) Plus, if you compare Carter to other presidents who served while their parties controlled both the House and Senate, he's at or near the bottom, according to another analysis published in 1990. Still, Carter won nearly 70 percent of his contested and important votes, according to CQ numbers cited in Rudalevige's analysis. Other problems with the CQ score are that it doesn't measure whether a president's proposal was watered down, or take into account whether he worked under unusually hostile conditions. And Carter did push an ambitious agenda during a very difficult time, experts agreed. His proposals included reforms on health care, welfare and energy, topics that remain difficult today. Furthermore, the Democratic Party was deeply divided during Carter's administration. Reforms in the House of Representatives dispersed power more widely among its members, making it difficult to influence the body as a whole. Even Johnson, who is renowned for his legislative skill, would have struggled under those conditions, notes Mark A. Peterson, a professor at the University of California Los Angeles who has written extensively on presidential legislative successes. "Yes, by one measure Carter did very well legislatively, but not quite as well as he has claimed," Peterson said. He didn't do well compared to other presidents whose parties had majorities in both houses of Congress, but considering his party's divisions, his achievements are notable, he added. "And by another measure that really matters -- actually enacting legislation -- Carter fared quite poorly, with the recognition that he tried to push a bold, difficult agenda," Peterson said. Overall, though, experts we interviewed said Carter's legislative record exceeds its reputation. "It's somewhat of a mixed case, but it is more successful than most people think," Rudalevige said. Consider his victory on the 1978 Panama Canal treaties, noted George C. Edwards III, a professor of political science at Texas A&M University who has written about Carter's legislative record. In 1976, almost half of the Senate pledged they would vote against altering the existing arrangement. Carter managed to get the two-thirds vote needed to change it in 1978. Now, what do we make of all this? We found no evidence that Carter's record surpassed every president since Eisenhower's but Johnson's, but according to one measure, he was close. A broader look at Carter's legislative record showed it was mixed. In at least one case, the Panama Canal treaties, his achievement was exceptional. Yet while his proposals garnered favorable votes in one chamber, many never became law. It's hard to call that a true record of legislative success. Still, he did better than most people think.

pomt-05823	Says Scott Walker enacted "the biggest cuts to education in our state’s history."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/feb/19/kathleen-falk/recall-candidate-kathleen-falk-says-governor-scott/	Democrats searching for the right combination of punches to drive Scott Walker from office have focused on joblessness, schools, tax fairness and leadership style. One of the jabs they throw repeatedly centers on cuts Walker’s 2011-’13 budget made in state aid to local school districts. Kathleen Falk, the best-known Democrat so far in the likely 2012 gubernatorial recall election, tried to land a roundhouse right as she became the first announced candidate. The former Dane County executive told a Feb. 8, 2012 audience in La Crosse that Walker has "divided us instead of united us." "He's done it with the wrong choices," Falk said, according to a WXOW-TV online story. "He gave big tax breaks for a few and then made the biggest cuts to education in our state's history." The state’s history covers a long time. Are Walker’s cuts truly the largest ever? We have already looked at several statements about Walker’s education budget. We gave state Rep. Jennifer Shilling, D-La Crosse, a Mostly False for saying Walker’s property tax freeze would cost schools $1.6 billion in revenue. It was about half that, according to the most common accounting. We labeled Mostly False a claim from Senate Minority Leader Mark Miller that Wisconsin "enacted the most drastic cuts to K-12 public schools of any state in the nation." At the time, the study he cited looked at only 24 states, not all 50. Now we have Falk’s claim. It is bold, but it actually is narrowly drawn, referring specifically to cuts in state aid -- a number easy to track and measure. Asked for backup, Falk’s campaign said she was referring not just to state aid to local schools, but cuts in state funding to the university system and technical colleges. And she meant the biggest cut ever in raw dollars, according to campaign spokesman Scot Ross. To be sure, Walker made two other moves that affected school budgets: A virtual freeze on schools’ ability to increase property taxes to make up for lost aid, and collective bargaining limits that allowed many districts to cut costs by imposing larger contributions from workers towards health insurance and pensions. But Falk’s statement was not about net impact, just the state funding side of the equation. Falk’s campaign did not provide a total of the education cuts, nor provide any history of funding cuts other than to say they had found none bigger. We did the math and found $792 million in aid cuts to school districts, $250 million in reduced aid to the university system and $71.6 million from the tech colleges. Total: $1.11 billion. Looking at it in terms of raw dollars limits the usefulness of any comparison, given inflation. That said, let’s look back. Local schools Walker’s budget was not the first to cut education aid, though any cut is rare. Facing a massive projected shortfall, lawmakers and then-Gov. Jim Doyle, a Democrat, approved cutting $284 million from aid to school districts in the 2009-11 budget. The cut under Doyle was the first ever, according to Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, a nonpartisan research group that tracks the history of aid changes. We couldn’t confirm that, but went back to the mid 1980s and found no evidence of a cut. If there was one earlier than that, it couldn’t rival Walker’s -- unless a previous governor cut 100 percent of the school aid budget, which was much smaller then. Walker’s $792 million cut was much larger in raw dollars than the $284 million cut in 2009, and as a percentage -- 7.4 percent vs. 2.6 percent. In the first year under Walker’s budget, nearly all districts lost aid, and the median decrease was 9.9 percent, according to the state Department of Public Instruction. University system Doyle and Walker cut identical amounts -- $250 million -- from the base budget of the UW system. The cut under Doyle was in 2003-05. The cut under Doyle was a bigger percentage cut than Walker’s because the university system’s biennial budget from state taxes grew from about $2 billion to $2.3 billion between 2003 to 2011. On the other hand, Walker’s cut was deeper if you factor all the budget adjustments to the state-tax-supported portion of UW’s budget, according to Dave Loppnow, an education funding expert at the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. For instance, UW got more state funding for things like rising fuel and utility costs, offsetting some of the $250 million funding cut. By this measure, it was about an 8 percent reduction by Doyle, and 9 percent under Walker. Loppnow said the $250 million base-budget cuts under both governors were the largest ever in raw dollars. Tech schools Walker proposed, and the Republican-controlled Legislature passed, a 30 percent cut in general aid to the state’s technical college system. That amounted to $71.6 million over two years. The tech college system found records dating to 1991 that showed only one other general aid cut -- a 0.5 percent trim in 2007. As we noted in a recent item, that general aid is only 12 percent of the tech system’s funding, which relies heavily on property taxes. So, in the big picture, there have been very few instances of cuts to education, with all of them coming in recent years as deficits mounted. What makes the Walker cuts stand out is the combination -- in the same budget -- of reductions across the three levels of education: kindergarten-12th grade; tech colleges; and the universities. In 2003-05, when the UW took a hit, Doyle and lawmakers boosted the K-12 budget by 1 percent, or $115 million. And the tech colleges’ general state aid was not reduced. As we noted, there were many other changes in the budget. Notably, Walker sharply curtailed collective bargaining rights for public employees, including university and local school employees. That allowed local school districts to save at least $200 million in pension costs because most districts put in place a pension change made possible by the budget, according to Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates, school officials and our calculations. The savings to districts from changes to health insurance premiums were significant in some cases, but vary widely by district; no statewide cost savings estimate is available. But some districts, due to existing union contracts and other reasons, were not able to benefit from the health insurance changes. That underlines an element essential aspect of Falk’s statement: The state controls its aid, but not what is done at the local level. Our conclusion Falk claimed Walker’s cuts in state support to local schools, tech colleges and public universities amount to the largest in state history. We found previous cuts in those areas, but not in all three in the same year, and not nearly as deep when you roll them all together as has Falk. We rate her statement True.

pomt-02527	"It’s been 14 years since a president or a vice president or a member of their family has not gone and attended at least an event at the Olympics."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/09/candy-crowley/cnns-candy-crowley-says-its-unusual-president-or-t/	Relations between Russia and the United States have been decidedly frosty recently, and the international spirit of the Olympics doesn’t seem to have delivered much of a thaw. Or at least, that is one way to read the roster of the official delegation to the games in Sochi. Former Homeland Security director Janet Napolitano leads the group named by the White House. CNN’s Candy Crowley reminded Napolitano of how administrations have handled this before. "I'm sure it's been noted to you, that it's been 14 years since a president or a vice president or a member of their family has not gone and attended at least an event at the Olympics," Crowley said on CNN’s State of the Union. "Can you tell me as a practitioner of both policy and politics why Sochi is different for the U.S.?" Napolitano denied that any snub of Russian President Vladimir Putin was intended. Obama, she said, had sent a group that "represented the broad values of the United States." The Obama administration has made it clear that acceptance of gays and lesbians ranks prominently among those values. When the White House announced the delegation list, a spokesperson said it "represented the diversity that is the United States." The list included the gay tennis star, Billie Jean King. Russia’s anti-gay bias has become a sticking point between the two nations. The president himself said his schedule doesn’t allow him to attend. The meaning behind the make-up of the delegation is a matter for diplomats and students of international relations. In this fact-check, we will look at whether the tradition that Crowley suggested actually has been in place since 2000. As this table shows, the record speaks for itself. Year City Who went 1998 Nagano, Japan Tipper Gore 2000 Sydney, Australia Chelsea Clinton 2002 Salt Lake City, Utah George W. Bush 2004 Athens, Greece George H.W. Bush, Barbara Bush 2006 Turin, Italy Laura Bush 2008 Beijing, China George W. Bush 2010 Vancouver, Canada Joe Biden, Jill Biden 2012 London, England Michelle Obama While it’s uncommon for an American president to attend, the White House has reliably extended the personal touch. Crowley’s statement includes the important catch-all category of family member to make her claim accurate. As far back as 1998, the then-wife of Vice President Al Gore, Tipper Gore, represented the White House at the Winter games in Nagano, Japan. For the 2000 Summer games in Sydney, Australia, President Bill Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea, took time off from college to watch the competition. In 2004, it was the president’s father and mother, former President George H. W. Bush and Barbara Bush, who made the family connection in Athens, Greece. George W. Bush stands out for having personally attended twice. The first time, the games took place on American soil in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the leader of the host country pretty much always attends. But Bush also made the trip to Beijing in 2008 where he memorably bumped a volleyball to a bikini clad member of the U.S. beach volleyball team. Our ruling Crowley said "a president or a vice president or a member of their family" has attended every Olympic games since 2000. That is accurate. In fact, the tradition goes back 16 years to 1998. We rate Crowley’s claim True.	None	Candy Crowley	None	None	None	2014-02-09T15:27:44	2014-02-09	['None']

pomt-01015	"GEORGIA ROADWAY FATALITIES THIS YEAR: 59 PLEASE DRIVE SAFELY"	true	/georgia/statements/2015/feb/02/billboard-spaghetti-junction/dot-sign-counts-roadway-deaths/	New Year’s resolutions were still rolling around in our heads, if not being followed. Traffic was moving at a reasonable Saturday clip, which, in metro Atlanta, means it was moving. And suddenly, an overhead sign on I-85 southbound near Spaghetti Junction announced a harsh reality. "GEORGIA ROADWAY FATALITIES THIS YEAR: 59," the sign stated in large lighted letters. "PLEASE DRIVE SAFELY." Twenty-four days into January, could that be right? This PolitiFact Georgia scribe was curious. We contacted Natalie Dale, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Transportation, who told us the message board’s numbers were already outdated. Roadway deaths, statewide, for the new year were updated to 70 by Wednesday, Jan. 28th. Among those killed were seven people in Chatham County, five in Fulton County and four in Hall and Hart counties, according to DOT data. Eleven were pedestrians, including Gayla Joyce Walker, 53. The Dunwoody woman was struck repeatedly on I-285 in Sandy Springs, prompting an investigation that shut down a portion of the interstate and snarled traffic for more than three hours during morning rush hour on Jan.22. Two other pedestrians, both over 65, were killed in Fulton County, one on 10th Street and one on Ralph David Abernathy Boulevard, DOT data shows. If previous trends continue, Fulton, DeKalb, Gwinnett and Cobb, Georgia’s most populous counties, will likely end the year with the highest percentages of roadway deaths. But the number of roadway fatalities statewide would actually be down. DOT data shows that roadway deaths in the state have declined slightly year over year -- going from 1,503 in 2008 to 1,147 last year, despite there being nearly a half-million more vehicles on the road. (The state had 8.5 million registered vehicles in 2008 and just less than 9 million vehicles in 2014, according to data we obtained from the Georgia Department of Revenue). State officials offer several potential explanations for the decline in roadway deaths. Dale said safety enhancements, including raised medians, have been DOT priorities. Raised medians have a track record of reducing all accidents by 55 percent and pedestrian accidents in urban areas by 90 percent, she said. Harris Blackwood, director of the Governor’s Office of Highway Safety, said greater seatbelt use is likely a factor. "We’re seeing some of the highest seat belt use -- somewhere north of 95 percent," Blackwood said. That -- combined with safer cars, stepped-up enforcement of drunken driving laws and graduated drivers’ licenses for young drivers -- could be contributing to fewer roadway deaths, he said. Our Ruling. Interstate message boards are being used to alert the motoring public to the latest data on roadway deaths. That can be quickly changing data. Last year, about three people died each day on Georgia roads. That’s a statistic worth pointing out. We rate the DOT post True.

pomt-10647	"I supported the surge when you didn't."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/06/mike-huckabee/romney-supported-it-from-the-start/	Mike Huckabee has been trying to convince voters recently that while he's committed to the troop surge in Iraq, Mitt Romney has wavered. After winning the Iowa caucuses, Huckabee carried that theme into the Republican debate on Jan. 5, 2008, telling Romney, "I supported the surge when you didn't." He has made the point in other forums, too, saying in a Dec. 30, 2007, appearance on Meet the Press : "I stood by (President Bush) in the war. I stood by him in the surge. I wasn't a latecomer like Mitt Romney was to believing that the surge was effective." Like Huckabee, Romney immediately and publicly supported the troop surge when President Bush announced it on Jan. 10, 2007. Seven months later, Romney announced a push to give extra support to the soldiers participating in the surge. Because the record does not support Huckabee's claims, we asked his staff to explain. They responded with links to recent interviews and debates that they said would show a difference between the candidates. We'll address them individually: • First, the staff analysis paired two clips — a Huckabee statement that aired Jan. 10 and 11 on the Fox network in which he praises Bush's announcement and a Dec. 2, 2006, article on the conservative Web site, HumanEvents.com, in which Romney — not yet a candidate for president — declined to weigh in on the issue until the president's announcement. The staff omitted Romney's Jan. 10, 2007, announcement that he supported the surge. It also did not include Huckabee's Jan. 24, 2007, statement in an MSNBC interview expressing doubts about the strategy. In the interview, Huckabee said, "I'm not sure that I support the troop surge if that surge has to come from our guard and reserve troops which have really been overly stretched." • Next, the Huckabee staff pointed to an April 3, 2007, interview on Good Morning America in which Romney supported a secret timetable for withdrawal, saying: "There's no question that the president and (Iraqi) Prime Minister al-Maliki have to have a series of timetables and milestones that they speak about, but those shouldn't be for public pronouncement. ... You don't want the enemy to understand how long they have to wait in the weeds until you're going to be gone." The staff left out Huckabee's Feb. 13, 2006, interview with USA Today, in which he, like Romney, saw the need for a withdrawal strategy. "I supported the president when he went in," Huckabee told the newspaper. "But I am disappointed. We don't have an exit strategy. I worry about the equipment of our armed forces. I worry that there is no end game. I don't favor a pullout date, but I believe we have to have a timetable for Iraq to take over security and civil administration. And we don't have that." • Finally, the staff points to a September 2007 Republican debate in Durham, N.H., arguing: "Governor Huckabee said, 'We have to continue the surge' (while) Governor Romney was only willing to commit that the surge was 'apparently' working, saying his course of action depended on 'if' the surge was working. We would note two things. First, the two candidates were asked very different questions in that debate. Romney was asked how long into the future he would commit U.S. troops in Iraq while Huckabee was asked directly if the surge should continue. Second, Romney also expressed hope the surge would work and said the troops should be supported. In addition, we note that the Councll on Foreign Relations, an independent think tank, finds no difference between Romney and Huckabee on this issue, saying both support the troop surge. Huckabee's claims about Romney were the subject of a Jan. 6, 2007, interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday. Wallace pressed him on the fact that the record did not square with his claims. Huckabee responded but did not answer the question. The record shows that Huckabee and Romney both have supported the surge and, at times, have both expressed doubts about the ability of the president's Iraq strategy to work in the long run. Huckabee says he's more committed to the surge. We find his claim False.	None	Mike Huckabee	None	None	None	2008-01-06T00:00:00	2008-01-05	['None']

pomt-01776	"By some estimates, as few as 2 percent of the 50,000 (Central American) children who have crossed the border illegally this year have been sent home."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/28/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-2-percent-children-apprehended-borde/	Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, one of the Republican Party’s most vocal advocates of federal action on immigration policy, recently re-entered the immigration debate with an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal regarding the thousands of undocumented Central American minors flocking to the United States border. Bush, a potential 2016 candidate, co-authored the op-ed with Clint Bolick, the vice president for litigation at the libertarian Goldwater Institute (the two also teamed up for a book on immigration in 2013). Before laying out their suggested course of action, Bush and Bolick explain the problem. "Currently the vast number of children is overwhelming the process," they wrote. "Roughly half do not show up for their hearings. As a result, judging by Homeland Security figures, only a fraction of the approximately 20,000 Central American children who entered the country illegally in 2013 were repatriated. By some estimates, as few as 2 percent of the 50,000 children who have crossed the border illegally this year have been sent home." We’ve already looked at the number of minors who report for their hearings. (Bush's description of it as "roughly half" is not far off from what we found.) But what about the number of children that the government has returned this year? We decided to look into the stat. Where did 2 percent come from? Right off the bat, we’ll note that these numbers are hard to pin down. This particular immigration issue crosses multiple government agencies — the Justice Department, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Department of Homeland Security, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and U.S. Customs and Border Protection, among others. Each one we contacted sent us toward a different department or agency to find the number. The bureaucratic labyrinth ultimately gave us no answer. So where did Bush get this 2 percent figure? A spokeswoman told PolitiFact that it came from a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing meeting on July 9, where many of the aforementioned bureaucracies testified. During the hearing, R. Gil Kerlikowske, commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said since the start of Fiscal Year 2014 (which begins in October 2013), about 57,000 unaccompanied minors were apprehended. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., then asked: "Of those 57,000, how many have been returned?" Kerlikowske said he didn’t know because his agency only deals with "apprehension." "Okay, so who would know?" Johnson asked the panel. "Who'd know the number of how many of those have been returned?" "The numbers I have that we talked about, about 1,300, 1,500," said Thomas Winkowski, the principal deputy assistant secretary for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. If you do the math, 1,300 to 1,500 out of 57,000 is about 2 or 3 percent. So Bush seems to be right. But the numbers get a bit more complicated than that. In his op-ed (and his office confirmed) Bush was discussing a specific issue: the number of children from Central American countries showing up at the border. Due to a 2008 immigration law, Mexican children are processed differently than those coming from non-border countries. It’s the surge in Central American children that make up the ongoing border crisis. Once apprehended at the border, minors from Central America are screened for trafficking or other signs of abuse. Immigration and Customs officials issue a "notice of removal" that begins the legal proceedings to determine whether the child must be deported. In the meantime, the law instructs the child to be placed with a family member or sponsor, if possible. Immigration courts then determine whether a child is eligible for asylum or specialized visas for victims of trafficking, but that process can take years. Mexican children, meanwhile, can just be turned around at the border by U.S. authorities. The 57,000 figure includes children from Mexico, who make up about 12,600 of the apprehended minors. When you subtract the Mexican children from the three main Central American countries — El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras — you get about 44,000. From the testimony, it’s also not clear how many of the 1,300 to 1,500 returned are from Mexico and how many are from Central America. Bush’s office sent us to Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. McCain’s staff told us that Immigration and Customs Enforcement said to them that 890 of the apprehended children from Central America in 2014 have been returned, but they could not forward us that correspondence and the agency would not confirm it independently. For what it’s worth, 890 is 2 percent of 44,000. A study released July 28 (after Bush’s op-ed was released) also seemed to back up the general figure. The Bipartisan Policy Center found about 18,300 cases in 2014 of juveniles from Central America entering the system (meaning, not just apprehended but beginning the legal procedures). Through June 2014, 393 have been ordered for removal and 62 left voluntarily. Together, that’s about 2.4 percent of all cases. (The data comes from the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse, a data gathering service of Syracuse University, not a federal agency.) Why so low? According to the Bipartisan Policy Center study, 95 percent of the 2014 cases are still pending. A big reason why only 2 percent have been removed is because so few cases have made it to a hearing a yet — not because they failed to show up to a court hearing, like Bush wrote. Compare that to previous years. About 70 percent of the 2013 cases are still pending. Still, in about 15 percent of cases the minor was ordered to return to Central America or left the United States voluntarily. In 2012, more than a quarter of all cases resulted in removal orders; in 2011, it was one-third. In an example of how arduous this process can be, 8 percent of 2009 cases are still pending, the study found. Experts we spoke with said the legal proceedings can take two to three years. Why does it take so long? Previously, cases involving undocumented minors took a back seat in the court system to immigration cases involving apprehended adults. The Obama administration has taken steps to make these cases involving Central American children a priority, but immigration courts are notoriously overworked and the influx of new cases in the past 12 months has exasperated the issue, further slowing the process. Our ruling Bush wrote, "As few as 2 percent of the 50,000 (Central American) children who have crossed the border illegally this year have been sent home." It’s surprisingly difficult to track down exact numbers, but from what we can gather, that number appears accurate. That figure, though, is only useful as a snapshot of the current state of affairs; it is likely the number will rise as more and more of these children go through the legal process. Further, Bush said the low number was a result of Central American children skipping their court appearances. Actually, it has more to do with how long the legal proceedings take. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2014-07-28T16:07:58	2014-07-23	['None']

pomt-14393	"The [Obama] administration’s regulatory assault on coal-fired energy has put thousands of Americans out of work"	mostly false	/missouri/statements/2016/mar/16/roy-blunt/sen-blunt-overstates-white-house-policys-impact-co/	Supporters of the coal industry have criticized President Barack Obama’s administration as it attempts to establish stricter environmental regulations on coal-fired plants in the U.S. The Clean Power Plan is the administration’s latest initiative to combat climate change. The Environmental Protection Agency proposes restrictions on coal-fired plants to reduce carbon emissions. On Feb. 9 the U.S. Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that the Clean Power Plan would not be allowed to go into effect until the court is able to hear arguments from those who support and oppose the plan. Before that ruling, Republican Sen. Roy Blunt spoke out against the Clean Power Plan in a January press release. Blunt said: "The administration’s regulatory assault on coal-fired energy has put thousands of Americans out of work, and threatens to double utility costs for Missouri families by 2020." We decided to look into that statement. Employment in the coal industry Employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows jobs in coal were declining well before Obama took office in 2009. Coal mining employment has been dropping since 1985. There are a number of market factors contributing to the long downturn, including technological innovation, investments in natural gas and renewable energy. PolitiFact has reported on the Obama administration’s impact on the coal industry before and found coal has been losing to natural gas for a while now. Natural gas attracts companieslooking for cheaper, cleaner and more efficient energy. Employment in the coal industry has declined faster since Obama’s first term, but Josh Bivens, research and policy director at the Economic Policy Institute, a group that receives significant funding from labor unions, says regulations adopted by the administration so far probably only had a marginal effect. Instead, the decline has to do more with cheaper natural gas. "More than anything to me, they’re just sort of locking in the coal declines that were originally caused by the decline in natural gas prices," Bivens said. "The single biggest factor in the decline of the coal sector over the past decade has been the big fall in the price of natural gas." Bivens added that if the Clean Power Plan goes into effect, he expects jobs in the coal industry to decline further. Electric bills We can’t fact-check a prediction, so Blunt’s assertion about the doubling of utility costs is beyond the scope of this fact-check. But we did look into the source behind his forecast. Blunt spokesman Brian Hart pointed us to this study on behalf of a group of Midwest utilities and regulators. We found two significant issues. First, the study says Missouri electricity bills could possibly double by 2030, not 2020. Second, the study was conducted in 2009, but Obama and the EPA didn’t actually propose the Clean Power Plan until 2015. The methodologies used to conduct the study aren’t consistent with Obama’s current environmental proposal. But we did find a study from the U.S. Environmental Information Administration that specifically breaks down how the Clean Power Plan will affect electrical utilities. That agency predicts electricity prices will rise slightly in the early 2020s. Prices will differ across the country, but the highest rise in prices is predicted to be 7 percent. Our ruling Blunt said the Obama administration’s regulations have caused thousands of workers in the coal industry to lose their jobs. While the decline in coal industry employment is real, the role of administration policy is less certain. Experts note that competition from abundant, cheap natural gas has reduced the demand for coal more than any other factor. With less demand, the need for workers falls. While the administration has encouraged movement away from coal for environmental reasons, market forces in the energy sector have been the dominant driver. While it is impossible to know how utility costs will rise or fall in the future, the study on which Blunt based his claims was conducted before the Clean Power Plan was enacted.

We don’t send them back."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/apr/27/ron-johnson/sen-ron-johnson-says-people-walk-us-border-say-few/	A caravan of Hondurans and other Central Americans fleeing poverty and gang violence by heading north through Mexico triggered a tweet storm from President Donald Trump. On April 2, 2018, Trump tweeted: "The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our 'Weak Laws' Border, had better be stopped before it gets there. Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen. Congress MUST ACT NOW!" The president continued to tweet about building a wall and securing the southern border of the United States as the White House announced a plan to deploy National Guard troops. In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker said he is committed to sending troops from the state's National Guard to the Mexican border if asked by the Trump administration. Meanwhile, the caravan that started off with more than 1,000 people had diminished a week later, with many migrants planning to remain in Mexico but some determined to continue their journey all the way to the U.S. border to apply for asylum in this country. On Friday, according to National Public Radio reports, the Central American migrants were gathering near the U.S. border and said they plan to request asylum from the U.S. government on Sunday. Into the midst of it all stepped U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, who declared during an April 3, 2018, interview on The Jeff Wagner Show on WTMJ radio (620 AM): "We need to fix our horribly broken legal immigration system." The senator went on to say: "We have laws on the books where people can walk right up to our ports of entry, say ‘I have a credible fear of persecution,’ and we bring them in. We don’t send them back." Is Johnson, who chairs the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, correct? Is it that simple to get into the country? And to stay here? The evidence When asked for backup for the claim, Johnson’s staff pointed to a variety of situations and scenarios, including legal precedents (the 1997 Flores settlement); the Homeland Security Act; and the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. An email from Johnson’s office also pointed to the issues of unaccompanied minors, immigration court capacity and hearings on border security, as well as "credible fear" claims. Let’s sort this out. It’s important to note Johnson’s claim focuses on those seeking asylum status. That is different than those who may seek to enter the country as refugees or other immigration channels. For example, the difference between asylees and refugees is procedural, according to AllLaw.com, a website that includes links to legal information, forms, and news. A person who requests asylum in the United States is called an asylee. A person who requests protection while still overseas, and then is given permission to enter the U.S., is called a refugee. An asylee, or a person granted asylum, is authorized to work in the United States, can apply for a Social Security card, can request permission to travel overseas and can petition to bring family members to the United States. Asylees may also be eligible for federal or Office of Refugee Resettlement benefits, such as Medicaid or Refugee Medical Assistance. After one year, an asylee may apply for permanent resident status (i.e., a green card). Once the individual becomes a permanent resident, he or she must wait four years to apply for citizenship. Testimony from border patrol agents and federal officials at Senate Homeland Security Committee hearings has included first-hand testimony from border agents and federal officials on the migrants presenting themselves at the border, citing fear of being accosted, forced into or killed by Central American gangs. Others have claimed they cannot return to their country of origin because of fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a political social group, or political opinion. The U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services website details a variety of guidelines on how to proceed when migrants arrive at the border seeking asylum, including details on the definition for "credible fear of persecution or torture": Q. What is a Credible Fear of Persecution? A. A "significant possibility" that you can establish in a hearing before an Immigration Judge that you have been persecuted or have a well-founded fear of persecution on account of your race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion if returned to your country. Q. What Is a Credible Fear of Torture? A. A "significant possibility" that you can establish in a hearing before an Immigration Judge that you would be subject to torture if returned to your country. Asylum denials Contrary to what Johnson’s claim suggests, denials of asylum by immigration judges have been rising. As of the end of September 2016, overall asylum denial rates for fiscal year 2016 had risen to 57 percent. The total number of asylum denials from fiscal year 2011 to fiscal year 2016 was 125,066, or 49.8 percent, according to Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse TracImmigration. Among the number of Immigration Court asylum cases decided during fiscal year 2011 through fiscal year 2016, Mexico had the highest number of denials, with 12,028, or 89.6 percent. Others with high rates of denials include El Salvador with 11,546, or 82.9 percent; Honduras with 7,350, or 80.3 percent; Haiti with 1,599, or 80.1 percent; and the Dominican Republic, with 407 denials, or 87 percent. A 2017 analysis by Reuters illustrated that the difference between an asylum seeker being granted residency or ordered deported depends largely on which judge hears the case, and where. Syracuse University’s Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TracImmigration), confirmed that report. The median level of asylum decision disparity that asylum seekers face is now over 56 percentage points. That is, the assignment of the judge for the typical asylum seeker could alter the odds of receiving asylum by this magnitude. For example, while the specific ranges differed by court, the typical asylum seeker might have only a 15 percent chance of being granted asylum all the way up to a 71 percent chance depending on the particular judge to whom their case is assigned. In addition, Johnson’s argument that "we don’t send them back" comes with a major caveat. Under international law, the United States can’t simply "send them back," according to a Yale Law School report: Summary removal procedures put the United States at risk of violating the principle of non-refoulement, which forbids states from forcibly repatriating individuals who have legitimate claims for international protection. To satisfy its obligations under the Refugee Convention, the United States must provide arriving noncitizens a genuine opportunity to pursue asylum claims prior to their removal. A Trump directive calls for expediting eligibility claims of those attempting to stay in the United States and promptly deporting those whose claims are rejected. Unaccompanied minors Things work somewhat differently when children -- "unaccompanied minors," in immigration parlance -- arrive at the border themselves. Those procedures are covered by the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act. In those cases, the children are screened and may be placed in the care of a sponsor – usually a parent, relative, or family friend – who can care for them while their immigration cases proceed. If the child fails to show up for a hearing, he or she can be ordered deported. However, deporting unaccompanied minors who are no shows in court is no easy task, because some do not stay at the addresses provided to the government and disappear into the general population. Expert opinion We also turned to Fatma E. Marouf, a professor of law and director of the Immigrant Rights Clinic at Texas A&M University School of Law, who made it clear it’s not as simple as saying the right words and being allowed to stay. "If they pass the credible fear interview, they will be placed in removal proceedings and have an opportunity to apply for asylum in immigration court. If their case is denied, they will be deported," he said. "In some cases, (authorities) may choose to parole the person into the country instead of keeping him or her detained, but that is very much the exception, not the rule." Our rating Johnson said "We have laws on the books where people can walk right up to our ports of entry, say I have a credible fear of persecution, and we bring them in. We don’t send them back." His claim is problematic on two fronts. First, those who make a "credible fear" claim are not simply brought into the United States. Rather, there is an extensive review process and, in some cases, asylum cases can take years. Second, statistics show that many have their cases rejected and are sent back -- including nearly 90% of those from Mexico. That said, the scenario Johnson lays out can happen with unaccompanied children who arrive at the border -- for example if they fail to show up for their hearing and disappear into the country instead. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.

pomt-12785	"Today, 27 million people .. are enslaved."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2017/feb/17/bob-corker/are-27-million-people-trapped-modern-slavery/	If the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Bob Corker, R-Tenn., has one special cause, it is ending modern slavery. In December, he won passage of a law that uses $50 million in federal money to seed a private foundation aimed at ending forced labor and human trafficking for the sex trade. "It's illegal in every country in the world, including ours," Corker said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Feb. 15, 2017. "But, today, 27 million people, as we speak on this program, are enslaved." That’s a big number, and we looked into the research behind it. Corker acknowledged that hard data is, well, hard to find. "Many human trafficking and modern slavery victims are part of a hidden population, which unfortunately makes it almost impossible to count with 100 percent accuracy just how many human beings are trapped around the world," Corker told us. "Fortunately, there are numbers of well-respected organizations that have done extensive work on this issue and give us a general sense of the magnitude of the problem." One advocacy group Corker relied on is End It, which cited estimates ranging from 20 million to 45.8 million. That’s quite a span, which suggests considerable differences of opinion as to what constitutes slavery and how to measure it. Siddarth Kara, director of the Program on Human Trafficking and Modern Slavery at Harvard’s Kennedy School, told us the 27-million figure has been in circulation for years. Kara gives more weight to the lower estimate of 20.9 million from the International Labor Organization’s 2012 report on forced labor. That study found that 4.5 million people were trapped by sexual exploitation. Another 14.2 million were locked in work that ranged from mining, to agriculture, to domestic service and manufacturing. The situation is complex. They found that people such as migrant workers can move in and out of forced labor. In Kara’s view, the truth lies between 20 and 40 million, and "closer to the International Labor Organization metric, I believe." A key architect of the high-end estimate is Kevin Bales, professor of contemporary slavery at the University of Nottingham in England. Bales works closely with the Australian anti-slavery organization Walk Free to produce the Global Slavery Index. The index includes in its definition of slavery the same conditions as the International Labor Organization, but adds in child soldiers, child brides and other forced marriages. Bales told us "the 45.8 million number is by far the most accurate." It is based, he said, on surveys and statistical models that have been checked against multiple measures. But many long-time researchers of modern slavery strongly criticize the methods behind the Global Slavery Index. "The trouble with this potentially admirable effort is that the data on which these tables rely is usually second-hand and often of seriously poor quality," wrote Neil Howard, a fellow at the European University Institute in Florence. Howard studies labor exploitation in the West African nation of Benin, one of the highest-ranked trouble spots in the index. In an op-ed in the Guardian in 2014, he said the reality is different from the story told in the index. "I worked with teenage boys who were said to be victims of trafficking and apparently forced from Benin to the artisanal quarries of Abeokuta, in Nigeria," Howard wrote. "The adolescent boys I interviewed willingly migrate to the quarries as part of a highly structured migrant network providing labor for the Beninese expatriate community that runs the quarry economy." However, even ardent critics of the larger figures in the index still describe a problem that afflicts millions of people. Joel Quirk, professor of political studies at the University of the Witwatersrand in South Africa, told us the overreach for hard data is rooted in the "huge market demand for numbers amongst journalists, government officials and the general public." At the end of the day, Quirk said, "I would generally go with tens of millions" of people living in some form of slavery. Our ruling Corker said 27 million people are enslaved worldwide. He acknowledged that it is difficult to put a precise number on modern slavery. We found that different estimates defined slavery in different ways and used different methods to arrive at a number. Estimates range from 20 million to 46 million. Among the experts we reached who question the higher estimates, we heard that Corker’s figure is in the right range.

pomt-07099	When Mitt Romney was governor, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states in job creation.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/22/david-axelrod/dems-say-when-mitt-romney-was-governor-massachuset/	On the campaign trail, Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney often blasts President Barack Obama's record on job creation while touting his own success in creating jobs as governor of Massachusetts. But a popular rebuttal by a number of Democratic leaders lately is this statistic: When Romney was governor, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states in job creation. Most recently, senior Obama re-election campaign strategist David Axelrod dropped the statistic in an interview on CNN's State of the Union on June 19, 2011. "If you're Governor Romney and you say I'm going to turn this economy around, I've got the answers. You don't offer them. Then people have a right to say, why is it that your state was 47th in the country in job creation when you were governor?" Axelrod said. Former White House spokesman Robert Gibbs cited the 47th out of 50 statistic in interviews before and after the most recent Republican debate. And on NBC's Meet the Press on June 12, 2011, Democratic National Committee chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz said, "Mitt Romney is pretty darn vulnerable on the economy himself. When he was governor, he literally was 47th in job creation. For someone who touts his own ability to create jobs, we're talking about somebody that never created and recovered the amount of jobs lost in Massachusetts from the 2001 recession when he was governor." Clearly this statistic is now part of the Democrats' playbook on Romney, prompted by his claims about success in job creation. First, it's true that when Romney took office, Massachusetts was losing jobs. And when he left, it was gaining jobs. So the job situation clearly improved. The argument, however, is that Massachusetts' jobs recovery was much slower than other states. We asked the Democratic National Committee for backup on the statistic, and they pointed us first to a Feb. 23, 2010, story in the Wall Street Journal's MarketWatch website. Reporter Brett Arends looked at statistics from January 2003, when Romney took office, to January 2007, when he left, and reported: During that time, according to the U.S. Labor Department, the state ranked 47th in the entire country in jobs growth. Fourth from last. The only ones that did worse? Ohio, Michigan and Louisiana. In other words, two rustbelt states and another that lost its biggest city to a hurricane. The Massachusetts jobs growth over that period, a pitiful 0.9 percent, badly lagged other high-skill, high-wage, knowledge economy states like New York (2.7 percent), California (4.7 percent) and North Carolina (7.6 percent). The national average: More than 5 percent. Romney campaign spokesman Eric Fehrnstrom called the DNC's statistic "laughable" in view of President Obama's negative jobs record. "Mitt Romney took office during a recession when the state was losing thousands of jobs every month," Fehrnstrom wrote in an e-mail. "He not only stopped the job losses, but ended his four years in office with positive numbers on the board. If you go back and look at the last 10 years, it was a lost decade for job growth in Massachusetts. The only bright spot was Mitt Romney’s term as governor. Both his predecessor and his successor posted job losses." Fehrnstrom's statement about the anomaly of net job growth during Romney's tenure, as opposed to net job losses under both his predecessor and successor, is accurate. But there were two national recessions that bookended Romney's four years in office. Again, the DNC's point isn't that Massachusetts' job picture didn't improve during Romney's term in office, rather it's that it didn't improve as much as most other states during the same period. The DNC pointed us to an article from the Associated Press on Feb. 4, 2008, which begins: It's part of Mitt Romney's core narrative: Massachusetts, in the throes of a fiscal freefall, fell back on his CEO skills and turnaround wizardry to spark -- in his words -- "a dramatic reversal of state fortunes and a period of sustained economic expansion." It's a rosy opinion of Massachusetts' economy that few in the state share. Instead, observers say, the state's recovery from a disastrous 2001 recession has been tepid at best, and Romney gives himself more credit than deserved on job creation and balancing the state budget. Romney says that by the time he left office, the unemployment rate in Massachusetts was lower, and the state had recovered nearly 80,000 jobs from the low point of the recession. A fuller look reveals a state still struggling to recoup the jobs washed away in the recession, while much of the rest of the country has already sailed past pre-recession highs. According to state unemployment numbers, the net number of jobs added during the four years Romney was in office was 24,400 -- a fraction of the total of about 200,000 lost during the recession. Although the number of new jobs steadily climbed during Romney's four years in office -- from a loss of 54,700 in his first year to a gain of 34,700 in his final year -- most of the rest of the country rebounded much faster. Massachusetts is one of just six states that hasn't added back all the jobs lost during the recession. We ran the some numbers ourselves using data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics. We should note up front that there are a number of ways to slice the data, and the numbers change a bit depending on the parameters of your search. For example, do you look at all nonfarm workers (which includes government workers) or only private workers? We ran the numbers a few different ways, and while the numbers changed slightly, the ranking did not: Massachusetts was 47th out of 50 in the percentage of job growth. If you look at all nonfarm workers, for example, Massachusetts went from 3,158,800 jobs to 3,198,500, an increase of 1.3 percent. Only Ohio, Michigan and Louisiana were worse. The national average was 5.3 percent. At our request, the taxpayer-backed Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, which does nonpartisan analysis of the state's financial and economic statistics, ran some numbers as well. They looked at figures from December 2002 (right before Romney took office) to December 2006, so the percentages were slightly different than ours, but they came to the same ranking for Massachusetts. "Jobs grew, but they grew at an anemic rate compared to the rest of the country," said Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation. The country was coming out of a recession when Romney took office. And it's likely, Widmer said, that Massachusetts emerged more slowly from that recession because its pre-recession numbers were disproportionally inflated by the technology bubble. A lot of those tech jobs never came back. Widmer warned not to put to much stock in any governors' influence over their states' rate of job growth, or decline. The ability for governors to manage the state economy is vastly overrated, he said. States are tied to larger economic forces, he said, and governors often claim too much credit when things are going well and no blame when things are going poorly. But when you have Romney running for president as a business person who says he created jobs for the private sector when he was governor, "In that context, the numbers from the DNC are relevant," Widmer said. "They are a relevant and accurate rebuttal." However, to the extent that some may interpret the Democrats' statistic that Romney is to blame for Massachusetts ranking 47th out of 50 states in the percentage of job gains, Jeffrey Miron, director of undergraduate studies at the Harvard University Department of Economics, advises caution. "Governors and presidents generally get way too much credit and blame for job creation or losses," Miron said. Assessing a governor's performance on jobs is difficult due to national economic forces and policies that predate a governor's term in office, he said. "It's misleading to give him too much blame," Miron said. "I'm having a hard time pointing to anything he did that was that dramatic." And, Miron said, you'd also need to consider that if a state was faring better than others through the recession, there would be less room to go back up, and so the percentage gains would be smaller. Again, there are lots of ways to present jobs data. And jobs statistics can often be manipulated by political campaigns, so that it's possible for competing campaigns to point to equal and opposite statistics -- as is the case with Romney and job creation as governor. For example, the Romney campaign provided data showing that Massachusetts' rank in terms of the percentage of job growth improved from 49th out of 50 during 2003 to 36th during 2006. And, they note, Massachusetts added more than 47,000 jobs over the course of the Romney Administration -- a gross number that does not factor in job losses during the period Romney was governor, as the Associated Press did in citing the 24,400 job number. Our ruling As with many of the claims we check, there are two elements to Axelrod's claim. He is saying that 1) Massachusetts ranked 47th in job growth and 2) suggesting that Romney is to blame. We find he is right about the numbers. Indeed, federal jobs numbers indicate that, no matter how we sliced the data, the state was 47th. But we found little evidence to support the other part of Axelrod's claim, that Romney is responsible for those jobs numbers. Economists told us that it's a stretch to blame or credit Romney or any governor for job numbers. Overall, we find Axelrod's claim Half True.

pomt-12018	"Even with a permanent income tax increase... the budget is more than $1 billion out of balance…"	mostly true	/illinois/statements/2017/sep/20/bruce-rauner/rauners-right-illinois-budget-balancing-act-ongoin/	Illinois’ record budget standoff ended July 6 with legislative Democrats, joined by a handful of Republicans, approving a $36 billion spending plan for the fiscal year that began July 1, which is underpinned by a 32 percent hike in the state income tax rate. Enactment came July 6 over the objections of Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner, who two days earlier had vetoed the budget. "Even with the (House Speaker Michael) Madigan permanent 32% income tax increase, this budget remains $2 billion out of balance for fiscal year 2018," Rauner wrote in his July 4 veto statement. More than two months later -- after a summer in which tension over school funding made the budget debate seem a faint and distant memory -- Rauner has revived his claim that the Legislature has placed the state on a path to fiscal doom. "Even with a permanent income tax increase costing the average Illinois household more than $1,000 a year, the budget is more than $1 billion out of balance…," Rauner said in a Sept. 7 press release. However, his office cautions not to read too much into the downward revision of the unbalanced budget claim from $2 billion in July to $1 billion now. The difference, the administration says, is due to technical reasons and doesn’t mean the budget is in better shape than the governor originally asserted. The not-so-subtle subtext of Rauner’s claims in both his July veto message and his renewed criticism is that Democrats significantly jacked up taxes to impose a woefully deficient budget. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Unpacking the governor’s argument requires a trip into the weeds of budget minutia, not to mention a detour into political hypocrisy. When it comes to budgeting, Rauner has been clearly guilty of some of the same sins he is now complaining about. But being inconsistent and being wrong aren’t necessarily the same thing. Is Rauner correct that the General Assembly has produced a budget deeply in the red? We took a look at the numbers. Balancing act The Illinois Constitution defines a budget as balanced when spending doesn’t exceed "funds estimated to be available for the fiscal year." But "estimated" has given politicians license to stretch or shrink their definition of "balanced" to suit their needs. The Civic Federation, a Chicago-based government fiscal watchdog, noted in a Sept. 7 analysis that the budget as passed on July 6 -- which contained a $360 million operating surplus -- met the textbook definition of "balanced." "On paper, the budget enacted by the General Assembly on July 7 — in an override of another gubernatorial veto — has a modest surplus," noted the federation’s Institute for Illinois’ Fiscal Sustainability. But the budget is "built on assumptions" and making it work will depend on whether Rauner and the General Assembly can "make those assumptions hold up," said Civic Federation President Laurence Msall. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Two of those assumptions form the bulk of Rauner’s claim that the budget is in the red by more than $1 billion. Pension problem The first involves a Rauner-driven change in state pension options that Democrats came to embrace. Referred to as "Tier 3," it gives state workers a choice to divert some of their traditional benefits into a 401(k) style savings plan. The budget enacted over Rauner’s veto projects Tier 3 will save $500 million this fiscal year. But Rauner spokesman Jason Schaumburg said savings from this plan won’t happen during this budget year. And Illinois Teachers Retirement System Executive Director Dick Ingram told the Better Government Association that TRS anticipates an effective date of July 1, 2019, for the new plan. That means savings won’t show up until FY 2020. This validates a significant part of Rauner’s "out of balance" claim, but the irony here can’t go unmentioned. The $500 million savings figure in the current budget came from an estimate originally presented in Rauner’s ill-fated budget proposal from last February. That budget also contained $4.6 billion in phantom money identified only as "Working together on ‘grand bargain.’" And it was hardly the only time Rauner has pushed a budget full of the same sort of holes he now condemns. The first budget Rauner proposed in 2015 anticipated $2.2 billion in savings from a sweeping overhaul of pensions that at the time was of questionable constitutionality and was soon rendered invalid by the Illinois Supreme Court. Pay it forward The Sept. 7 press release in which Rauner made his claim about the budget imbalance also announced that the state would issue $6 billion in bonds to pay down part of the $16 billion bill backlog that accrued during the budget impasse of 2015-2017. The Illinois Comptroller’s Office said at the end of FY 2017 that the state was paying late payment penalties of 9 and 12 percent on $5.5 billion contained in the backlog. This costs the state about $2 million a day, according to the comptroller. By borrowing, the state can lower that rate by up to half while also getting payment quickly to creditors. Thus, the budget enacted in July contained a provision empowering the governor’s office to borrow up to $6 billion for this purpose. But as the Civic Federation noted, "the small projected budget surplus was estimated to support only $3 billion in borrowing capacity." Rauner was more pointed in his press release: "(A) $6 billion issuance would require 12 annual principal payments of $500 million, plus interest payments depending on the interest rate. The legislature-passed budget did not account for the increase in debt service costs to cover the bill backlog bond issuance." Schaumburg put the total figure at $600 million annually, which roughly squares with the Civic Federation’s statement. "The governor's office is identifying several hundred million dollars in possible spending reductions to address this budgetary shortfall," Rauner’s press release said. "The governor also would like the General Assembly to return to Springfield this fall to work with him to balance the budget and enact structural reforms that could save much more." But one of the budget’s chief architects, Rep. Greg Harris, D-Chicago, said Rauner is trying to make a crisis from what should be a source of fiscal relief. Though the budget gives the governor’s budget office the authority to borrow up to $6 billion, Rauner need not do it all at once. If the administration borrows $3 billion and uses it to pay down outstanding Medicaid bills, it will get $3 billion in matching funds from the federal government that can go toward paying down the backlog, Harris said. "A huge portion of the bills are Medicaid," Harris said. "That’s money that’s just sitting there." Medicaid bills make up $4.1 billion of the $16 billion backlog, according to the Illinois Comptroller’s Office. But an even bigger chunk of the backlog comes from bills owed to providers in the State Employee Group Insurance Program. In its May monthly report, the General Assembly’s Commission on Government Forecasting and Accountability said the state owed $4.65 billion in group health insurance payments plus $462 million in late fees. The comptroller’s office now estimates group health insurance costs make up $5.1 billion of the total backlog. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com The Civic Federation report also emphasizes that the $360 million surplus claimed in the budget (and disputed by Rauner) is fragile at best. It is built in large part on proceeds of $240 million from the sale of the James R. Thompson Center in Chicago. The sale of the 17-story behemoth in the heart of Chicago’s Loop has been stymied by political fighting ever since Rauner first proposed it in October 2015. "The (budget) surplus could be reduced if it takes longer than expected to find a buyer or if the structure is sold for less than the projected price," the report says. New numbers Rauner’s office also complains that new revenue projections provided in August by the Illinois Department of Revenue to the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget show more trouble ahead. "The General Assembly’s budget was based on an earlier revenue projection from April, but FY17 revenues continued to underperform for the remainder of FY17," Schaumburg said. "As a result, the GOMB estimate is $500 million lower than the General Assembly’s FY18 revenue estimate." This argument, however, ignores the budget-making calendar in the Illinois Constitution, which puts a May 31 deadline on passing a budget with a simple majority in the Legislature. Reason for hope? The tone of Rauner’s news release makes clear that there will be tension in Springfield in the months to come as lawmakers work to, as Msall puts it, make the budget’s assumptions hold up. This is not an unfamiliar position for Rauner and the Legislature, even though for the entirety of Rauner’s term they have yet to agree on a full budget. In March 2015, state government faced the prospect of running out of money unless the governor and lawmakers closed a gap of $1.6 billion. Working together, Rauner and the Legislature hammered out a solution that appeared, briefly, to signal good things for future bipartisan cooperation. Then as now, the effort involved salvaging an existing budget. That’s a departure from the two fiscal years in between, when government operating without any budget controls ran up the $16 billion bill backlog. Our ruling Gov. Bruce Rauner said Illinois’ current operating budget is "is more than $1 billion out of balance…" The head of the Illinois Teachers Retirement System confirms Rauner’s claim that the new pension plan expected to generate $500 million in anticipated savings won’t be enacted during the current fiscal year (or even the next one). The Civic Federation reports that the small surplus in the budget will finance only $3 billion of the $6 billion Rauner plans to borrow. But putting $3 billion toward past-due Medicaid bills would generate $3 billion in federal matching funds -- something Rauner has not discussed. Failure to sell or get the expected price for the Thompson Center are possible scenarios that could further imperil the budget. Some of the assumptions identified as sources of the trouble originated in Rauner’s own budget, a fact that Rauner does not acknowledge and that needs to be considered here. Whether or not the imbalance reaches more than $1 billion is debatable, but Rauner is correct that there remains much work to do. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-06214	"I never favored cap and trade."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/07/newt-gingrich/gingrich-claims-he-never-favored-cap-and-trade/	Three years ago, Newt Gingrich went on television, cozied up to Nancy Pelosi and preached the need to respond to global warming. "We do agree our country must take action to address climate change," Gingrich said from a couch, which was oddly positioned in front of the U.S. Capitol. What seemed like genuine, bipartisan PR in 2008 now looks like conservative heresy by the current frontrunner in the Republican presidential race. Gingrich now calls that TV ad the "dumbest single thing" he’s ever done and insists his policy stance on the environment passes all conservative muster. "If you notice, I never favored cap and trade," he said in a candidate forum in New York City on Dec. 3, 2011. Really? Never? We did a little digging and it didn't take long to find that Gingrich has been inconsistent and has at times advocated cap and trade legislation when combined with other approaches. Origins of cap and trade Cap and trade legislation seeks to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and other greenhouse gas sources by setting caps on the amount of pollutants a plant can spew into the air. Companies that come in below their cap are then allowed to sell their emission credits to other companies that need them. Supporters say the approach provides economic incentives to reduce pollution and innovate. Critics deride it as an energy tax and say it increases costs for everyone. The approach was originally employed to curb the pollutants that cause acid rain in the early 1990s. President George H.W. Bush championed it, with the support of both Democrats and Republicans in Congress -- including, yes, Newt Gingrich. The idea was to provide incentives to reduce acid rain through a marketplace approach. As scientists found more evidence of climate change, cap and trade became a popular solution. "It embodied freedom from the command and control regulation that can be so confining. It was seen as a real step in the right direction for that reason by a lot of Republicans," said Eric Pooley, a former journalist and author of the 2010 book The Climate War who is now a senior vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund. In 2008, it was one of the few areas of common ground for Barack Obama and John McCain. Both acknowledged climate change and favored carbon caps. But then several factors combined to change the dynamic, Pooley said. The recession made it hard to talk about any solution that had a price tag attached, and Republicans dug in against Obama's main initiatives. Plus, Pooley said, the rise of the tea party movement put pressure on moderate Republicans, especially those in the House who voted in favor of a cap and trade bill in 2009 that demanded major emissions cuts. The bill died in the Senate. Today, most Republicans in Congress are staunchly against cap and trade. Gingrich praises cap and trade But contrary to his claim this week, Gingrich has not been consistent on the issue. Four years ago, he was singing the praises of cap and trade -- as long as tax incentives were included in new laws. On Feb. 15, 2007, Gingrich went on the PBS show Frontline and championed cap and trade. Asked if he supported George W. Bush’s campaign pledge in 2000 to set mandatory carbon caps, Gingrich responded: "I think if you have mandatory carbon caps combined with a trading system, much like we did with sulfur, and if you have a tax-incentive program for investing in the solutions, that there's a package there that's very, very good. And frankly, it's something I would strongly support." he said. He then went on to criticize Bush for backing off the pledge. "If he had instituted a regime that combined three things I just said -- mandatory caps, a trading system inside the caps, as we have with clean air, and a tax incentive to be able to invest in the new technology and to be able to produce the new technology -- I think we would be much better off than we are in the current situation," Gingrich said. Two months later, Gingrich took part in a debate with Democratic Sen. John Kerry of Massachusetts about environmental matters. Gingrich was slightly less gung-ho about cap and trade than he had been on PBS, but his message of "urgent need for action" on environmental dangers was clear. "We should address it and we should address it very actively," he said in the debate, citing a UN report documenting the earth’s rising temperatures. "The … consensus is that humans have contributed to that. I don't think there's any consensus that we are the only contribution, but there is a clear agreement that human activity has helped increase the level of warmness." On cap and trade, Gingrich said he doubted whether the approach would be as effective with carbon dioxide emissions as it had been with sulfur pollution, which in his view is easier to measure. "And cap-and-trade, by the way, for sulfuric acid and acid rain -- which I voted for and helped pass as the Republican whip -- was a very definable number of plants. A carbon cap in trade, if it's universal, is enormously complicated and transfers an amazing amount of power to a Washington bureaucracy and will create, inevitably, winners and losers and will become politicized overnight." He said he favored tax incentives to reduce carbon emissions but added, "I'm not automatically saying that coercion and bureaucracy isn't an answer. I just don't think it's as positive and as creative an answer as market incentives in terms of getting the kind of change we want." Then, a bigger shift By 2008, Gingrich was firmly against cap and trade. Pooley called it Gingrich’s "signature reading of the American political moment." He started talking not about addressing climate change but about increasing oil drilling domestically. In April of 2009, Gingrich took his cap and trade opposition to a House committee hearing, testifying against the bill that would have set carbon emission caps. Said Gingrich: "An energy tax punishes senior citizens. It punishes rural Americans. If you use electricity it punishes you; if you use heating oil it punishes you; if you use gasoline it punishes you. This bill will increase your cost of living and may kill your job." In that same hearing, however, he left the door open to a law that would apply cap and trade, combined with tax incentives and regulatory changes, to the biggest polluting sites. "Now, if you want to write a bill that covers the 2,000 most polluting places and say, fine, those 2,000 are part of cap and trade, I'd be glad to look at it," he told the House committee. At the 2011 candidate forum, Gingrich cited this testimony in his opposition to cap and trade. A section of Gingrich’s campaign website devoted to "setting the record straight" has this to say on the controversy: Gingrich "absolutely opposes ‘cap and trade’ as well as any system of taxing carbon emissions" and on global warming itself and humanity’s responsibility, the website says "Newt has noted there is no settled scientific conclusion." Our ruling Gingrich, as a presidential candidate in 2011, declared, "I never favored cap and trade." But we found solid evidence he did, with the condition that carbon caps be combined with tax incentives to encourage energy companies to innovate. He told Frontline a cap and trade system combined with tax incentives is "something I would strongly support," and even took a hindsight-is-20/20 stance, saying the country "would be much better off" if cap and trade had been instituted. That’s favoring it. We rate his statement False.	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-12-07T16:55:19	2011-12-03	['None']
pomt-12741	"Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes — but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing or almost nothing."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/02/donald-trump/trump-exaggerates-economic-burden-export-tariffs-s/	In his address to Congress, President Donald Trump said there’s an uneven playing field when it comes to trade with foreign countries. "Currently, when we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes — but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them nothing or almost nothing," Trump said Feb. 28. Taxes on imports and exports are important given that Trump has been highly critical of America’s trade policies. Is this United States getting a bad deal when it comes to trade? Experts say Trump is exaggerating. ‘Many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes’ Trump’s generalization that "many" countries make us pay "very high" tariffs and taxes is misleading. Tariffs are another form of tax that are imposed on many goods as they enter a country. They’re designed to make homegrown products more competitive. The United States has many trade partners, and most tariffs with key trading partners like the European Union, Australia and Canada are relatively low. (In Canada, we pay zero tariffs due to the North American Free Trade Agreement.) However, American exporters trying to access particular markets for certain goods do pay much higher tariffs compared to what the United States charges exporters in those countries. For example, tariffs in developing countries are typically higher. For example, Rwanda’s tariff rate was 13.9 percent in 2012, while the United States rate sat around 2.7 percent, according to data collected by the World Bank. So, in a sense, many other countries make the United States pay higher taxes, but those countries are usually quite small and trade relatively little with the United States. Trump also talked about taxes. Other countries charge their full value added tax on imports, while the United States does not have a VAT and uses a larger corporate income tax. The VAT is collected at each stage in the production or distribution of a product or service, but with a refund mechanism for VAT paid on purchased units so the final burden falls on the final buyer or consumer. For example, when a clothing wholesaler sells some pants to a retailer, the tax is booked on the wholesaler’s mark-up. When the retailer sells the shirt to a customer, the tax is booked again. But the retailer gets a credit back for the tax paid by the wholesaler. "So our producers do face ‘very high’ taxes in many markets," said Gene Grossman, a professor of international economics at Princeton. "However, the local producers also face these taxes when they sell locally, so the taxes do not disadvantage the United States producers relative to the local producers." For example, in many circumstances, a VAT administered in the manner that Europe or Japan does so is neutral with respect to trade, he said. So while the United States may incur more financial hurdles in some countries, Trump’s point is overly broad. ‘We charge them nothing or almost nothing’ The United States’ tariff rate is far lower than other countries. But Trump exaggerated when he said the United States charges nothing or almost nothing. On average, tariffs imposed at the border in the United States is 1.5 percent, according to a March 2016 report from the U.S. International Trade Commission. That is below the 2012 world average, which was about 4 percent, according to the World Bank. For a more specific example, you can look to China. For non-agriculture products, the U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods sold in the United States is about 2.9 percent, while Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods sold in China faced a 5 percent tariff. "Almost nothing is an exaggeration, but not wrong," said Joel Trachtman, an international law professor at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. Our ruling Trump said, "When we ship products out of America, many other countries make us pay very high tariffs and taxes — but when foreign companies ship their products into America, we charge them almost nothing." Trump’s claim makes a generalization about the reality of trade in the United States and abroad. There are examples of countries who make the United States pay high tariffs and taxes, but there are other countries who charge about the same or nothing (Canada). It’s really a mixed bag. As for the second part — that we charge them almost nothing — we do charge something, but experts said that something is relatively low on a global setting, so Trump has a point. Overall, we rate this claim Half True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2017-03-02T13:32:56	2017-02-28	['United_States']
pomt-04552	"Over the last four years, the deficit has gone up, but 90 percent of that is as a consequence of" President George W. Bush’s policies and the recession.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/27/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-hes-responsible-just-10-percent-/	In an interview with CBS’s 60 Minutes that aired on Sept. 23, 2012, President Barack Obama blamed the Bush administration for much of the nation's recent debt. "Over the last four years, the deficit has gone up, but 90 percent of that is as a consequence of two wars that weren’t paid for, as a consequence of tax cuts that weren’t paid for, a prescription drug plan that was not paid for, and then the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression," Obama said. "Now we took some emergency actions, but that accounts for about 10 percent of this increase in the deficit." When we asked the Obama campaign for documentation, they pointed to calculations by the Treasury Department, based on data from the Congressional Budget Office. CBO is an independent congressional agency, but the Treasury Department is part of the Obama administration, so we need to look closely to see whether Treasury is interpreting CBO’s data fairly and accurately. To figure out what caused the accumulation of deficits over the past decade, CBO tracked the surplus it had projected back in 2001 and compared it to the actual cumulative deficits that resulted instead. Between 2002 and 2011, the government was projected to run a cumulative surplus of $5.6 trillion. Instead, the government ran a cumulative deficit of $6.1 trillion. That’s a swing of about $11.7 trillion. We combined the CBO data into four broad categories, which broke down like this: * About 37 percent of the swing came from higher spending * About 24 percent from tax cuts * About 12 percent from increases in interest costs * About 27 percent from CBO’s failures to predict economic conditions accurately. Obama's Treasury Department took CBO’s detailed, bill-by-bill calculations and assigned some of those laws to Bush and some of those laws to Obama. When Treasury did this, it found that 29 percent of the cumulative shortfall came from CBO forecasting problems, 59 percent of the shortfall came from Bush administration policies and only 12 percent from Obama administration policies. That’s where Obama’s claim comes from -- roughly 10 percent due to himself, and 90 percent due to either Bush or an economy so bad that CBO was unable to predict it. However, we see two problems with this methodology. We’ll take them in order. "Over the last four years" On 60 Minutes, Obama said his 90-10 split referred to "the last four years." But that claim is a stretch at best if you’re using the Treasury document. Its percentages refer to the cumulative deficit swing over a 10-year period between January 2001 and August 2011. We can calculate a more appropriate number using the original CBO data. We’ll use three years -- 2009, 2010, and 2011 -- because those are the years that reflect Obama’s presidency. (Data for 2012 isn’t available yet.) Over this period, 38 percent of the swing comes from spending, 20 percent from tax cuts, 14 percent from interest increases and 28 percent from faulty CBO projections. Using Obama’s strict definition of what laws count as "Bush’s" and "Obama’s," about 17 percent of this swing is attributable to Obama, not 10 percent. What should count as "Bush’s" and "Obama’s"? The bigger problem with Obama’s figure, though, is in what he blames on Bush. Obama in the interview mentioned the big-ticket "Bush" programs -- the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the Medicare prescription drug program. The total by his Treasury department also includes other laws, such as the 2008 Bush stimulus package, which Obama supported as a senator. Meanwhile, Obama claims as his own the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (the stimulus), TARP and the tax act of 2010. However, this division seems unduly generous toward Obama because it includes policies he supports, or has supported. Obama has said he intends to keep the Bush tax cuts for Americans earning under $200,000, which accounts for a significant chunk of the cost. If he supports the policy, he shouldn’t be able to fob off 100 percent of the responsibility on his predecessor. The same goes for the Medicare drug program -- a program Obama not only supports but actually expanded in his health care bill. Even the responsibility for the wars in Iraq or Afghanistan are more nuanced than Obama’s formulation makes it. While Obama didn’t start the wars, he did make policy decisions that wound down one war (Iraq) and extended, at least temporarily, another (Afghanistan). We won’t venture a guess as to the actual percentage; CBO in its report acknowledges that its own numbers are "only a very rough approximation of how changes since January 2001 have contributed to the swing from projected surpluses to a string of annual deficits over the 2002-2011 period and should not be interpreted as precise tracking of all the components of that cumulative change over the past decade." Still, even our revised starting point of 17 percent is higher than Obama’s 10 percent. And it would rise much higher if Obama were to take some responsibility for the Bush tax cuts, the Medicare drug program and the wars, as we believe he should. (The Washington Post Fact Checker gave Obama's claim four Pinocchios, its lowest rating.) Our ruling Obama said that "over the last four years, the deficit has gone up, but 90 percent of that is as a consequence of" President George W. Bush’s policies and the effects of the recession. But Obama misstated his own documentation by using four years rather than the 10 that were included in the analysis. At a minimum, that makes him responsible for at least 17 percent. But more importantly, he engages in significant cherry-picking by assigning pricey programs to Bush’s column while ignoring the fact that he supported, or supports, many of them. We rate the statement False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-09-27T17:17:55	2012-09-23	['None']
pomt-01455	Dan Patrick said that if women "get paid less than a man for the same job, that that’s not a problem."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/oct/02/leticia-van-de-putte/leticia-van-de-putte-says-dan-patrick-said-equal-p/	Leticia Van de Putte said in her recent Austin debate with Dan Patrick that Patrick had said that if women "get paid less than a man for the same job, that that’s not a problem." Patrick said that? To our query, Manny Garcia, spokesman for Van de Putte’s campaign, said by email Van de Putte. the San Antonio state senator and Democratic lieutenant governor nominee, heard Patrick, the Houston senator and Republican nominee, make the remark at the 2014 Texas Tribune Festival. Patrick, Garcia noted, voted in the 2013 legislative session against a proposal ultimately vetoed by Gov. Rick Perry requiring equal pay for women doing equal work. And in May 2014, Patrick said that as lieutenant governor, he would keep an equal-pay measure from being considered by the full Senate. As recapped by WFAA-TV, Channel 8 in Dallas, Patrick said: "I do not think that we should have government telling business how to pay their employees whether they’re male or female. I would hold that bill… Look, women deserve equal pay and if they’re doing a better job than the guy they’re working next to, they deserve more. It’s not up to government." Patrick added that the lieutenant governor should protect free markets. "I don’t want government interfering," he said. On Sept. 20, 2014, Tribune CEO Evan Smith interviewed Patrick and Van de Putte back to back on an Austin stage. We watched the video. The equal-pay portion of the conversation opened with Smith asking Patrick to confirm he’d previously said: "Women should be paid the same as a man, but I don’t believe government should enforce it." "Correct," Patrick said, adding that pay should be based on an individual’s performance. "And if a woman does a better job than a man, she deserves to be paid more," Patrick said. "And we have a lot of women business owners. I don’t want the state of Texas telling women business owners you have to pay, listen, you have to pay everyone the same." Smith then asked if Patrick thought Texas has an equal pay problem or, alternatively, if critics had overblown the issue. Patrick: "You know, I don’t think it’s a problem. But to say, are there some businesses that may not treat people fairly? Yes. But I don’t think it’s a problem. And I think look, I’m a small-business guy; I’ve always had a lot of women work for our company. I want the best employees I can have." Smith asked next if women who work for Patrick are paid equally as men. Patrick: "In some cases you’d find they are paid more. Look, I’m a business guy and like every businessman and woman, you want the best people. You don’t really care what color they are, where they come from, what gender they are; you want them to do the job." Patrick then reiterated he doesn’t want the government imposing pay requirements. Our ruling Van de Putte said Patrick said that if women "get paid less than a man for the same job, that that’s not a problem." Broadly, both candidates were vague in their use of "problem," leaving room for interpretation. Still, Patrick answered a question by saying he doesn’t think the equal-pay issue is a problem and he hammered his opposition to any state law mandating equal pay. However, Patrick also said some businesses don’t treat people fairly and said any worker should be paid on performance. These are important missing details. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-03027	Louie Gohmert of Texas "compared the current general-in-charge in Egypt to George Washington."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/oct/10/gail-collins/louie-gohmert-linked-george-washington-and-egyptia/	In her Oct. 3, 2013, opinion column, Gail Collins of the New York Times referred to U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert of Tyler as among a couple dozen "unhinged" House Republicans keeping the government from being funded unless the Obamacare law is unplugged. Collins wrote that this cast includes Gohmert, who had an "exciting time" with Republican Reps. Steve King of Iowa and Michele Bachmann of Minnesota "in Egypt on a recent fact-finding tour during which ... Gohmert compared the current general-in-charge, Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, to George Washington." By email, Collins’ research aide, Isabella Moschen, pointed us to a New York Times news article posted online Sept. 8, 2013, describing a Cairo news conference featuring Bachmann, King and Gohmert. The Times story said Gohmert "compared the leader of the military takeover, Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, to George Washington." The visiting Americans vowed to defend the $1.3 billion in annual American military aid to Egypt, according to the story, so its army could continue its fight against what Gohmert called "the bloodthirsty Muslim brothers." "Stand strong, Egypt," Gohmert was quoted as saying. "Stand firm." We checked Gohmert’s wording by watching a 15-minute YouTube video of part of the press conference. Here’s the relevant quote by Gohmert from the video: "George Washington, doing what no one had ever done before him, led a military in revolution, won the revolution and then resigned and went home. No one had ever done that. And we met in Gen. el-Sisi, a man who’s the leader of the military, who might have a shot at being elected president, but who’s more concerned about giving his life to help his country, Egypt." So, Gohmert did liken el-Sisi’s situation to that of Washington after his Revolutionary War victory. Our ruling Collins said Gohmert compared the current general-in-charge in Egypt to George Washington. Gohmert linked the Egyptian general and Washington. But this statement could benefit from the clarification that Gohmert’s comparison was limited to each figure’s desire to put his country ahead of himself; he did not compare other aspects of their characters or achievements. We rate this claim, which would have benefited from clarification, as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-14654	Under Barack Obama, "the fewest number of adults are working since Jimmy Carter’s presidency."	false	/texas/statements/2016/jan/22/roger-williams/roger-williams-falsely-says-fewest-number-adults-w/	After the president talked up national job gains, a Central Texas member of Congress suggested things haven’t been rosy. U.S. Rep. Roger Williams, R-Austin, whose district stretches nearly to Fort Worth, said in a Jan. 12, 2016, response to the State of the Union address: "It’s been seven years since President Barack Obama took office. In that time, the United States has accumulated the largest national debt in its history, the fewest number of adults are working since Jimmy Carter’s presidency and the executive branch has expanded its power immensely – the president has chosen which laws to enforce and created new ones without Congress’ approval." The national debt, in raw dollars, is at a record high, and Obama has issued provocative executive orders though, PolitiFact found in 2014, fewer orders than most recent predecessors. A reader asked us if Williams was correct about the country having fewer working adults than when Carter was president from 1977 into January 1981. Just given population growth, could that be? We asked Williams’ spokesman Vince Zito how Williams reached his conclusion and didn’t hear back. In 2012, PolitiFact explored similar territory, finding Mostly False a claim that the American "workforce" was smaller than when Carter was president. The word "workforce" refers to the absolute number of people employed or seeking work; that tally was way up by 2012 compared with Carter’s era due to population growth and, through the 1990s, the expansion of working women. Counting workers So, did the number of working adults subsequently plunge to Carter-era levels? No, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, whose figures indicate that in 1980, around 100 million people were in the civilian workforce. In 2015, bureau figures show, nearly 150 million Americans were in the workforce -- up about 50 percent from Carter’s last year as president. By phone to our inquiry, economist Stephen Rose of the Urban Institute, a former deputy in the Department of Labor, told us Williams’ claim isn’t supported. "Not close," Rose said. A chart in the 2015 Economic Report of the President shows 99.3 million people comprised the civilian workforce in 1980 and 146.3 million were in the workforce in 2014. Another bureau chart indicates 149.7 million people in the workforce in December 2015 and also that the workforce increased nearly every year from 1980 through 2015 -- with the exceptions of 1982, 1991, 2002 and 2008 through 2010, a period encompassing the end of George W. Bush’s terms and the first two years of Obama’s tenure. From 2010, when an Obama-low 139 million people were in the workforce, the count inched to nearly 140 million in 2011; 143 million in 2012; 144 million in 2013 and 146 million in 2014, according to the bureau. Employment-population ratio By another indicator, Rose said, it’s possible to compare the share of Americans who had jobs in Obama’s years with the share of job-holders when Carter was president. The BLS, drawing on results from the American Community Survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau, calculates the employment-population ratio to reflect the proportion of the civilian noninstitutional population aged 16 years and over that’s employed. The highest ratio under Obama was 60.6 in January 2009, the month he was sworn in. The lowest ratio on his watch, 58.2, was set in November 2010 and June and July 2011. In Carter’s four years as president, according to the bureau, the highest ratio, 60.1, was reached in February and December 1979 and the lowest ratio, 57.0, occurred in January 1977, the month he was sworn in (it nudged to 57.2 the next month). Labor force participation We wondered if another indicator might be relevant. That statistic is the civilian labor force participation rate -- meaning the labor force, civilians 16 and older working full- or part-time, divided by the civilian population. According to the BLS, 62.6 percent of the population comprised the labor force in December 2015, the latest month of available figures. While Carter was president, a bureau chart indicates, the participation rate fluctuated from 61.6 percent in January 1977 to 64 percent in January and February 1980. Score one for Williams, though the rate on Obama’s watch peaked at 65.8 percent in February 2009--which was higher than any rate in Carter’s years or the first seven years of successor Ronald Reagan’s tenure. The rate was 66.5 percent when Reagan left office in January 1989. Labor force changes There’s another chewy issue: Demographics, particularly the aging of the population, have affected changes in the workforce, making comparisons between current times and Carter’s era tricky. In the 2000 Census, Americans aged 60 to 69 -- that is, those who had recently hit retirement age or would do so soon -- numbered about 20 million. But thanks to Baby Boomers, that number surged in the 2010 Census to more than 29 million, for almost a 50 percent increase. This matters because the more people aged 60 to 69, the more people who pass into retirement age -- or, put another way, leave the labor force. Even though more people proportionally remain in the workforce after retirement age, the difference isn’t big enough to cancel out the flood of new retirees. In 2015, Atlantic magazine published a chart contrasting the workforce in October 1977, in Carter’s first year as president, and June 2015, in the seventh year of Obama’s tenure: SOURCE: Story, "How America's Workforce Has Changed Since 1977," the Atlantic, July 2, 2015 (accessed Jan. 21, 2016) Our ruling Williams said that under Obama, "the fewest number of adults are working since Jimmy Carter’s presidency." This claim doesn’t hold up in that far more people were working the past few years than in Carter’s time as president. According to a government calculation, about the same share of adults was employed during each Democrat’s presidency. We rate this statement False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-06249	Says the federal stimulus program was ineffective because "the number of jobs has actually decreased by 18,300 through July 2011."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2011/nov/30/greg-walden/greg-walden-says-stimulus-hasnt-helped-oregon-gai/	Like most Republicans, Rep. Greg Walden says the $825 billion stimulus law has been a failure. But unlike other critics who speak in contemptuous generalities, Walden puts hard numbers behind his opinion. "When the bill was signed into law, the White House promised that the stimulus would increase by 44,000 the number of jobs in Oregon by December 2010," he says on his official congressional website. "Unfortunately, even with the stimulus, since the bill was signed, the number of jobs has actually decreased by 18,300 through July 2011." Walden supports his claim with a study by the Republican staff of the House Ways and Means Committee. That study relies on federal statistics and, sure enough, both the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Oregon Employment Department show that Oregon had fewer people working in July 2010 than February 2009. When the stimulus was signed into law in February 2009, 1.643 million people in Oregon held non-farm jobs, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. In July 2010, after billions of dollars of stimulus spending had been dispersed, the number of non-farm jobs in Oregon was 1.625 million. That’s a loss of 18,000 jobs which is the number Walden cited. But it’s only part of the story. First, a quick recap. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, which is the full name of what is commonly called the stimulus, became law in February 2009. Democrats pushed the legislation as a way to create jobs and extend unemployment benefits through a mix of government spending, tax cuts and financial aid to cash-strapped states. The stimulus and its performance have provided a high intensity battlefield ever since. The White House released at least six reports on the program, counting jobs that were created or "saved" as a result of the stimulus. Those counts were augmented by dozens of other reports from independent sources. The most recent came Nov. 22 from the Congressional Budget Office. It says the stimulus is responsible for adding between 500,000 and 3.3 million jobs nationally. But the CBO, which is nonpartisan, also says its reports, "do not provide a comprehensive estimate of the law’s impact on U.S. employment, which could be higher or lower..." Among the reasons is that "some of the jobs included in the reports might have existed even without the stimulus," and that the reports do not "attempt to measure" the number of indirect jobs. Earlier studies, both independent and partisan, have offered similar ranges for the law’s impact on jobs. A March study by the White House Council of Economic Advisers explains why. "Evaluating the impact," said the report, which was the sixth in a series, " … is inherently difficult because we do not observe what would have happened to the economy in the absence of policy." Separately, the council’s report cited four independent analyses by the CBO and three private economic analysis companies that all found between 1.3 million and 3.6 million jobs saved or created. Oregon’s acting state economist Mark McMullen agrees precision is difficult -- and fraught with politics. "This issue is about as politically charged as topics in economics get," he said. He points to CBO numbers to explain how many stimulus jobs were created and reported in Oregon. In 2009, 18,412 direct jobs were created with 33,489 in 2010 and 17,663 in 2011. Even trickier is estimating the indirect jobs from the stimulus. Here, McMullen and other economists extend estimates that Oregon collected between 1.2 percent and 1.5 percent of stimulus jobs depending on the year. That translates to 2,967 to 13,350 indirect jobs in 2009; 8,714 to 41,078 jobs in 2010 and 5,820 to 30,473 jobs in 2011. Economists say there’s another conundrum: Because of constant churning in the economy, the stimulus law could have generated - or come close to generating - the number of jobs the White House predicted even though total employment in the state declined. The reason is that the jobs total is fluid and that additions in jobs like road construction could be eclipsed by losses in other parts of the economy that aren’t touched by the stimulus. There are also jobs protected with stimulus money. Teachers, prison guards, and other state workers who probably would have been laid off were able to keep their jobs because the stimulus sent $2.4 billion to Oregon. More than $1.2 billion was used to fill state cuts to education that could have triggered teacher layoffs in every district. Another $117 million went to public safety, with some of that money used to avoid cut-backs in police and emergency response personnel. The White House and supporters factor those "saved" jobs into their calculations. Walden and critics do not. Got it? It’s all very murky and far from precise. But this much is certain: As of July 31, 2011, there were 18,300 fewer people working in Oregon than in February 2009. That is the number Walden cites in his comment and that much is true. But Walden’s context suggests that the stimulus did not produce jobs for Oregon, and that is not correct. While economists and other experts say it’s impossible to say how many Oregon jobs were "created or saved," as the White House puts it, there certainly were some. And it’s clear that a significant number of Oregon jobs would have been lost without the stimulus. Walden’s assertion of lost jobs uses numbers out of context and leaves out important details. For that reason we rate this claim: Half True. Return to OregonLive to comment on this ruling.	None	Greg Walden	None	None	None	2011-11-30T17:02:07	2011-11-30	['None']

"Idaho mother sentenced to prison after multiple citations for breastfeeding in public," reads the headline on a Sept. 3, 2016, post on TheSeattleTribune.com, which sometimes is shared with an AssociatedMediaCoverage.com url. Even though the story is months old, it continues to be shared widely on Facebook, which flagged it as part of its efforts to combat fake news. The story — which again, is not true — says that 32-year-old Heather Watson of Baker County, Idaho, was sentenced to seven years in prison and will have to register as a sex offender for breastfeeding her 6-month-old daughter in public. The post said Watson had received six citations for indecent exposure before landing in prison. There is no outward indication the story is fake, but several clues should tip off readers this is a work of fiction. There are no other news reports of this incident, beyond blog posts from incensed mothers. There also is no record of a Heather Watson at the Idaho Department of Correction offender search. (We doubt the story is about the British tennis player of the same name.) The main photo used on the story is from a 2014 post on a Flickr account, with a chyron added to make it look like a screen grab from TV news. The inset mug is of a woman arrested in Maricopa County, Ariz., in 2016. Another giveaway is the location mentioned in the story: There is no Baker County in Idaho. There’s further reference to a location called Wiser, Idaho, but the town is spelled Weiser, and it’s in Washington County. There’s also a phone number given as a way to contact the judge in the case at the fictional Baker County Department of Justice. When called, the phone number identifies itself as a voicemail service for the controversial Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kan. The story likely keys off Idaho’s distinction as being the only state without a law specifically defending breastfeeding in public (although there is a law excusing nursing mothers from jury duty). The post links to a MoveOn.org petition supporting a new law, and there is a graphic illustrating where in the United States it is legal to breastfeed in public, taken from a 2014 Huffington Post article. Many Idahoans support a new law protecting mothers from being kicked out of businesses or charged with public indecency. The state reportedly has a higher rate of breastfeeding mothers than any other state. In 2016, Miss Idaho America Christi Van Ravenhorst teamed up with a group called the Idaho Breastfeeding Law Coalition to push for a bill, and mothers staged a "nurse-in" on the steps of the state Capitol. The headline on this post, meanwhile, continues to draw the ire of breastfeeding supporters with its fake details.

pomt-07122	Says Allen West violated federal law by scuba diving with U.S. flag.	false	/florida/statements/2011/jun/17/blog-posting/blogger-says-west-violated-federal-law-diving-flag/	A couple days before Flag Day, Republican U.S. Rep. Allen West went for what was supposed to be a fun excursion for the Army vet: A patriotic dive off the coast in Broward County. Little did West know he was entering hot water. The Miami Herald reported on West's June 12, 2011 dive with a group of Army, Navy and Marine Corps veterans and published a photo of West underwater in scuba gear, saluting the American flag. "I think it's important wherever we are, that the flag flies," West, a 22-year veteran Army officer and experienced scuba diver, told the Herald. The veterans who joined him agreed. But was the whole thing illegal? That's a claim being circulated by bloggers. The Daily Pulp, a blog of the Broward-Palm Beach New Times, reported on West's deep sea adventure June 14 with the headline: "Allen West violates federal law during weekend diving trip." "There's nothing really bad to say about Rep. Allen West going diving off the coast of Deerfield Beach with a bunch of military veterans -- except for the fact that he violated U.S. federal law in the process and provided a pictorial of himself doing so," the blog claimed. "During his diving session Sunday, Lt. Col. West was photographed holding an American flag underwater, on top of an artificial reef -- which would be a violation of the United States Code." The blog then quoted Title 4, Chapter 1, Section 8, Subsection B of the U.S. Code: "The flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise." The allegation against West -- a freshman legislator being targeted by Democrats in 2012 -- was picked up or repeated by dozens of websites, including POLITICO, and BlogPost, a Washington Post blog. The Salon.com headline was "Why does Allen West hate the American flag?" PolitiFact Florida wanted to see if the blogger's claim had merit. There is indeed a "Respect for Flag" section of the U.S. code. It reads: "No disrespect should be shown to the flag of the United States of America; the flag should not be dipped to any person or thing. Regimental colors, State flags, and organization or institutional flags are to be dipped as a mark of honor." The code contains several rules about how to respect the flag including that it should "never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free ... never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery" and "never be used as a covering for a ceiling." For this fact-check, we're focusing on the part that pertains to West, that "the flag should never touch anything beneath it, such as the ground, the floor, water, or merchandise." We contacted five different experts -- two former federal prosecutors and three law professors who teach constitutional law. All agreed the flag code is intended to advise people on how to respect the flag and that there is no penalty for violating the code. Most said, generally, that West's actions did not violate law. • The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the right to burn the flag. So, experts asked, how could diving underwater with a flag be possibly considered worse? West's display of the flag underwater would be protected by his First Amendment rights, which would trump the code, said Kendall Coffey, a former federal prosecutor who worked for Democrats in the Bush v. Gore 2000 recount case. "It's really just a guidance rather than an instrument of prosecution," Coffey said. "He's acting inconsistent with the law, but if your actions are in effect protected by the Constitution which overrides laws you would not say he is violating the law. ... I don't think he has violated the law. I think he is fully protected by the U.S. Constitution." • The flag code uses the word "should," as opposed to "shall." That suggest the code isn't legally binding, said Michael Froomkin, a law professor at the University of Miami. "It's pretty clear to me that this rule is advisory, or normative, but, not mandatory unless referenced somewhere else in the code. (I'm aware of no such references.)," Froomkin wrote in an e-mail. "While one might expect a congressperson to choose to obey these rules voluntarily, that is an issue of decorum, not law. So, yes, it is a violation of something in the U.S. Code, but no, not a violation of a law that you can actually get arrested or fined for violating." Bob Jarvis, a law professor at Nova Southeastern University, agreed. "There is no punishment here," Jarvis said. "When we talk about law where there is no enforcement mechanism it's an advisory law. Then the question becomes is that really a law?" • No prosecutor would ever try the case. Coffey and former South Florida federal prosecutor Jeffrey Sloman said prosecution was extremely unlikely. "It is my opinion that no U.S. Attorney (in his right mind) would ever prosecute anyone, let alone a U.S. Congressman, for the conduct you have described," Sloman wrote in an e-mail. We asked for a response from West's spokeswoman Angela Sachitano. She e-mailed us back a June 15, 2011 blog item in the conservative Weekly Standard, which wrote "it turns out that U.S. Armed Forces routinely takes the flag underwater for reenlistment ceremonies and various other reasons. Nevermind that it was obvious West was honoring the flag, and he's a retired lieutenant colonel and combat veteran that's probably far more sensitive to what is and is not appropriate to do with the flag than a flurry of liberal bloggers." Sachitano also sent us a link from the Navy's website showing a photo of a member of the Navy underwater holding the U.S. flag. So is the Navy breaking the law? Is West breaking the law? No, at least in the opinions of experts. He may have violated U.S. Code, but there's no penalty for doing so, and there's a question if the code is anything more than a suggestion. And even if it was, the U.S. Supreme Court has already said you can burn a flag, so experts say (and we agree) that you can go swimming with one. We rate this claim False.

pomt-07219	The 2009 stimulus bill "failed to get people back to work."	false	/virginia/statements/2011/jun/03/eric-cantor/cantor-says-stimulus-failed-get-people-back-work/	The Democrats’ massive stimulus program passed two years ago was a dud, according to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. "They (Democrats) passed a nearly $1 trillion stimulus bill which failed to get people back to work," Cantor, R-7th, said in a May 26 news conference of House Republican leaders. Cantor is referring to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, passed in February 2009. Democrats pushed the legislation as a way to create jobs and extend unemployment benefits through a mix of government spending, tax cuts and financial aid to cash-strapped states. It adds $830 billion to the budget deficit between fiscal years 2009-2019, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Let’s turn to the crux of the majority leader’s assertion -- that the measure failed to get people back to work. How does Cantor justify that statement? In an e-mail, Cantor spokeswoman Megan Whittemore characterized his statement as a broad proclamation that the stimulus failed. She noted that the unemployment rate is higher now than when the stimulus passed, that there are more discouraged workers and that private sector growth in May was much slower than expected, she said. "Of course, when the government spends that much money it’s able to hire additional government workers, but it failed to spur real private sector growth," Whittemore said. Cantor didn’t specify in his statement what kinds of jobs he was talking about -- public or private. So we won’t give him the benefit of his staff’s elaboration after the fact. Also, the economic statistics Cantor’s office cited don’t address whether there were people who returned job rolls as a result of the stimulus. Cantor simply said the stimulus "failed to get people back to work." Is that true? We decided to check. The White House has posted on its stimulus website a listing of jobs funded by the stimulus, breaking it down by state and congressional district. Between February 17, 2009 and March 31, 2011, the U.S. had a reported 573,510 full-time equivalent jobs funded by stimulus fund contracts, grants and loans, which account for one-third of the cost of the stimulus. Virginia had a reported 11,446 full-time equivalent jobs funded by the stimulus fund contracts, grants and loans. White House data shows the bulk of the Virginia jobs -- 7,203 full-time equivalent positions -- were in downtown Richmond where the state government relied on stimulus funds to balance budgets from 2009 to 2011. That number may paint an exaggerated picture, however, because the state parceled much of the stimulus money to localities to help support schools. Even so, the statistics suggest a benefit to Cantor’s constituents in suburban Richmond counties, many of whom work for the state government. The data shows 178 full-time equivalent jobs arising from the stimulus were located in Cantor’s district. The Government Accountability Office has criticized the White House tallies, noting in a November 2009 report that there were "significant reporting and quality issues" in how the figures were compiled. For more insight, we contacted the Virginia Department of Education. Charles Pyle, a spokesman, said that as of January 2011, Virginia school divisions reported they had saved 5,692 jobs and created another 926 jobs using stimulus money. In a report released March 18, 2011, the president’s Council of Economic Advisers estimated that between 2.5 and 3.6 million jobs were created or saved by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2010. Separately, the council’s report cited four independent analyses by the Congressional budget office and three private economic analysis companies. Here’s what the groups found: *CBO: Between 1.3 million and 3.6 million jobs saved or created. *IHS/Global Insight: 2.45 million jobs saved or created. *Macroeconomic Advisers: 2.3 million jobs saved or created. *Moody’s Economy.com: 2.5 million jobs saved or created. Many conservative economists balk at the methodology of these studies, which they say depends on assumptions that government stimulus automatically generates a net gain in economic activity. Conservatives have argued government stimulus doesn’t boost the economy, but merely shifts around dollars that could be better spent by the private sector. They’re also concerned deficit spending creates uncertainty for businesses looking to hire. Tad DeHaven, a budget analyst with the libertarian Cato Institute, is among those skeptical the stimulus is a net plus for the nation’s employment picture. In an Aug. 2, 2010 column in the Richmond Times-Dispatch, he wondered how many private-sector jobs were lost or not created because he said the stimulus shifted money from the private sector to the government. But does that mean that the stimulus failed to put people back to work? In an interview, DeHaven said the stimulus program did create jobs, at least in the short term. "On one hand, it creates jobs," DeHaven said. "But at what cost?" To sum up: Cantor said the stimulus "failed to get people back to work." A variety of national studies estimate the measure saved or created at least 1.3 million jobs. The reports do not break down how many of the positions were new and how many were existing jobs that didn’t get cut. They do not tell us how many of the jobs were in the private sector and how many were public ones. But they do provide ample evidence that the stimulus did get people back to work.

pomt-03592	When Susan Rice spoke about Benghazi on Sunday news shows, she said "that al-Qaida might be involved, or other al-Qaida affiliates might be involved, or non-al-Qaida Libyan extremists, which I think demonstrates that there was no effort to play that down."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/13/jay-carney/jay-carney-says-susan-rice-didnt-play-down-terrori/	Journalists peppered President Barack Obama’s press secretary, Jay Carney, with a series of tough questions about Benghazi at a White House press briefing on May 10, 2013. The incident, in which four Americans were killed at two U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, was the topic at a congressional hearing on May 8. Members of Congress have criticized how the administration handled the Sept. 11, 2012, incident, both in the immediate aftermath and in the months since. One of the issues receiving the most attention is whether, or to what extent, Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice misled the American public about the incident when she offered talking points on five Sunday morning talk shows on Sept. 16, 2012. The criticism has focused on whether Rice was playing down the possibility that the attack in Benghazi was a pre-planned event carried out by terrorists, as opposed to flowing organically from a series of public protests at U.S. facilities throughout the Arab world following the news reports about a movie made in the U.S. that mocked Islam. At the press briefing, Carney responded to questions about Rice’s talking points by saying, "If you look at the issue here, the efforts to politicize it were always about were we trying to play down the fact that there was an act of terror and an attack on the embassy. … Susan Rice, when she went out on the Sunday shows using the very talking points that we're discussing now, talked about the possibility that we knew that, or believed based on the intelligence assessment, that extremists were involved, and there were suspicions about what affiliations those extremists might have, but there were not … hard, concrete evidence. And so Ambassador Rice, in those shows, talked about the possibility that al-Qaida might be involved, or other al-Qaida affiliates might be involved, or non-al-Qaida Libyan extremists (might be involved), which I think demonstrates that there was no effort to play that down. It was simply a reflection of we did not, and the intelligence community did not, and others within the administration did not, jump to conclusions about who was responsible before we had an investigation to find out the facts." So was Carney correct that she mentioned al-Qaida and did not try to "play that down"? We asked the White House for evidence, but didn't hear back by publication time. So we went back to the transcripts of Rice’s appearances on five shows -- CBS’ Face the Nation, CNN’s State of the Union, NBC’s Meet the Press, Fox News Sunday and ABC’s This Week. We’ve collected the relevant exchanges from each show below and, to show the repetition of her talking points, highlighted them in bold, as well as her one reference to al-Qaida. You'll see that Carney did not accurately describe what Rice said and that she in fact did play down the possible involvement of al-Qaida. • • • • • CBS’ Face the Nation Rice: "Based on the best information we have to date, what our assessment is as of the present is in fact what began spontaneously in Benghazi as a reaction to what had transpired some hours earlier in Cairo where, of course, as you know, there was a violent protest outside of our embassy sparked by this hateful video. But soon after that spontaneous protest began outside of our consulate in Benghazi, we believe that it looks like extremist elements, individuals, joined in that effort with heavy weapons of the sort that are, unfortunately, readily now available in Libya post-revolution. And that it spun from there into something much, much more violent." Host Bob Schieffer: "But you do not agree with (Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.) that this was something that had been plotted out several months ago?" Rice: "We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned." Schieffer: "Do you agree or disagree with him that al-Qaida had some part in this?" Rice: "Well, we'll have to find out that out. I mean I think it's clear that there were extremist elements that joined in and escalated the violence. Whether they were al-Qaida affiliates, whether they were Libyan-based extremists or al-Qaida itself I think is one of the things we'll have to determine." • • • • • CNN’s State of the Union Rice: "Let’s recall what has happened in the last several days. There was a hateful video that was disseminated on the Internet. It had nothing to do with the United States government and it's one that we find disgusting and reprehensible. It's been offensive to many, many people around the world. "That sparked violence in various parts of the world, including violence directed against western facilities including our embassies and consulates. That violence is absolutely unacceptable, it's not a response that one can ever condone when it comes to such a video. And we have been working very closely and, indeed, effectively with the governments in the region and around the world to secure our personnel, secure our embassy, condemn the violent response to this video. "And, frankly, we've seen these sorts of incidents in the past. We've seen violent responses to (Salman Rushdie’s novel, The) Satanic Verses. We've seen violent responses to the cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammed in an evil way. So this is something we've seen in the past, and we expect that it's possible that these kinds of things could percolate into the future. What we're focused on is securing our personnel, securing our facilities. ... "(It was a) horrific incident where some mob was hijacked ultimately by a handful of extremists." • • • • • NBC’s Meet The Press Rice: "We can't predict with any certainty, but let's remember what has transpired over the last several days. This is a response to a hateful and offensive video that was widely disseminated throughout the Arab and Muslim world. ... "Let me tell you the best information we have at present. First of all, there is an FBI investigation, which is ongoing, and we look to that investigation to give us the definitive word as to what transpired. But putting together the best information that we have available to us today -- our current assessment is that what happened in Benghazi was, in fact, initially a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired hours before in Cairo -- almost a copycat of the demonstrations against our facility in Cairo, which were prompted, of course, by the video. "What we think then transpired in Benghazi is that opportunistic extremist elements came to the consulate as this was unfolding. They came with heavy weapons, which, unfortunately, are readily available in post-revolutionary Libya, and that escalated into a much more violent episode. Obviously, that's our best judgment now.

The information, the best information and the best assessment we have today is that in fact this was not a preplanned, premeditated attack. That what happened initially was that it was a spontaneous reaction to what had just transpired in Cairo as a consequence of the video. People gathered outside the embassy and then it grew very violent and those with extremist ties joined the fray and came with heavy weapons, which unfortunately are quite common in post-revolutionary Libya and that then spun out of control. "But we don't see at this point signs this was a coordinated plan, premeditated attack. Obviously, we will wait for the results of the investigation and we don't want to jump to conclusions before then. But I do think it's important for the American people to know our best current assessment." • • • • • ABC’s This Week Rice: "First of all, it's important to know that there's an FBI investigation that has begun and will take some time to be completed.

In Cairo, as you know, a few hours earlier, there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this very offensive video that was disseminated. "We believe that folks in Benghazi, a small number of people came to the embassy to -- or to the consulate, rather, to replicate the sort of challenge that was posed in Cairo. And then as that unfolded, it seems to have been hijacked, let us say, by some individual clusters of extremists who came with heavier weapons, weapons that as you know in the wake of the revolution in Libya are quite common and accessible. And it then evolved from there. We'll wait to see exactly what the investigation finally confirms, but that's the best information we have at present." • • • • • How do these comments speak to Carney’s claim? Here are a few key points. Did Rice talk about "the possibility that al-Qaida might be involved" or that "al-Qaida affiliates might be involved"? Barely. In only one of the five interviews did Rice speak the words "al-Qaida" -- on Face the Nation -- and even then she urged caution in jumping to conclusions. "Whether they were al-Qaida affiliates, whether they were Libyan-based extremists or al-Qaida itself I think is one of the things we'll have to determine," she told Schieffer. Did Rice talk about whether "non-al-Qaida Libyan extremists" might be involved? Yes -- repeatedly. But it’s worth noting that Rice portrayed these extremists as opportunists who seized the moment during a public uprising, which is something quite different from the pre-planned terrorist attack that the administration’s critics are charging the White House initially played down. Indeed, Rice explicitly, and repeatedly, shot down speculation that the attack was planned in advance, for instance telling Schieffer, "We do not have information at present that leads us to conclude that this was premeditated or preplanned." Did Rice play down any of the three listed scenarios? Yes. In the one interview of the five in which she mentioned al-Qaida at all, she urged caution about assuming they were involved. And while she did allow that "extremists" appeared to have been involved in the attack, she made a point of saying in every interview that these extremists got involved only by hijacking an ongoing event that protested the anti-Islam film, a narrative that gives almost a secondary role to the extremists. Meanwhile, in three of the five interviews, Rice specifically rejected the idea that Benghazi amounted to a preplanned terrorist attack. Our ruling Carney said that Rice "talked about the possibility that al-Qaida might be involved, or other al-Qaida affiliates might be involved, or non-al-Qaida Libyan extremists (might be involved), which I think demonstrates that there was no effort to play that down." It’s true that Rice offered those three scenarios, but Carney is wrong to say she didn’t play them down. Rice barely mentioned the potential role of al-Qaida or one of its affiliates, and she urged caution about jumping to conclusions on the one occasion in which she did. And while she did point to a role for "extremists," Rice made clear that the extremists didn’t pre-plan the attack, but instead hijacked a demonstration that was already under way. Both decisions played down, to one degree or another, each of the three scenarios she mentioned. We rate Carney’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-08501	Says campaign contributions to her rival for a state House seat was money intended for schoolchildren.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2010/oct/08/jill-chambers/candidate-state-house-said-her-rival-took-money-in/	Even among this election season's accusations of corruption and dastardly deeds, an attack in a local state House race stands out. A recorded telephone message recently told voters that Democrat Elena Parent is taking money intended for schoolchildren to finance her campaign. Taking money from schoolchildren? We had to check this one out. The race for state House District 81 is one of the most heated and closely contested legislative contests in Georgia this year. Republican Jill Chambers, a feisty iconoclast, is trying to keep her seat against Parent, a former litigator who worked for a Democratic state senator who became the ambassador to Singapore. Chambers has served in the House since 2003 and is best known for her work on MARTA's oversight committee, known as MARTOC. Neither party dominates the district, which runs along Buford Highway in DeKalb County northeast of Atlanta. Democrats think the seat is up for grabs. The outspoken Chambers thinks she is on her way to re-election. The campaign is ugly. Parent lobbed attacks accusing Chambers of wastefully spending taxpayer money. Parent's campaign has also launched websites dedicated to attacking the incumbent. Last week, Chambers blitzed voters with three automated telephone messages, or robocalls, and a mailer accusing Parent of taking money intended for schoolchildren: "This is an important voter alert for PTA members in DeKalb County," a voice on one of the robocalls said. "Candidate Elena Parent has taken over $22,000 intended for our schoolchildren in campaign contributions from a law firm representing the corrupt DeKalb school board. "DeKalb County can no longer afford to have politicians like Crawford Lewis, the indicted former school superintendent, and Elena Parent jeopardize our school system’s future. Since these contributions became public last week, Elena Parent has repeatedly refused to return the money. Please call Elena Parent today and tell her to return these contributions." The mailer asks, "Hey, Elena Parent, what did you promise in return for $22,585.09 in contributions from the law firm for the corrupt DeKalb County Board?" It is true that corruption accusations are rocking DeKalb schools. In May, Lewis, former chief operating officer Patricia Reid, Reid's former husband and Reid's secretary were indicted on accusations that Reid ran a criminal enterprise that steered millions of dollars in contracts to the ex-husband, an architect. The attack's logic is that the school system's legal fees skyrocketed from its budget of roughly $900,000 to $5 million, Chambers said. That means money that should be going to student education is filling the coffers of Sutherland Asbill & Brennan, the law firm to which the attack ads refer. Sutherland's employees are therefore giving political donations with money intended for children, the line of reasoning goes. Is this accurate? We looked at Parent's campaign contribution disclosure reports, which she filed with the State Ethics Commission of Georgia. The campaign donation figures are correct. From mid-2009 through July, Parent received exactly $22,585.09 in cash and in-kind donations from people who listed their employer as Sutherland, where Parent used to work. Chambers' attack mailer has other correct information. Sutherland does have a contract to provide legal services for DeKalb County schools, including in the Reid matter. The school system does not have its own in-house legal department. Records show DeKalb arranged to pay Sutherland $120,555 a month for its services, as Chambers' mailer said. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that DeKalb schools spent $5.79 million on lawyers from July 1, 2009, to June 30, 2010, when the district had budgeted $934,816 for legal expenses. But those contributions to Parent's campaign don't come directly from Sutherland, as the robocall suggests. Its employees made individual donations with their own money. Chambers acknowledges this, and two of her other ads say the donations are from lawyers, not the firm. There are other problems with Chambers' claims. None of the school system's board members was named in the indictment. A schools spokesman said it is therefore inaccurate to call the board "corrupt." And saying campaign contributions to Parent came from money intended for schoolchildren tests the bounds of logic. Using Chambers' reasoning, if a Sutherland lawyer bought a candy bar at a Wal-Mart, you could accuse the retailer of taking money intended for schoolchildren. So while Chambers' attack mailer contains some correct information, the robocall accusation against Parent is incorrect and borders on the ridiculous. It's unfair to call the DeKalb school board corrupt. School employees, not board members, were indicted. And no one has been convicted. The contributions were not directly from Sutherland, as the call implied, and were not intended for children. They were from individual contributors who used their personal funds. This House race is smoking. We give Chambers a Pants On Fire for this one.	None	Jill Chambers	None	None	None	2010-10-08T06:00:00	2010-09-27	['None']

pomt-09835	"There's no rationing in any of these bills."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/25/howard-dean/rationing-health-care-reform/	It is perhaps the most polarizing word in the health care debate: rationing. Countless conservative opponents of the Democrat-backed health care reform plans have used the word. Their argument goes like this: You get government more involved in running health care, you set a goal of reducing costs, and it will inevitably mean rationing of medical services. It's not a long road from there to images of Grandma being denied a life-saving operation as a cost-saving measure. Everyone from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to Sen. Chuck Grassley has warned that people have reason to worry about rationing, while Democratic proponents of the plan have dismissed the claims as uninformed fearmongering. The term rationing has become so ubiquitous in the health care debate, we could've chosen to fact-check statements from any number of politicians as a way to talk about this issue. In a separate item, we looked at a claim about rationing from House Republican Leader John Boehner. In this item, we opted for one from Howard Dean, former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, if only because he was so definitive about a subject with a lot of gray. "Let me just say, A, there's no rationing in any of these bills, so we don't have to worry about that," Dean said on ABC's This Week with George Stephanopoulos on Aug. 9. Before we examine his specific claim, let's look at the criticisms that have led to charges of rationing. The critics have often focused on two areas of the health plan to back up their accusations. The first is a proposal to expand comparative effectiveness research. That's a bureaucratic way of saying the government would do studies to find out which medical treatments and medications work better than others, and which are most cost-effective. The idea is that this would help doctors and patients make better informed decisions about the most effective treatment strategies. It's also expected to save money over time. Some opponents, however, claim the government would use findings from this research to ration care. We looked into this issue in detail and concluded that claim is False . Other opponents of the plan have pointed to the Obama administration's proposal for an Independent Medicare Advisory Council (IMAC). The board would make annual recommendations for changing federal payments for various services covered by Medicare, as well as recommendations on ways to reform the Medicare delivery system. Michael Cannon, a health policy expert with the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, argues that price controls recommended by IMAC's unelected board amount to implicit rationing. Judith A. Stein, director of the Center for Medicare Advocacy, a group that helps seniors get care under the federal program, doesn't agree. Stein is no fan of IMAC, but she said its goal is not to "ration" care but to seek out ways to improve the efficiency of Medicare services, not necessarily cut them. We note that while IMAC has been recommended by the Obama administration, it was not included in any of the House bills so far. It has been discussed as an option by the powerful Senate Finance Committee. Still, we think it's a little premature to suggest this is part of the health care reform plan. And we think claims that IMAC might lead to wholesale rationing are alarmist. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office looked at the IMAC proposal and concluded it would save the government $2 billion from 2016–2019. That doesn't sound to us like the CBO expects any kind of dramatic cuts in service. In fact, we think much of the rhetoric from opponents about how the Democrats' health plan would lead to wholesale rationing has been wildly distorted, fanning the flames of public fear that the health care plan would have the government setting dollar limits on how much could be spent in a year to care for a patient, or deciding that some groups of people — older or disabled people, for example — should not get care because it's too expensive for the common good. And so it's understandable that Dean would want to knock down these wild claims. But we think Dean goes too far when he says the bills have "no rationing," because it ignores a hard reality of health care — there is rationing now and there would be rationing in the Democrats' plan too. "This whole notion of rationing as it applies to a public option, I think, is really ridiculous," Stein said. "It is what insurance is. Right now, Congress and any health care plan 'rations.' No health insurance I know pays for 'whatever it costs.'" "Everyone hates the word rationing," said Katherine Baicker, a health economics professor at Harvard University. "From an economics perspective, there's no way around rationing. Some care is being rationed now. Everyone isn't getting everything." And you can bet people who can't get health insurance due to a pre-existing condition feel like there's already rationing. Ditto for those who can't afford health insurance. Proponents of the health reform plan — which seeks to provide basic coverage to everyone, regardless of whether they have a pre-existing condition — argue that it would clearly reduce that form of rationing. You could spend an unlimited amount on health care that would have some chance of helping people, Baicker said. But we have a limited amount of public resources. And so decisions have to be made about how to prioritize to allocate those resources. The idea, she said, is to provide adequate, basic health care in a public plan. Above that threshold, she said, people with more money could buy extra care. John Holahan, the director of the Urban Institute Health Policy Research Center, said he has not seen anything in any of the plans that will result in explicit rationing, but "if you define rationing as 'people can't get everything they want,' it's true. But it's also true today." Interestingly, he said that Medicare is much less likely to deny a health service than a private insurer. "That's the argument you hear people making (that the reform bills would lead to government rationing)," Holahan said. "But I think they have it backwards." Even Obama acknowledged the reality of health care rationing in a town hall on health care on Aug. 16: "When we talk about reform, you hear some opponents of reform saying that somehow we are trying to ration care, or restrict the doctors that you can see, or you name it," Obama said. "Well, that's what's going on right now. It's just that the decisions are being made by the insurance companies. "Now, in fairness, we probably could not construct a system in which you could see any doctor anywhere in the world any time, regardless of expense. That would be a hard system to set up. So if you live in Maine, you know, we're going to fly you into California, put you up. I mean, you can see — and I'm not trying to make light of it — you can just see the difficulty. "So any system we design, there are going to have to be some choices that have to be made in terms of where you go to see your doctor, what's going on, et cetera. That's being done currently in the private marketplace. All we're trying to do is to make sure that those decisions that are being made in the private marketplace aren't discriminating against people because they're already sick; that they are making sure that people get a good deal from the health care dollars that they are spending." In other words, rationing is just a fact of life in a world with limited resources. Or as Cato's Cannon puts it: "Asking if there will be rationing under the Obama plan is like asking if there will be gravity. It is ubiquitous and unavoidable." We realize some may read our ruling and conclude that we believe the Obama plan will mean more drastic rationing. But we think it's more accurate to say the bill seeks a more rational way to ration. Whether it can succeed is a topic for legitimate debate. The Democrats' health care plan calls for a health care exchange that will be a vigorous marketplace of companies offering different plans that will compete for customers by offering more or less coverage. But each of those choices about coverage — a lower or higher cap on out-of-pocket expenses, perhaps, or more or less generous coverage for doctor visits — are rationing. And the same goes for three-fourths of Americans who would probably keep their current employer-sponsored health insurance. Those plans too have limits and caps — and rationing.

pomt-02259	A North Carolina study proves that "probably over a million people voted twice in (the 2012) election."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/10/dick-morris/dick-morris-theres-proof-over-1-million-people-vot/	The pursuit of voter fraud is a running theme among Republicans and the latest numbers out of North Carolina made the conservative websites pop with alarming headlines. "Oh My: Audit Finds Evidence of Widespread Voter Fraud in North Carolina," wrote Townhall.com. The National Review had "N.C. State Board Finds More than 35K Incidents of ‘Double Voting’ in 2012." The North Carolina news certainly fired up Dick Morris, a Fox News commentator and former political adviser to President Bill Clinton (who has largely turned against the Clintons these days). "It's most important data I've read in a year," Morris said on Fox News’ Hannity. "The elections commissioner there, Kim Strach, did a study of those who voted in North Carolina who also voted in another state in 2012 and she found 35,500 people voted in North Carolina and voted in some other state. "And only 27 states pool that data. Texas, California, New York and Florida did not pool their data. So you're talking about probably over a million people that voted twice in this election. This is the first concrete evidence we've ever had of massive voter fraud. We’ve talked about it ad nauseam. This proves it." Morris amplified on this claim in an op-ed that came out two days later. For this fact-check, we examine whether the report from the North Carolina Board of Elections proves that probably a million people voted twice in 2012. Let’s begin with the report, which wasn’t so much a report as one small piece of a longer slide show for lawmakers sitting on the state’s Elections Oversight Committee (see slides 34 and 35 in the presentation). Strach, executive director of the State Board of Elections, was giving the initial results from the state’s participation in a project run by the Kansas Secretary of State’s Office, Interstate Crosscheck. That project has grown from four states in 2005 to 28 in 2013. The list includes Alaska, Washington, Idaho, Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Iowa, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Tennessee, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Michigan, Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, West Virginia, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts. Those states send voter information to Kansas where the record of each of their voters is run against the records in all the other participating states. They are matched on first name, last name, date of birth and Social Security number. According to the Associated Press, Strach reported that this produced 765 voters in North Carolina who matched on each category with someone who voted elsewhere during the 2012 general election. "Could it be voter fraud? Sure, it could be voter fraud," Strach told lawmakers. "Could it be an error on the part of a precinct person choosing the wrong person's name in the first place? It could be. We're looking at each of these individual cases." Stracht said an additional 35,570 North Carolina voters matched on first and last name and date of birth, but not Social Security number. She emphasized the need for more investigation. Hans von Spakovsky, a former member of the Federal Election Commission who is a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that 765 voters matched down to the last four digits of a Social Security number suggests that North Carolina has the goods. "It is highly unlikely with all of these matching, that these were different individuals," Spakovsky said. Spakovsky said the larger group, based on name and birth date, was also fruitful ground to root out abuse. "It is probable that many of these are the same individuals, but there is also going to be certain percentage of folks who may share the same name and birthdate but are not the same individual. What that proportion will be I don’t know – but they all need to be investigated," he said. These numbers are large. In fact, Spakovsky said that in itself is part of the problem. It takes an enormous effort to get to the bottom of each case and election officials rarely have the resources. However, if the past is any guide, there is reason to doubt that the problem of double voting and voting fraud is as large as these figures suggest. The track record of the Interstate Crosscheck program itself shows how quickly the scale can drop from massive to miniscule. Kansas created the project nearly a decade ago, which is enough time to assess its performance. In a September 2013 presentation, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach said more than 84 million records had been fed into his office’s database. At that time, 22 states were in the pool. Kansas found over 120,000 potential duplicate voters based on first and last name and date of birth. The emphasis is on potential. Kobach’s presentation included the number of cases referred for prosecution. The total was 14. All of the referrals dated back to at least 2010. That year, over 850,000 people voted. There is no indication that any convictions emerged. That might be due to the workload and priorities of prosecutors but the point remains the same: The Interstate Crosscheck process starts very big and ends very small. Kobach also noted that four people were indicted in Colorado on charges of having also voted in Arizona. While an indictment is more serious than a referral, again, it is not a conviction. We reached out to the Kansas Secretary of State’s Office but the staff did not respond before our deadline. We will update this article if we learn anything new. The question is, why do the numbers drop off so radically? Michael McDonald, a political scientist at George Mason University, says there are many reasons. In his research, McDonald has spent a lot of time with voting records. They are not tidy. "You find missing data, or worse, a missing data code," McDonald explained. "They might plug in ‘9999’ when they don’t have a Social Security number and people are getting matched on that missing data code." In particular, clerical errors make voting records highly unreliable, McDonald said. "Someone might mark that a person voted when they didn’t, or they confuse fathers and sons who have the same name," he said. Interestingly, the Interstate Crosscheck staff acknowledge this. In their 2014 participation guide for states, they warn that "a significant number of apparent double votes are false positives and not double votes. Many are the result of errors -- voters sign the wrong line in the poll book, election clerks scan the wrong line with a barcode scanner." PunditFact looked at how North Carolina keeps its records. A bit over half of the counties, 53 of them, use a manual entry paper poll book. Mistakes are simply part of record keeping. In a different arena, medical records, one review found that at least 23 percent of names were misspelled. If database systems and human error aren’t enough to explain the huge number of matches, basic statistics make it even tougher to say this process picks out the same person in two states. McDonald co-authored a 2007 article that ran the numbers on New Jersey’s 2004 voter registry. More than 3.5 million people were listed as having voted that year. There was an allegation that over 4,000 people had voted twice. After scrubbing the list of 4,000 for clerical errors, about 800 matches remained. But statistically, researchers calculated that you would expect about 400 people out of the original 3.5 million to have the same names and birth dates. "The bigger the number of people, the more likely you will find these sorts of matches," McDonald said. "But they aren’t the same person." The latest round of the Interstate Crosscheck involved over 100 million records. Outside of the Interstate Crosscheck system, the number of people who vote twice seems low. PolitiFact Texas found that of 616 allegations of voting violations over 10 years in Texas, one conviction emerged for double-voting. So we know it’s unlikely that 35,000-or-more North Carolinians voted twice in 2012. How did Morris stretch it all the way to 1 million? In his op-ed, he offers some basic, but incorrect, math. The population of North Carolina is around 9.7 million, or about 3 percent of the overall U.S. population. If 35,000-or-more people voted twice in North Carolina, and if that trend continued all over the country, that would mean about 1.1 million people will have voted twice across the country, Morris figures. The problem with that calculation, however, is that if the same person votes once in North Carolina and once in Kansas, they will appear as having wrongly voted in both Kansas and North Carolina (2 hits in Morris’ calculation) -- but it would actually only be one offense. Morris seems to recognize this mistake. In his op-ed, he shifted to talking about "double-votes". So not only is the point Morris made on television flawed, his math appears to be inflated by 100 percent. Our ruling Morris said that the large number of North Carolina voters matched with records in other states was proof that over 1 million people voted twice in the 2012 election. While Morris admittedly was extrapolating from the North Carolina data, his conclusion is flawed on several fronts. The head of North Carolina’s board of elections did not claim that even the closest matches on name, birth date and Social Security numbers was conclusive evidence. She said more investigation was needed. The track record of the Interstate Crosscheck project shows that a tiny fraction of all potential matches represents any kind of voting fraud. In Kansas, out of more than 850,000 votes cast, only 14 names were recommended for prosecution and the Kansas Secretary of State reported no convictions.

pomt-10491	"John McCain voted against establishing a national holiday in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/08/moveon/mccain-changed-position-on-mlk-day/	The left-leaning advocacy group MoveOn.org has created an e-mail warning voters against Sen. John McCain, listing 10 things it says people might not know about him. "Please check out the list below, and then forward it to your friends, family, and coworkers," the e-mail says. "We can't rely on the media to tell folks about the real John McCain — but if we all pass this along, we can reach as many people as CNN Headline News does on a good night." Item No. 1 is about Martin Luther King Jr. "John McCain voted against establishing a national holiday in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Now he says his position has 'evolved,' yet he's continued to oppose key civil rights laws," the e-mail states. It's true that as a congressman in 1983, McCain voted against making Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday a national holiday. He was on the losing end of a 338 to 90 vote in the House of Representatives. McCain no longer stands by that vote. On April 4, 2008 — the 40th anniversary of Martin Luther King's death — McCain said the vote was wrong in a speech he gave in Memphis, the city where King died. "We can be slow as well to give greatness its due, a mistake I myself made long ago when I voted against a federal holiday in memory of Dr. King. I was wrong," he said, to loud reaction from the crowd. "I was wrong, and eventually realized it in time to give full support — full support — for a state holiday in my home state of Arizona. I'd remind you that we can all be a little late sometimes in doing the right thing, and Dr. King understood this about his fellow Americans." So McCain did oppose the national holiday, even though he later supported the state holiday. As for opposing key civil rights laws, McCain scores very low from two groups that rate Congress on issues involving civil rights law. The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights rates congressmen on their voting records. For the most recent 110th Congress, it rated senators on an array of votes on such things such as immigration, voting rights, education and the judiciary. McCain scored 22 percent on his votes, voting in favor of the conference's positions twice, on immigration issues. (Sen. Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, scored 92 percent, while Sen. Barack Obama scored 100 percent. These percentages omit missed votes.) The American Civil Liberties Union also rates McCain poorly, giving him a 17 percent rating for the 110th Congress and a 22 percent lifetime rating. Some news stories have given a more nuanced account of McCain's history on civil rights and the black community. (See Politico's April 8, 2008, story on John McCain and Arizona's black community .) But MoveOn gets its facts right on McCain, MLK Day and the senator's voting record, so we rate this statement True.	None	MoveOn.org	None	None	None	2008-04-08T00:00:00	2008-04-05	['John_McCain']
pomt-11375	"Pennsylvania (is) the only state in the country not to tax drillers."	half-true	/pennsylvania/statements/2018/mar/30/tom-wolf/wolfs-half-truth-subject-shale-taxes/	Almost four years after taking office and in the midst of his first re-election bid, Gov. Tom Wolf continues to push for a severance tax on natural gas extraction in Pennsylvania, arguing that drillers haven’t paid their fair share while raking in huge sums of cash from the Marcellus Shale boom. It’s a theme that carried over from his first campaign and through his first years in office, and it’s present in his latest round of campaign advertising. In a campaign video released March 23 titled "Here they come," Wolf says oil and gas lobbyists — the "they" in this scenario — "spent $60 million to block a tax on oil and gas extraction..." in Pennsylvania. (The $60 million figure is based on campaign finance data for the seven year period between 2010 and 2017, but MarcellusMoney.org says this total includes lobbying against other regulations and clean energy incentives, not just a severance tax.) The ad includes an animated clip showing black limousines labeled "LOBBYI$T" pulling up to the Capitol where bank bags of cash are tossed atop the steps. In the same breath, Wolf says this lobbying blitz has left Pennsylvania "the only state in the country not to tax drillers." Is that true? A tax by any other name While Pennsylvania remains the largest natural gas-producing state without a severance tax, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures, it is not the "only state" without one. A handful of states with relatively low levels of natural gas production or no natural gas production, like Iowa, lack such a measure. Pennsylvania shale drillers argue that even without a severance tax here, they’re far from being free of levies. In 2012, Wolf’s predecessor, Gov. Tom Corbett, signed into law an updated version of Pennsylvania’s Oil and Gas Act. It included the imposition of a so-called impact fee assessed on new wells, with the resulting revenue distributed to local and state governments to help municipalities "offset impacts associated with natural gas drilling." In June 2017, the Pennsylvania Utility Commission said it had collected and distributed "more than $1.2 billion in impact fees to communities across Pennsylvania" over six years. Reached by email, Erica Wright, vice president of communications and membership with the Marcellus Shale Coalition, an industry trade association and lobbying group, pointed back to a previously released statement. It reads, in part, "since 2012, Pennsylvania’s natural gas impact tax has generated $1.5 billion (and counting) in new revenue. These revenues, which total approximately $200 million annually, directly support communities in every county, as well as key statewide environmental and conservation programs." Groups like Marcellus Shale Coalition argue of the impact fee that if it looks like a tax and acts like a tax, it’s a tax. (Wright’s use of the phrase "impact tax" in referring to the state’s impact fee is no coincidence. It’s also reflective of the industry’s overall position on this subject.) The Pennsylvania Independent Oil and Gas Association, another industry advocate, also argues that gas drillers pay "the same taxes as other businesses, PLUS the impact ‘fee’ that NO OTHER businesses pay." Asked if the Wolf campaign video overlooked these taxes or the impact fee in calling Pennsylvania "the only state in the country not to tax drillers," Wolf campaign spokesman Jeff Sheridan said the line is "clearly" a reference to the lack of a severance tax here. (The words "severance tax" do not appear in the ad.) He then went on to disagree with those who say the impact fee is a practical equivalent to a severance tax. The point of the ad, Sheridan added by email, is that "Governor Wolf has taken on lobbyists and special interests to fight for a commonsense severance tax to stop letting oil and gas companies off the hook so they pay their fair share in Pennsylvania." Sheridan continued, "It’s long past time — Pennsylvania is the only major gas producing state that does not impose a severance tax on oil and gas. States like Texas, West Virginia, and Oklahoma all charge a severance tax, and their natural gas industries continue to thrive." What’s the difference? For starters, the verbiage — one is a "fee" and one is a "tax." Generally speaking, taxes are meant to raise money that can be used to defray the general costs of government — Wolf has said he wants a severance tax to help fund public education, for example — while a fee is typically meant to pay for the costs of a specific government program or service. But beyond that, the applications of the impact fee and severance tax differ as well. According to StateImpact.org: "Impact fees are levied on a per-well basis, so each time drillers punch a hole in the ground, they pay. A ‘severance tax’ is applied when resources are severed from the earth, so it would be a tax on the amount of gas produced." The Kleinman Center for Energy Policy at the University of Pennsylvania said in a 2015 report that the yield for the state would be larger with a severance tax, adding, "were the severance tax in place for the most recent year, extraction companies would have paid an effective tax rate more than three times the rate they were charged under the impact fee." In February 2015, Wolf said he expected the severance tax to create $1 billion in new revenue for Pennsylvania, Philly.com reported at the time. That projection has fallen in the years since, alongside a slowdown in natural gas production. Actual impact fee collections have fallen for the same reason. But is the impact fee actually a tax? In September, the Pennsylvania State House Energy and Environmental Resources Committee approved an amendment rebranding the existing "impact fee" as a "severance tax." Critics called it an act of "legislative deception" and an exercise in semantics. Supporters called it an overdue clarification. The conservative Commonwealth Foundation, meanwhile, added that because impact fee revenue was restricted to certain uses under Act 13, and because the fee is a flat rate per unconventional well, these limits make the proposal "truly a fee, rather than a tax in disguise." Our ruling Wolf is accurate in saying Pennsylvania does not have a severance tax on drilling. He's also accurate in saying lobbyists are a large part of the reason for that. He's wrong in implying those same lobbyists spent $60 million in direct opposition to severance tax proposals. He's wrong about Pennsylvania being the only state without a severance tax, though it's the only "major gas-producing state" without one. It's also misleading to imply that nothing has been done to tap drilling activity for municipal or state gain in Pennsylvania. The result of all this is a lack of context being passed on to viewers and voters. For those reasons, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-13988	Since 1978, college "tuition nationwide has gone up something like four times the rate of inflation."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jun/09/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-college-tuition-has-risen-four-t/	Gov. Scott Walker has put caps on tuition increases, even amid budget cuts, saying he wants to be sure there is "affordable" tuition for the University of Wisconsin System. He caught our attention May 16, 2016 when he said, on conservative talker Charlie Sykes radio show on WTMJ-AM, that rising tuition costs are far from unique. "This is not just picking on the University of Wisconsin System," Walker said. "This is a nationwide trend. Since ‘78, I think, tuition nationwide has gone up something like four times the rate of inflation." We have checked many claims about the cost of college tuition. In 2014, for instance, PolitiFact National examined this claim: "In 1978, a student who worked a minimum-wage summer job could afford to pay a year’s full tuition at the 4-year public university of their choice." Based on national averages, a person could pay in-state tuition at most public universities with their summer earnings, but not for any school, such as one out of state. The claim was rated Mostly True. We decided to check out Walker’s claim, too. Behind the numbers When asked for backup, Walker’s team sent us to a Chart of the Day published by Bloomberg in 2012. The article said college tuition since 1978 has increased four times faster than inflation, but didn’t cite a source for the statistic. We turned to the National Center for Education Statistics, the primary federal entity for collecting and analyzing education data. The center, part of the U.S. Department of Education, provided data on undergraduate tuition going back to 1978. The numbers come from its annual surveys of colleges. In 1978, tuition and required fees at all institutions averaged $1,073. By 2014, it increased more than 1,000 percent, topping $11,000. That’s a big jump in cost. But Walker’s claim compared the increasing price of tuition to inflation. The Consumer Price Index is one measure of inflation, or how over time the value of money decreases. The CPI measures the change in cost over time for a representative basket of goods, such as food, housing, transportation and education. From 1978 to 2014, the index increased about 246 percent. So, clearly, the rate of increase for tuition has surpassed inflation. And the percent increase in tuition is more than four times the increase in inflation, as Walker claimed. Since Walker talked in the context of Wisconsin’s public four-year college system, we took a look at tuition prices for those schools. Tuition at those institutions shot up from around $600 to more than $8,000 by 2014. That’s more than a 1,000 percent increase. What about the total cost of an education? Tuition is just a portion of the cost of a college degree and the costs for room and board have increased much slower than tuition. If tuition is combined with room and board, the price increase is about three times inflation since 1978, according to the same education and inflation data. Some experts say the out-of-pocket costs for tuition should be examined, rather than the published rates. Typically, few students pay the full amount, since many also get scholarships, grants and other financial aid. The College Board reports data on the net tuition paid by students, but that data doesn’t begin until the 1990s. Sandy Baum, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and co-author of the Board’s Trends in College Pricing and Trends in Student Aid reports, said the growth of actual prices is smaller than published prices, though still substantial. For example, from 1990 until 2014, net tuition paid by in-state students at public four-year schools across the country doubled. In contrast, published tuition prices more than tripled during the same time period. Our rating Walker said since 1978, college "tuition nationwide has gone up something like four times the rate of inflation." Average tuition prices from the National Center for Education Statistics and inflation rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics back up his point. We rate the claim True.

pomt-03241	Of the roughly 15 percent of Americans who don’t have health insurance, "half of them made more than $50,000 a year."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/15/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-half-uninsured-americans-make-least/	During a recent appearance on The Daily Show, guest host John Oliver and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., engaged in a lively exchange on health insurance and why people buy it or not. Paul, an eye surgeon, is strongly opposed to President Barack Obama’s health care law. During the interview, Oliver pressed him on how to get more Americans signed up for insurance. Paul indicated that the biggest issue is affordability, particularly for young, healthy and relatively affluent people. According to the most recent statistics, he said, "85 percent of people had insurance, so 15 percent didn't. So what you need to do is look at who are the 15 percent, and why don't they have insurance? Of the 15 percent who didn't have insurance, half of them made more than $50,000 a year. Why didn't they buy insurance? Because of the expense. They were young healthy people." In this fact-check, we’ll check his claim that half of the uninsured made more than $50,000 a year. In a separate report, we’ll look at whether the cost of insurance is the biggest barrier to uninsured Americans. We’ll start by noting that Paul is very close to the mark when he says 15 percent of Americans don’t have insurance. The most recent Census Bureau statistics for 2011 show that 15.7 percent of Americans are uninsured. What about the income breakdown for that 15 percent? There are a few different ways to slice the data, but none produces a number for $50,000-plus earners that reaches the 50 percent level Paul offered on The Daily Show. In a September 2012 paper, the Employee Benefits Research Institute looked at 2011 census data on health coverage. It found that 28 percent of the uninsured earned at least $50,000. That’s quite a bit lower than what Paul had indicated. The highest plausible percentage cited by our experts -- who included both liberals and conservatives -- used census data for households rather than for individuals. Using this method, 37.5 percent of the uninsured live in a household with an income above $50,000. Why the variation between household and individual data? Uninsured young adults who are roommates might live in a household where all roommates collectively make more than $50,000, even if each roommate individually earns much less. This type of living arrangement tends to boost the count of uninsured adults who "earn" more than $50,000, even if they really don’t make that much individually. This difference in counting methods matters in this sort of statistical comparison because people without health insurance "are more likely to be living in less-common housing arrangements -- more in multi-generation families, more living with people who aren't related to them," said Hanns Kuttner, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute. When we showed our calculations to Paul’s office, communications director Moira Bagley said there’s significant uncertainty in the Census data due to "inexact data collection" that "under-reports the numbers of people who actually have health insurance." This refers to an argument made by some critics of Obamacare that the Census Bureau undercounts Medicaid recipients compared to the total cited by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. Subtracting these uncounted Medicaid recipients leaves the pool of uninsured Americans relatively better off. However, each of the seven ideologically diverse health policy experts we talked to for this story used the census numbers when we asked them to evaluate Paul's claim, and none expressed concerns about the ability of the census data to fairly evaluate the question. Our ruling Paul said that of the roughly 15 percent of Americans who don’t have health insurance, "half of them made more than $50,000 a year." In reality, if you measure what individuals make, Census data shows that 28 percent of uninsured Americans earn $50,000. By another measure, using household income, almost 38 percent of uninsured Americans earn at least $50,000. Both of these figures are pretty far from the 50 percent Paul cited in the interview. We rate his claim False.	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2013-08-15T15:11:14	2013-08-12	['United_States']
pomt-08367	Darryl Hicks had seven ethics violations and didn't pay most of the fines.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/oct/26/mark-butler/candidates-spar-over-ethics-claims/	With double-digit unemployment and the economy as uncertain as the outcome of this weekend's matchup between the Georgia Bulldogs and the Florida Gators, the two leading candidates for state labor commissioner are spending a good bit of time talking about ethics. At issue: Who is more unethical? Case in point, the Oct. 17 Atlanta Press Club debate. The fireworks began with Democrat Darryl Hicks grilling Republican Mark Butler, a state representative, about whether he attempted to "strong-arm" a state university to rehire a lobbyist whom he dated. "I never threatened nor strong-armed anybody to hire anybody back," Butler said. Butler countered by asking Hicks about some information the representative spotted on the State Ethics Commission's website. "I'd like for you to tell the people of Georgia about your seven ethics violations and your seven ethics fines, most of which you have not paid, dating all the way back to 2006," Butler said, referring to Hicks' failed 2006 bid for secretary of state. "Now, Mark," Hicks said. "C'mon, folks can look that up and see that is not true." "Look it up," Butler could be heard saying in the background. We wanted to look into Butler's claim about Hicks, since it seemed more concrete than whether Butler inappropriately tried to help a lobbyist. You've either had ethics fines or not. Butler led us to the website's late/nonfiler's reports. Hicks' name was there. Hicks was late in turning in his campaign contribution disclosure report, according to the site. The disclosure reports outline who gives a candidate money and how each candidate spent the funds. "It's right there," Butler said. Hicks, the former chief of staff to the chairman of the Fulton County Commission, lost the Aug. 8, 2006, Democratic Party runoff for secretary of state to Gail Buckner. He was late in filing disclosure reports from that campaign that were due on Sept. 30, 2006, and Oct. 25, 2006. We checked the Ethics Commission's website and Butler's name didn't appear. Butler's campaign disclosure reports show he filed them by the deadline. Hicks told us he didn't realize he had to file disclosure reports with the state for the Sept. 30, 2006, and Oct. 25, 2006, due dates since he had lost. State records show some fines were paid in 2009, when Hicks said he received invoices from the state that he had not paid the late fees. Hicks paid $150 in fines last week to clear up other late disclosure reports. Candidates are typically required to send disclosure reports to the state five times during the year of their campaign. The standard dates are March 31, June 30, Sept. 30, Oct. 25 and Dec. 31. Candidates have a grace period of five business days to deliver the reports to the state. Candidates who miss the deadline are required to pay "an additional filing fee" of $25, according to page 24 of the state Ethics in Government Act. The candidate must also pay a $50 "filing fee" if he or she is more than 15 days late, according to the state act. The penalties and language are much tougher on lobbyists found guilty of improper actions. The ethics act says they can be hit with a $2,000 penalty for each "violation." Ethics was a major topic during this year's legislative session as lawmakers passed a bill that broadens the authority of the Ethics Commission, tightens reporting requirements for lobbyists and legislators, increases the fines for violations, makes it a crime to use a state agency to attack someone and prohibits sexual harassment. State lawmakers were influenced by embarrassing headlines that surrounded the resignation of former House Speaker Glenn Richardson, who resigned last year after his ex-wife accused him of having an affair with a female lobbyist. Some lawmakers wanted the legislation, Senate Bill 17, to go further by restricting gifts from lobbyists. We spoke with Hicks campaign spokeswoman Phyllis Fraley, who sent us a letter from her candidate to the commission. Hicks wrote that there were "clerical errors in the amount assessed" on the state's website and he thought the matter had been resolved. State Ethics Commission executive secretary Stacey Kalberman told us that all the fines have been paid. Fraley accused Butler of blowing the matter out of proportion. "It's interesting that while Mark is busy being dishonest by attacking Darryl's ethics over the most minor clerical error, Mark has managed to further expose his own serious moral and ethical lapses while he held office," she said. Butler believes the issue is important. He told us he wouldn't have brought up the matter if Hicks had been late once or twice, but seven times is disturbing. Butler also said Hicks should have known he missed those deadlines in 2006. "He's a habitual violator," Butler said. Butler accused Hicks of misleading those who watched the Atlanta Press Club debate by saying it wasn't true he had ethics violations. "He called me a liar over that fact," Butler said. We discussed this with Common Cause Georgia executive director Bill Bozarth, one of the state's leading government ethics watchdogs. Bozarth said when he thinks of ethics violations, he considers something like a candidate who uses a contribution for inappropriate purposes or accepts a donation from a questionable source. Bozarth said he has seen some cases in which candidates who lost their race missed the deadline to hand in their disclosure reports, although the state's ethics laws do not give them a pass for being late because they lost. So does this constitute an ethics violation? "Technically, it is a violation, but in my opinion, not as serious as those flouting the law and using the [campaign] funds for inappropriate purposes," Bozarth told us. We posed the same question to Kalberman, without mentioning the dispute between the two candidates about this issue. "Technically, any time you don't file on time, it's an ethics violation," Kalberman said. "I would not consider it a serious violation of the ethics code." Butler is technically correct that Hicks violated the ethics act. But his statement leaves out important details and context that could give voters a different impression. The ethics act is much tougher on other acts of improper conduct. We believe Butler's statement could give viewers the impression that Hicks committed ethical lapses along the lines of what was included in SB 17. Also, most of the fines were paid before last week. We rate Butler's claim against Hicks as Half True.	None	Mark Butler	None	None	None	2010-10-26T06:00:00	2010-10-17	['None']

pomt-07931	Recommendations for a major tax overhaul for Georgia are an "overall tax hike."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2011/jan/28/americans-tax-reform/anti-tax-group-says-georgia-overhaul-hike/	A proposal to overhaul Georgia’s tangled tax system recently earned the worst slur in the fiscal conservative book: "tax hike." Americans for Tax Reform, which opposes all tax increases, called out new Gov. Nathan Deal, House Speaker David Ralston and Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers by name. If they back the reforms, ATR said, they’re breaking a promise they made when they signed the group’s anti-tax pledge. The proposal "is akin to shards of glass in a delicious creme brulee," Grover Norquist, leader of the Washington-based group, said in a written statement Jan. 10. "It is a bit of desirable tax reform ruined by an overall tax hike." Are there really shards of tax-hike glass in an otherwise yummy overhaul? In June, then-Gov. Sonny Perdue created the Special Council on Tax Reform and Fairness for Georgians to recommend a rewrite of the state’s tax code. Critics think change is overdue. They argue that the code is outdated and riddled with exemptions for special interests. They also want the state’s income to rely on revenue sources that aren’t so vulnerable to economic downturns. On Jan. 7, the council came back with more than a dozen recommendations. They included lowering the 6 percent personal and corporate income tax over three years to a rate that "does not exceed" 4 percent, re-establishing a tax on groceries and eliminating many exemptions. Council members recommended lowering income tax rates to levels they think will zero out any potential revenue increases, said Christine Ries, an economics professor at Georgia Tech and a member of the council. State legislators now must decide how to incorporate the recommendations into a bill. Three days later, ATR called the recommendations an "overall tax hike." ATR used data from the council’s report and its own estimates to determine cuts would total $3.375 billion over three years but hikes would total far more -- between $4.77 billion and $5.75 billion. Since the proposal would increase state revenue, it counts as a tax increase, its officials told PolitiFact Georgia. ATR’s focus is on the recommendation’s overall effect on revenue and not whether certain individuals would pay more taxes. We will therefore focus on revenue, as well. We took our own look at the council’s report and found that while it’s possible the changes would increase tax revenue, it might not. Under the council’s proposal, a grocery tax would start right away, but reductions in personal and corporate taxes that would offset that hike would phase in over three years. Therefore, in the first year taxes could rise. Our rough calculations put that jump between some $250 million and $1.4 billion. The report, however, lacks revenue estimates for major pieces. It has none for two years of the three-year cut in personal and corporate income taxes. Estimates for other initiatives, such as eliminating the tax on energy used in manufacturing, are missing as well. News accounts place the cost of this tax anywhere from $80 million a year to $420 million. More complete estimates are in the works. When you tally what numbers are available, it’s not clear whether tax numbers would rise or fall. PolitiFact Georgia was able to cobble together reasonable scenarios in which they increased and dropped. For instance, if you follow ATR’s assumptions and take the high revenue estimates for taxing groceries, increasing cigarettes taxes and taxing person-to-person auto sales, revenue would jump by an average of more than $1 billion a year (about 6 percent of the state budget). If you use low revenue estimates and ignore ATR’s assumptions, they would sink by nearly $119 million (roughly 1 percent). Another problem is that ATR boost its revenue estimate by about $1.23 billion over three years by assuming state-level reform would enable Georgia to collect sales taxes from out-of-state Internet retailers. But state changes can’t create this windfall. This is largely a federal issue, and the constitutionality of collecting this money is in dispute. Other states, the U.S. Congress and courts will likely have to act before this money comes in. It’s not clear when or if this will happen. ATR opposes taxing e-commerce, but "that said, we are merely using the numbers we were provided," Joshua Culling, the group’s state affairs manager, said in an e-mail. "Most of what has been discussed about this plan has been guesswork to this point," Cullig added. "ATR’s scoring of the plan is as comprehensive as anything out there." We talked to other experts and found they were hesitant to label the proposal a "tax increase." Kelly McCutchen, who is president of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, a Libertarian-influenced think tank, cautioned that even valid revenue estimates can vary widely. For instance, the foundation’s estimate for the revenue from taxing food was more than $175 million higher than one by the Georgia State University Fiscal Research Center. Whether the proposal would constitute a tax increase is up for grabs, McCutchen said. Kail Padgitt, a staff economist for the fiscally conservative Tax Foundation in Washington, noted that taxes may jump initially because of the timing of income tax cuts. Still, the group currently favors the proposal because its language would allow legislators to solve this problem by slashing income taxes more quickly and deeply than recommended. Another issue is ATR’s "tax hike" definition. Tax revenue is currently unusually low because of the foundering economy. It’s fair to ask whether "revenue-neutral" means the proposal maintains current revenue levels or returns us to pre-recession figures, said Sarah Beth Gehl, deputy director of the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute. To sum up: ATR concluded the reform recommendations were an "overall tax hike" before it had enough evidence. PolitiFact Georgia’s own analysis found that the tax overhaul could increase or cut taxes. ATR also included a $1.23 billion boost in e-commerce revenue that recommendations cannot bring about on their own. Calling the recommendation an "overall tax hike" is therefore akin to telling Georgians there are shards of glass in their creme brulee before it reaches the table. ATR’s assessment contains some element of truth, but it is premature and ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. It therefore meets our definition of Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08828	"We know that tax cuts are remarkably un-stimulative when you compare them with different kinds of government spending."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/12/rachel-maddow/maddow-claims-spending-more-stimulative-tax-cuts/	Tax cuts are popular with Republicans, but they don't boost the economy as much as other types of government spending, Rachel Maddow, the liberal MSNBC talk show host, said on her show Aug. 6, 2010. Talking to Ezra Klein, a Washington Post columnist and an MSNBC contributor, about the economy and the upcoming November elections, Maddow took a stab at one of the cornerstones of the GOP platform. "Is there anything that would make a real impact on job numbers that Republicans are willing to support? Obviously, we know they‘re willing to support tax cuts. We know that tax cuts are remarkably un-stimulative when you compare them with different kinds of government spending, different allocations of resources. Is there anything? They keep saying jobs are their priority. Have they shown a willingness to embrace anything that would make a dent on jobs?" Maddow's use of the phrase "we know" got us thinking -- do economists really agree that cutting taxes is less effective than increasing government spending? We decided to look into it. First, however, a crash course on "Keynesian economics." The name comes from John Maynard Keynes, a 20th century British economist. (For a musical lesson of the economic debate, check out the Hayek vs. Keynes Rap Anthem.) As Greg Mankiw, a Harvard economics professor, explains in a summer 2010 edition of National Affairs magazine, Keynes believed that "extreme and sustained unemployment during a recession" is fundamentally the result of "a decline in overall (or aggregate) demand in the economy." The government can "help restore normalcy" by increasing demand through spending, writes Mankiw. "And because the influx of government spending drives businesses to hire and consumers to spend, its impact is multiplied." According to classic Keynesian theory, government spending increases have a higher "multiplier" than tax cuts, because individuals might choose to save the money from tax cuts, rather than spend it. Is there data to back up Keynes' -- and, by extension, Rachel Maddow's -- argument? Yes, but there's also data that certain types of tax cuts can have a similar impact. To start out, we turned to testimony by Mark Zandi before the Senate Finance Committee on April 14, 2010. Zandi is the chief economist for Moody's Economy.com and a former adviser to Republican Sen. John McCain during his 2008 presidential campaign. Page 5 of the testimony contains a table that summarizes Zandi's calculated "bang for the buck" for various fiscal stimulus programs. Spending $1 on unemployment insurance benefits, for example, increases the GDP -- the value of goods and services that the economy produces -- by $1.61 a year later, according to Zandi. (We found some counter-arguments in a previous Truth-O-Meter item checking New Hampshire Sen. Jeanne Shaheen's use of Zandi's data.) A temporary increase in food stamps has the biggest stimulative effect. For each dollar spent, GDP grows by $1.74 one year later. For spending increases as a whole, the "bang for the buck" ranges from $1.13 for the Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program to $1.74 for food stamps. The former economist for the GOP presidential candidate also looked at the stimulative effect of tax cuts. Making the Bush income tax cuts permanent has a multiplier of 0.32, which means that for every dollar the government cuts in taxes, GDP grows by $0.32. Cutting the corporate tax rate also has a multiplier of $0.32. According to the chart, the most stimulative tax cut initiative would be a job tax credit, which has a multiplier of $1.30. So based on Zandi's research, Maddow is on solid ground. All but one of the spending programs that Zandi analyzed have a multiplier significantly higher than one. The highest multiplier for tax cuts is $1.30. Christina Romer, who heads President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers until she steps down Sept. 3, 2010, also addressed the question of fiscal multipliers in a speech at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business on Feb. 27, 2009. She began by acknowledging that "estimating these multipliers is difficult and that there is surely substantial uncertainty around any estimate." She then went on to argue, however, that based on her analysis with Jared Bernstein (an economic advisor to Vice President Joe Biden) of the stimulus package that President Obama signed in February 2009, "a tax cut has a multiplier of roughly 1.0 after about a year and a half, and spending has a multiplier of about 1.6." In other words, government spending is more effective than cutting taxes. Likewise, in 2009, Matthew Shapiro and Joel Slemrod, economics professors at the University of Michigan, found the 2008 federal tax rebates did not provide a big boost for consumer spending. "Because of the low spending propensity, the rebates in 2008 provided low 'bang for the buck' as economic stimulus. Putting cash into the hands of the consumers who use it to save or pay off debt boosts their well-being, but it does not necessarily make them spend. In particular, low-income individuals were particularly likely to use the rebate to pay off debt." Still, it is a long-running joke that if you ask 10 economists a question, you get 10 different answers, and the size of fiscal multipliers is no exception. There are plenty of economists who have found that tax cuts -- particularly cuts that encourage investment -- can have a strong stimulative effect. We spoke with Valerie Ramey, an economics professor at the University of California-San Diego, who has done much research on estimating fiscal multipliers. She told us that "income tax rebates are not very stimulative" but that "other types of tax cuts appear to have much bigger effects." Ramey specifically cited the positive effects of investment tax credits, which she said are not captured by the "simple textbook Keynesian model." "Thus, based on the research, I would argue that the most stimulative types of policies are tax cuts that directly affect the incentives to invest and hire workers," she wrote us in an e-mail. We also looked at a paper that Christina Romer co-authored in June 2010 with her husband, David Romer. Using narrative evidence to control for other factors that influenced output during the post World War II period, the two economists found that a tax cut of $1 raises the GDP by roughly $3 over the following three years. Romer did not attempt to quantify spending effects in the paper, but Mankiw wrote in his National Affairs essay that her results suggest that the maximum potential impact of cutting taxes may actually be up to three times bigger than Obama's advisors assumed it was during their policy simulations. Then there is Ramey's own research. Using news sources to identify expected changes in government spending that are due to military events from 1939 to 2008, Ramey found that the government spending multiplier is anywhere from $0.60 to $1.20, "depending on the time period and how the multipliers are calculated." We asked Ramey to help us understand how her findings compare with Romers' 2010 results. She told us that the spending increases she looked at lasted on average for 4 years. In contrast, "it is unclear what the average duration of Romers' tax changes are," she said. Still, based on her review of Romers' data, she told us that "I don't think that one can argue that my spending multipliers are bigger than the Romers' tax multipliers." Finally, economic researchers Andrew Mountford from the University of London and Harald Uhlig from the University of Chicago wrote in a July 2005 paper that "the best fiscal policy to stimulate the economy is a deficit-financed tax cut." There are more papers than we have time or space for here, but we think you get the picture. Economists have been arguing for decades about various approaches to economic stimulus and there is plenty of research and literature for both sides. Going back to the original claim: Maddow said that "we know that tax cuts are remarkably un-stimulative when you compare them with different kinds of government spending." During the course of our research, we found several papers and studies that support her argument. But we also found evidence to the contrary. When it comes to macroeconomics, just about everything is still a matter for debate. We rate her claim Half True.	None	Rachel Maddow	None	None	None	2010-08-12T17:54:22	2010-08-06	['None']
pomt-12102	"Austin is the safest big city in Texas."	half-true	/texas/statements/2017/aug/24/steve-adler/steve-adler-calls-austin-safest-big-city-Texas-cri/	Austin Mayor Steve Adler, urging transgender members of the military threatened by President Donald Trump to come to work for the Texas capital’s law enforcement agencies, ran out several tweets including a July 26, 2017, post stating: "Austin is the safest big city in Texas partly because we know our differences make us a stronger community." A reader asked us to check: Is Austin the state’s safest big city? Mayor cites Texas Monthly We asked Adler how he reached his conclusion. By email, Adler spokesman Jason Stanford advised that Adler relied on a Texas Monthly "Daily Post" story on FBI crime statistics published the day that Adler tweeted. The story includes a headline declaring Austin the state’s safest city. In the main, the story says that according to data compiled by the FBI covering 2015 and part of 2016, Odessa by far had the state’s highest violent crime rate, 1,070.1 violent crimes reported per 100,000 residents, up 25 percent from 2014. The FBI classifies as violent crimes murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. "It’s long been noted that Austin is something of a fairytale land where violence is rare, and at least compared to the rest of the state, that tends to bear out," the story says, going on: "Although Austin’s violent crime rate of 287.7 per 100,000 is slightly up from 2013, it’s grown at a much slower rate than any comparably safe city over the past couple of years, putting Austin in the top spot for safe Texas cities." FBI says don’t compare jurisdictions We noticed, though, the story didn’t mention a consistent FBI advisory against employing its statistics to compare jurisdictions. Since at least 2011, the FBI has said it "strongly discourages" using FBI Unified Crime Reporting statistics to compare communities. That note said: "Rankings ignore the uniqueness of each locale." The FBI admonished in May 2017: "Data users should not rank locales because there are many factors that cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place." When we asked FBI spokesman Stephen Fischer to evaluate Adler’s claim, Fischer replied by email: "Since crime is a sociological phenomenon influenced by a variety of factors, the FBI discourages ranking the agencies and using the data as a measurement of law enforcement effectiveness." Fischer passed along elaboration from FBI analyst Loretta Simmons: "Comparisons lead to simplistic and/or incomplete analyses that often create misleading perceptions adversely affecting communities and their residents. Valid assessments are possible only with careful study and analysis of the range of unique conditions affecting each local law enforcement jurisdiction." Austin, big city? Another consideration is whether Austin fairly ranks as a big city in comparison to, say, Houston, Dallas or San Antonio. This year, before rating Half True U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke’s description of his hometown as the nation’s safest city, we noted that CQ Press--which annually reports on crime rates using FBI statistics--enables adjustments based on population density--and if you impose a density of at least 2,720 residents per square mile, Austin and El Paso fall out of its big-city crime rate rankings. That density squeeze, we found, left San Antonio with the No. 6 lowest crime rate nationally, Dallas at No. 12 and Houston at No. 17. Austin region’s violent crime rate Another wrinkle: The crime rates cited by Texas Monthly were not city-specific, instead taking into account metropolitan statistical areas. This means the touted Austin figures reflected crimes tallied through Travis, Williamson, Hays, Bastrop and Caldwell counties. That said, the Austin area in 2015 had a lower violent-crime rate than any of the state’s other regions, we confirmed in our own break-out of what’s posted by the FBI. Austin’s rate of 287.7 violent crimes per 100,000 residents greatly trailed the Odessa area’s No. 1 state rate of 1070.1 violent crimes per 100,000 residents. Meantime, the Austin region’s murder/nonnegligent manslaughter rate of 2.2 per 100,000 residents ranked third behind the rates for less-populous Wichita Falls (1.3 per 100,000 residents) and Brownsville (1.6 per 100,000 residents); the Longview area had the state’s highest rate (10.1 per 100,000 inhabitants). LOWEST VIOLENT CRIME RATES, TEXAS METRO AREAS, 2015 REGION VIOLENT CRIME RATE Austin-Round Rock 287.7 per 100,000 residents Tyler 295.7 College Station-Bryan 315.5 McAllen-Edinburg-Mission 298.1 Brownsville-Harlingen 299.8 Midland 322.3 Sherman-Denison 327.1 San Angelo 329.3 Dallas-Plano-Irving 330.6 Wichita Falls 334.5 SOURCE: Chart showing crime rates in Texas Metropolitan Statistical Areas, https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2015/crime-in-the-u.s.-2015/tables/table-6 (PolitiFact Texas compilation, August 2017) More recent FBI data Our own look into FBI crime reports further showed that in January 2017, the agency released its preliminary report tabulating crimes in each U.S. city of 100,000 population or greater in the first half of 2016. From those figures, we roughed out the violent crime rate for each of 35 Texas cities (not metro areas) listed in the report. Our finding: Austin (population about 948,000 as of July 2016) ranked 21st in the state with a violent-crime rate of 209 incidents per 100,000 residents--trailing cities including El Paso (population about 683,000) with 195 violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants); Laredo (192 violent crimes per 100,000 residents); Midland (186 violent crimes per 100,000 people); and the capital’s northern suburb, Round Rock (73 violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants). See our chart here. When we alerted Stanford to what we found, he replied by email that Adler compares Austin solely to the state’s biggest cities, specifying Houston, San Antonio, Dallas and Fort Worth. El Paso safer? Separately, our web search turned up an April 2017 ranking of Texas cities for public safety by Pittsburgh-based Niche, a self-described "blend of data scientists, engineers, parents, and ‘yinzers’ who are passionate about helping you discover the schools and neighborhoods that are right for you." Starting from FBI statistics, Niche says, it based the public-safety grades on each city’s assault and robbery rates and, to lesser degrees, local rates of murder, burglary, vehicle theft and larceny plus resident responses to questions about local crime and safety. Niche ranked Austin No. 22 nationally among "best cities to live in America" though the city landed a public-safety grade of C+ -- like El Paso, Brownsville, Midland, Laredo, Wichita Falls and Tyler. Faring better, Plano, Richardson, College Station, and McAllen each had a public-safety grade of B-minus, per Niche, with Round Rock ranking fifth nationally thanks to its public-safety grade of B. Criminologist: Comparisons ‘chancy’ We also queried Northeastern University criminologist James Alan Fox about Adler’s claim. By email, Fox said he’s determined that per FBI figures, Austin in 2015 had the lowest homicide rate among 51 U.S. cities with at least 300,000 residents and at least 20 homicides; Austin’s rate was 2.5 for every 100,000 residents, narrowly besting San Diego’s 2.6 rate, according to a table Fox provided. Among Texas cities Fox evaluated, Houston had the highest homicide rate, 13.3 per 100,000 residents. Does that arguably make Austin the safest big city in Texas? Fox said by phone that such judgments are hard to cement because cities differ in many ways including, for instance, how suburban they happen to be. "There are a whole bunch of reasons cities differ that have nothing to do with safety," Fox said, "that have nothing to do with police and how they’re doing their job. That’s why it’s chancy to make those kinds of comparisons." Our ruling Adler called Austin the safest big city in Texas. As we’ve said before — and as experts keep stressing — using crime data to declare one city "safer" than another is fraught with peril. That said, FBI statistics suggest the five-county Austin region in 2015 had a lower violent-crime rate than other Texas regions. But El Paso had a lower violent-crime rate than Austin in the first half of 2016. Adler’s claim adds up to a statement that’s partly accurate while lacking important context. We rate it Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-13482	Says President Barack Obama "has taken less vacation days than any other president in a generation," while Congress "has taken more vacation days than any other Congress in history."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/09/occupy-democrats/facts-take-vacation-occupy-democrats-claim-about-p/	When President Barack Obama was vacationing on Martha's Vineyard and his critics were chastising him for not visiting flood victims in Louisiana, the liberal group Occupy Democrats created a message on their Facebook page trying to contrast Obama's work record against the Republican Congress. Below a photograph of Obama are the words, "Has taken less vacation days than any other president in a generation." Below an image of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan are the words, "Have taken more vacation days than any other Congress in history." The introduction to the Aug. 20 image insists, "The numbers don't lie." It had been shared 45,470 times by Sept. 6, 2016. Bad grammar aside (it should be "fewer" vacation days, not "less"), we wanted to know if the data checked out. We repeatedly contacted the group but didn't hear back. Presidential vacations First, it's important to realize that if you're only going back a generation (20 years), you're only comparing Obama to two other presidents — Bill Clinton who took office in 1993 and George W. Bush, who was inaugurated in 2001. We turned to Mark Knoller, White House correspondent at CBS News, the zen master of data on all things presidential such as vacations, trips, news conferences and even teleprompter use. He told us via email that Obama has been on 28 vacations (including long weekends) spanning all or part of 217 days. The president has just over four months left in his term. His predecessor, Bush, made 77 visits to his Texas ranch spanning all or part of 490 days. There were also 11 visits to his parent's home in Kennebunkport, Maine, spanning all or part of 43 days. Total: 533. But by Knoller's count, Clinton took the fewest — 174 days of summer vacations on Martha’s Vineyard and at Jackson Hole, Wyo. So the first part of the Occupy Democrats post is wrong. (It's also worth noting, as Knoller does, that a president never really goes on vacation. The job goes with him.) Congressional vacations We didn't have to go very far back in time to discover that this part of the Occupy Democrats meme is wrong as well. Defining vacation days for Congress is harder than for a president. After all, when members don't have to be in Washington for a vote, they may be in their districts, meeting with voters, or attending to official duties. And let's be real here — they might also be treating it like a vacation. As of Sept. 6, 2016, the House had been in session 94 days. The Senate had been in session 114 days. We decided to start by looking at House calendars. This year, the House is scheduled to be in session for another 32 days. That means House members will have been officially working in Washington for a total of about 126 days. That’s more days on the calendar than in 2008, when House members met for 119 calendar days, and in 2006, when they met for 104 days. The House looks even less lazy if you look at 2015, the first year of the current Congress. That year, the House met for 157 calendar days, more than in 2014 (137 days), 2012 (153 days), 2010 (128 days), 2008 (119 days) and 2006 (104 days). Alternatively, we looked at the data in two-year blocks, which would be full sessions of Congress. The current House (the 114th session, 2015-16) has met or is scheduled to meet for 283 days. But in the 109th session (2005-06) it met for 247 days, which is 36 days fewer. In fact, the current session is slated to have more days than the 105th, 106th, 107th and 108th Congresses as well. We found the same pattern in the Senate, which has met, or is scheduled to meet, for 156 days this year. It didn't matter whether we looked at projected days this year or actual days last year. Since 2000, there were at least six years the Senate met fewer times. And when we combined House and Senate tallies, the current 114th Congress is on track to have officially worked in Washington more days than the 113th, 109th, 108th, 107th and 106th Congresses. Our ruling Occupy Democrats says Obama "has taken less vacation days than any other president in a generation," while Congress "has taken more vacation days than any other Congress in history." The post is wrong for Obama. It is ridiculously wrong for Congress. We rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-15271	The number of illegal immigrants in the United States is "30 million, it could be 34 million."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2015/jul/28/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-number-illegal-immigrants-30-mil/	The day after Donald Trump visited the border in Laredo, Texas, he was armed with some fresh claims about illegal immigration, including how many immigrants are actually here. "I don't think the 11 million -- which is a number you have been hearing for many many years, I've been hearing that number for five years -- I don't think that is an accurate number anymore," Trump said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe July 24. "I am now hearing it's 30 million, it could be 34 million, which is a much bigger problem." Host Joe Scarborough then asked Trump, "Who are you hearing that from?" Trump replied: "I am hearing it from other people, and I have seen it written in various newspapers. The truth is the government has no idea how many illegals are here." Is Trump right that there are 30 million or more illegal immigrants? We decided to see what the latest evidence shows. Counting illegal immigrants The U.S. Department of Homeland Security comes up with an estimate of the number of illegal immigrants each year, and its most recent estimate was 11.4 million unauthorized immigrants as of January 2012. That includes those who entered the United States illegally and those who overstayed their visas. According to the department’s estimates, the number of illegal immigrants peaked around 12 million in 2007 and has gradually declined to closer to 11 million. The Homeland Security figure is in the same ballpark as several independent organizations that study illegal immigration, including Pew Research Center (11.3 million); the Center for Migration Studies (11 million), which studies migration and promotes policies that safeguard the rights of migrants, and the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of legal immigration (11-12 million). All of them arrive at their figures by subtracting known legal immigrants from the total number of foreign-born people documented in the U.S. census and then controlling for the estimated percentage of unauthorized immigrants who refuse to answer the census. All of the researchers we interviewed found similar figures to the federal government and said that Trump’s claim was wildly inflated. "There are, to my knowledge, no credible, research-based estimates of 30 million," said Jeffrey Passel, an expert on Hispanic immigration at the Pew Research Center. "The 11-12 million range is broadly accepted by almost all researchers and immigration advocates (regardless of perspective)." Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, said that the total number of illegal immigrants has essentially held constant in recent years, because the number arriving has roughly balanced the number going home or getting legal status. Could the census be missing enough illegal immigrants in its counts that the estimate is actually in Trump’s range? The experts we talked with said no. "Even though the empirical estimates have a margin of error of maybe plus or minus a million, there is virtually no evidence that the real number could be even a few million higher than 11 million," said Robert Warren, a fellow at the Center for Migration Studies and a former demographer with the Census Bureau and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. Camarota said that the reason the 30 million figure is unlikely is that the census asks other questions that allow researchers to estimate how good the data is -- for example, the number of births to immigrant mothers, school enrollment and death records, which helps shore up the figure. In other words, if there were three times the generally accepted number of illegal immigrants in the United States, they would show up in those other categories. Marc Rosenblum of the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank that doesn’t take positions on immigration legislation, said that 30 million "is a totally absurd number." "There is NO published report by a serious research organization or academic that suggests anything in the range of 30 million," he said. So how did Trump come up with his inflated figure? We aren’t certain, since a campaign spokeswoman declined to comment. But we’ve heard others cite similar figures. In her book Adios America, conservative columnist Ann Coulter said there are 30 million illegal immigrants. Her starting point was a 2005 article from two Bear Stearns financial advisors, who looked at the rise in money sent back to Mexico and housing permits in three New Jersey communities. Coulter emphasized that "the assumption that illegal people will fill out a census form is the most ridiculous concept I have ever heard of." The Center for Immigration Studies disagrees with that last point. In a recent report, the center wrote, "It is well established that illegal aliens do respond to government surveys such as the decennial census and the Current Population Survey." Our ruling Trump said the number of illegal immigrants in the United States is "30 million, it could be 34 million." The Department of Homeland Security says the number of illegal immigrants was about 11.4 million as of January 2012. Other independent groups that research illegal immigration put the number between 11 and 12 million. We found no compelling evidence that the number could as high as Trump said. Trump has provided no proof that the number of illegal immigrants is triple the widespread consensus. We rate this claim Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b6c9e9d4-0fe9-4bf5-abbd-15a37945e468	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-07-28T14:18:13	2015-07-24	['United_States']
pomt-05672	Says David Rivera "received a $5,000 campaign contribution from Congressman Spencer Bachus, who is currently under House Ethics investigation for insider trading."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/mar/16/luis-garcia/david-rivera-took-5000-donation-spencer-bachus-inv/	Miami Beach state Rep. Luis Garcia says that U.S. Rep. David Rivera, R-Miami, took money from a peer accused of insider trading. "Last week, Congressman David Rivera allowed House Republican leaders to strip key provisions from the STOCK Act that would crack down on corruption of public officials and on those who peddle political inside information for profit. Rivera has received a $5,000 campaign contribution from Congressman Spencer Bachus, who is currently under House Ethics investigation for insider trading, and whose behavior is the target of the STOCK Act," said Garcia, a Democrat, in a Feb. 15 campaign press release. In a related report about whether Rivera "allowed" Republican leaders to soften the bill, we examined in detail the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, which passed the Senate and House in February. Although insider trading by members of Congress is already illegal, the STOCK Act is a response to newspaper reports and academic research that raise suspicions that politicians on Capitol Hill use their unique access to information to make lucrative trades. The bill is intended to make it crystal clear that members can’t inside trade, and it requires them to disclose their transactions within 30 to 45 days. In this item, we will explore whether Rivera received a $5,000 contribution from Bachus, who is under investigation for insider trading. For questions about the campaign donation, Rivera’s congressional office spokeswoman referred us to a generic email address for Rivera’s campaign, and we did not get a reply. We also tried to reach Rivera directly but were unsuccessful. First, some background about Rivera. A longtime state legislator, Rivera was elected to Congress in 2010 and now faces re-election in 2012. Rivera is the subject of a criminal probe by the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service related to $510,000 in undisclosed payments from a former dog track to a company owned by his mother. The press release noted that Rivera received a contribution in 2010 from Bachus’ Growth and Prosperity Political Action Committee. The PAC’s report filed with the Federal Election Commission showed that it gave to multiple congressional campaigns, including $5,000 to Rivera’s congressional campaign on May 13, 2010 (Rivera’s FEC report shows that he received the donation June 24, 2010.) The Center for Responsive Politics shows a summary of donations by Bachus’ Growth and Prosperity PAC -- it spent about $724,000, for the 2010 cycle. The contribution to Rivera’s campaign was not among the top recipients or vendors. In November 2011, 60 Minutes aired a report inspired by the book Throw Them All Out, by Peter Schweizer, which cast a spotlight on Bachus, R-Ala., and his trades during the 2008 financial crisis. "While Congressman Bachus was publicly trying to keep the economy from cratering, he was privately betting that it would, buying option funds that would go up in value if the market went down," the 60 Minutes report stated. "He would make a variety of trades and profited at a time when most Americans were losing their shirts." The Washington Post reported on Feb. 9, 2012, that the Office of Congressional Ethics had launched an investigation of Bachus, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, over possible violations of insider-trading laws. Bachus "has been a frequent trader on Capitol Hill, buying stock options while overseeing the nation’s banking and financial services industries," the Post stated, explaining that it was the first investigation of its kind of a member of Congress. The Post wrote that the OCE has found probable cause that insider-trading violations have occurred. The Post report was based on anonymous sources, which we cannot independently confirm or refute. However, we’ve seen nothing that refutes the Post’s key findings. And Bachus himself released a statement on the matter. "I welcome the opportunity to set the record straight," Bachus said in a statement. "I respect the congressional ethics process. I have fully abided by the rules governing members of Congress and look forward to the full exoneration this process will provide." Among the examples cited in the Post article: On Sept. 18, 2008, Bachus participated in a closed-door briefing with then-Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke. Paulson wrote in a book that they discussed the high likelihood of decline across the entire economy if drastic steps weren’t taken, but Bachus denied that he received any insider information. The next day Bachus made trades that earned him profits. "The Office of Congressional Ethics has requested information and I welcome this opportunity to present the facts and set the record straight," Bachus said in a statement quoted in the Post report. Bachus’ spokesman did not respond to PolitiFact Florida. Facing a primary challenge on March 13 (which Bachus won), Bachus defended himself in an ad in which he blamed "liberal Washington reporters" and "Obama’s Democratic allies" and claimed that "news reports are clear. The attacks are false." The ad shows a headline from The Hill which quoted a former federal judge and SEC head, tapped by Bachus to review the allegations, as saying that he is innocent. Two former SEC chairman also said in a guest editorial that the allegations are "laughable." "If Mr. Bachus attended a meeting in which the troubled state of the economy (and how to deal with it) was discussed, that hardly was a state secret at the time of the meeting. Moreover, immediately after the meeting, the organizers disclosed what had been discussed," stated the editorial. So Bachus’ PAC gave money to Rivera’s campaign in May 2010 for a race he won that year, and nearly three years later the Washington Post reported that Bachus was under investigation. Our ruling Garcia said that "Rivera has received a $5,000 campaign contribution from Congressman Spencer Bachus, who is currently under House Ethics investigation for insider trading." Technically, the donation came from Bachus’ PAC and not Bachus as an individual, but that isn’t a key difference in this case. More significantly, the donation was made in 2010, years before news broke about the recent investigation. We should also note that although Bachus has acknowledged providing information to the ethics office, their findings have not been made public. Obviously, we don’t know what its findings will be. But in a literal sense, Garcia’s claim about the donation is accurate. But it omits the additional information that the donation was made before Bachus was under investigation. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Luis Garcia	None	None	None	2012-03-16T14:25:28	2012-02-15	['None']

pomt-05129	Says New Jersey’s job growth in May represents "25 percent of all the jobs created in the country."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jun/24/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-new-jerseys-job-growth-may-r/	For those Democrats questioning whether to cut taxes, Gov. Chris Christie has a statistic to prove his "Jersey Comeback" is real: the Garden State in May created one out of every four net new jobs in the nation. Christie offered that statistic during a June 14 press conference as one of the "real facts" Democrats should address. "Fact is, it is time for a tax cut in this state," said Christie, according to a video posted June 15 on YouTube. "It is long overdue for a tax cut in this state, and I hope that today they stop with the make-believe and start addressing the real facts, which are that New Jersey is the single biggest job producer last month of any state in the country -- 25 percent of all the jobs created in the country right here." But PolitiFact New Jersey found that Christie was making an invalid comparison of federal labor statistics. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics announced June 1 that the nation had seen a net increase of 69,000 nonfarm jobs in May, accounting for both job gains and losses. State officials said June 14 that New Jersey saw an over-the-month increase in May of 17,600 nonfarm jobs. Both figures are preliminary and seasonally adjusted. Christie’s mistake was claiming that the 17,600 jobs in New Jersey were part of that 69,000 for the nation. The bureau separately develops two sets of employment estimates -- one for the nation as a whole and then estimates for each individual state. Compiling the state estimates does not necessarily equal the national total. For example, if you combine the job gains and losses for the 50 states and Washington, D.C., you reach a net increase of 98,400 nonfarm jobs in May -- not 69,000. So, since the two sets of estimates are done separately, it's wrong to compare the two. "As mentioned earlier, the CES national estimates are independently produced and are not an aggregation of statewide data," the bureau said, referring to the Current Employment Statistics program. "Therefore users cannot disaggregate or compare CES national economic movements to state, regional, or metropolitan area CES estimates." The most valid comparison would be to consider New Jersey’s 17,600 jobs as a share of the job gains across the country in May, according to Doug Hall, director of the Economic Analysis and Research Network at the Washington, DC-based Economic Policy Institute, a liberal think tank. In May, a total of 184,500 jobs were created in 27 states and Washington, D.C. Of that amount, New Jersey’s growth represents about 9.5 percent. Those statistics, which were released by the bureau the day after Christie’s press conference, also show that California and Ohio saw greater job gains in May than New Jersey. So, Christie’s wrong to say "New Jersey is the single biggest job producer last month of any state." Brian Murray, a spokesman with the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, argued that at the time of the governor’s statement, Christie only had "the net national gain of 69,000 jobs against which to compare the state numbers." "I understand your point that the comparison made is not recommended by the BLS," Murray said in an e-mail. "But I think you should consider that it was not until June 15, a day after the Governor made his remarks, that the public and Governor’s Office could have seen the full BLS numbers on national figures and other states like California." Christie may not have had the additional labor statistics, but that doesn’t change the fact that he made a flawed comparison with the publicly available figures at his disposal. Our ruling At his June 14 press conference, Christie claimed New Jersey’s over-the-month increase of 17,600 jobs in May represented "25 percent of all the jobs created in the country." The governor was comparing the state’s job growth to the national estimate of 69,000 net jobs created. But according to the bureau, state estimates and the national estimate are developed separately, making it wrong to compare the two. We rate the statement False.

pomt-12574	Says small businesses "make up 98.9 percent of all businesses in the state and employ nearly half of the state's private sector workforce" and "almost never receive a penny of government money."	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/apr/11/richard-corcoran/are-small-businesses-getting-gypped-incentives/	Florida House Speaker Richard Corcoran continued his scorched-earth campaign against taxpayer-backed business incentives, this time attacking Gov. Rick Scott for spending too much time defending Enterprise Florida and not enough time on issues that protect jobs. In an April 3 Tampa Bay Times column, Corcoran warned that not addressing the state's workers' compensation system and a property insurance issue known as "assignment of benefits" will put small and family-run businesses in jeopardy. Corcoran said that instead of working with the House on these issues, Scott has spent most of the 60-day legislative session fighting for an agency that doesn’t help small businesses. "(Enterprise Florida) subsidizes big companies with over 1,000 employees to compete against our small businesses, which make up 98.9 percent of all businesses in the state and employ nearly half of the state's private sector workforce and who almost never receive a penny of government money," Corcoran wrote. For this fact-check, we decided to focus on the statistics about small businesses in Florida and whether they "almost never" receive government money. Regardless of how you define them, small businesses make up a large chunk of all businesses in Florida. However, his point that small businesses "almost never" receive government money is at best an exaggeration. Small businesses not so small in Florida There is no standard definition for a small business. The difference between large and small firms can depend on how many people a firm employs, the amount of revenue the firm makes or the type of industry. No matter which way you slice the pie, small businesses in Florida comprise a significant chunk of all business in the Sunshine State. Florida is home to approximately 2.4 million businesses of all sizes. That figure includes large firms, small firms and nonemployer firms — a technical term to describe a business with no employees. Most nonemployers are self-employed individuals whose business may or may not be the main source of income, such as someone who earns money as a tutor. Nonemployers make up 81.5 percent of all businesses in the state. The latest snapshot comes from the federal government. The Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy considers a small business as any firm with fewer than 500 employees (including the nonemployers). Under that metric, the total number of small businesses is about 2.3 million. That comes out to 99.8 percent of all businesses, an even larger share than Corcoran’s figure. Corcoran got to his figure of 98.9 percent by excluding firms without a single employee. The figure came from a report that divided the number of firms with fewer than 500 employees (almost 420,000) with the total of firms with employees (424,550). See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com To throw out another measure that still proves the prevalence of small businesses, firms with fewer than 20 employees make up about 90 percent of all businesses in the state. Corcoran’s point about small businesses employing "nearly half" of the workforce is slightly above the actual figure. The latest number shows that small businesses (defined as fewer than 500 employees) employed 3.2 million people. That is about 42.8 percent of the workforce. Kwame Donaldson, a senior economist at Moody’s, said that compared to the national average, small businesses in Florida employ a smaller share of the workforce (43 percent in Florida vs. 48 percent nationwide). Are small businesses getting gypped? Corcoran said small businesses "almost never" get government money. Corcoran’s team pointed to a December 2016 review of Enterprise Florida’s economic development system by the Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability, a nonpartisan research arm of the Legislature. The analysis found that the majority of businesses incentives (51.9 percent) went to employers with more than 1,000 employees. The analysis pointed out that businesses with less than 50 employees received only 14.5 percent of economic incentives. "Although 96 percent of the state’s businesses employ fewer than 50 employees, most state-level economic development programs, particularly incentives, generally benefit large businesses," it reads. Here’s the breakdown: If we consider a small business as a firm between 1 and 499 employees, as Corcoran did for the other part of his point, then small businesses were awarded 38.3 percent of economic incentives. That’s not as much as the big firms got, but it’s not "almost nothing." Our ruling Corcoran said small businesses "make up 98.9 percent of all businesses in the state and employ nearly half of the state's private sector workforce" and "almost never receive a penny of government money." No matter the definition, small businesses in Florida make up the majority of all businesses in the state. Corcoran’s specific numbers are accurate if a small business is defined as any firm with fewer than 500 employees. However, by that 500-employee metric, it is not the case that small businesses "almost never" receive government money. While large firms get the majority of incentives, firms that employ between 1 to 499 people in Florida were awarded almost 40 percent of all incentive projects in past years. So while large firms receive the majority of economic incentives, it is imprecise to say there’s "almost nothing" left for the little guy. For a partially accurate claim that requires explanation, we rate it Half True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Richard Corcoran	None	None	None	2017-04-11T15:48:50	2017-04-03	['None']
pomt-07432	"We are the most generous in New England and New England is known for its generosity toward its welfare recipients."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/apr/24/colleen-conley/ri-tea-party-founder-says-rhode-island-most-genero/	In the ongoing debate over how and where to cut the state budget, social services -- particularly welfare -- are popular targets. After all, social service spending costs residents nearly $1.1 billion a year and makes up nearly 40 percent of the general revenue budget. So when Colleen Conley, founder and president of the Rhode Island Tea Party said on WHJJ's Helen Glover Show on April 13 that welfare recipients in Rhode Island are treated to the "most generous" benefits in New England, that caught our attention. Conley made the comment following an appearance by state Rep. Brian Newberry, a North Smithfield Republican, who said that the state's health and human services budget has increased by 73 percent since 2002. Conley moved to the welfare issue after criticizing Gov. Chafee's assertion that he wasn't hearing any viable alternatives to his proposal to raise taxes. "If he would sit down and meet with us we could give him 10 HUGE concrete ideas that could spread the difficulty, the pain, around a little bit," Conley commented. "But as Brian was saying, health and human services -- huge in this state. If we brought it in line with just the other New England states it would save millions and millions of dollars. That is just one component right there. We are the most generous in New England and New England is known for its generosity toward its welfare recipients." When we contacted Conley, she said her source was a study by the Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council. Do welfare recipients really have it that good in Rhode Island? We decided to check. The simple answer: When it comes to how folks commonly define welfare -- cash assistance to poor people -- they don’t. The RIPEC report, released in 2010 using data from 2008, doesn't have a state-by-state comparison of cash payments. Instead, it examines them by two different measures. And both show we’re far from the most generous in New England. First, to gauge how we compare with other states, it divided the amount spent on cash assistance by the Rhode Island population. The cash assistance program cost each resident, on average, $53. Rhode Island ranked fifth out of the six New England states. Only residents of New Hampshire spent less -- $44 per capita. Second, to compare how much Rhode Islanders could afford to pay, RIPEC divided the amount spent on cash assistance by the amount of personal income Rhode Island residents had that year. By that measure, the state spent $1.30 per $1,000 of personal income and Rhode Island ranked third in New England, behind Maine ($4.08 per $1,000) and Vermont ($2.63 per $1,000). And how do we compare in actual dollars paid to recipients? The RIPEC report didn’t have those figures, but the liberal Poverty Institute did. Rhode Island is fifth in New England, with payments of $554 per month for a family of three. Only Maine pays less - $485 per month. Rhode Island’s hasn't increased its welfare payments in more than 20 years, said Rachel Flum, a Poverty Institute policy analyst. Up to this point, Conley's "most generous in New England" assessment doesn’t hold up. When we questioned her, Conley directed us to the welfare "vendor payments" section of the RIPEC report, noting, as RIPEC did, that "per capita vendor payments almost tripled in Rhode Island, growing by 178.9 percent between FY 1998 and FY 2008." When we asked Conley what the payments were and how those payments might be cut back to bring us in line with everyone else, she said it's up to the state to look into that. "I'm not a policy wonk nor do I head a 501c3 think tank," she added. So what is a vendor payment? We went to RIPEC. "Those are not welfare recipients. Let's be very clear," said Ashley Denault, RIPEC's research director. They represent payments to doctors, nursing homes and organizations that charge the state for health- or mental health-related services for the poor. Vendor payments soak up a whopping 88 percent of public welfare expenditures, according to RIPEC's ranking. The state paid $1,785 per capita to vendors in 2008, more than any other state in the United States. Massachusetts ranked second at $1,667. "The rapid increase in vendor payments is not just a Rhode Island issue," she said. "It's the medical inflation rate, which has been very high over the last decade. You can't look at it and say Rhode Island is a welfare magnet, or we have tons of people on Medicaid." "It could be we could have more people who qualify for these programs. It could be wider eligibility. It could be we're not providing services in the most efficient manner. It could be how we set our reimbursement rate, which might be out of line with the rest of the country," Denault said. She said Chafee's budget includes proposals to try to bring these costs into line, including changes in nursing home reimbursements expected to save $6.1 million in the coming fiscal year and outpatient hospital reimbursements that could save $2.7 million. To sum up, Conley is right when she asserts that Rhode Island’s overall social services spending -- and particularly the amount paid to vendors for health services -- ranks high, both in New England and nationally. But when she said Rhode Island is the "most generous in New England . . . toward its welfare recipients," that invoked the image of single mothers receiving the biggest welfare checks in New England. That's simply not true, no matter how you measure it. She may not have intended to give that impression, but her words clearly conveyed that. So we’ll split the difference and give her a Half True.

pomt-01747	"This administration is slashing the Navy to pay for more Obamacare."	pants on fire!	/virginia/statements/2014/aug/03/ed-gillespie/ed-gillespie-says-white-house-cutting-navy-pay-oba/	The Navy is ailing, and Obamacare is to blame, says Ed Gillespie, the Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate. "This administration is slashing the Navy to pay for more Obamacare," he said during a recent debate with Democratic incumbent Mark Warner. "There’s no two ways about it when looking at their budget." It wasn’t the first time Gillespie has made this claim on the campaign trail in Virginia, home to the world’s largest Naval base. We decided to see if he’s right. The Navy Budget The final Navy allocation requested by George W. Bush’s administration, for fiscal 2009, was $149.3 billion. Congress appropriated $148.1 billion. Here are the amounts President Barack Obama has requested for the Navy: 2010 -- $156.4 billion 2011 -- $160.6 billion 2012 -- $161.4 billion 2013 -- $157.3 billion 2014 -- $155.8 billion 2015 -- $148 billion. And here are the amounts Congress appropriated for the Navy: 2010 -- $156.1 billion 2011 -- $156.1 billion 2012 -- $158.3 billion 2013 -- $161.6 billion 2014 -- $149.8 billion. You may notice that the first list goes one year into the future while the second list doesn’t. That’s because Obama has made his Navy budget request for 2015, but Congress hasn’t agreed on the appropriation. There are two important trends in these lists. First, over the course of Obama’s administration, a chart of his Navy budget requests would look like a hill, sloping up in the early years and then dropping below its starting point. A chart for the congressional allocations would have the same shape. The second trend is that in four of the first five years of the administration, Congress appropriated less Navy money than Obama requested. The trends stem from a partisan showdown over the federal debt in 2011 that resulted in an unhappy compromise. The fight arose over raising the nation’s debt limit so the government could continue to pay its obligations, something Congress had routinely done in the past. This time, however, Republicans insisted on spending cuts in return for raising the limit. Democrats initially refused. The standoff was broken that August by passage of the Budget Control Act of 2011, which eventually triggered $1.2 trillion in automatic budget cuts over 10 years -- called sequestration -- in exchange for raising the borrowing limit. Half the cuts will be made in domestic programs, which Democrats sought to protect, and half will come in defense spending -- including the Navy -- that Republicans wanted to shield. The cuts began to take effect on March 1, 2013. Is Obamacare tied to Navy cuts? The Navy and Obamacare -- also known as the Affordable Care Act -- are funded under different budget rules. The Navy falls under discretionary spending, which accounts for about 40 percent of all federal outlays. These are programs that receive annual appropriations subject to the whims of Congress and are affected by the sequester. Although defense consumes about half of the discretionary budget, other areas include education, agriculture and housing. Obamacare was set up to be self-supporting through a series of specially enacted taxes and long-term Medicare savings. It doesn’t rely on an annual appropriation. In other words, the ACA and the Navy are supported by two unconnected funding streams. So where does Gillespie find the link? His campaign sent us a variety of information but none of it tied the Navy cuts to Obamacare. We received: A 2013 blog entry by Adm. Jonathan Greenert, chief of Navy operations. He warned that the U.S. fleet could sink to about 255-260 ships in 2020 if sequestration continues. That’s a loss of about 30 ships, or about 10 percent. A 2013 news release from Rep. Randy Forbes, R-4th, announcing he had introduced a bill to remove the Department of Defense from the sequester. Two long-term budget outlooks published by nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office this year, noting there will be costs for expanding health insurance subsidies under Obamacare. The reports, however, did not address ACA revenues. "They looked completely at the spending side," said Josh Gordon, an analyst for the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan organization urging deficit reduction. For now, insurance provisions under Obamacare are costing less than expected. The CBO estimated in April that the expanded insurance under the act will cost $104 billion less than it originally projected over the next 10 years. Experts told us Gillespie’s linkage of Navy cuts to Obamacare is way off base. "I don’t see any connection between the defense budget and the Affordable Care Act," said Todd Harrison, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a think tank focused on defense policies. Winslow T. Wheeler, director of the Straus Military Reform Project for the Project on Government Oversight, called Gillespie’s comment "specious nonsense." Our ruling Gillespie says the Obama administration is "slashing the Navy to pay for more Obamacare." The claim is erroneous for two reasons. First, Congress is complicit in the Navy budget cuts. By failing to agree on a debt-reduction plan, it triggered a self-imposed regimen of automatic cuts to defense and domestic programs. Second, Obamacare is shielded from those reductions because it’s not subject to annual appropriations from Congress. The ACA is self-funded through a series of specially enacted taxes and health care efficiencies. Its fortunes are not tied to those of Navy. Gillespie, who has made this statement at least twice, sent us plenty of information, but none of it linked the Navy cuts to Obamacare. We agree with the military expert who called the claim "specious nonsense." But at PolitiFact, we call it Pants on Fire.	None	Ed Gillespie	None	None	None	2014-08-03T00:00:00	2014-07-26	['None']

pomt-11099	"The city that I was mayor of was 50 percent Latino, and I won with 90 percent of the vote..."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2018/jun/12/lou-barletta/hazleton-wasnt-half-latino-when-lou-barletta-was-r/	In an interview with Fox Business Network’s Stuart Varney on June 7, Republican Congressman and U.S. Senate candidate from Pennsylvania Lou Barletta claimed that he won re-election as mayor of Hazleton, a city in northeastern Pennsylvania with a large Latino population, while also serving as the driving force behind a heavily scrutinized crackdown on undocumented immigrants there. "The city that I was mayor of was 50 percent Latino, and I won with 90 percent of the vote, and I was standing up for legal immigrants. Legal — keyword — legal immigrants," Barletta asserted. Barletta was on the program to discuss, among other things, a federal court’s ruling against the Trump administration’s plan to penalize Philadelphia for its sanctuary city policy by docking its federal funding. Barletta, a Trump supporter, has been an outspoken critic of U.S. immigration policy, sanctuary cities and the Democratic Party’s approach to dealing with millions of immigrants who entered the country illegally. This includes the approach of his Democratic opponent for the U.S. Senate seat, longtime incumbent Bob Casey. But is Barletta’s claim that he won re-election by a landslide in a majority Latino city in the midst of a high-profile crackdown on undocumented immigrants accurate? See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com By the numbers There are a few things to consider with Barletta’s claim: First, did he win with 90 percent of the vote? Yes, if you round up slightly. According to archived Luzerne County elections records, Barletta won 89.05 percent of the vote when he was re-elected mayor of Hazleton in 2007. Barletta was the only major party candidate on the ballot and appeared as both the Republican nominee and the Democratic nominee after winning the Democratic nomination with a write-in campaign. Barletta first won election in 1999 with 65 percent of the vote and won re-election in 2003 with 68 percent of the vote, according to the Hazleton Standard-Speaker, which pulled results from their archives to provide to Politifact Pennsylvania. Second, was the city half Latino at the time? No. According to Census data, Hazleton’s Latino population grew from 1,132 or 4.84 percent of the city’s overall population in 2000 to 9,454 or 37.31 percent of the total population in 2010. In 2007, the last time Barletta was re-elected as mayor before being elected to U.S. Congress — and the only time he was re-elected mayor with anywhere near 90 percent of the vote — the city’s Latino population was under 37 percent. It’s unclear how many of those Latino residents were eligible or registered to vote, or how many of them did vote. According to a 2017 report in the Washington Post, the town never studied the number of undocumented immigrants living in Hazleton. Philly.com,in 2016, reported an unnamed "veteran police official" estimated 10 percent of the city’s Latino population was undocumented. And while Census data are not infallible as a gauge of demographic makeup, Barletta’s claim that Hazleton was 50 percent Latino at the time of his re-election is not supported by a more reliable source. Barletta spokesman David Jackson offered the following response: "Even if you think that legal immigrants only made up ‘nearly 40 percent’’ of the population of Hazleton in 2006, to garner 90 percent of the vote, many of them had to have supported his policies. This is anecdotal, but we're talking hard numbers here." There was also no empirical evidence provided by his campaign to support the implication that support for Barletta’s Illegal Immigration Relief Act, which threatened Hazleton landlords and employers with fines for housing or hiring undocumented immigrants, helped propel him to victory. "The fact that he won with such a high proportion of the vote at a time when the ordinance was so prominent in the news is evidence in and of itself that it was not received as negatively as it is being portrayed," Jackson added. "I don't think he made the statement that the ordinance was the driving factor in his re-election, but by any measurement, a 90 percent re-election win is a mandate to continue the policies an elected official had begun." Worth noting: the 89.05 percent of the vote Barletta received in winning re-election in 2007 represents just 89.05 percent of the votes cast, not 89.05 percent of the city’s population or 89.05 percent of overall registered voters. There were 3,964 total votes cast in the Hazleton mayor’s race in 2007 and 3,530 of those went to Barletta. Hazleton’s total population was roughly 21,000 at the time. Today, the city is more than 50 percent Latino and that number continued to grow even during the controversy over Barletta’s Illegal Immigration Relief Act. The ordinance drew a lawsuit before being struck down by a federal court. Our ruling Barletta’s claim that he won re-election with 90 percent of the vote in a majority Latino city while driving a crackdown on illegal immigration there misstates the size of Hazleton’s Latino population at the time and the timeline involved. Barletta was re-elected mayor of Hazleton with roughly 90 percent of the vote in 2007 but the city was not majority-Latino then. It is now. And while Barletta’s crackdown was certainly popular with some in the city at the time, and unpopular with others, it’s unclear what role it played in his 2007 victory. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Lou Barletta	None	None	None	2018-06-12T12:00:00	2018-06-07	['None']

pomt-13996	Says Merrick Garland "authored an opinion that resulted in the release of 17 Guantanamo Bay prisoners who were part of a group of violent Islamist extremists the State Department had designated as terrorists."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/jun/07/pat-toomey/pat-toomeys-beef-supreme-court-pick-merrick-garlan/	U.S. Senator Pat Toomey has doubts about Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland -- particularly regarding a ruling that set free prisoners from Guantánamo Bay. Garland "authored an opinion that resulted in the release of 17 Guantanamo Bay prisoners who were part of a group of violent Islamist extremists the State Department had designated as terrorists," Republican Toomey wrote in an April op-ed for PennLive titled, "Here's why I'm opposing Merrick Garland's Supreme Court nomination." Look closely: Toomey’s statement combines two court rulings, Garland’s and a later decision. The first, decided by a three-judge panel and indeed authored by Garland, ordered the release of one detainee, not 17. Uighurs in China Toomey is not referring to a typical Guantánamo case. The story begins with social unrest in China, and the status of the Uighurs. Uighurs (pronounced wee-gurs) are a Muslim ethnic minority primarily from the northwestern province of Xinjiang. After alleged discrimination and violent clashes, the 22 Uighurs fled China for the Afghan mountains, and fled again after airstrikes reached their settlement after 9/11. They were captured and sent to Gitmo in 2002. Many had been captured in Pakistan, close to the Afghan border, by bounty hunters who sold them to the United States for $5,000 each. Why would a Uighur militant be a part of Al Qaida? In the 2013 report "Terrorism in China," University of Virginia Professor Philip B.K. Potter traces it to "China’s ongoing security crackdown in Xinjiang [forcing] the most militant Uyghur separatists into volatile neighboring countries, such as Pakistan, where they are forging strategic alliances with, and even leading, jihadist factions affiliated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban." So, as the executive branch pushed for Guantánamo’s closure, the case of the Uighurs and their possible ties to terrorism took center stage. Five Uighurs were cleared and released in 2006, resettling in Albania. Seventeen remained in custody. Which brings us Garland and the 2008 opinion that Toomey is referencing. What made the government back down Really, the three-judge panel on which Garland sat only released one Uighur: Huzaifa Parhat. Parhat told the FBI, per court documents, that he left China to escape harsh discrimination. His people suffered "harassment, forced abortions for more than two children, high taxes, the taking away of land, and the banishing of educated people to remote areas," he said. He was one of the Uighurs who had basic gun training from the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (or ETIM; Turkistan is a name some Uighur independentists use for their homelands), learning how to take apart and clean guns. Much of the evidence that the government provided came from his own interviews. Parhat identified Hassan Maksum and Abdul Haq, as leaders at the camp; both men were ETIM fighters and Al Qaida members. In court, Parhat argued that just because some people in the camp were members of ETIM, it didn’t mean that the whole camp was. Garland, in his opinion, noted that the intelligence didn’t seem certain. "The documents repeatedly describe those activities and relationships as having ‘reportedly’ occurred, as being ‘said to’ or ‘reported to’ have happened, and as things that ‘may’ be true or are ‘suspected of’ having taken place," he wrote. "But in virtually every instance, the documents do not say who ‘reported’ or ‘said’ or ‘suspected’ those things." Further: "To be clear, we do not suggest that hearsay evidence is never reliable -- only that it must be presented in a form, or with sufficient additional information, that permits the Tribunal and court to assess its reliability." The three-judge panel unanimously found that the government didn’t have enough evidence to prove that Parhat was Taliban-affiliated or an enemy of the United States. The government conceded that it would not argue differently for the remaining detainees. The D.C. Federal District Court, Ricardo Urbina, ordered their release later that year. Urbina also ordered them transferred to the United States, but a federal circuit court panel later blocked this move. Federal law bans transferring Guantanamo detainees to American soil. Because the United States has a non-refoulement policy that prohibits sending refugees to countries where they would be in danger, the detainees could not be sent back to China. So these men were resettled in nations like Palau, Switzerland and Bermuda. The last Uighur detainees left Guantánamo for Slovakia as 2013 came to a close. What do experts think? It’s worth noting that the government pointed to other evidence against the Uighurs that remains classified. But Toomey isn’t basing his statement on classified documents. What’s unclassified is "ample" enough, according to his spokeswoman, to substantiate the claim. Out of the unclassified documents, the primary sources are the Uighurs themselves. Many of the Uighur 17 admitted that they received basic gun training, but none said they had Al Qaida ties. Many said they were fighting -- but for their independence, not in global jihad or with efforts to hurt Americans. In 2003, according to the Washington Post, the Pentagon had already considered five of the Uighurs innocent (the same five who were relocated to Albania three years later) and another 10 "low-risk," approving 15 for release. The report quotes a State Department official calling the Uighurs’ case "unfortunate." Some experts believe the Uighurs’ detainment was likely a mistake. Benjamin Wittes, a governance studies researcher at the Brookings Institution, told PBS NewsHour that he considered this a case of wrong place, wrong time. "These are actually not people who have a problem with the United States," said Wittes. "These are people who have a problem with the government of China and whose marriage of convenience with the Taliban is really just a convenience thing. It’s not part of any global jihad." While Thomas Joscelyn, senior editor at the Long War Journal, doesn’t believe the Uighur detainees were high-threat, he doesn’t see them as harmless and disagrees with Wittes. "It’s what we call the Forrest Gump story," he said. "Where they happened upon these places that are Al Qaida-affiliated by accident. ... It strains credulity that would accidentally find their way to the Tora Bora Mountains, a known Al Qaida stronghold, jihadist country at that time." Almerindo Eduardo Ojeda, director of the Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Americas, calls the detainees "mostly independentists that happened to be Muslims." Labeling them terrorists on "grounds that [the government] cannot reveal... is particularly insidious, as there is a definite interest in large areas of the government to inflate the claims. At an enormous cost to the detainees," he emailed. "For GTMO prisoners to be released," Ojeda asked, "They have to be cleared by all relevant intelligence agencies. What does Pat Toomey know that they don't?" Our ruling Toomey wrote that Garland "authored an opinion that resulted in the release of 17 Guantanamo Bay prisoners who were part of a group of violent Islamist extremists the State Department had designated as terrorists." Toomey’s claim is misleading. We have no definitive proof that the Uighur detainees engaged in terrorist acts or were "violent Islamist extremists." They were an oppressed ethnic minority in China and may have been caught up in events without endorsing terrorism. The courts released them because the government’s case against them seemed dubious. We rule the claim Mostly False.	None	Pat Toomey	None	None	None	2016-06-07T09:30:00	2016-04-15	['United_States_Department_of_State']
pomt-02960	Congress, criminals, Scientologists and other groups are exempt from Obamacare.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/24/facebook-posts/congress-criminals-scientologists-and-other-groups/	Internet memes are great for quickly spreading jokes and important information. And because they’re also efficient at sharing inflammatory falsehoods, they keep us busy here at PolitiFact. When a reader emailed us a graphic he came across on Facebook about which groups are exempt from Obamacare, our warning bells went off. Under the headline, "Where is your OPT OUT? Let’s get this straight, it doesn’t exist," a long list claims to show who is and is not exempt from the health care law, which requires everybody to have insurance beginning in 2014. Groups like Congress and the White House, criminals and Muslims are listed as exempt, according to the graphic. Catholics, Jews and "you" are not. At the end, the list emphasizes, "Christians In General NO Exemption." In addition to making the rounds on Facebook lately, we’ve found the graphic on several websites like Liberal Logic 101. It’s hard to tell when and where it originated. A few of the items on the list are actually accurate. A lot of it, though, is plain wrong. Let’s break this down piece by piece. Government officials PolitiFact is no stranger to the "Congress is exempt" claim. Ted Cruz and others have claimed lawmakers either have an exemption or are trying to get one. We’ve found no truth to that. Lawmakers and their staffs are actually singled out, forced off their employer-provided insurance and sent into the health care marketplaces. (In their case, their employer is the federal government.) Members of Congress and staff will receive their traditional employer contribution to put toward a plan from the marketplaces. It’s a special circumstance, but it’s not a pass by any means. They still need to get insurance like everyone else. Although the graphic only lists Democrats like Harry Reid and Nancy Pelosi, it’s important to note that all lawmakers have the same obligation to buy insurance, regardless of political affiliation. So Democratic and Republican lawmakers are treated alike under the law. President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden are a different story, said David Howard, an Emory University health policy professor. They’re eligible for many different health coverage options, and can choose go to the Bethesda Naval Hospital. Like everyone else, they would be fined if they didn’t have any health insurance. Criminals Incarcerated criminals are exempt from the penalty for not having insurance. That’s because it’s the prison’s responsibility to provide health care to its inmates. The Affordable Care Act specifically indicates that "incarcerated individuals excluded." The specific care prisoners receive varies by state, but generally speaking, prisoners get regular check-ups (typically not frequently) and emergency care. This technically isn’t considered insurance. American Indians American Indians are also exempt from the individual mandate, so members of federally recognized tribes will not be fined. They don’t have insurance, but they do get health care through the Indian Health Service, according to Leighton Ku, the director of George Washington University’s Center for Health Policy Research. They have a long-standing treaty with the federal government guaranteeing them health care. The Indian Health Service is a federal agency that provides care to American Indians and Alaska Natives. Although they won’t be fined for not enrolling in plans through the marketplace if they are eligible for IHS care, they can still choose to do so at any time. Religious groups The meme targets a whole host of religious groups. The Amish, Scientologists, Christian Scientists and Muslims are categorized as exempt, but Baptists, Catholics, Lutherans and Jews are not. But that’s not really accurate. The law doesn’t contain specific language about which denominations or religions would qualify for an exemption, but it does specify that individuals belonging to religious groups for exemptions if they have religious beliefs opposed to health insurance or medical treatment. These kinds of exemptions exist for other federal programs, and there are rules for determining who qualifies. Based on who has obtained exemptions from other federal programs like Medicare and Social Security, it looks like the Amish would qualify, as would Mennonites. The assertion that an exemption for Muslims is specified in the law is wrong -- Pants on Fire wrong. Scientologists typically have no objection to medical treatment for physical ailments. Our ruling This Internet meme rattles of a list of groups that are and are not exempt from the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act. Most of the claims are way off-base, but we found some facts buried among the falsehoods. Obama and Biden don’t need to buy insurance on the marketplaces, but they’re not exempt from fines if they don’t have coverage. Prisoners and American Indians are in fact exempt, but they still have health care of some sort. Members of small number of religious groups can receive exemptions if they have formal objections to medical care or health insurance, but we found no evidence that Muslims or Scientologists meet that criteria. Because most of the list is wrong, we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-05076	"Fireworks have never been safer, and their use continues to increase each year."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/jul/04/bill-weimer/fireworks-executive-says-theyve-never-been-safer-a/	Picking a favorite holiday is almost like picking a favorite child, but PolitiFact Ohio admits to particular fondness for the Fourth of July. We enjoy the invocations of history, especially when they're factually accurate. We like the annual cookout with old friends. And we love fireworks. So we were especially interested to read a newspaper commentary by Bill Weimer, vice president of Youngstown-based Phantom Fireworks, the nation’s largest retailer of consumer fireworks. "Fireworks have never been safer, and their use continues to increase each year," he wrote. "This alone provides a strong case for the regulated and sensible use of consumer fireworks." Really? Safer than ever? In 1994, Weimer said, the United States imported 117 million pounds of fireworks, and the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission reported 12,500 fireworks-related injuries. By 2010, fireworks imports grew more than 75 percent to 205.9 million pounds, but the number of fireworks-related injuries dropped by more than 30 percent to 8,600. "This is phenomenal progress in safety," Weimer wrote, calling on Ohio's General Assembly to relax state laws and legalize consumer fireworks. PolitiFact Ohio looked at the law and checked the numbers. Ohio law, which now permits the use of only "novelty and trick" fireworks, is among the more restrictive nationally. Three other states have similar laws, and four ban all consumer fireworks. Forty-one states and Washington, D.C., allow some or all types of consumer fireworks permitted by federal regulations, according to the American Pyrotechnics Association. We found that Weimer's numbers, as reported by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission and the American Pyrotechnics Association, a trade group, are accurate. The same day Weimer’s column was published, the federal Consumer Product Safety Commission, which set standards for consumer fireworks in 1976, issued its annual fireworks report last week. It confirmed the injury number Weimer used -- 8,600 for 2010. CPSC spokeswoman Nikki Fleming said the injury rate as measured by injuries per 100,000 persons has leveled off. The Massachusetts-based National Fire Protection Association takes the position that "using consumer fireworks is simply not worth the risk," division manager Guy Colonna said. "We don't seem to be trending that rapidly toward zero," he said of the injury numbers. "You haven't moved the needle so much in terms of saying it's safe for consumers to use." The NFPA -- which coordinates the national Alliance to Stop Consumer Fireworks -- said in its annual report in June that there are more fires on a typical July 4th than any other day of the year, and that fireworks account for 40 percent. Colonna acknowledged statistics showing that the rate of injury per 100,000 pounds of imported fireworks has declined, but said it is "still a significant number." The American Pyrotechnics Association, a trade group, cites the latter statistic. It shows that the rate of injuries dropped from 38 per 100,000 pounds of fireworks in 1976 to 7 in 2000 and to 4 per 100,000 pounds of fireworks in 2010. The trade group considers that significant because U.S. fireworks consumption has skyrocketed. It more than doubled between 2000, when the trade group says "the trend in relaxing (state) consumer fireworks laws was first initiated," and 2011, when 212 million pounds were sold. The trade group credits "safety education efforts and the ever improving quality of its products." It says that injuries and fires most typically result from illegal fireworks and from improper use, especially involving children. But does that mean that fireworks themselves are safer? We asked Weimer what he had to support his statement. He immediately credited the work of the CPSC and the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory. In the 1970s, the CPSC set federal requirements for consumer fireworks that cover cautionary labeling, the burn time of fuses, explosive powder content, stability for both ground-based and aerial devices and proper performance. In 1988, the CPSC started an inspection and enforcement program for Chinese-manufactured fireworks. China -- which now supplies 98 percent of the fireworks in the United States -- began exporting fireworks to this country in 1973. Initially, 75 percent of fireworks tested by the CPSC failed to comply with the regulations. "The quality truly wasn't very good," Weimer said. "The quality was inconsistent. The industry knew that if it didn't so something there would be big issues." Working with the CPSC, importers established the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory to set additional, stricter requirements for consumer fireworks. The AFSL went to factories in China, conducted seminars, worked with manufacturers and started a testing program in China in 1994. "The linchpin of the system is the testing," Weimer said. The testing is conducted by an independent laboratory hired from outside China by the AFSL. Each fireworks shipment is tested for compliance with 15 quality standards, Weimer said. If any standard is not met by any of the randomly selected cases, the entire case lot fails. In the program's first year, 1994, 36 percent of the random lots of tested fireworks were rejected. By 2002, that number was less than 10 percent. The compliance rate exceeded 90 percent. CPSC Chairman Inez Tenenbaum, speaking at a symposium in China last January, noted that the agency has been working for years with manufacturers and with China's General Administration of Quality Supervision, Inspection and Quarantine. "While AQSIQ and CPSC may work to improve product safety with somewhat different motivations, everyone benefits from the end result, which is improved product safety," she said, adding that "we have increased the frequency, scope, and depth of our training in China." Weimer thinks that the availability of regulated consumer fireworks diminishes the use of the "really lethal" illegal and homemade variety. So what's the grand finale? PolitiFact Ohio is not ruling on the advisability of maintaining, relaxing or tightening Ohio laws regulating fireworks. And we’re not taking a position on whether consumer use of fireworks is even a good idea. Weimer’s statement addressed legal and proper use of fireworks by consumers -- not use of homemade or illegal products. And fireworks are -- as Weimer told us -- a "product with risk associated with it." But, the statistical record shows that the rate of injury from fireworks declined nationally while their use increased dramatically, and while laws governing their consumer use loosened. There still are injuries, but the annual rate has plateaued even while consumption continues to grow. We found no stronger explanation than the concurrent regulatory and policing work of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the American Fireworks Standards Laboratory to make fireworks safer. Weimer’s claim is accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter it rates True.	None	Bill Weimer	None	None	None	2012-07-04T06:00:00	2012-06-26	['None']

pomt-04957	The new 21st State Senate district was "created in secret for Van Wanggaard. It was drawn within half a block of his house."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jul/26/john-lehman/lehman-senate-district-secret-wangaard-house/	Shortly after his June 5, 2012 recall election victory over incumbent Van Wanggaard was affirmed by a recount, state Sen. John Lehman (D-Racine) said it will be tough for him to win the seat again. Lehman told WTMJ radio listeners July 10, 2012, that the borders of 21st state Senate District were changed significantly by Republicans in 2011 when they controlled the Legislature. The redistricting is required every 10 years, based on updated census figures, and this was the first time in decades that one party in Wisconsin had complete control over the process. The seat is up in November 2014, and Wanggaard is expected to run. "I’m not surprised that he’ll run in the district," Lehman said. "The district was created in secret for Van Wanggaard. It was drawn within a half a block of his house, around his house two blocks away then went out to western Racine and western Kenosha County down to the Illinois line." Sounds like neither Lehman nor Wanggaard should unpack their boxes. If Lehman and Wanggard face each other in 2014 (or earlier, if there is another recall), it would be the third time the two have run against each other. Wanggaard topped Lehman to win the seat in 2010. But the next time a much different mix of voters would make the choice. On July 13, 2011, the Journal Sentinel’s Craig Gilbert took a detailed look at the differences between the new and old 21st Senate district. "The new plan goes to some extra lengths in reducing the potential for partisan competition," wrote Gilbert, author of the Wisconsin Voter blog. "The most striking example is the transformation of two very competitive districts, the 21st in Racine County and 22nd in Kenosha County, into one very Republican Racine-Kenosha seat to the west and one very Democratic Racine-Kenosha seat to the east. "Republicans who drew the lines have produced a plan that favors the GOP, which is certainly nothing new for political parties," the piece continued. "Among the state's most competitive districts, the plan gives GOP incumbents Terry Moulton, Joe Liebham and Pam Galloway safer seats and (Alberta) Darling, (Leah) Vukmir and Wanggaard dramatically safer seats." In an earlier piece, Gilbert wrote: "The Wanggaard seat would shed most of the city of Racine and some nearby areas -- wards that voted 63 percent Democratic in last fall's race for governor. (The one section of the city of Racine that's kept in the district is the one where Wanggaard lives.)" Gilbert calculated that the new 21st was far more Republican, based on the vote in the 2010 governor’s race. Gov. Scott Walker would have won the district by 23 points, rather than 9 points in the old 21st. Now the map’s borders. Wanggaard lives in the 1200 block of Blaine Ave. on the west side of Racine. The new border is 13th Ave., just south of his home. That portion of Racine -- Lehman calls it a "peninsula" -- lies within the new 21st district. (Indeed, Lehman’s house is on Orchard St., several blocks away from Wanggaard. His house, too, lies just inside the new district.) On the "in secret" question, GOP lawmakers were allowed to see advance copies of their proposed district maps at the law offices of Michael Best & Friedrich near the Capitol. The Republican lawmakers -- including Wanggaard -- signed confidentiality agreements in which they promised not to disclose the contents of the maps, according to a Feb. 6, 2012, Journal Sentinel article. Our rating Lehman says the new 21st State Senate district was "created in secret for Van Wanggaard. It was drawn within half a block of his house." It’s common, of course, for the party in control to draw maps favorable for itself -- and the lines in question here have been approved by the courts. While the points Lehman cites may sound outrageous, even unbelievable, the record shows them to be accurate. We rate the statement True.

pomt-05723	"The top 1 percent (of income earners) paid 36.7 percent (of the taxes). ... The top 50 percent pay 97.7 percent."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/mar/06/jim-renacci/jim-renacci-says-top-50-percent-pay-nearly-all-inc/	Whether it’s the so-called "99 percenters" occupying Wall Street, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett publicly suggesting that billionaires like himself should pay more taxes, or President Obama calling for tax hikes on households earning more than $250,000, the share of taxes borne by the nation’s wealthiest Americans remains a hot topic. Freshman GOP Rep. Jim Renacci - a self-made businessman who is among the wealthiest members of Congress - explored the subject with a group of constituents who attended a Town Hall meeting he hosted Feb. 13, 2012, in Medina. At the meeting, Renacci attempted to shoot down a "misconception on wage earners and income taxes paid," citing the percentage of the nation’s taxes paid in 2009 based on income levels. "The top 1 percent (of income earners) paid 36.7 percent (of the taxes). The top 5 percent paid 58.7 percent, and the top 10 percent paid 70.5 percent." Renacci continued as the figures were projected onto a screen: "The top 25 percent pay 87.3 percent of the taxes paid in this country. The top 50 percent pay 97.7 percent. So, it’s interesting when you hear the story that the wealthy need to pay more of their share." Trackers from a Democratic Super PAC called American Bridge recorded the meeting and sent some video highlights to reporters. The data Renacci presented to his constituents piqued PolitiFact Ohio’s curiosity, so we decided to learn more. Renacci cited Internal Revenue Service taxation data compiled by the Tax Foundation in Washington, an organization that calls itself non-partisan but is widely regarded as conservative. Its board of directors includes Douglas Holtz-Eakin, the top economic advisor to Republican John McCain’s presidential campaign in 2008, and former congressman William Archer, a Texas Republican who chaired the House Ways and Means Committee. We consulted the Tax Foundation report he used as well as articles on the same subject from sources such as Kiplinger.com, a personal finance website. The numbers were consistent between sources, identifying the top 1 percent of taxpayers as those with an adjusted gross income of at least $343,927. That group, roughly 1.4 million taxpayers, reported 16.9 percent of the nation’s income and paid 36.7 percent of the taxes in 2009. The top 5 percent, those with adjusted gross incomes of at least $154,643, earned 31.7 percent of the nation’s income and paid 58.7 percent of the taxes. Those in the top 10 percent made at least $112,124. They earned 43.2 percent of the nation’s income and paid 70.5 percent of the taxes. The income cutoff for the top 25 percent in 2009 was $66,193. Folks with that income or higher earned 65.8 percent of the nation’s income, and paid 87.3 percent of the taxes. To be in the top half of all taxpayers, one had to make $32,396. That group’s share of total earnings was 86.5 percent and its share of taxes was 97.7 percent. That means those in the bottom 50 percent of income earners accounted for 2.3 percent of taxes paid. Since Renacci publicly mused about whether the "top 10, 25 or 50" percent pay their share under the current system, we also decided to examine why the top half of the households pay such an overwhelming percentage. According to National Journal magazine, the Earned Income Tax Credit is a big reason why. The program allows working families making under $49,000 (with three children) or $41,000 (with one child) to get a refundable tax credit whose size depends on marital status and family size. The refunds, by design, can sometimes exceed what people pay in taxes, it says. Before 1986 tax reforms adopted under GOP President Ronald Reagan expanded the Earned Income Tax Credit, low-income Americans paid 0.02 percent of individual income taxes while the top one percent paid about 24.6 percent. The share of income taxes borne by the highest Americans rose to its current levels, while the share of income taxes paid by the poor dropped. Nearly two thirds of low-income taxpayers who don’t pay income taxes do pay payroll taxes, according to a report by the non-partisan Tax Policy Center. More than half of those who pay neither tax are elderly. More than one third are non-elderly with yearly incomes under $20,000. The statistics Renacci cited to his constituents were accurate. The top 1 percent of the nation’s taxpayers do pay 36.9 percent of its income taxes and the top half of earners do pay 97.7 percent of the nation’s income taxes. On the Truth-O-Meter, Renacci’s claim rates True.	None	Jim Renacci	None	None	None	2012-03-06T06:00:00	2012-02-13	['None']

pomt-07170	Says opponent Kathie Tovo "believes that Austin invests too much in the cops, firefighters and paramedics that protect our families and neighborhoods."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/jun/11/randi-shade/randi-shade-says-kathie-tovo-believes-austin-inves/	Randi Shade, the Austin City Council member in a June 18 runoff, says in a mailer sent voters after the May general election that her challenger, Kathie Tovo, "believes that Austin invests too much in the cops, firefighters and paramedics that protect our families and neighborhoods." In the mailer, Shade traces her characterization to Tovo’s answer on a questionnaire presented to candidates by the Austin Neighborhoods Council. Asked if the city's public safety contracts "put an undue burden on the city budget," Tovo replied: "Yes, Austin’s public safety budget makes up more than 65 percent of the general fund. The continuing growth of (the) public safety budget is limiting the ability of the city to deliver other services that are important to maintaining a high quality of life. Escalating public safety contracts are financially unsustainable and must be addressed for the long-term health of the city." We can’t divine what anyone believes. For this fact check, we looked into positions Tovo has taken in her campaign. Specifically, we wondered if her criticism of escalating public-safety contracts as "unsustainable" amounts to saying the city spends too much on its police officers, firefighters and the like. We asked Tovo’s campaign to elaborate and also reviewed news accounts on her position on public safety spending. On May 19, Austin’s KVUE-TV quoted Tovo saying: "I am very supportive of public safety, fire, and EMS." A May 20 Austin American-Statesman news story quoted Tovo saying she would look for ways to reduce waste in all city departments but would not cut the number of police, firefighters or paramedics. "If we can save money in other ways, we can have more (public safety employees) on the street," she said. And in an interview by the Austin Chronicle, posted online June 3, Tovo said she favors "safe and secure neighborhoods, and so a big part of that is making sure we have police and EMS and firefighters out on the streets. I certainly don't support making cuts to those." By email, Tovo spokesman Jim Wick said Tovo’s response to the questionnaire was "intended to address the growing gap in the (city’s) general fund between spending on public safety contracts and spending on everything else. With the way the public safety contracts are structured right now, the spending is unsustainable without either cutting spending or raising taxes," Wick said. Wick noted that City Council Member Bill Spelman was quoted in a Sept. 19, 2010, Austin Chronicle story saying that adjusted for inflation, per-resident public safety spending had increased nearly 50 percent since 2000, while spending from the general fund on every other part of the budget increased 2 percent. Spelman is also quoted saying: "We've taken all the new money we've gotten from property taxes, sales taxes, and what have you, and put it all into public safety. And none of it into parks, libraries, health and human services, development services, and so on." Wick said in an interview that Tovo’s questionnaire answer speaks to "the future, not the present" and "there is no place anywhere" that Tovo has said she’d cut public-safety jobs. Tovo says in a more recent campaign mailer: "I will not cut police, paramedics or firefighters." So, Tovo seeks to corral public-safety contracts, but would not cut police, paramedics or firefighter jobs. That’s like having it both ways. Then again, by basing her claim solely on Tovo’s questionnaire, Shade ignores her opponent’s subsequent comments. We rate Shade’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-14751	"The head of the FBI has told Congress they cannot vet those (Syrian) refugees."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/15/ted-cruz/ted-cruzs-claim-head-fbi-told-congress-they-cannot/	At the Las Vegas Republican primary debate, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, stressed the need to secure the border to keep out jihadists masquerading as refugees. "President Obama and Hillary Clinton are proposing bringing tens of thousands of Syrian refugees to this country when the head of the FBI has told Congress they cannot vet those refugees," he said Dec. 15, 2015, on CNN. Is it true that Obama’s own FBI director, James Comey, said national security and intelligence officials can’t screen Syrian refugees? The Cruz campaign forwarded us a report on Comey’s concerns over a bill put forward by Republicans that would toughen the refugee vetting process. The bill would require Comey — and other top national security officials — to personally certify every single refugee admitted into the United States was not a security threat. Comey, appearing before Congress on Dec. 9, said he couldn’t. "Could I certify to there being no risk associated with an individual?" he said. "The bureau doesn't take positions on legislation, and we don't get involved in policy decisions. But that practically would be impossible." But that’s not the same standard Cruz mentioned during the debate. For the record, the United States can vet the refugees through a process that involves the FBI as well as the State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense and other agencies. The vetting process can take up to two years, in which refugees undergo several rounds of security clearance checks. Comey has stressed, in testimony before several different congressional committees, that there are challenges (namely, information gaps) to how we screen the refugees, and that there’s no risk-free process. But, he said, we’ve gotten "dramatically" better at the task in the past few years. He never said that the federal agencies "cannot vet" refugees in as plain of terms as Cruz suggested. (Later in the debate, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie made a similar claim as Cruz about Comey’s remarks.) Appearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee on Oct. 8, Comey said, "There is risk associated with bringing anybody in from the outside, but especially from a conflict zone like that. From the intelligence community's perspective, as I said, I think we've developed an effective way to touch all of our databases and resources to figure out what we know about individuals. … I don't think that's a cumbersome process. My concern there is that there are certain gaps." Comey made similar comments before the House Homeland Security Committee on Oct. 21 and talked about the information gaps in more detail. "If someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home but we are not going to -- there will be nothing show up because we have no record on that person," he said, adding, "The good news is we are much better doing it than eight years ago. The bad news is, there is no risk-free process." A day later, on Oct. 22, Comey repeated his comments before the House Judiciary Committee: "We have gotten much better as an intelligence community at joining our efforts and checking our databases in a way that gives us high confidence. If we have a record on somebody, it will surface. That's the good news. … The challenge we face with Syria is that we don't have that rich set of data. So even though we've gotten better at querying what we have, we certainly will have less overall. And so as I said to a question earlier, someone only alerts as a result of our searches if we have some record on them. That's the challenge we face with Syria." Our ruling Cruz said, "The head of the FBI has told Congress they cannot vet those refugees." The Cruz campaign pointed to comments Comey made about how he cannot personally vet every refugee admitted to the United States (required by a House bill that seeks to toughen the admissions process). But the FBI director never said, as Cruz claims he did, that the government "cannot vet" refugees. Comey has said there are challenges and gaps to the process and that there are always risks to admitting people from conflict zones. But he also said the process is effective and has gotten more so in the past few years. We rate Cruz’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-12116	Says he "made St. Petersburg the state's best maintained large sewer system in 2007."	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/aug/18/rick-baker/was-st-petersburg-states-best-maintained-large-sew/	Former Mayor Rick Baker says his management of St. Petersburg’s sewage system was so good, it earned statewide recognition. Writing on Facebook, Baker plucked a city achievement from his two terms as proof of his management prowess compared with Mayor Rick Kriseman. Kriseman, Baker’s main opponent in the Aug. 29 primary election, has been hampered by the sewage crisis that developed after the city closed a plant. Baker linked to a Tampa Bay Times story about how fixing the sewage system to reduce spills may lead to higher utility bill payments at the start of the next year. "Who do you trust to fix this mess?" Baker asked in a July 28 Facebook post. "A man who caused the mess and is tens of millions of dollars over budget on the pier, police station and public relations staff? Or a mayor who made St. Petersburg the state's best maintained large sewer system in 2007?" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com St. Petersburg did nab its first Wastewater Collection System Award in 2007 under Baker. But Baker’s claim goes further to say St. Petersburg was the state’s best sewer system — which is not entirely true, because only utilities that applied were considered, and not every utility in the state applied. Further, Baker left out the backstory about why the city was pouring so many resources into the sewers at the time. In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Baker emphasized he has been more precise with his word choice in other instances touting this accomplishment, saying the city was "named" the best maintained large sewer system. Still, we wanted to take a look at this specific claim. St. Petersburg won an award, but the competition was not stiff The award came from the Florida Water Environment Association, a nonprofit group that recognizes utilities for significant accomplishments related to the operation and maintenance of wastewater collection systems among other things. Lane Longley, the division manager of St. Petersburg’s Wastewater Collection Division, submitted the city’s 2007 application. Longley said St. Petersburg started adopting maintenance strategies to prevent spills rather than wait for problems to happen on their own, and those steps reduced the number and magnitude of sanitary sewer overflows from 1999 to 2007. But the award doesn’t reflect a real contest among Florida cities. For one thing, not every city applies for the award. The city of Tampa stopped applying for the FWEA awards decades ago, saying it takes up too much time to gather the information and fill out the applications. A spokeswoman for the city of Orlando said the city has heard of the FWEA, but she couldn’t point to any specific awards the city had won or applied for. And a spokeswoman with the city of Jacksonville said the city was aware of the FWEA, but said it hasn’t won or applied for any awards. What’s more, these other cities could point to other awards. Tampa won a 15-year Directors Award from a different group in 2013 for treating water significantly above minimum standards at the David L. Tippin Water Treatment Facility. Orlando won recognition from the Water Environment Federation, an FWEA sister organization. Another major issue with Baker’s claim: St. Petersburg made a lot of the improvements because it was under Florida Department of Environmental Protection consent orders that required changes be made to the sewer system. One order started in 2000 and the other started in 2002. Both went on to cover Baker’s entire tenure. After massive spills in the late 1990s, St. Petersburg entered into its first consent order. A spokeswoman for the FDEP said it covered the city's four facilities for unauthorized discharges and included corrective actions pertaining to the collection system and the facilities to address the discharges. The second consent order covered violations and discharges only from the Albert Whitted Facility. In both cases, the state agency assessed civil penalties against the city, but decided to implement programs for environmental enhancement, education and restoration in lieu of payment. Baker acknowledged the city was ordered to improve, but said the improvements were significant nonetheless. "We invested everything that was recommended to me by either my staff or FDEP under the consent order to get the system to the point where we didn't have spills," Baker told the Tampa Bay Times on June 24. "It was absolutely a success, what we did." According to the Tampa Bay Times, the highest year of sewer spending under Baker was 2005, when the city spent $38.5 million in inflation-adjusted dollars. By the end of his second term, spending had dropped to less than $2 million a year. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Baker said he started by doing an analysis of the system to evaluate what needed to be done and to prioritize the repairs — and then developed a funding and operational plan. Along the way, the city charted its progress online. As an example, Baker’s campaign sent a graph showing that the city went beyond the requirements laid out in the consent order. The original goal was to rehabilitate 97,680 linear feet of pipe. By September 2008 a little under 160,000 linear feet of pipes had been rehabilitated, according to the city document. Still, the Baker years haven’t escaped criticism when it comes to sewers. Investigators have traced some of the blame for the city’s sewage woes to the city’s decision to close and not reopen the Albert Whitted treatment plant in 2015. That move was approved by the city council in 2011 and carried out under Kriseman. Taking the plant offline reduced capacity and led to the release of millions of gallons of sewage into the Tampa and Boca Ciega bays after major storms in 2015-16. But a draft report from the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission also places much of the blame for the sewage spills on the Kriseman administration, as well as on the past two decades of city leadership, which includes the Baker administration from 2001-10. The FWC report said the city's many sewage problems were not adequately repaired in the past. During Baker’s tenure, most of the projects recommended in the consent order focused on clearing pipelines and hydraulic improvement to increase flow velocities. Some changes related to inflow happened as a result of a consent order, but the report goes on to blame Baker’s administration and others for not doing enough to fix leaky pipes that contributed to the city's sewage problems. "Claims made by others that they thought the system was fixed and therefore did not need to worry about it were not based in fact," the report said. Our ruling Baker said he made St. Petersburg the state's best-maintained large sewer system in 2007. Baker’s evidence is that the Florida Water Environment Association gave St. Petersburg a Wastewater Collection System Award. But the award was hardly a comprehensive comparison of similarly situated cities in the state. Nor is it the only award that recognizes excellence in sewage management. St. Petersburg was under consent orders for Baker’s tenure that required the city to make improvements to the system. Outside investigators looking into the current sewage crisis have put some blame on Baker’s years for not addressing some problems with the system. This statement is partially accurate, but needs clarification of additional information. We rate it Half True. Tampa Bay Times senior researcher Caryn Baird contributed to this report.

pomt-10900	"Muslims in America have been subjected to more insults, attacks and hate crimes in the last two or three years than ever before, specifically more than after 9-11."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/aug/03/omar-rachid/US-Muslims-more-attacks-hate-crimes-than-ever-be/	A Texas member of a Muslim congregation said after a man was convicted of setting its mosque on fire that the United States isn’t what it used to be. Muslims can’t afford to lower their guards, Omar Rachid, a board member at the Victoria Islamic Center, told the San Antonio Express-News for a July 2018 news story stating that Marq Vincent Perez, just convicted of burning the mosque, faces up to 40 years in prison when he is sentenced in October 2018. Rachid then made a claim making us wonder: "The reality of it is that Muslims in America have been subjected to more insults, attacks and hate crimes in the last two or three years than ever before, specifically more than after 9/11," Rachid said, adding: "Islamophobia is thriving. This is not America. It is not the America I came to 35 years ago." We didn’t divine how to pin trends in insults. But, we found, the FBI and others tabulate anti-Muslim attacks and hate crimes. Have records recently been set? By phone, Rachid told us he based his declaration on accounts of upticks tied to FBI figures; he emailed us web links to news stories and a commentary published in 2017 and 2018. Included was a November 2017 Pew Research Center blog post citing FBI figures indicating 307 incidents of U.S. anti-Muslim hate crimes in 2016, which marked a 19 percent increase from 2015. Pew’s post specifies that a record was set in 2016 in the subcategory of anti-Muslim assaults, which rose significantly between 2015 and 2016, per the FBI, easily surpassing the previous peak reached in 2001, the year of the 9/11 attacks. For 2016, the FBI reported 127 reported Muslim victims of aggravated or simple assault, compared with 91 the year before and 93 in 2001, Pew's post says. SOURCE: Blog post, "Assaults against Muslims in U.S. surpass 2001 level," Fact Tank, Pew Research Center, Nov. 15, 2017 (accessed July 31, 2018) "But assaults are not the only form of hate crime carried out against Muslims and other religious groups," Pew’s post says. "The most common is intimidation, which is defined as reasonable fear of bodily harm. Anti-Muslim intimidation also increased in 2016, with 144 reported victims, compared with 120 the previous year." Pew cautioned, though, that the 2016 "intimidation" count was "dwarfed by the 296 victims of anti-Muslim intimidation in 2001" tallied by the FBI. A general caution: Pew and others that explore anti-Muslim activism stress that the FBI collects hate crime data from about 15,000 law enforcement agencies that voluntarily participate, which means the statistics likely undercount hate crimes. FBI reports on anti-Muslim incidents Next, we looked directly at the FBI’s annual reports on hate crimes, which the agency defines as "criminal offenses motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias against" a particular group such as a religion, race or sexual orientation. It looked to us like the greatest percentage spike in reported anti-Islamic incidents occurred between 2000 and 2001. For the latter year, the FBI tallied 481 anti-Islamic incidents--a count up more than 1,600 percent from 28 in 2000. According to the FBI, such incidents decreased by 68 percent to 155 the next year and then dipped to 149 in 2003 before escalating to 156 in 2004. We also reviewed the agency’s recent tallies, finding there was not a bigger-than-post-9/11 spike in incidents in recent years -- though the numbers have been on the rise. The 307 incidents noted for 2016 compare to 257 reported incidents in 2015, the FBI says, and that count was up 67 percent from 154 anti-Muslim incidents reported in 2014. Put another way, the 2016 tally reflected a two-year 99 percent increase. But that latest count still fell 36 percent shy of the agency’s 2001 count of 481 anti-Muslim incidents. A California researcher Rachid offered among the stories fueling his claim a July 2017 analysis of hate crimes against U.S. Muslims by Brian Levin, who directs the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino. Levin’s article, covering every year since 9/11, says that from 2002 to 2014, the FBI’s counts of anti-Muslim crimes receded to a range of 105 to 160 though the 257 tally for 2015 was the highest since 2001 and, the article says, the second-highest total of anti-Muslim hate crimes since the agency began eliciting reports of hate crimes from police agencies in 1992. Not only did anti-Muslim crime cases rise numerically, the article says, they grew as a percentage of all hate crimes, accounting in 2015 for 4.4 percent of all reported hate crimes even though Muslims are estimated to be only 1 percent of the population, the article says. By phone, Levin told us that in 2016, per FBI figures, anti-Muslim hate crimes accounted for 5 percent of all hate crimes. After 9/11, Levin told us, anti-Muslim hate crimes represented 4.5 percent of hate crimes reported by the agency. In 2016, Levin’s published calculations of hate crimes against Muslims were cited by Hillary Clinton to justify her claim that hate crimes against American Muslims and mosques had tripled after attacks in Paris and San Bernardino. Levin said in a 2016 interview that since 9/11, anti-Muslim incidents ranked second to anti-Jewish incidents among all anti-religious hate crimes. PolitiFact rated Clinton’s claim Mostly True. Civil rights reports by CAIR Hoping for more up-to-date information, we approached several non-government groups about research into anti-Muslim incidents. This tack drew data only from the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which says it challenges stereotypes of Islam and Muslims. Zainab Arain of CAIR pointed by email to the council’s latest annual civil rights report. The April 2018 report, based on investigations by council staff, says that in 2017, there were 2,599 U.S. anti-Muslim "bias incidents," including 300 hate crimes--a count exceeding the council’s confirmation of 2,213 incidents in 2016 by 17 percent. The report classifies incidents by type. Harassment, it says, accounted for 14 percent of the confirmed incidents in 2017 with incidents in which an individual was "inappropriately targeted and harassed by Customs and Border Protection" proving second-most prevalent. Anti-Muslim hate crimes, including crimes targeting children and families, made up 12 percent of the 2017 cases, the report says, with incidents involving FBI harassment or other targeting of individuals constituting 10 percent of incidents. SOURCE: Web page, "2018 Civil Rights Report: Bias Incident Data," Council on American-Islamic Relations, April 30, 2018 (fetched Aug. 1, 2018) Its counts, the report says, should be considered only a "snapshot of the experiences of American Muslims, including children, youth, and families. From experience, CAIR knows that bias incidents targeting the community are vastly underreported to both law enforcement and community institutions. Community members will often not report incidents, such as harassment and bullying, because of a certain level of desensitization," the report says. Arain told us: "Based on the numbers we report, we have documented more anti-Muslim bias incidents and anti-Muslim hate crimes from 2015 to present than were documented in the year immediately following September 11, 2001." We followed up by checking the council’s 2002 civil rights report. It says the group received 1,516 complaints from community members over the year involving the lives of more than 2,250 people, most of whom "were subjected to incidents of bias-motivated harassment and violence" including several murders, the report says. The report says its complaint count was up 300 percent from the year before. "Excluding the September 11 backlash incidents," the report says, "this year's normal reporting period contains 525 valid complaints, up from 366 in 2000/2001--a 43 percent increase." Our ruling Rachid said: "Muslims in America have been subjected to more insults, attacks and hate crimes in the last two or three years than ever before, specifically more than after 9-11." Incidents confirmed by the pro-Muslim CAIR support this statement. Also, FBI hate-crime statistics drawn from police departments indicate there were more anti-Muslim assaults in 2016 than after 9/11 though its counts generally indicate there were more anti-Muslim incidents after 9/11.

pomt-00028	On being on stage campaigning with the president	full flop	/punditfact/statements/2018/nov/06/sean-hannity/hannity-vows-not-appear-onstage-trump-rally-then-h/	On the eve of the midterm elections, Fox News host Sean Hannity promised he would not go onstage to campaign with President Donald Trump at a rally. Later that evening, he appeared to do exactly that. Both Hannity and Trump were in Cape Girardeau, Mo., where incumbent Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill is locked in a close race with Republican state Attorney General Josh Hawley. Trump was there to amp up the crowd for Hawley ahead of the vote. Earlier that day, Hannity said he would broadcast his nightly show from the rally venue, but pledged not to participate in the campaign event. "In spite of reports, I will be doing a live show from Cape Girardeau and interviewing President Trump before the rally," the Fox News host tweeted. "To be clear, I will not be on stage campaigning with the president. I am covering final rally for my show. Something I have done in every election in the past." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Yet minutes into Trump’s remarks, the president praised Hannity and called him onstage. "I have a few people, and they’re right out here, and they’re very special, they’ve done an incredible job for us," Trump told the crowd. "They’ve been with us from the beginning also. I’m going to start by saying, Sean Hannity, come on up." Hannity took the stage and embraced Trump. Then the Fox News host approached the podium and wagged his finger at the media, which included reporters with Fox News. "By the way, all those people in the back are fake news," he said to applause, invoking one of Trump’s favorite epithets. Hannity told the crowd he was unaware Trump would call him onstage. He then delivered an inventory of Trump’s accomplishments, took a veiled swipe at former President Barack Obama, then left the stage. "The one thing that has made and defined your presidency more than anything else," Hannity said, "promises made, promises kept." To any reasonable observer, it looked like Hannity was onstage campaigning with the president — in direct contradiction to his statement hours earlier. Fox News did not respond to a request for comment. Hannity and Trump have had each other's ears since the 2016 election, when Hannity openly supported Trump’s presidential bid, provided political counseling to the candidate, and even appeared in a pro-Trump ad ahead of the vote. "I’m not hiding the fact that I want Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States." Hannity told the New York Times in August 2016, adding, "I never claimed to be a journalist." (In a subsequent interview with Times, Hannity described himself as an "advocacy journalist.") Fox News draws a distinction between its opinion and news sides of the house. But the relationship between Fox News opinion programming and the Trump White House has raised ethical questions about whether the channel is reporting the news or promoting the president’s agenda. Hannity, whose evening show attracts more than 3 million viewers, is the network’s most popular opinionator, and his program is typically the most-watched cable news talk show. The day after the rally, Fox News issued the following statement: "Fox News does not condone any talent participating in campaign events. We have an extraordinary team of journalists helming our coverage tonight and we are extremely proud of their work. This was an unfortunate distraction and has been addressed." The network also pointed to a tweet from Sean Hannity about the incident, that said he was surprised to be called onstage and that his earlier tweet was truthful. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com In any case, Hannity did in fact appear onstage to campaign with Trump at a rally, directly contradicting himself. Our conclusion Hannity promised he would not go onstage to campaign with Trump at a rally. Hours later, he did exactly that. We rate this a Full Flop. Update: This story was updated soon after its initial publication to include a statement from Fox News and a tweet from Sean Hannity.

pomt-01033	"In Iraq and Syria, American leadership, including our military power, is stopping (the Islamic State’s) advance."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/27/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-america-stopping-islamic-states-/	President Barack Obama briefly updated Americans on the state of the Islamic State during his State of the Union address. "In Iraq and Syria, American leadership, including our military power, is stopping (the Islamic State’s) advance," Obama said. "Instead of getting dragged into another ground war in the Middle East, we are leading a broad coalition, including Arab nations, to degrade and ultimately destroy this terrorist group." The comment came during a string of examples of his administration engaging the Middle East — militarily and diplomatically — without the need for large-scale troops. But is his claim that U.S. airstrikes have improved the situation in Syria and Iraq, where the Islamic State wreaked havoc last summer, accurate? We decided to take a look. Iraq vs. Syria There are two elements we will look at: Whether the situation has improved in the two countries, and whether it’s the result of U.S. intervention. First, what’s going on in Iraq and Syria? There’s general agreement among experts that the Islamic State’s movement in Iraq has been halted and, in some cases, reversed since Aug. 8, when the first airstrikes launched. For example, their march toward Baghdad has stopped short of the city, and they’ve been pushed out of the Mosul Dam, a critical victory for the United States in the early days of its military intervention. However, Syria is a different story. The key to Obama’s language is he said the U.S. "is stopping." That suggests an ongoing process that’s not complete. And in Syria, it isn’t. "It’s fluid," Defense Department spokesman Carl Woog told PolitiFact. "It is possible that (the Islamic State) has taken certain areas of the map in Syria (since airstrikes began). I think that is plausible and likely in some cases, but it’s not the case everywhere. This is a large area." There are disputes over how much area Syria has won, if any, since the airstrikes began. A map published by the Wall Street Journal shows considerable gains by the Islamic State compared to another map of their movements from Aug. 31. However, the airstrikes on Syria did not begin until Sept. 24, so it’s possible that ground was gained before U.S. intervention there, and the source is partially credited to the Coalition for a Democratic Syria, an organization of Syrian rebel forces that have called for more U.S. action. Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a Middle East expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracy, said based on his own analysis of the Islamic State’s movements, any gains in Syria have been offset by losses in other regions. For example, the United States has heavily bombed the city of Kobani, a Kurdish stronghold in northern Syria near the Turkish border. In fact, according to an analysis of Pentagon daily briefings by longtime Middle East reporter Robin Wright, 78 percent of all U.S. airstrikes in Syria have come on Kobani. Despite repeated efforts by the Islamic State to overtake the city, the United States through the air and Kurdish fighters on the ground have beaten back those attempts. Reports from Jan. 26, after Obama’s speech, indicate Kurdish fighters have pushed the Islamic State almost entirely out of Kobani. In some ways it makes sense that Syria is a murkier situation. For one, U.S. airstrikes there started a month and a half after the first American bombs dropped in Iraq. The U.S. military has openly admitted it has an "Iraq first" strategy, aimed at eliminating the Islamic State in Iraq, while shaping their movements in Syria and training vetted moderate forces there. Iraq is also more familiar territory for the United States, after a decade of fighting there. And it has a government that is cooperating with the United States and supplying forces to fight. The same cannot be said for Syria, which is embroiled in a civil war between President Bashar al-Assad (Obama has called for him to step down) and rebel groups. Additionally, while the Islamic State may be partially halted in Syria, other extremist groups in the region have "gone on a rampage," Gartenstein-Ross said. The bottom line, said Wright, now a joint fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace and the Woodrow Wilson International Center, is "we’ve contained (the Islamic State) in terms of stopping their sweep. They’re paying an enormous price and their supply lines have clearly been disrupted. But four and a half months in, (the Islamic State) is still there and has taken over huge chunks of both Iraq and Syria. "So (Obama’s characterization) is partly true and partly not true," she added. "But this was never gonna happen overnight." With or without the U.S. How much credit should the United States get for stopping the Islamic State? Experts said U.S. intervention has been key. It has disrupted supply lines, directly killed many fighters, and delivered supplies to Kurdish forces. The terrorist group’s strong march relied on acting as a conventional military force, using humvees and artillery to move across the region. The constant threat of airstrikes has forced them to change strategies. The Islamic State’s stall is also a result of many other influences in the region, many of which have come from the ground while the United States remains entirely airborne. In Syria, for example, as the United States has focused on Kobani, Assad’s forces have prevented the Islamic State from taking over the major metropolitan hub of Aleppo. So while Obama has backed Assad’s ouster, the dictator’s ability to prevent further movement by the Islamic State has been hugely important in Syria. Meanwhile, in Iraq, Iran’s support for Shiite Islamic militia groups fighting against the Islamic State, which practices the Sunni branch of Islam, has stopped their spread into southern Iraq, said Rick Brennan, a Middle East expert at the RAND Institute. Much of the Islamic State’s campaign has involved winning over converts, by force or otherwise, in predominantly Sunni regions, Brennan added, so they were naturally going to have trouble spreading when they tried to push into areas controlled by other populations. "ISIS made progress when they went through Sunni-controlled areas, but when they went to Shi’a and Kurdish areas, they slowed," Brennan said. "So there are natural demographics at play here as well." Our ruling Obama said, "In Iraq and Syria, American leadership, including our military power, is stopping (the Islamic State’s) advance." Obama’s language is carefully worded not to oversell the United States’ progress or the Islamic State’s lackthereof. And U.S. airstrikes have had a qualitative, if not quantifiable, impact on slowing the group’s swift spread compared with the situation last summer. However, Obama’s statement implies the United States is winning its war against the Islamic State, and that is not at all clear. While the terrorist group has stalled in Iraq, its movements in Syria are much more fluid. Things look improved today, but the situation can change quickly. Additionally, other countries in the region, including those outside our alliances, have played a role in fighting the Islamic State. Obama's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2015-01-27T14:49:42	2015-01-20	['United_States', 'Iraq', 'Syria']
pomt-08839	"Bill McCollum voted for higher taxes and fees 42 times while he was in Congress."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/aug/10/rick-scott/adding-bill-mccollums-42-votes-raise-taxes-and-fee/	Without a record of votes to haunt him, Republican gubernatorial frontrunner Rick Scott has been free to attack primary opponent Bill McCollum for his 20 years in Congress. Scott's latest charge is a whopper -- that McCollum voted 42 times to raise taxes and fees. The accusation came up during the candidates' second and final debate on Aug. 5, 2010, and plays off a new Scott television ad called "Omelette." The ad starts with an egg breaking on the ground with a narrator saying that "Once, could be a mistake." Then a few more eggs fall to the ground. "Two or three times? Bad luck," the narrator says. Then the eggs really start pouring. "But 42 times? "Bill McCollum voted for higher taxes and fees 42 times while he was in Congress," the narrator says in the 30-second ad, which is airing statewide. "Yet now McCollum claims he won't increase taxes as governor. If you believe McCollum won't raise your taxes, the yolk's on you." The ad is no doubt effective, particularly in a Republican primary. But is it an accurate depiction of McCollum's two decades spent representing an Orlando-area community in Washington? PolitiFact Florida wanted to find out. Scott's evidence Scott's campaign referred PolitiFact Florida to a campaign-created website, www.factsforflorida.com, to review McCollum's Congressional record. The supporting evidence is difficult to digest, mainly because it's a simply a string of bill numbers, roll call votes and Internet links. Think we're lying? Here's one paragraph: Congressman Bill McCollum Voted To Raise Employment Taxes, Tobacco Taxes, Gas And Energy Taxes, Airport Taxes, Telephone Taxes, Taxes On Business, And Medicare And Social Security Taxes. (H.R. 4961, Roll Call Vote #303: Adopted 226-207: R 103-89; D 123-118, 8/19/82, McCollum Voted Yea; H.R. 1646, Roll Call Vote #282: Passed 398-5: R 157-4; D 241-1, 8/1/83, McCollum Voted Yea; H.R. 3575, Roll Call Vote #396: Passed 396-30: D 260-4; R 135-26; I 1-0, 11/14/91, McCollum Voted Yea, http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1991/roll396.xml; H.R. 2005, Roll Call Vote #408: Adopted 386-27: R 147-26; D 239-1, 10/8/86, McCollum Voted Yea; H.R. 6211, Roll Call Vote #488: Adopted 180-87: R 73-46; D 107-41, 12/21/82, McCollum Voted Yea; H.R. 3128, Roll Call Vote #60: Motion Agreed To (Thus Cleared For The President) 230-154: R 146-21; D 84-133, 3/20/86, McCollum Voted Yea; H.R. 1900, Roll Call Vote #43: Adopted 243-102: R 80-48; D 163-54, 3/24/83, McCollu m Voted Yea; H.R. 2470, Roll Call Vote #164: Adopted 328-72: R 98-63; D 230-9, 6/2/88, McCollum Voted Yea) The Scott campaign provided us a better summary of the votes to help us sort through the madness. The campaign says McCollum voted at least 27 times between 1981 and 2001 for legislation that included higher taxes, and at least 15 times for legislation that included higher fees. We then took the bill numbers and checked Thomas, a website through the Library of Congress. That site provides summaries of the legislation and also records how members voted. We also relied on descriptions of the legislation provided by the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. Scott is right that McCollum voted for legislation that increased taxes. Most notably, McCollum voted for the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, which undid some tax cuts passed a year earlier. The bill increased excise taxes, airport and airway trust fund taxes, cigarette excise taxes, and a telephone excise tax. The bill also increased employment taxes, according to the Tax Policy Center. The bill passed the House 226-207, with Republicans supporting the tax increases 103-89 and Democrats voting 123-118 in favor. Florida's four Republicans in the U.S. House (McCollum, C.W. Bill Young, Louis Bafalis and Clay Shaw) all supported the tax increases. McCollum, in the debate, called it a vote he regrets. "The only time that I voted for a tax increase when I was in Congress was Ronald Reagan's economic plan," McCollum said. "And I voted for that, and that's the one vote I regret that I ever took. I always said that after I did it." McCollum's support of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982 is a notable example of a tax increase McCollum supported, but it also highlights a problem with Scott's accounting methods. The vote on the one bill constitutes three of the 42 votes Scott is referencing in his ad because the bill included increases in employment (1), aviation (2) and tobacco (3) taxes. Double and triple counting is common in Scott's list of votes. According to the Scott campaign, four of McCollum's 42 votes to increase taxes and fees come in 1997 with the passage of a bill that's called -- ironically -- the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. In two separate roll call votes, McCollum voted in favor of raising the cigarette tax. And in two other votes, McCollum voted to support an aviation tax. Scott accurately accounts for those tax increases, though double-counting them is somewhat disingenuous. But more alarming is what he fails to mention: Namely that the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997 actually cut taxes by $240 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The legislation introduced a $500 per child per year tax credit, created an education tax credit, reduced the rates for the capital gains and estate taxes, and repealed the alternative minimum tax for small businesses. The bill passed the U.S. House, 389-43, with only one Republican voting "No." PolitiFact Florida noted at least four other instances where a vote was counted more than once to reach Scott's 42-vote claim. Scott also counts tax extensions as tax increases -- the 1997 tax cut package included an extension of air transportation excise taxes. And a 1991 vote that Scott said was for a tax increase actually extended "taxes on heavy trucks and trailers sold at retail." That's not the same thing as voting 42 times for higher taxes and fees, which is what Scott says in his ad. What Scott leaves out Scott's ad also neglects McCollum's record of supporting tax cuts in Congress. McCollum voted for Ronald Reagan's first tax cut package, the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981. The legislation reduced marginal tax rates 23 percent over three years, reduced the maximum rate to 50 percent and reduced the maximum capital gains rate to 20 percent. In 1986, he also supported tax reform legislation to simplify the U.S. tax code. The bill was designed to be revenue neutral but actually provided overall tax relief, according to the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office. (By the way, this is listed as a tax increase vote by Scott's campaign). Bruce Bartlett, a columnist for Forbes.com and the one-time executive director of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, published a good macro look at tax policy during Reagan's presidency. Using Office of Management and Budget data, Bartlett found that between 1981 and 1988 Congress approved $275 billion in tax cuts and about $133 billion in tax increases. The tax cuts are almost entirely contained in the 1981 and 1986 legislation McCollum supported. Even if McCollum supported every tax increase, he was still a net tax-cutter. McCollum also supported the major tax cut package in the 1990s, the Taxpayer Relief Act of 1997. Our ruling We should note that we didn't track back every single vote Scott cites. We asked the McCollum campaign if there were any votes they thought were misrepresented or that Scott had gotten wrong and did not hear back. PolitiFact Florida's review suggests Scott has been able to locate 42 taxes or fees that were either raised, or had their shelf-life extended, because of votes McCollum took while in Congress. But that only tells part of the story. Several of the votes are double counted, meaning that while 42 taxes may have been extended or raised, McCollum didn't vote 42 times for increases. Moreover, the Scott ad overlooks McCollum's votes to cut taxes, and specifically tries to label a $240 billion tax cut McCollum supported as a tax increase -- four different times. At best, Scott is cherry picking the votes to help make his case that "Bill McCollum voted for higher taxes and fees 42 times." But he's also brazenly trying to label a tax cut as a tax increase, and double and triple counting some votes. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06220	Says 25 percent of Oregonians oppose the death penalty.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2011/dec/06/joshua-marquis/oregon-district-attorney-puts-opposition-capital-p/	Death penalty politics are back in vogue after Gov. John Kitzhaber’s recent decision to suspend capital punishment for the remainder of his term. Carla Axtman a contributor to the Democratic blog Blue Oregon got into the discussion over the governor’s executive move by posting a short news excerpt and some quick encouragement: "Well done, Gov." Naturally, this set off a pretty long debate that pulled in, among others, Clatsop County District Attorney Josh Marquis, a longtime supporter of the death penalty. In one of his responses on the blog, he told opponents that they "were in a minority of about 25 percent." That caught our attention. Could it be that only a quarter of Americans oppose the death penalty? Our first stop was Gallup, the polling organization, which has recorded the national appetite for capital punishment for more than seven decades. Gallup’s most recent survey, conducted October 2011, asked respondents whether they were "in favor of the death penalty for a person convicted of murder." The response was 61 percent in favor, 35 percent opposed and 4 percent without an opinion. Generally, the data that Gallup has on hand shows a growing discomfort nationally with the death penalty. In the mid-1960s, opposition eclipsed those in favor, but it soon began to fall until the mid-’90s when opposition hit an all-time low of 16 percent. Since then, the tide has turned again, and opposition has been on a slow climb. Of course, it’s still clear the majority of those polled favor capital punishment in some cases. One other poll from late September 2011, this one done by CNN, showed that 50 percent of respondents favored life in prison as a penalty for murder, while 48 percent favored the death penalty. We called Marquis to see whether he had any evidence to back up his claim. He had a lot to say. First, he clarified that he wasn’t talking nationally, he was referring to Oregon specifically when he made that 25 percent comment. As for his evidence, he said that back in 2002, there was a group that was considering mounting a campaign to abolish the death penalty in Oregon. But, he said, they backed off after polls showed just 20 to 25 percent opposed. We pointed out that Gallup showed similar numbers 10 years ago, but since then the number opposed has changed. Marquis was unconvinced. He said the poll’s question made the issue appear too black and white. He also felt that the national poll wasn’t representative of Oregon. "Most importantly what about OREGON? You say that the numbers I cited from 2002 are too old but unless someone has documented numbers from OREGON, not nationally, where 15 states do NOT have capital punishment, I don't see how the comparison can be made," he wrote in one of several follow-up e-mails. In subsequent e-mails, he pointed us to polls in California (where 68 percent supported the death penalty), and Connecticut (where 67 were in support). He then cited a national Angus Reid poll conducted in October that showed support at 70 percent and opposition at 20 percent. Finally he presented us with this argument: "The last ‘poll’ of any significance was the 1984 vote in Oregon which was 75% in favor." There, he is referring to the year in which Oregonians put capital punishment back on the books after abolishing it decades earlier. Oregonians voted on two related measures in 1984. One exempted the death penalty from the part of the Oregon Constitution that bars cruel and unusual punishment. That measure passed with 55 percent in favor. The second granted a separate sentencing hearing before the trial jury to those convicted of aggravated murder and gave juries the power to sentence convicts to death. That was the vote that passed with 75 percent of the vote. Still, those votes were taken nearly 17 years ago before DNA evidence in several states cleared a number of convicts on death row and doubts about eyewitness testimony were widely publicized. In addition, officials in some states have flip-fopped, citing the public cost of protracted death penalty appeals. We talked to Stuart Elway, an independent pollster up in Seattle who works regionally. First we asked him what he thought about the Gallup poll and whether Marquis’ criticism seemed fair. He said it’s possible that the question, if asked differently, could elicit a slightly changed result -- but only a couple points in either direction. "In a question where public opinion is pretty settled the wording makes less difference than when asking about some tax policy that (a respondent has) never heard about before." He did, however, agree with Marquis that it wasn’t necessarily fair to tie the national polls to Oregon. Attitudes differ regionally and could certain affect the results by 5 to 10 points. Still, Elway said, the fact that Oregon was trending with the nation in 2002, probably indicates that the trend Gallup has found over the past few decades is somewhat present in Oregon as well. All that said, the facts are these: There is no recent Oregon-specific polling regarding the death penalty and national polls tend to vary pretty wildly, depending on how the question is asked. Marquis is basing his statement on numbers from at least a decade ago. The Gallup and CNN polls seem to indicated that the national mood is changing. How true this is for Oregon, we can’t say, but neither can Marquis. With PolitiFact, the burden of proof is always on the speaker. Marquis’ statement might have the smallest grain of truth, but it ignores some important details. We give his statement that death penalty opponents are "in a minority of about 25 percent" a Half True. Tell us what you think by visiting Oregonlive and leaving a comment.

pomt-07009	Says that when President Bill Clinton raised the top tax rates to levels now proposed by Obama, the country experienced significant job growth.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/07/barack-obama/obama-claims-job-rate-soared-after-clinton-raised-/	While many Republicans have warned that President Barack Obama's plan to raise taxes on wealthy Americans would hurt the fragile economy, Obama fired back in a Twitter town hall on July 6, 2011, that he's only proposing to return the top tax rate to the level it was raised to under President Bill Clinton, when job growth subsequently soared. Said Obama: "If wealthy individuals are willing to simply go back to the rates that existed back in the 1990s when rich people were doing very well -- it’s not like they were poor -- and by the way, that’s when we saw the highest job growth rates, and that’s when we saw the highest -- the greatest reduction in poverty, and that’s when we saw businesses very profitable -- if the wealthiest among us -- and I include myself in this category -- are willing to give up a little bit more, then we can solve this problem. It does not take a lot. "And I just have to say, when people say, job-killing tax increases, that’s what Obama is proposing, we’re not going to -- you’re entitled to your own opinions, but not your own facts. And the facts are that a modest increase for wealthy individuals is not shown to have an adverse impact on job growth. "I mean, we can test the two theories. You had what happened during the ‘90s -- right? Taxes for wealthy individuals were somewhat higher, businesses boomed, the economy boomed, great job growth. And then the 2000s, when taxes were cut on wealthy individuals, jobs didn’t grow as fast, businesses didn’t grow as fast. I mean, it’s not like we haven’t tried what these other folks are pitching. It didn’t work. And we should go with what works." First, let's look at the history of the top tax rates at issue here. Clinton raised the top marginal rate from 31 percent to 39.6 percent with the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1993 (previously, President George H.W. Bush had raised the top tax rate from 28 percent to 31 percent in 1990). At the time, Clinton said, "The deficit has increased so much beyond my earlier estimates and beyond even the worst official government estimates of last year. We just have to face the fact that to make the changes our country needs, more Americans must contribute today so that all Americans can do better tomorrow." Sound familiar? President George W. Bush later lowered the top marginal rate to 39.1 percent in 2001 and 38.6 percent in 2002 by the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001. And then he lowered the top rate again, to 35 percent, with the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. The Bush tax cuts -- extended in a compromise deal in December -- are set to expire at the end of 2011 unless Congress seeks to extend them or make them permanent. Obama proposes to let the Bush tax cuts expire for people making over $250,000 a year. In other words, Obama would like to return the top marginal tax rate to the 39.6 percent it was under Clinton. As for Obama's claim that in the years after the Clinton tax increase, job rates soared, the numbers back him up. Employment rates grew a healthy clip through the mid 1990s after Clinton's tax hike, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. And it's also true that jobs didn't grow as quickly after the Bush tax cuts were enacted. So tax hikes equal job growth? "The 1990s were very good, but not because of higher tax rates," said Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute. In an April 18, 2010, blog post, Mitchell argued that "while Bush had a better record (than Clinton) on taxes, he had a much worse record on spending." Other economists say the trend at least shows raising taxes on the wealthy isn't going to cause the economy to tank. "I don't think Obama was claiming that the higher tax rates in the '90s led to the boom, just that they did not prevent it," said Dean Baker, a liberal economist and co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research. "Similarly, the tax cuts of the Bush years did not lead to strong growth. Most of the evidence shows that tax increases with a given level of deficits will have a modestly negative impact on the economy." Higher tax rates in the top brackets does create some disincentive effect, Baker said, and some people work less, "but it is not a very big deal in the scheme of things." "The idea that going back to something like Clinton era tax rates would be a disaster is nonsense," Baker said. Said Gus Faucher, director of macroeconomics with Moody's economy.com: "I think he (Obama) is making the point that higher tax rates, at least at the levels under President Clinton, are compatible with strong economic growth, and the evidence is clear on that." "You can argue that one reason we had strong growth in the 1990s is that Bush I and Clinton reduced the deficit (cut spending and raised taxes), bringing down budget deficits," Faucher said. "This, in turn, lowered long-term borrowing costs and made more capital available to the private sector. The strong growth then helped bring down the deficit further, and eventually we got surpluses. I think the fiscal discipline of Bush I and Clinton was a reason for the strong growth in the 1990s." J.D. Foster, an economist with the right-leaning Heritage Foundation, scoffed at the suggestion that higher tax rates might be responsible for higher job growth rates and a booming economy. "The most you could even hope to say is that the Clinton tax hikes didn't do much damage," Foster said. "The economy was poised for a dramatic boom in 1993, and instead we got muddle and negative real wage growth," Foster said, drawing from arguments he made in a March 4, 2008, post on the Heritage website about this very topic. "The Clinton boom? It started not in 1993, but in 1997, which not coincidentally coincided with Republicans taking firmer control of the budget, welfare reform, and especially the capital gains tax rate reduction. Did these policies cause the boom? I argue they contributed to a propitious moment. But at least the case is plausible, whereas to ignore history and argue that the tax hikes somehow led to a boom that began four years later is simply laughable." Foster argued that while the Clinton tax hikes didn't trigger job losses in the 1990s, tax increases could now. "The real difference between 1993 and 2011 is that the circumstances of 1993 suggested a recovery well underway that was on course for rapid expansion, an expansion that was dulled by the tax hikes," Foster said. "We had just come out of a very mild domestic recession, inflation was low, energy prices were low, peace reigned as democracy bloomed and a confluence of new technologies were about to transform the world economy. "2011? We're still struggling out of a finance-centered deep global recession, the recovery is weak and retarded by a series of economic policy gaffes by this administration, global political tensions are high, oil prices are high, Europe is in the grips of a massive sovereign debt crisis of their own making. Do you really think the consequences of a tax hike today would be the same as in 1993? Not hardly." Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, doesn't dispute Obama's facts. But he questions what it proves. "It does not prove that tax increases cause growth and tax cuts retard it," Toder said. "Lots of other stuff was happening in both decades, and simple correlations don’t prove causation. It is even possible that growth in the 1990s would have been stronger without the tax increases and weaker in the 2000s without the tax cuts. It is true, however, that the Clinton tax increases did not prevent an economic boom from occurring, whatever their incremental effect may have been. And the Bush tax cuts did not forestall a decade of relatively weak performance, even if one is willing to argue that things would have been worse without them." So where does this leave us? It is true that when Clinton raised the top marginal tax rate to 39.6 percent -- the same level Obama would like to return it to now -- the U.S. saw strong job growth in the ensuing years. But to the extent Obama is suggesting a cause and effect relationship between those two events -- and we think he certainly leaves that impression when he says we "should go with what works" -- that is dubious, according to the cross-section of economists we spoke to. There were many other economic factors that played a larger role in job growth, they said. However, most agree that the tax increases did not appear to hinder job growth, and that's significant given the dire warnings some Republicans have issued about Obama's plan to return the top tax rate to Clinton levels. Perhaps, as Foster argues, the situation is different enough now -- more precarious -- that a tax hike would have a more damaging effect. That's a matter for economists to debate. When Obama says we saw job growth in the 1990s even as Clinton raised taxes, he's right. But to the extent that he's suggesting raising taxes created job growth -- as he appears to be when he says "we should go with what works," he goes too far. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-11137	"One in six Texans don’t have health care. We’re the most uninsured state in the U.S."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/may/31/lupe-valdez/lupe-valdez-1-6-Texans-lack-health-care-uninsured-/	Lupe Valdez, the former Dallas County sheriff nominated for governor by Texas Democrats, says health care will get much-needed attention once she’s in charge. Valdez was quoted in a May 23, 2018, New York Times news story saying: "One in six Texans don’t have health care. We’re the most uninsured state in the U.S." It’s an exaggeration, we’d suggest, to say that all uninsured individuals don’t have any health care. As we concluded in a 2010 fact-check, many avenues exist to make care available--including paying out of pocket and going to hospital emergency rooms. Still, many people don't get the care they need. A slightly different 1-in-6 statement appears on Valdez’s campaign website: "1 in 6 Texans lack health insurance," Valdez says on the "Health Care" portion of the site. She goes on: "The truth is, we’re already paying for universal healthcare, we are just doing it in the most expensive and inefficient (way) possible." Valdez, calling Republican Gov. Greg Abbott foolish for rejecting the option of expanding Medicaid in Texas as permitted by the Obamacare law, further says that as governor she’ll push to reverse his decision. We’ve found validity to other claims that Texas has the greatest share of residents who lack health insurance. After Valdez spoke, we decided to look again at how Texas ranks. Census Bureau estimates Valdez’s campaign didn’t respond to our email asking for her backup. But to our inquiry about the latest available data, Paul Fronstin of the Washington, D.C.-based Employee Benefit Research Institute, who previously advised us on the number of uninsured residents by state, pointed by email to a September 2017 Census Bureau report estimating that in 2016, Texas still had the nation’s greatest share of residents without health insurance, 16.6 percent--or 1 in 6 people. The Texas rate, the report says, was down from 17.1 percent the year before and 22.2 percent in 2013, according to information collected in the American Community Survey. In 2016, the report says, Alaska ranked second nationally with 14 percent of residents lacking coverage and Oklahoma was third with a 13.8 percent uninsured rate. Also answering our query by email, the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Chris Lee shared its calculations indicating that in 2016, Texas led other states with 15 percent of residents lacking health insurance, per research connected to the bureau’s Current Population Survey. According to the foundation, states ranking second and third in residents lacking coverage were Alaska (14 percent) and Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, Utah (12 percent each). Lee guided us next to a Kaiser chart showing that Texas in 2016 also had the nation’s greatest share of uninsured residents younger than 65 (when residents qualify for Medicare). The Texas uninsured rate of 17 percent outpaced No. 2 Alaska’s rate, 15 percent, a foundation chart says. Gallup survey results We spotted a more recent nongovernmental estimate. In May 2018, Gallup said that surveys the polling company took in 2017 asked respondents: "Do you have health insurance coverage?" For the 10th straight year, Gallup said, Texas had the nation’s highest rate of uninsured residents, 22.5 percent, which was still an improvement from the uninsured rate Gallup gauged for Texas in 2013, 27 percent. In 2017, Gallup gauged, Massachusetts residents had the nation’s lowest uninsured rate in 2017, 4 percent. SOURCE: Press release, Gallup, "Uninsured Rate Rises in 17 States in 2017," May 9, 2018 Our ruling Valdez said: "One in six Texans don’t have health care. We’re the most uninsured state in the U.S." One in six Texans in 2016 lacked health insurance, according to government surveys, and the state remained No. 1 for its share of residents without coverage. It’s an exaggeration to say that all uninsured people have no health care. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-01553	Says Gina Raimondo's "venture capital firm secured a secret no-bid contract funded by taxpayers."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/sep/14/angel-taveras/taxpayers-paid-secret-no-bid-contract-benefited-gi/	A TV commercial that ran before the Sept. 9 primary showed two well-dressed men carrying briefcases, approaching each other. They meet in the shadows of a stairwell to shake hands. The implication: they don't want anyone to see what they're doing. The word "SECRET" appears in large green letters, followed by the words "No-bid Contract." A narrator talks about General Treasurer Gina Raimondo, then one of four Democrats running in a primary for governor, a race she ultimately won. "Her venture capital firm secured a secret no-bid contract funded by taxpayers," the narrator says The commercial was for Providence Mayor Angel Taveras, one of Raimondo’s opponents. It didn't say what the contract was about, but it sure sounded shady. Even though the primary is over, we decided to examine the commercial’s claim because the issues it raises may well come up again as Raimondo runs against Cranston Mayor Allan Fung, who won the Republican gubernatorial primary. The commercial cites a March 1, 2014 story in The Providence Journal that explored the terms of a 2006 investment that Providence made in a venture capital investment firm, Point Judith Capital. Raimondo co-founded the company. In March 2006, four years before Raimondo would enter politics, a board chaired by then-Mayor David Cicilline voted to invest $1 million in retirement money with Point Judith. The investment would last 10 years; the city initially invested $100,000. Under the terms of the deal, if the investment made money by 2016, Point Judith would get 20 percent of the profit and it would refund the management fees Providence would be paying to Point Judith -- as much as $200,000 during the duration of the deal. By Dec. 31, 2013, the city had invested $907,211 and Point Judith had deducted $159,690 in fees, but the value of the investment had grown to $1.466 million. What makes this a "secret" deal? Venture capital firms, which provide early financing for innovative companies in hopes of getting big payoffs down the road, are tight-lipped about how they invest their money and demand secrecy from those who invest in them. The Journal spent months trying to get details about the city's Point Judith investment, which included debate between Point Judith and the city over what to release. In April, more than a month after The Journal reported on the general terms of the deal and eight years after it was approved, Providence released a copy of its agreement with Point Judith to the newspaper, with several portions -- including dollar amounts, investment periods, interest rates and other key elements -- redacted. So key elements Providence's contract with Point Judith remain secret. But when it comes to other aspects of the deal, the image of two shadowy businessmen cutting an illicit deal in a stairwell is ridiculously wrong. The vote to invest money with Point Judith was approved unanimously on March 23, 2006, during a regular meeting of the city's Board of Investment Commissioners. The public session was in a third floor conference room in City Hall. A transcript of the meeting, during which Raimondo made a presentation and members weighed the pros and cons of the deal, is available online. The investment was recommended by the fund's investment counselor. One reason the city went with Point Judith: at the time, the company was the only venture capital firm based in Rhode Island. "We did not say the contract was entered into secretly," said Dawn Bergantino, spokeswoman for Taveras’ gubernatorial campaign. "We are saying the contract itself is secret. We were talking specifically about the non-disclosure aspect of the contract. When the agreement was signed, the position of Point Judith was that the information is not for public disclosure. The Mayor has fought Point Judith to subsequently make the contract public." "If the specifics of the contract are hidden from public view, and if on being asked to release the contract the requests are refused – the contract is secret," she said. And was this a no-bid contract? The short answer: yes. But that's not unusual on the state or local level. Investments are often done without bidding because they are based on the recommendation of a fund's investment adviser. "For the most part, most do not go out for bid" unless an investment board doesn't have a financial consultant, said Howard Pohl of The Bogdahn Group. He is a well-known consultant to many public pension plans. Spokespeople for Taveras insisted that most investments were done through requests for proposals. We asked to see copies of past RFPs. Providence's consultant, Wainwright Investment Counsel, said it didn't have any available. We also asked three of the four people who voted on the Point Judith investment about whether bidding was standard practice. Cicilline, now a U.S. Congressman, said through spokesman Andrew Gernt that individual investments did not go out for bid. Myrth York, who was a member of the investment commission at the time and is supporting Raimondo's bid for governor, said the same thing. "Someone would come in and say they had something, and we would either be interested in it or not, and part of it would depend on how it fit in with the overall portfolio. It's wasn't like you opened three bids and picked one," she said. Stephen T. Napolitano, also a former commission member, said: "We relied on our consultant to make recommendations and provide us with people in the field to come in and do interviews. Based on that, we made a decision to hire them. . . . In terms of putting it out to bid, I don't think it was ever done back then. I don't think that's the normal procedure." Our ruling Angel Taveras said Gina Raimondo's "venture capital firm secured a secret no-bid contract funded by taxpayers," citing a newspaper story that deals with the terms of Point Judith's deal with Providence. Some elements of the deal remain secret. But the ad’s clear implication that the contract was approved in secret is wrong. It wasn’t. It was voted on in an open session. To call it a no-bid contract is technically correct, but that phrase suggests something improper. The reality is that many such investment decisions never go out for bid because the investments have been vetted by a financial consultant. Because the statement in Taveras' commercial contained some element of truth but ignored critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-13331	Mike Madigan made a fortune on tax appeals… Saving his friends millions... It’s an inside game played by people like Merry Marwig, Madigan’s hand-picked candidate. When Marwig thought her property taxes were too high she got them lowered at your expense. Saved so much she did it again. Marwig and Madigan: Profiting from the same corrupt system.	mostly false	/illinois/statements/2016/oct/05/citizens-michael-mcauliffe-and-house-republican-or/attack-marwigs-property-taxes-misses-mark/	Illinois’ 20th House district is considered one of the most important in-state races to watch come Election Day in the battle for seats between Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan and GOP Gov. Bruce Rauner. The district, which includes parts of Chicago’s Northwest side and nearby suburbs,features Republican state Rep. MichaelMcAuliffe defending his seat from first-time candidate Democrat Merry Marwig. McAuliffe’s defense includes a new television ad that calls Marwig corrupt and ties her to Madigan because she has successfully appealed her property tax bills. The ad, titled "Inside Game," is a 30-second spot running in the Chicago area and was produced by Citizens for Michael McAuliffe and the Illinois House Republican Organization. Here’s the transcript: "Mike Madigan made a fortune on tax appeals. Representing the powerful and politically connected. Saving his friends millions. Forcing you to pay more. It’s an inside game played by people like Merry Marwig, Madigan’s hand-picked candidate. When Marwig thought her property taxes were too high she got them lowered at your expense. Saved so much she did it again. Marwig and Madigan: Profiting from the same corrupt system." It got us wondering: Did Marwig get her property taxes lowered? Did Madigan have anything to do with it? Is it corrupt to get your property taxes lowered? We took a look to find out. Madigan’s law firm and tax appeals The opening line of the advertisement says: "Mike Madigan made a fortune on tax appeals. Representing the powerful and politically connected. Saving his friends millions." Madigan’s personal law firm, Madigan & Getzendanner, has made quite a bit of money from property tax appeals. According to the Chicago Tribune, Madigan & Getzendanner represented 45 of the 150 most valuable Chicago downtown buildings in 2008. The Tribune also found "Madigan's firm won enough appeals to cut more than $183 million from the taxable value of the top high-rises it represented" in 2006. A 2013 Chicago Magazine article also backs this claim, citing a Sun-Timesarticle that says over the course of a decade Madigan & Getzendanner made nearly $14 million for suburban Cook County landowners. Madigan and Marwig Where the ad gets murky is when it starts linking Marwig to Madigan. The advertisement says Madigan "saved his friends millions, forcing you to pay more." It also says Marwig is Madigan’s "hand-picked candidate." The ad lays out these ideas in an order that implies Madigan’s firm represented Marwig during her property value reassessment. However, Marwig and her husband were not represented by an attorney and filled out the forms themselves. Marwig’s property taxes Next, the ad claims Marwig had her property taxes "lowered at your expense. Saved so much she did it again." Marwig once unsuccessfully appealed to the Cook County Assessor to have her property value lowered in 2015. However, she successfully appealed to the Cook County Board of Review twice. It resulted in getting her property taxes lowered by about $400 in her 2013 appeal and then about $700 in her 2015 appeal. Marwig believes there is a double standard for McAuliffe to criticize her practices. In an emailed statement to Reboot Illinois she said: "For Mike McAuliffe -- a 20-year politician who has personally benefited from a property tax appeal -- to attack my family for going through the legal process of correcting a government error in an unfair tax bill is another sad example of what’s wrong with the politics and hypocrisy that local residents are so fed up with." Note: McAuliffe did benefit from getting his property taxes lowered when his condominium association appealed its property value in 2012. However, McAuliffe did not file the claim himself. And when the advertisement says Marwig got her property taxes "lowered at your expense," it’s technically correct. But Chicago-based property appeals lawyer Gary H. Smith believes the ad implies Marwig is stealing, which is not actually the case. "It’s got elements of the truth," Smith said. "When someone gets their property assessment lowered, it has to be made up by everyone else." But is it corrupt? The ad ends by saying, "Marwig and Madigan: Profiting from the same corrupt system." Not at all, Smith says. Anyone, regardless of whether they are regular citizen or a political candidate, can appeal a property tax bill if they believe it is inaccurate. According to the most recent available data from the Cook County Board of Review website, citizens filed appeals for nearly 403,000 parcels in 2013. The Board of Review approved a reduction for 63 percent of them. Smith said the ad’s message is misleading and paints the practice of property value reassessment as ugly. "It’s horrible we live in a society that a system that’s meant to improve our lives might be perceived as a detriment based on a person’s political status," Smith said. Our ruling In their advertisement, Citizens for Michael McAuliffe and the House Republican Organization say, "Mike Madigan made a fortune on tax appeals. Representing the powerful and politically connected.… When (Merry) Marwig thought her property taxes were too high she got them lowered at your expense... Marwig and Madigan: Profiting from the same corrupt system." Merry Marwig did, in fact, get her property taxes lowered twice and it did raise other people’s taxes. But the ad’s tone and inferences are misleading to viewers. It makes it seem like Madigan’s firm was connected to Marwig’s property value reassessment. Madigan’s firm never represented Marwig. In fact, Marwig never used an attorney during her property tax appeals. The ad also calls the practice of appealing one’s property taxes corrupt. While there is evidence Madigan has been a highly successful property tax appeal lawyer whose clients win breaks more than many others, any citizen within the geographic boundary can file an appeal to the Cook County Assessor's Office or Cook County Board of Review. The process becomes public record. While some people may think Madigan succeeds more than average citizens, there’s no evidence the system as a whole is corrupt. We rate this claim as Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fa7dab3e-6788-47a1-a2d6-b1a64c11ecc8	None	Citizens for Michael McAuliffe and House Republican Organization	None	None	None	2016-10-05T09:36:55	2016-09-14	['Michael_Madigan']
pomt-01549	Says NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell interviewed domestic abuse victim Janay Rice with Ray Rice present and for "every domestic violence agency, every law enforcement agency, that’s a no-no."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/14/mike-wise/did-nfl-commissioner-roger-goodell-interview-janay/	The Sunday news shows broke from their usual coverage of Washington’s inner-workings to examine another institution fraught with controversy: the National Football League. The heat is on NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for his discipline of former Baltimore Ravens running back Ray Rice, who was shown in a video leaked last week punching out his now-wife Janay Rice in an Atlantic City, N.J., casino elevator in February. The video’s release prompted more voices to question Rice’s initial two-game suspension as too lenient, including Goodell, who announced Rice’s indefinite suspension amid fallout from the video. To some sports pundits and victim advocates, that’s not nearly enough to prove Goodell is for real about punishing players accused of domestic violence. Washington Post sports columnist Mike Wise said Goodell should lose his job on CNN’s State of the Union. "The thing that bothered me most is Roger Goodell at one point tried to play essentially a marriage counselor with the victim and the perpetrator, Janay and Ray Rice," Wise said. "He put the victim and the perpetrator together. Every domestic violence agency, every law enforcement agency, that’s a no-no." Wise continued: "She is sitting, telling her story in front of the person who essentially abused her. And it’s the tone deafness of those types of things that show me that this commissioner does not take domestic violence seriously enough." PunditFact wondered if Wise is right: Did Goodell talk to victim Janay Rice with Ray Rice present? And does that violate the policy of domestic violence advocacy organizations and law enforcement agencies? The meeting lead-up and fallout An NFL spokesman declined to comment, citing the investigation by former FBI director Robert Mueller of the NFL's actions. The meeting in question occurred June 16 at the NFL’s headquarters in New York, three months after a New Jersey grand jury indicted Rice on charges of third-degree aggravated assault from the elevator incident. Ray Rice, who married Janay Rice on March 28, was accepted into a pretrial intervention program to avoid time behind bars in May. The purpose of the mid-June meeting was to discuss disciplinary action by the NFL. Sports Illustrated’s Peter King broke the first details about the meeting, citing anonymous inside sources that the NFL has not contradicted. The meeting included not just Goodell and Ray and Janay Rice, but also Ravens General Manager Ozzie Newsome, Ravens President Dick Cass, and two NFL executives, King reported. In the meeting, Janay Rice asked Goodell to be lenient to Ray Rice, the source told King, saying major discipline could ruin the running back’s career. On July 24, the NFL announced it would suspend Rice for just two games, setting off early waves of criticism. King’s story is important because it informed the subsequent chorus of columns and punditry that slammed Goodell for not talking to the couple separately. The popular sports blog Deadspin quoted two domestic violence victim advocates -- Rene Renick, vice president of programs and emerging issues with the National Network to End Domestic Violence, and attorney adviser Viktoria Kristiansson of prosecutor resource group AEquitas -- who said Goodell’s combined meeting with the couple was inappropriate. "Even having the two of them in the room and thinking that she can speak freely in that kind of a situation is crazy," Renick told Deadspin. "There is no way she can speak freely. And if there was any chance that she was afraid or coerced, she couldn't have said that. She would have been probably in a whole lot of danger." A columnist for the Ravens’ hometown paper, the Baltimore Sun’s Dan Rodricks, interviewed a local social worker and counseling professor who echoed that point. And Wise, too, wrote a July 29 column that went into more detail about Goodell’s meeting with the couple than Wise discussed on CNN. In an interview with PunditFact, Wise said the meeting was "ethically irresponsible" and shows Goodell’s background lacks professional mental health training. "I have no qualms whatsoever about maintaining that law enforcement agencies and domestic violence advocates on the whole support not interviewing a perpetrator and the abused together, especially when deciding matters of discipline for the perpetrator," Wise said. Law enforcement policies Ruth M. Glenn, interim executive director of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, confirmed to PunditFact what other domestic violence advocates told other news organizations: Goodell should not have talked to Janay Rice in front of her husband. "When that incident is being reviewed, investigated, whatever it is, there should never be an opportunity where that inquiry occurs when they’re both present," Glenn said. "Absolutely, it doesn’t make it any different if it had happened a day before." Glenn said the domestic violence prevention community has pushed for years for law enforcement agencies to adopt policies that call for interviewing victims and suspects separately (example of model policies and checklists here.) We found plenty of examples of law enforcement agencies that expressly say to separate the victim, suspect and witnesses involved in the dispute, including Santa Clara County (Calif.), Kentucky, Michigan, South Carolina and New Jersey. (We didn’t have time to check each district or state by our deadline, and the U.S. Department of Justice did not offer a comment, but we are comfortable saying this policy is widespread.) Stanford University law professor Robert Weisberg noted that detectives always question witnesses separately. Still, while separation may be required in the immediate aftermath of an incident, it isn’t always maintained throughout the legal process, said said Charles H. Rose III, Stetson University College of Law professor. Sometimes couples in domestic violence cases are interviewed together so officials can judge how they act with one another. "By the time Goodell was involved it was no longer necessary to have them be interviewed apart," Rose said. "In effect, the wagons had already been circled." Also left unsaid by Wise: Goodell was not initiating a law enforcement investigation. That already had occurred. "You cannot apply a law enforcement paradigm to an employment issue," Rose said. "Different standards, different law, and different results." Goodell’s goal for talking with Ray and Janay Rice may not have been analogous with a law enforcement investigation, cautioned James Acker, a University at Albany-SUNY School of Criminal Justice professor. "If it was, then for the same reasons, such a joint discussion would not likely be appropriate," Acker said. "On the other hand, for all I know, the context was quite different. Perhaps Goodell already had received a factual account elsewhere; perhaps he wanted to attempt to gauge the Rices' relationship and try to form an impression of them together." Our ruling Wise has a problem with Goodell meeting with Ray and Janay Rice together as Goodell sought information about the February elevator incident and aftermath that would inform Rice’s discipline by the league. First, there’s little debate that the meeting occurred, as it has been widely reported and not challenged by the NFL. Second, Wise also claimed that "in every domestic violence agency, every law enforcement agency" a meeting like that would be "a no-no." That’s for the most part correct as well, though experts we spoke to questioned whether it’s the right parallel to draw. Questioning victims separately from suspects in domestic violence cases does appear to be a widespread practice both encouraged by domestic violence advocates and many police and state policies after an incident occurs. But Goodell was not conducting a criminal investigation -- that already had occurred, and he had access to that information. Also, there are occasions when couples involved in domestic violence cases are interviewed together later, allowing police and prosecutors to judge how they act with one another so they can assess credibility and potential prosecution, one expert told us. Setting aside whether the comparison is apt, Wise’s claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-03618	The labor market is weak because if you count the unemployed, underemployed, and those who’ve stopped looking for work, the unemployment rate "actually went up last month to 13.5 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/07/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-rise-employment-statistic-shows/	On NBC’s Meet the Press, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., pointed to a somewhat obscure labor statistic as evidence that the economy continues to fare poorly more than five years after the onset of the last recession. "I think it's very dangerous to suggest that this economy's healthy," Ginrgich said. He went on to argue that the implementation of President Barack Obama’s health care law could push some companies to turn full-time workers into part-timers in order to avoid providing health coverage. "The pain level it's going to cause, is going to be enormous," Gingrich said of the health care law. "The number of people who are going to have their jobs reduced to 29 hours, because that way their employer doesn't have to pay for their insurance, is going to be staggering. And if you look at the U-6 number, which was unemployed, under-employed, and dropped out, it actually went up last month to 13.5 percent." The U-6 number, for the nonwonks in our audience, is a federal statistic that tries to capture a broader picture of labor-market weakness than the more familiar unemployment rate. As Gingrich indicated, the statistic takes into account not just people who are unemployed but also people working part-time who would rather have full-time work, as well as people who have stopped looking for work but would begin to look again if labor-market conditions improved. Because it includes these additional factors, the U-6 rate tends to track the official unemployment rate, but is usually a few points higher. The experts we interviewed didn’t object to Gingrich’s concern about the health of the economy. In general, labor market measures have improved significantly from their weakest point in 2010, but the key measurements are "still historically very high and not dropping precipitously," particularly this long after the beginning of the last recession, said George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair. However, we will focus on whether the rise in the U-6 measurement Gingrich cited supports his point about the health of the economy. As it turns out, Gingrich was actually low when he said the current U-6 level is 13.5 percent. The seasonally adjusted figure -- which is the preferred number when comparing the data across months, as Gingrich is doing -- was 13.9 percent in April 2013. Still, the more important factor given his comment is to look at how the number has been moving. And while Gingrich was right that the number went up in April 2013, there’s less to that fact than meets the eye. The statistic rose from 13.8 percent in March to 13.9 percent in April. The experts we interviewed saw two big asterisks in this rise. • A change of one-tenth of a percentage point is not statistically significant. We checked with Bureau of Labor Statistics, and a spokesman told us that the U-6 measure needs to move three-tenths of a percentage point in a month for the change to qualify as statistically significant. The actual change from March to April was one-third of that, meaning that the change is essentially statistical noise. (Obama supporters note: The 0.1 percentage point fall in the unemployment rate from March to April was also statistically insignificant, so you shouldn’t make too much of that statistic either.) • With the exception of April’s number, the U-6 has generally been falling, not rising. In fact, while there were occasional jogs upward, the statistic has been on a pretty steady decline since it peaked at 17.1 in April 2010. The current level of 13.9 percent is now about where it was in December 2008, a month before Obama was inaugurated. Indeed, since January 2013, the statistic has fallen by half a percentage point -- an amount that is statistically significant, unlike April’s small rise. Gingrich’s portrayal of a small increase like April’s as evidence of a worrisome trend amounts to cherry picking. "Kvetching about a 0.1 percentage-point change seems a bit silly in the context of other changes in employment, unemployment, and underemployment published in April’s BLS report," said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution. "The number of payroll jobs increased by 165,000 in April and has increased 635,000 since January. " Burtless agreed that "conditions are improving way too slowly for anyone to think it’s time to break out the champagne," but he added that "it’s ridiculous to suggest April’s employment report contains evidence of a weakening in the trend toward a better job market." Our ruling Gingrich said that if you count the unemployed, underemployed, and those who’ve stopped looking for work, the unemployment rate "actually went up last month to 13.5 percent." Gingrich is correct that the measurement in question did rise. However, that rise was not statistically significant, and it has been more than outweighed by a consistent decline in the numbers over the past three years. On balance, we rate his claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/586dbf1f-5b60-4e69-bdbe-32f6e2f691ac	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2013-05-07T16:07:07	2013-05-05	['None']

pomt-15258	Says states not directly involved in the gay marriage lawsuits that reached the Supreme Court "are not bound" by the court’s ruling.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/jul/31/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-states-not-singled-out-supreme-court-not-/	The U.S. Supreme Court holds ultimate sway on the laws of the land, yes? Hold on, Ted Cruz said in an interview about the court’s 5-4 decision holding that state bans on gay marriage violate federal principles of equal protection and fair treatment under the law, creating a "grave and continuing harm" to families led by such couples. After the June 26, 2015, ruling, which addressed challenges to state laws in Ohio, Tennessee, Michigan and Kentucky, Cruz said that if a party isn’t directly involved in a dispute before the Supreme Court, it’s not required to comply with the ruling. "Those who are not parties to the suit are not bound by it," Cruz said. A reader asked us to check Cruz’s claim. The Republican senator and presidential aspirant should know about the high court. He argued before the court on Texas’ behalf in a past job as the state’s solicitor general. In the interview, Cruz told Steve Inskeep, who hosts NPR’s Morning Edition program, that the court’s ruling imposed "elitist radical views," short-circuiting the ability of each state to define marriage. Inskeep asked if Cruz would encourage officials who disagree with the ruling to ignore or defy it. State officials "cannot ignore a direct judicial order," Cruz said. "The parties to a case cannot ignore a direct judicial order. But it does not mean that those who are not parties to case are bound by a judicial order." INSKEEP: "Did I understand you to say just now that as you read the law, as you read our system, this decision is not binding on the entire country, only to the specific states that were named in the suit." CRUZ: "Article III of the Constitution gives the court the authority to resolve cases and controversies. Those cases and controversies, when they're resolved, when you're facing a judicial order, the parties to that suit are bound (by) it. Those who are not parties to the suit are not bound by it. Now, in subsequent litigation, other courts will follow the precedence of the court, but a judicial order only binds those to whom it is directed, those who are parties to the suit. That's the way our litigation system works." (See fuller excerpts of this part of the interview here.) We alerted Cruz’s campaign to this fact check and didn’t hear back. Legal experts Separately, several legal experts told us the idea that states not party to the marriage cases weren’t bound by the court’s ruling may have technical merit, but that’s all. Richard Fallon, a Harvard specialist in constitutional law, said by email that under the doctrine of precedent, "any official who failed to issue gay marriage licenses would be sueable for failure to do so, and any court in which the suit was filed would be obliged to follow the Supreme Court’s gay marriage ruling. In the long run, non-compliance thus amounts at most to a delaying tactic. And there are lots of complicated questions about whether officials should regard themselves as obliged to do what they know a court would order them to do if they were sued — even if they are not technically bound by the Supreme Court’s ruling. But on Senator Cruz’s technical point, he is probably correct, if you understand it as being only a very limited, technical point about a delaying tactic." In contrast, Lynn Wardle, a law professor at Brigham Young University who has advocated that the Constitution leaves it to legislators to stipulate who may marry, called Cruz’s statement "precisely correct." Entities not party to a suit are not bound by the resulting judicial order, Wardle said by email, adding: "That’s the way our litigation system works." Only parties before the court are bound by its judgment and orders, Randy Barnett, a professor of legal theory at the Georgetown University Law Center, said by email, but all other courts are bound to follow the court (which Cruz hinted at). So, Barnett wrote, "it is futile for states who are not parties to resist. More importantly, when a ruling is clear, ignoring the Supreme Court's decisions until a court directly orders them to obey undermines the rule of law. Bad people say ‘we won't obey the law until you make us.’ Unless they are engaged in justified civil disobedience — in which case they are liable to be punished — good people follow the law before they are directly commanded." If nonparties to the suits don’t go along with the ruling, he said, "they are postponing the inevitable and flouting the rule of law that was announced by the Court." Stephen Vladeck, an American University law professor, called Cruz’s statement "literally true, but deeply misleading. Technically, the only parties that are bound by a ruling by the Supreme Court are the parties to that litigation — and so, in the context of the marriage cases, the small subset of states whose bans on gay marriage were before the Court. "But the way our system works," Vladeck emailed, "every state and federal court is ultimately subject to the supervision of the Supreme Court at least where federal law is concerned. That’s why those courts generally apply the Constitution as it has been interpreted by the Justices in Washington; if they don’t, they’re likely to be reversed." Asked if Wardle had a point saying Cruz was precisely correct, Vladeck said that read is misleading in that states still have to go along with such a ruling, absent a good-faith reason not to. In the "immediate aftermath of a decision like this one, when there is no reason to think the Supreme Court would answer the question any differently were a different state a party to the suit," Vladeck said, "it’s unreasonable for a state official or state court to decline to follow that ruling. They’re not literally bound to do so (and, thus, can’t be held in contempt for failing to do so), but they are practically bound by dint of the Supreme Court’s appellate jurisdiction." By phone, Susan Sommer, the lead lawyer for Lambda Legal in the suits that reached the Supreme Court, suggested that "only in the very most technical and hair-splitting way could it be said that the Supreme Court’s ruling is not immediately and directly binding on every state government and government official in the country." Sommer said she knows of no legitimate school of thought that could say the ruling doesn’t apply to all the states. "It’s sort-of Law School 101," Sommer said. We also heard back from SCOTUS Blog reporter Lyle Denniston, who’s covered the Supreme Court for more than 50 years. The Constitution’s Article III, Denniston said by email, limits the authority of federal courts to actual cases or controversies, so the outcome is between the actual litigants, as Cruz said. Then again, he said, "the Supreme Court since 1803 (Marbury v. Madison) has claimed the authority to ‘say what the law is’ constitutionally, and its conclusions on what the Constitution means in a given case are made binding across the land, as a result of the reinforcement of its authority by the Supremacy Clause of Article VI" of the Constitution. Denniston further said: "The Supreme Court, in the 1958 decision in Cooper v. Aaron (the Little Rock high school integration case), said explicitly that the combination of the Marbury decision and Article VI made the Supreme Court's decisions binding on the states. That decision, by the way, is the only" one "in history where each of the nine Justices explicitly signed the opinion to give it more force." Article VI says the Constitution shall be the "supreme Law of the Land" with judges bound to it along with legislators and executive and judicial officers, state and federal. Our ruling Cruz said states not directly involved in the gay marriage lawsuits that reached the Supreme Court "are not bound" by the court’s ruling. He has a thread of a point in that only four states were directly involved in the case. But that’s an incomplete answer to the question of whether states could ignore the court’s ruling. Other courts would be bound by the Supreme Court’s precedent, making the ruling applicable throughout the nation. That’s a fact that Cruz alluded to only after being pressed by the interviewer for clarification of his earlier misleading statement. We rate the claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-09897	"Only about 6.8 percent of the (stimulus) money has actually been spent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/15/jon-kyl/sen-jon-kyl-says-only-68-percent-stimulus-has-been/	One of the most common Republican attack lines against President Barack Obama's $787 billion economic stimulus package has been that the money isn't flowing to the nation's economy quickly enough. If the bill's supporters really wanted to help the economy quickly, the argument goes, they should have spent the stimulus money right away rather than using it on projects that will take more time to get up and running. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., the No. 2 Senate Republican, made that point on ABC's This Week With George Stephanopoulos on July 12, 2009. "The reality is (the stimulus) hasn't helped yet," Kyl told Stephanopoulos. "Only about 6.8 percent of the money has actually been spent." It's a matter of opinion and interpretation whether the stimulus has helped the economy since it passed in February. So we won't rule on that. But Kyl is mostly right about the amount that's been spent. The Obama administration publishes u pdated spending figures on Recovery.gov , the administration's Web site tracking the stimulus money. It includes a graph showing the week-by-week trend in spending, which shows how it has steadily increased. As of July 3, $60.4 billion in stimulus money had been spent, according to the chart. If you divide this by the full stimulus amount of $787 billion, you get 7.7 percent — a bit higher than Kyl's 6.8 percent, but in the ballpark. It appears that Kyl was a few weeks out of date in his statistics. The figure spent by June 19 was 6.7 percent; in the subsequent two weeks of reported data, the government shelled out an additional $7.5 billion, boosting the percentage slightly. But on the larger point, Kyl is accurate: A relatively small portion of the stimulus has been spent. So we find his claim Mostly True.

pomt-13278	Says Syrian refugees are not being vetted, and "the FBI is not even being told where they are."	mostly false	/north-carolina/statements/2016/oct/12/pat-mccrory/mccrory-says-syrian-refugees-not-properly-vetted-o/	During Tuesday’s debate in the North Carolina governor’s race, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory repeated a questionable claim from the realm of national politics when defending his party’s presidential nominee, Donald Trump. Seven North Carolina cities and towns have received several hundred Syrian refugees since 2014. In total across the country, the U.S. recently took in its 10,000th refugee from the war-torn nation. In the debate, McCrory said we don’t know anything about these newcomers. Trump has previously made the False claim that there is "no system to vet" refugees. Former Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson made a similar Mostly False claim that "there is currently no ability to vet these people." The difference between the two claims was that Trump said there’s no system for vetting refugees, and Carson said we don’t have the ability to vet them. There is certainly a system: It has been in place since 1980 and has been tweaked several times since 9/11. Carson’s claim had a tiny bit more truth to it than Trump’s did because it can be difficult to track down every bit of information about every Syrian refugee, given the violence and destruction there. So where did McCrory land with his own claim? Let’s take a look at the whole thing. Debate moderator Chuck Todd was pressing McCrory and his Democratic challenger, Roy Cooper, about their parties’ presidential candidates. He asked McCrory if Trump was a role model. You can watch the entire exchange here. McCrory said Trump "does stand strong on certain issues that need to be said, especially from outside Washington, D.C. The Syrian refugee situation is a disaster. I personally talked to the FBI – one of the top leaders of the FBI – and they kind of laughed when they said they’re checking the backgrounds of the Syrian refugees. No, they aren’t. There’s no embassy to check. There’s no qualifications. So when Hillary Clinton says they’re doing a vetting process of these Syrian refugees coming into our state, the FBI is not even being told where they are." McCrory’s claim that "no, they aren’t" being vetted is in line with Carson’s Mostly False claim that we don’t have the ability to check the backgrounds of these refugees. And his claim that "the FBI is not even being told where they are" reminds us of a Mostly False claim by Sen. Ted Cruz that "the head of the FBI has told Congress they cannot vet those refugees." Vetting refugees McCrory said at the debate there’s no embassy to help with background checks. But the U.S. does have an embassy in Syria. The Syrian government also had an embassy in the U.S. until 2014, when the U.S. suspended it and began recognizing diplomats for the rebels instead. Regardless, embassies are rarely the first point of contact for refugees. The initial vetting is almost always handled by United Nations workers. That process takes four to 10 months. If refugees pass the U.N. checks and are referred to the U.S., they face additional scrutiny from the FBI and other federal agencies – including in-person interviews, medical screenings and background checks. If they pass they are matched with sponsors, begin taking "cultural orientation" classes and undergo a final security clearance. Then they’re allowed to come to the United States. And that’s just the normal process for refugees from anywhere in the world. Syrian refugees undergo an additional layer of security checks, using classified information. The process typically takes one to two years or longer. The State Department says about half are approved. The system certainly isn’t perfect, since many refugees have fled violence hastily, without all their papers. Officials have also said a lack of U.S. troops on the ground means our knowledge of local terrorists isn’t as complete as in places like Iraq and Afghanistan, which have also sent thousands of refugees to the U.S. "If we don’t know much about somebody, there won’t be anything in our data," FBI Director James Comey told Congress in 2015. "I can’t sit here and offer anybody an absolute assurance that there’s no risk associated with this." But few Syrian refugees fit the typical profile of a terrorist or criminal – only about 2 percent resettled in the U.S. have been young adult men, according to a Washington Post article from 2015. Half have been children, and another quarter have been older than 60. Including the 10,000 Syrian refugees now here, the United States still had almost twice as many refugees a decade ago, under President George W. Bush. The number of refugees and asylum-seekers in the United States peaked in 2006 at 970,000 people. In 2015, there were 560,000. Government awareness We’re not sure why an FBI official might have told McCrory that the agency "is not even being told where they are," but we can fill the governor in. North Carolina is one of the top states for Syrian refugees. Only Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Michigan, New York, Pennsylvania and Texas have taken in more. As of August North Carolina had 430, according to the conservative group Federation for American Immigration Reform. That group, citing data from the federal government, says there are 102 Syrian refugees in High Point, 83 in Raleigh, 70 in Charlotte, 63 in Durham, 61 in Greensboro, 48 in Winston-Salem and three in New Bern. The FBI does not continue automatically tracking the movements of all Syrian refugees once they pass background checks and settle here – but again, most of the refugees are children or senior citizens. And there is nothing keeping the FBI from tracking suspected terrorists of any nationality or residency status. If a refugee does exhibit red flags after making it through the background checks, the FBI can begin tracking that person. In 2010, the FBI arrested two Iraqi refugees who had been under surveillance for being suspected of trying to smuggle weapons from Kentucky back to Iraq. They were caught handling heavy weapons on camera after being set up in a sting by the FBI. Our ruling McCrory said Syrian refugees aren’t being vetted and that the FBI doesn’t know where they are. The vetting process has faced criticism, but it does exist – leading to the rejection of thousands of applicants and, in many cases, taking more than two years for those who are approved. There are also extensive records of where refugees are initially settled. The FBI does not automatically track all of them once they’re settled, but nothing is stopping agents from tracking refugees who make it through the vetting process but later exhibit signs of extremism – and there are recent examples of the FBI doing exactly that. McCrory distorts the reality of the Syrian refugee system, and we rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7de8d8b9-b87c-4e34-bb1e-d1f3d8813722	None	Pat McCrory	None	None	None	2016-10-12T13:17:22	2016-10-11	['Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation', 'Syria']

pomt-00704	"If we choose Obamacare expansion, 600,000 will lose eligibility for their subsidies, of which 257,000 would be forced into Medicaid."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/apr/30/steve-crisafulli/crisafulli-says-257000-would-be-forced-medicaid-un/	Even before the Florida House adjourned early, Speaker Steve Crisafulli laid blame for the session’s budget impasse clearly on Medicaid expansion. In an essay printed by the Tampa Bay Times, Crisafulli wrote the Senate had "partnered with the Obama administration" to demand the expansion. But the House believed the move would drag people into a costly system that didn’t work. "Under federal law, other low-income Floridians have access to health care subsidies to buy private insurance for less than the average cost of a wireless phone bill," said Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island. "In fact, if we choose Obamacare expansion, 600,000 will lose eligibility for their subsidies, of which 257,000 would be forced into Medicaid. " Estimates say the expansion would cover more than 800,000 people, many of whom are currently uninsured. We wondered where Crisafulli was getting his numbers. Playing percentages This subject can make heads spin pretty easily, so before we begin, let’s review a few basics about the Affordable Care Act. The law’s intent was to expand coverage to the uninsured through two different ways. The first was to give subsidies to people who needed help to buy insurance through HealthCare.gov or a new state marketplace. The second way was to expand Medicaid, a state-federal insurance program for the very poor. Medicaid expansion ended up being optional for the states, thanks to a 2012 Supreme Court ruling. This is what the Florida House and Senate are arguing about. The Senate wants to expand Medicaid so that recipients end up buying heavily subsidized insurance. The House doesn’t want to expand Medicaid at all. Crisafulli’s numbers are based on how many Floridians would qualify for the expansion, which would be extended to all adults up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (100 percent is currently $11,770 for an individual and $24,250 for a family of four). Technically the calculation is actually 133 percent under the law, but a 5 percent deduction is added on top of that. If a state doesn’t expand Medicaid, people who make 100 to 400 percent of the poverty level can get subsidies to buy insurance in a marketplace. These are the subsidies Crisafulli is talking about. But if you qualify for Medicaid, you’re not eligible for help paying premiums. His argument is that if the state extends the program, the people between 100 and 133 percent of the federal poverty level (he’s not citing the full 138, you’ll note) will lose their subsidies to buy policies, and the House simply won’t let that happen. Crisafulli is using 2015-16 fiscal year estimates by the Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research, which we examined ourselves. That projection says there are about 609,000 people in the 100 to 133 percent of poverty level range, and a little more than 351,000 of them have insurance of some kind. They get it through employers, Medicare or some other form of government assistance program, or buy insurance on their own (subsidized or not). Those people could enroll in Medicaid if they wanted to. More than 257,000 have no insurance at all, and these are the ones Crisafulli is saying will be "forced into Medicaid." His office confirmed he meant they will be left without subsidies and will not make enough money to buy policies, so Medicaid will be their only option. What it means The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and health policy experts largely agreed the numbers were plausible, but there are some points they said Crisafulli is sidestepping. Foremost is the idea that 257,000 people would be "forced" to join the program. There is no law that says you have to use Medicaid if you qualify, and not everyone who is currently eligible enrolls. Ben Sommers, a health policy and economics professor at Harvard, said it’s pretty tough for Crisafulli to imply those quarter-million people would be upset by suddenly qualifying for Medicaid. "Giving uninsured people Medicaid is pretty popular among uninsured people," Sommers said. "There aren’t any public opinion surveys I’ve seen in which low-income adults don’t generally support the Medicaid expansion." Crisafulli neglects to mention there are many Floridians who right now don’t qualify for either Medicaid or federal subsidies, an estimated 669,000 people whose income is below 100 percent of federal poverty level. Those uninsured Floridians account for 18 percent of all Americans in the so-called coverage gap -- second only to Texas. They would all benefit from Medicaid expansion by gaining coverage. Finally, Crisafulli is arguing that expanding Medicaid under Obamacare would unfairly take away subsidies that Floridians need to buy their own insurance. Those subsidies are a feature of the very same Affordable Care Act he criticizes. Our ruling Crisafulli said, "If we choose Obamacare expansion, 600,000 will lose eligibility for their subsidies, of which 257,000 would be forced into Medicaid." Crisafulli is using incendiary language to describe state projections about Medicaid expansion. The state estimates that about 609,000 Floridians would lose access to subsidies to buy insurance under an expansion. About 257,000 of those people would be uninsured, likely because they’re too poor to buy their own. The rest could enroll in Medicaid if they wanted to. So his numbers can be considered accurate. But experts tell us saying those people would be forced into the program isn’t accurate. Many of the very poor would likely see becoming eligible for Medicaid as a benefit.

pomt-02983	All members of Congress are required to be in Obamacare, but Obama and members of his administration "have their own gold-plated health care plans that they're in."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/oct/21/sean-duffy/obamacare-congress-must-buy-insurance-marketplaces/	U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Wis.) flashed what appeared to be a self-satisfied smile after his televised quarrel with longtime Washington journalist Andrea Mitchell over the government shutdown and Obamacare. The MSNBC interview on Oct. 8, 2013 occurred one week after health insurance exchanges, now known as marketplaces, opened under President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act. Those marketplaces were created to offer health insurance to individuals who don’t have coverage from employers and who may be eligible for government subsidies to help pay for the coverage. Duffy’s tussle with Mitchell earned him kudos from conservatives and sparked coverage by news outlets in Wisconsin, as well as by Politico, the Huffington Post, Rush Limbaugh and other national media. He argued that if the health care law is so good, Obama and members his administration should have to buy their insurance from the marketplaces just like members of Congress. "Why won't he join us in Obamacare?" Duffy said of the president, before making a reference to the first lady and the president's press secretary. "Why wasn't Michelle Obama on October 1st at the computer with her family signing up for Obamacare, or Jay Carney? They have their own gold-plated health care plan." "So do you," Mitchell interjected. "No. I’m not. I'm in Obamacare, I’m in Obamacare, Andrea; all members of Congress are, and my family," Duffy replied. "The president should join us in Obamacare and the rest of America. Is that pretty reasonable? We should be all be treated equally under the law. Why should members of Congress be in Obamacare and not the president? Explain that one. Isn’t that fair? Can you defend that? Can you defend why the president shouldn’t be in Obamacare like members of Congress and their staffs?" Duffy essentially repeated his claim Oct. 16, 2013 on MSNBC’s "Morning Joe" show. Is Duffy right that members of Congress are required to buy health insurance through the Affordable Care Act's marketplaces, while Obama and his staff can keep their "their own gold-plated health care plan"? Congress So many people have said Congress is exempt from Obamacare that in September 2013, PolitiFact National made the claim, rated False, one of its top 16 myths about the health care law. For many years, members of Congress chose from a variety of insurance plans offered by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, which serves 8 million federal and retired workers and their dependents. So, members of Congress were like most Americans, covered through their employer with the employer picking up most of the tab. That will end in January 2014, when lawmakers and some of their staff will be required under the health care law to pick from plans in the health care law’s new marketplaces. They are the only Americans facing this requirement, although Uncle Sam will still continue to pick up most of the cost. (Factcheck.org and The Washington Post Fact Checker have also debunked the Congress-is-exempt claim.) The requirement for Congress became part of the law after Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) in 2009 offered an amendment that required lawmakers to get their health care through the marketplaces. A version of the amendment was adopted. So, Duffy is correct on the first part of his claim, that members of Congress must, under the Affordable Care Act, purchase insurance through the law's marketplaces. President Obama and members of his administration and their families will continue to get their health insurance through the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program. But it's not "their own" plan, as Duffy claimed; it's the same plan that covers millions of other federal employees. In other words, they will be like most Americans who get their health insurance through an employer -- nothing will change. In fact, despite Duffy's reference to "the rest of America" joining Congress in the marketplace, the vast majority of Americans will continue to be covered through employers, not purchasing insurance from the marketplaces. Rather than being "gold-plated," the federal health insurance is roughly comparable to what members of Congress will be able to buy in the marketplaces, according to three health care reform experts we consulted: Timothy Jost, law professor at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Va.; professor Sabrina Corlette of Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms; and Michael Tanner, senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank. "It’s a good plan," Tanner said of the federal health insurance, "but it’s roughly the equivalent" of choices available in the marketplaces. Plans available in the marketplace range from "bronze," which has the lowest premiums and pays 60 percent of the total medical costs of everyone in the plan, to "platinum," which has the highest premiums and pays 90 percent. (A fifth category, "catastrophic," is available to people under 30 years old and to some people with very low incomes.) Members of Congress, however, are required under the health care law to choose from among 112 "gold-level" plans, which pay 80 percent of the total costs. By way of comparison, the most common plan chosen in the program offered to all other federal employees is a Blue Cross plan, which pays closer to 90 percent. Our rating Duffy said: All members of Congress are required to be in Obamacare, but Obama and members of his administration "have their own gold-plated health care plans that they're in." Members of Congress will have to buy their health insurance from marketplaces created as part of the health reform law, while the president and members of his administration can keep the coverage they get from the federal government. But the federal offerings are roughly comparable to what Congress can buy in the marketplaces, not vastly superior. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, Duffy gets a Half True. To comment on this item, go to the Journal Sentinel's web page.

pomt-00642	Says Thomas Jefferson said "that government is best which governs least."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/may/19/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-it-was-thomas-jefferson-who-utte/	On his personal Twitter account, Gov. Scott Walker has been posting a number of tweets lately that espouse conservative principles. Some of the most recent ones were "Stop the spending" messages, with pictures of President Barack Obama, as well as Ronald Reagan quotes and a pro-gun rights sentiment. (There was also a tweet with a math error -- which was quickly criticized and corrected -- saying "It's hard to believe that it has been 505 years since the first settlers arrived at Jamestown." The tweet referred to 1607, so it should have been 408 years.) A tweet Walker posted May 14, 2015 caught our attention. A graphic image attached to the tweet said: "That government is best which governs least. -- Thomas Jefferson." And the text of the tweet itself read: "Thomas Jefferson said it best. Retweet if you agree that we need a smaller, more conservative government." That might sound like Jefferson. But it’s not. In September 2014, PolitiFact Georgia checked a similar claim by U.S. Rep. Jody Hice, R-Georgia, who at the time was running for the seat he now holds. Hice attributed this quote to Jefferson in a tweet: "That government is best which governs the least, because its people discipline themselves." Our colleagues rated Hice’s claim False. "That sounds like something that he might have said or written, but in fact, he did not," Anna Berkes, the research librarian at the Thomas Jefferson Foundation, said at the time. Meanwhile, the quote Walker used is so often misattributed to Jefferson that it appears on the "Spurious quotations" page of the Thomas Jefferson Foundation’s website. That page says of the quote: "Although the ideas expressed in this quotation may be in line with Jefferson's opinions to some extent, the exact phrasing is almost certainly not Jefferson's. However, this quotation has been associated with the ideological descendants of Jefferson's Democratic-Republican party for a very long time, and this is likely why it ultimately came to be attributed to him." Berkes told PolitiFact Georgia that the quote used by Walker has also been attributed to Henry David Thoreau. But she said research indicates Thoreau was likely quoting the United States Magazine and Democratic Review, where the sentiment first appeared in 1837. Berkes told us that she has done some further research and it's still clear the quote isn't Jefferson's. We also found that "Respectfully Quoted: A Dictionary of Quotations" also attributes the quote to the United States Magazine and Democratic Review. Our rating Walker said it was Thomas Jefferson who said "that government is best which governs least." While it may match closely with Jefferson’s views, the Thomas Jefferson Foundation lists the quote as one of the many that are mistakenly attributed to Jefferson. We rate Walker’s statement False.

pomt-08010	"We had an amendment in the health care law that said the federal government is going to take over education."	false	/florida/statements/2011/jan/11/allen-west/west-says-feds-are-going-take-over-education/	You've heard the one about the "federal government takeover" of health care, but how about the feds taking over education? U.S. Rep. Allen West, a Republican from South Florida who took office Jan. 5, 2011, has a beef with government takeovers. On Fox News Jan. 2, West said (around page 3 of the transcript): "When you look at the things that happen in our country and the nationalization of so much of our production -- being it an automobile industry, being it a health care industry, being the fact that we had an amendment in the health care law that said the federal government is going to take over education." A day later, this time on CNN, he again spoke critically about health care legislation connected to a change in education loans. In response to a question by host John King related to jobs and health care, West said: "But this health care law is tied to jobs because when you look at the 52-employee rule, a lot of people are not going to have more than 52 employees because of the threat of the high cost. And we also see that insurance premiums are already going up for Americans. Look, you know if we're talking about improving health care, that does not mean 11 new taxes. That does not mean 159 new government agencies or bureaucracies. It does not mean 16,000 new IRS agents. "And I'm waiting for someone to explain to me what does government control of college education loans have to do with health care, which was part of that law. So there are some things that we need to carefully examine and we need to come up with a right, free market, free enterprise-based solution that looks at the cost analysis of health care and not just a simple government expansion." For this Truth-O-Meter we wanted to know what West was referring to about "an amendment in the health care law that said the federal government is going to take over education." And is he right about a takeover? "Takeover" is a hot-button word But first, some background from PolitiFact about that other big alleged "government takeover:" PolitiFact editors and reporters -- as well as readers -- chose "government takeover of health care" as the Lie of the Year for 2010. According to a PolitiFact article published Dec. 16, 2010, "a 'Government Takeover' conjures a European approach where the government owns the hospitals and the doctors are public employees. But the law Congress passed, parts of which have already gone into effect, relies largely on the free market." Employers will still provide insurance through private companies, the government did not nationalize doctors or seize hospitals, and ultimately there was no public option -- a proposed government-run plan. With that reminder of the health care takeover myth, let's return to West's claim about the federal government taking over education. On Jan. 6, we contacted West spokeswoman Angela Sachitano and asked her to explain what amendment West was referring to and how it constituted an education takeover. Health care link to student loans We also did some research to look for a connection between government control of college education loans and the 2010 health care bill. We found some background from updates posted March 6, 2009, and April 5, 2010, on the Obameter, PolitiFact's website tracking promises made by President Barack Obama. The promise Obama had made was to "eliminate wasteful subsidies to private student lenders, which will save nearly $6 billion dollars per year, and invest the savings in additional student aid." The Obameter wrote in 2009: "There are basically two kinds of college loan programs: the Federal Family Education Loan Program, in which private lenders make and secure loans to students and receive subsidies from the federal government, and the William D. Ford Direct Loan Program, in which the federal government directly loans to students. Obama's plan is to shift student lending away from the private loans to the government's direct loan program, which he believes is more efficient and cost-effective." On April 5, 2010, the Obameter wrote: "Congress ultimately decided against cutting the program through the 2010 budget bill, but it was more forthcoming the second time around. On March 30, 2010, Obama signed legislation -- which was part of the health care bill -- that replaces the private lending program with 100 percent direct lending, effective July 1, 2010." In addition to the two updates on the Obameter, PolitiFact's Truth-O-Meter on April 21, 2010, summarized the cost savings of the change in the student loans: "The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, which analyzes the fiscal impact of legislation, has said the student-lending changes will save the government nearly $61 billion in the 10-year period. The office estimates that of those savings, $36 billion will go to Pell grants, $2.2 billion to assist colleges historically serving blacks or other minorities, and $750 million to other college-access grants." The Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, which Obama signed into law March 30, 2010, included a portion on "Student Loan Reform" -- read the Congressional Research Service Summary to learn more about that portion of the bill. On Jan. 7, Sachitano sent us a copy of a March 21, 2010, New York Times article about the House voting to revamp the student loan program as part of the reconciliation bill that included the health care law. Nothing in the article suggests that the move was a federal government "takeover" of education. The article did state that: "Private banks lobbied against the student loan changes, which eliminate a long-flowing source of revenue for them." Higher ed experts weigh in We spoke with three experts on higher education and all concluded that the changes in the loan program did not constitute the federal government taking over education. We spoke to Terry Hartle, vice president of the division of government and public affairs at the American Council on Education; Barry Toiv, vice president for public affairs at the Association of American Universities; and Stephanie Brown, associate vice president for enrollment and student services at Nova Southeastern University in Broward County. Part of West's Congressional District 22 lies in Broward. Hartle gave us more history of the federal student loan program. When that program started in 1965, banks provided student loans that were guaranteed by the federal government. In 1993, then-President Bill Clinton said it didn't make sense for the government to subsidize banks to make loans to students and it would be better for the government to make loans directly to students. Congress didn't want to do away with the loan program involving private banks but did agree to add a direct federal loan program. Two programs co-existed for many years -- until the reconciliation act in 2010. "Very few students will notice any difference in their loans because of the change," Hartle said. "They are filling out the same loan application -- it just goes to a different post office box. The loan -- once it is made -- is not held by SunTrust, CitiBank or Bank of America; the loan is held by the U.S. Department of Education. The Department of Education will hire contractors who might be Bank of America, CitiBank or SuntTrust to manage the portfolio of loans. It's much cheaper for the Department of Education to make student loans this way than to make it through the banks." Colleges will notice some differences -- the financial aid employees are now dealing with the federal Department of Education rather than several banks. "From campus officials I've talked to, it's not that big a difference," Hartle said. "The vast majority of college presidents I talk to said it makes no difference to them, they didn't incur significantly higher costs ... and frankly the implementation was remarkably smooth." Said Toiv, of AAU and a former deputy press secretary under President Clinton, in an interview Jan. 7: The change to the loan programs "didn't take banks out of the program completely because the private sector still administers the loans for the Department of Education. However it did take out the part of the program where banks were the actual lenders. Opponents of this did refer to it as a federal 'takeover' of student lending. The proponents did not refer to it that way mainly because it's always been a federal program." While this changed work responsibilities for some employees in financial aid offices at universities, "This has no impact at all on the management of colleges and universities," Toiv said. Brown, at Nova, agreed in a Jan. 7 interview, saying it's not a takeover and the process is actually simpler for students who don't have to research multiple lenders anymore. We sent Sachitano an e-mail Jan. 7 to tell her that our experts did not describe this as a government takeover and to ask whether she had additional proof to back up West's claim. She replied: "No, we're good." Our ruling Has the government seized control of education? West said: "We had an amendment in the health care law that said the federal government is going to take over education." This is the same type of overblown "takeover" rhetoric that led to our 2010 Lie of the Year award. The federal government was a major player in student loans for years before Obama signed the health care law. And the law does not mean that colleges and universities are now under the control or management of the federal government. We rate this claim False.

pomt-06223	Says Newt Gingrich is responsible for the gridlocked politics of Washington.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/05/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-calls-newt-gingrich-godfather-gridlo/	During an interview on the Dec. 5, 2011, edition of MSNBC’s The Daily Rundown, David Axelrod, a senior campaign adviser to President Barack Obama, coined a new description for Republican presidential candidate and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich: "the godfather of gridlock." Discussing a newly released Gingrich ad that portrays the former speaker in a soft light, Axelrod told host Chuck Todd that he was amused by the ad "because he talked about (how) he was going to bring the country together to solve problems. You're talking about the godfather of gridlock here, the guy who two decades ago really invented the kind of tactics that have now become commonplace in Washington. So, this is a whole new Newt." We wondered whether it was really fair to pin today’s policy gridlock on tactics engineered by Gingrich. So we sought comments from historians, political scientists and other political observers. We thought analyzing this quote might prove too subjective, but we found concrete evidence to both bolster and undermine Axelrod's claim. Gingrich the fighter Some historians and analysts say Gingrich's bare-knuckled tactics created a sharp partisanship that continues today. Gingrich came to national attention when he led a group of fellow backbenchers to challenge the ethics of House Speaker Jim Wright, D-Texas. Their challenge led Wright to resign in 1989, driving the ousted speaker to decry the "mindless cannibalism" consuming Congress. It was a watershed moment for Gingrich, and only solidified his belief that confrontation, not compromise, was what Congress needed. Beginning in 1989, Gingrich bided his time as House minority whip, serving under a more conciliatory Republican leader, Bob Michel of Illinois. By 1993 and 1994, -- when a Democratic president, Bill Clinton, was in the White House and the 40-year Democratic House majority was looking shaky -- Gingrich upped the ante. "The Republican strategy in 1993 and 1994 was to vote as a parliamentary minority, in unison against the new president's initiatives, and that was as much or more Newt's idea as anybody's," said Norm Ornstein, a congressional scholar with the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. "Clinton's economic program, his first big initiative, took almost eight months to pass, denying him a big early victory and making the eventual passage look like a humiliation. The same approach had success with a crime bill and, of course, with health care reform." Michel’s impending retirement cleared the way for Gingrich to become speaker if the GOP managed to take over the House in the 1994 election. And they did. Once in office, Gingrich continued his confrontational strategy, most notably in the budget fights of 1995 that led to shutdowns of the federal government. Purdue University political scientist Bert A. Rockman cited Gingrich's "defamatory misuse of the C-SPAN morning one-minute diatribes to an empty chamber, his over-the-top-rhetoric and his dogged pursuit of Clinton’s impeachment. It’s become much worse, and for reasons hardly exclusive to any individual’s nastiness, but Newt was a major contributor to the nastiness that prevails today." Gingrich developed wedge issues to divide the Democratic majority and magnets to pull voters into the Republican orbit, said Steve Gillon, a historian at the University of Oklahoma and author of The Pact: Bill Clinton, Newt Gingrich, and the Rivalry that Defined a Generation. University of Kansas political scientist Burdett Loomis argues that Gingrich’s attacks on Congress itself have harmed the institution in the long term. Though Gingrich is a historian by training, Loomis said, he "ignored the importance of maintaining (Congress’) legitimacy, which has haunted us since." Gingrich the deal-maker But Loomis and others also say Gingrich's legacy is not black and white. After Gingrich lost the public relations war over the shutdown to Clinton, he became more willing to compromise with his rival. "What Axelrod's comment does not account for is the change that took place in Gingrich after the 1995 budget battle," Gillon said. "Both Clinton and Gingrich realized they had more to gain by working together than they did by fighting each other. Both men saw their poll numbers rise." This period of cooperation lasted until the emergence of the Monica Lewinsky affair in 1998, which Gingrich played a significant role in promoting. So what did Clinton and Gingrich accomplish during this era of (relatively) good feelings? Here are a few notable bills, each of which passed with broad, bipartisan majorities. Telecommunications Act, 1996 -- described by the Federal Communications Commission as "the first major overhaul of telecommunications law in almost 62 years." The House passed the final version of the bill by a 414-16 margin, with 236 Republicans and 178 Democrats supporting it. Welfare reform, 1996 -- a landmark bill to end cash payments and instead encourage recipients to find work. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 328-101 margin, with 230 Republicans and 98 Democrats. Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, 1996 -- a law that allowed people to change jobs without fearing the loss of their health insurance due to pre-existing conditions, as well as provisions dealing with health information privacy. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 421-2 margin, with 227 Republicans and 193 Democrats. Taxpayer Relief Act, 1997 -- which established a child tax credit, tuition tax credits, and penalty-free withdrawals from IRAs for education expenses and first-home purchases, as well as a decrease in the capital gains tax and limitations on the estate tax. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 389-43 margin, with 225 Republicans and 164 Democrats. Balanced Budget Act, 1997 -- a bill that cut spending in order to balance the budget by fiscal year 2002. The House passed the final version of the bill by a 346-85 margin, with 193 Republicans and 153 Democrats. At the presidential bill-signing ceremony on the South Lawn of the White House, Gingrich called for "‘bipartisan leadership across the planet" to put aside party differences and address other nagging problems that, like the deficit, worry the public," the Washington Times reported. "‘We will meet the moral integrity test in peacetime of not spending our children's and grandchildren's money," he said. "We have a chance over the next three and a half years to work together . . . to accomplish a lot.’" "Overall, Newt’s four years as speaker can be characterized as gridlock followed by greased wheels," said Donald Wolfensberger, who served as the Republican staff director of the influential House Rules Committee before and during Gingrich’s tenure as speaker. Wolfensberger is now director of the Congress Project at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Alan Abramowitz, an Emory University political scientist, agreed, and added that the Senate -- long the home of blocked nomination hearings and a filibuster rule that allows one senator to stand in the way of legislation -- has been at least as much a force for gridlock in Washington as the House. "The Senate deserves far more blame for gridlock than the House," Abramowitz said. So Gingrich has been more of a prince of partisanship than a godfather of gridlock. Axelrod "is mixing up apples and oranges," said John Feehery, a longtime House Republican spokesman who worked under then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., among others. "Intense partisanship does not necessarily lead to gridlock, and gridlock is not necessarily the result of partisanship." Gillon, who wrote the book on the Clinton-Gingrich relationship, calls the former speaker "a very complicated figure. He is a man who will use the most ruthless methods in order to gain power, but who can be restrained, creative, and bipartisan once he has power... The political people in the Clinton White House viewed Gingrich as the antichrist. But many of the policy people – Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, domestic policy adviser Bruce Reed, Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles – painted a portrait of a pragmatic, though temperamental, policymaker." Our ruling So while Gingrich was sharply partisan, there are solid examples where he short-circuited gridlock to push bills to enactment. On balance, we rate Axelrod’s statement Half True.

pomt-07329	About two-thirds of Medicaid beneficiaries are children, but they account for one-third of the program’s cost, while one-third are elderly, and they account for two-thirds of the cost.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/12/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-says-elderly-account-two-thirds-medi/	During a May 10, 2011, interview on MSNBC, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, defended Medicaid from a Republican proposal to change the structure of the federal-state health insurance program for the poor. MSNBC’s Cenk Uygur asked Brown whether the Democrats will have "as much passion and fight in defending Medicaid" as they have on criticizing GOP proposals to overhaul Medicare for those currently under 55 years of age. Brown said Democrats would fight just as hard. "It's a nonstarter," he said. "It hurts two groups of people. It hurts poor kids. … About two-thirds of Medicaid beneficiaries are children. They are only one-third of the cost, because kids don't get sick as much. The other part of Medicaid is seniors, many of them in nursing homes, low-income, moderate-income seniors who don't have a lot of assets. That's about a third of the individuals in Medicaid but two-thirds of the costs, because … it costs more to take care of a senior than a child. "So they are going after young -- they`re going after poor children and low-income, moderate-income, low-asset, if you will, seniors," Brown concluded. "And that ain`t going to work either because the public gets it." We wondered whether Brown had the numbers right -- that two-thirds of Medicaid beneficiaries are children, but they account for one-third of the program’s cost, while one-third are elderly, and they account for two-thirds of the cost. We turned to statistics produced by the federal agency that runs Medicaid -- the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. First, we’ll look at the figures that break down who enrolls in the program. Table IV.8 here offers two different measurements -- average monthly enrollment and individual enrollees on an annual basis. Since the numbers are similar, we’ll make things simpler and choose the latter yardstick. All told, 68.2 million individuals used Medicaid in 2010. Of that 5.8 million were "aged" -- 65 and older -- while 33.9 million were children. An additional 9 million are counted separately as recipients of the State Children’s Health Insurance Program of SCHIP. (Children are the predominant beneficiaries of SCHIP, though this figure also includes some adults covered under waivers; we’ll ignore that in our calculations.) So 8.5 percent of Medicaid's beneficiaries are aged, and 63 percent are children. That means Brown is quite close on the percentage of beneficiaries who are children, but too low for the percentage of beneficiaries who are elderly. If Brown had adjusted his statement to "elderly, blind or disabled," he would have been closer. Adding those categories together gets the figure to 24 percent, although even that’s well below the one-third Brown stated. Now, we’ll look at expenditures, using data from Table II.4 here. The most recent data is from 2007. The table shows that 20.7 percent of Medicaid payments were made for beneficiaries age 65 and over, while 19.4 percent supported children. Both numbers are well below what Brown said. He’d said that the elderly account for two-thirds of the cost, when in fact they’re just over 20 percent, and that children account for one-third, when they’re actually less than 20 percent. The biggest complicating factor is that the single largest category of payments -- 43.3 percent -- is for those who are blind or disabled. Because the statistics are not broken down by age, we can’t be sure what the final distribution is. However, if Brown had adjusted his statement to "elderly, blind or disabled," he would have been close to correct about payments. The combined category would be 64 percent, just under the two-thirds he cited in the interview. When we asked Brown’s office for further information about the senator’s claim, his spokeswoman said that Brown had intended to combine "elderly, blind or disabled" into one category but failed to use the more inclusive description on camera. She said he has made that point in the past when responding to constituent letters on the issue. Even when Brown leaves out blind and disabled beneficiaries from the calculation, he still has a point, said Henry Aaron of the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. Brown’s underlying point is that the elderly account for a disproportionate share of Medicaid’s costs. By our strictest accounting, elderly beneficiaries are 8.5 percent of those served but account for 20.7 percent of payments -- a cost burden two and a half times the size of their numbers. "The central point, not widely understood, is correct: Although kids account for most of the enrollment, the elderly and disabled account for most of the cost," Aaron said. "That difference -- enrollments vs. cost -- is the key point, and he has that right." In the midst of a television interview, Brown erred in recounting Medicaid’s statistics, oversimplifying figures on both enrollment and costs. In reality, elderly beneficiaries by themselves account for nowhere close to the two-thirds of Medicaid’s costs that Brown suggested. His point that spending on the elderly is disproportionate to their numbers is valid, and he would have been close to accurate if he’d said the "elderly, blind and disabled," as his office said he had intended to. Still, the numbers viewers heard were mostly incorrect, so we rate Brown’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Sherrod Brown	None	None	None	2011-05-12T17:38:14	2011-05-10	['None']
pomt-07479	"For every [coyote] they kill, the population will replace and usually multiply."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/apr/15/online-petition/petition-claims-killing-individual-coyotes-doesnt-/	Coyotes have people howling mad on Aquidneck Island. Middletown residents recently packed a meeting to tell town officials how alarmed they are by coyotes boldly stalking neighborhoods, leaping fences into backyards and snatching beloved pets. Action is needed, they demanded, before one of the notoriously sly predators maims or kills a small child. But the solution that the residents convinced the town to approve April 4 -- enlisting the services of a hunter to kill coyotes -- has infuriated others. Several hundred residents have signed a petition opposing the plan. "The Town of Middletown has hired a hunter to begin a systematic mass killing of the coyotes," the petition reads. "What they do not take into consideration is that for every one they kill, the population will replace and usually multiply the numbers," reads the petition. That second part sounded so counter-intuitive -- after all, didn’t we hunt buffalo and wolves to near extinction? -- that we decided to look into it. But first we have to dispense with the statement about the "mass killing" of coyotes in Middletown. As far as we know, no one has suggested that the goal is to kill huge numbers of coyotes. At the April 4 meeting, Police Chief Anthony Pesare said the town would hire just one hunter to target coyotes that have lost their fear of humans. The hunter, he said, would be teamed up with Numi Mitchell, who since 2005 has been running the Narragansett Bay Coyote Study. Had we run this statement through the Truth-O-Meter, it would have rated a False ruling. But we were more interested in the petition’s claim that killing coyotes just leads the animals to "replace and usually multiply the numbers." First we called Shana Gaines, a Newport woman and vintage clothing store owner, who started the petition. She said she based the text on remarks by Mitchell, whose team has been placing radio collars on coyotes and tracking them to better understand their habits. Mitchell, after confirming her advisory role in the Middletown initiative, referred us to several research studies, including those by Frederick F. Knowlton, who spent 45 years studying coyotes and other wildlife with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Wildlife Service and as a professor at Utah State University. His work, much of it relating to coyote attacks on livestock, is commonly cited in scientific papers. "Local population reduction can provide temporary relief to sheep operators, but only until the local coyote population compensates for the removals and fills vacant territories. … Population reduction as a management option usually requires annual reapplications due to the reproductive capabilities and ease of movement of coyotes," he and his co-authors wrote in one 1999 paper. Kim Murray Berger, another researcher who has studied coyotes, wolves and other predators, wrote in a 2006 paper that although systematic campaigns to kill predators have "threatened" such species as wolves, coyotes "have shown remarkable resilience." The scientific explanation that is commonly given is intriguing. "It’s called responsive reproduction," said Christine Schadler, a wild-canid ecologist and teacher who is the New England representative for the advocacy group Project Coyote. "It seems very mysterious. How can you shoot and shoot and shoot and wind up with more? It doesn’t seem intuitive at all." But here’s what happens, she said. Coyotes typically live in a pack that stakes out, and protects, a territory. Packs are led by an alpha male and female, which are the only breeders among the group. When stressed by a limited amount of food, the females produce litters with fewer pups. But when the size of a pack is reduced, there’s more food for each individual. And breeding becomes more prolific. Their numbers bounce back in a year or two, she said. Coyotes have expanded from western parts of the country, despite attempts to reduce their numbers there, and spread to the East, taking advantage of the decline in wolf populations, a natural territorial competitor. "In a hundred years of trying to control the coyotes, all we’ve done is create millions more," Schadler said. "There’s not a scientific article that can dispute that." A New Hampshire sheep raiser, Schadler "educates" the local coyote pack to feel threatened by humans -- in ways that are not harmful to the animals. That, along with good fences and other deterrents, has prevented her from losing any sheep. All experts on coyotes caution against intentionally or unintentionally providing coyotes a source of food. We searched for someone who might argue that killing coyotes can reduce populations. We called Wildlife Services, a federal agency within the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The office readily acknowledges overseeing the killing of tens of thousands of coyotes every year, much to the chagrin of wildlife advocates. But even Carol Bannerman, a spokeswoman for the agency, would not advocate killing coyotes simply to reduce populations. The agency responds to complaints of damage being caused by coyotes, such as livestock losses, with an "integrated management plan" that emphasizes non-lethal methods to ward off coyotes. Where does that leave us? Bannerman, Middletown officials and Mitchell all appear to embrace the idea, to some degree, that the targeted killing of coyotes too comfortable around humans can help deal with isolated problems. "This is just a short-term solution for a couple of individual coyotes," Mitchell said. Knowlton, the Utah expert, said local reduction programs can provide temporary relief from coyote problems. But, in general, wildlife advocates and scientific studies maintain that coyotes are such prolific breeders that trying to lower their numbers by killing them is ineffective. So it appears the petition, apart from the "mass killing" falsehood, wasn’t feeding us a pack of lies after all. We rate the claim about coyotes replenishing their numbers Mostly True.

pomt-05327	Says President Barack Obama’s finance team is recommending a "1% tax on all transactions at any financial institution."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2012/may/16/chain-email/barack-obama-advisers-recommend-one-percent-fee-al/	Social Security beneficiaries beware: an e-mail hitting local inboxes claims President Barack Obama backs a scheme to tax your monthly check. But the online missive falls short on facts. "President Obama's finance team is recommending a one percent (1%) transaction fee (TAX). Obama's plan is to sneak it in after the November elections to keep it under the radar," the e-mail, which was sent to PolitiFact New Jersey on May 12, said. "This is a 1% tax on all transactions at any financial institution - banks, credit unions, savings and loans, etc. Any deposit you make, or even a transfer within your own bank from one account to another, will have a 1% tax charged." "If your paycheck or your Social Security or whatever is direct deposit, it will get a 1% tax charged for the transaction," the e-mail claims. Don’t empty your bank accounts and plan a life off the grid quite yet. Neither the president nor his financial team are recommending such a measure, PolitiFact New Jersey found. The idea comes from a Pennsylvania congressman’s proposal. U.S. Rep. Chaka Fattah, a Democrat, first advanced the concept in the House in 2004 when he introduced a bill that would have required a study on eliminating all federal taxes on individuals and corporations and replacing that revenue stream with transaction fees. The bill had no co-sponsors and died in committee. Fattah introduced similar legislation several times after his first attempt calling for a study. Only one of those bills gained a co-sponsor, but none of them made it out of committee. In 2010, Fattah ditched the calls for a study and introduced a bill -- called the "Debt Free America Act" -- to implement a one-percent transaction fee on "any transaction that uses a payment instrument, including any check, cash, credit card, transfer of stock, bonds, or other financial instrument." Any transactions involving stocks were excluded from the fee. With the fee, the bill "intended to raise sufficient revenue to eliminate the national debt" and "phase out the income tax on individuals." The Debt Free America Act is the legislation the e-mail claims Obama and his financial team are recommending, though it’s the work of one congressman and the proposal never left committee. Since the e-mail, a version of which PolitiFact Rhode Island deemed Pants on Fire in November 2010, started circulating, Fattah reintroduced the legislation. The most recent bill, introduced in March 2011, still applies a one-percent transaction fee, but excludes personal bank account transactions in addition to transactions involving stocks. It has no co-sponsors and was again referred to committee, where it remains. Our ruling An e-mail claims that the president’s finance team recommends a "1% tax on all transactions at any financial institution." That’s ridiculous. A Pennsylvania congressman has sponsored a bill that would levy a one-percent fee on some financial transactions. But nearly every year he has introduced the legislation it gained no support. And none of the bills have ever left committee. Obama -- and his financial team -- have nothing to do with the legislation. We set this e-mail claim ablaze. Pants on Fire!

pomt-07505	Says the Beaumont school district’s superintendent is the highest-paid in the state.	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/apr/11/stefani-carter/texas-rep-stefani-carter-says-beaumont-schools-chi/	Discussing the state budget with three fellow freshman Texas House members and Texas Tribune editor Evan Smith, Republican Stefani Carter of Dallas said she sees room for cuts in the "administrative side" of the state’s public schools. As an example, she highlighted the Beaumont school district, where, she said, "the superintendent is making $356,000 a year." That prompted Smith, who interviewed the freshmen Feb. 16, to interject: "In fact, among the highest-paid if not the highest-paid school superintendent in the state." Carter agreed: "The highest-paid. And it’s a very tiny school district. So, things are out of whack. ... Superintendents should not be paid a salary increase unless the voters say so." We wondered if the Beaumont school chief’s pay is tops in the state. Carter’s chief of staff, Taurie Randermann, pointed us to the Tribune’s superintendent salary database, which indicates that Beaumont ISD leader Carrol Thomas’ base pay has been the highest in the state for the past three school years. This school year, Thomas’ salary is $347,834, according to the database, which was built with information from the Texas Education Agency. The Tribune’s database also calculates each superintendent’s pay per student. This school year, the Beaumont district has about 20,000 students, which means Thomas’ base pay is about $17 per student. Terry Grier — head of the state’s largest school district, Houston ISD, which has about 200,000 students — earns about $1.50 in salary per pupil. Overall, Grier’s $300,000 salary is the sixth-highest in the state, according to the Tribune database. The $283,412 annual salary of Austin district chief Meria Carstarphen ranks No. 10 on the list. That makes her per-pupil pay about $3 a year. We confirmed the Tribune’s salary information with TEA’s own rankings, current as of October 2010. Agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us that the average annual salary for Texas superintendents is $119,080. But that’s the average in a state with more than 1,000 districts, about 80 percent of which have less than 3,000 students. Mary Barrett, assistant director of compensation services at the Texas Association of School Boards, told us that the group’s annual survey of superintendent salaries and benefits found that half of reported salaries are less than $105,000 and 75 percent are less than $138,000. (The association’s report is based on surveys sent to Texas school districts. This year, 79 percent responded. Beaumont was not among them.) How does Thomas’ salary compare with superintendents in similar-sized school districts? According to the association, the average superintendent salary in districts with between 10,000 and 24,999 students this year is $191,316. So, why is the Beaumont superintendent’s salary higher? In a Dec. 17, 2009, news article, the Tribune wrote that Thomas’ "high salary may reflect his uncommon longevity: He’s been leading Beaumont since 1996 — a tenure tantamount to eternity in the hyper-politicized, high-turnover world of urban education." As of this year, Texas superintendents had held their posts an average of five years, Barrett said. A Nov. 17 article in the Beaumont Enterprise said that when Thomas was hired in December 1995, "the district was embroiled in a bitter battle among (school) board members who were split along racial lines, with student performance that was well below the state average." TEA monitors had taken control of the board, according to the article. The article says that Thomas’ initial annual salary was $152,800. That compared with a 1996 average superintendent salary of $103,407 in school districts with 10,000 to 25,000 students, according to Barrett. Ratcliffe told us that the Beaumont district was willing to pay Thomas a high salary because the district was grappling with serious problems when he was hired. "And he’s turned a lot of those schools around, so they’ve given him good raises along the way," she said. His contract, which the district sent to us, provides for a 3.9 percent annual raise dependent on a positive review from the school board. The average superintendent pay raise for this year was 3.3 percent, Barrett said. In a March 25 article, the Tribune reported that "student achievement in Beaumont has climbed steadily for the past 15 years even as the state has moved to the more rigorous Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills tests and required more students to be included in the testing." However, according to the article, Thomas’ salary and the school district’s spending have become issues in Beaumont, where residents in May will vote on an initiative to change election procedures for the school board. But there’s more to superintendent compensation than salary: The district leaders also receive perks — which vary considerably among districts — such as bonuses and car allowances. We wondered how those compare among Texas superintendents with the highest base salaries. That information proved tougher to get. Ratcliffe told us that the education agency doesn’t keep data on superintendents’ total compensation packages. The school board association tracks the most common extras, including allowances for cell phone or home Internet service, bonus payments, professional organization membership dues and car allowances, Barrett told us — but the data is only for use by association members. However, she did say that the top 10 compensation packages ranged from $338,000 to $443,000. Thomas’ salary alone puts him in that group. We attempted to conduct our own total compensation analysis, starting with Thomas. Beyond his $347,834 salary, Thomas’ contract shows that he receives a monthly "supplemental allowance" of $1,000. And Jessie Haynes, a spokeswoman for the district, told us that Thomas’ annual health and dental insurance benefits are about $6,800. The district also pays about $10,500 a year in premiums for his life and professional legal liability insurance and about $1,500 a year in membership dues to professional and civic organizations. That brings Thomas’ total package to about $379,000. How does that compare to his counterparts? Of the superintendents with the highest salaries in Texas, we were able to track down enough information to calculate nearly complete totals for Melody Johnson of the Fort Worth school district (No. 4 in TEA's salary rankings) and Grier of the Houston district (No. 6 in salary). Johnson, whose district has about 80,000 students, earns an annual salary of $328,950 and receives an automobile allowance of $600 per month. According to district spokesman Clint Bond, the district also pays $1,426 per year in membership dues to a professional organization, $4,475 for an annual disability insurance premium and $2,940 for health insurance. Johnson’s total: about $345,000. In addition to his $300,000 salary, Grier receives $1,200 per month for an automobile allowance and $400 per month for a cell phone, according to his contract. The district also pays $2,485 annually for dues and fees to professional and civic organizations, and this year, Grier will get $21,150 in supplemental salary payments. In January, the district paid $30,000 into a special retirement account for Grier, in addition to awarding him a performance-based bonus of $18,001 for the 2009-10 school year. Grier’s total, without health insurance: about $391,000. Our research also indicates that the total compensation package of Dallas school district Superintendent Michael Hinojosa is likely bigger than that of Thomas. Hinojosa’s salary of $332,832 — in a district that serves more than 150,000 students — ranks third on the education agency’s list of superintendent salaries. Add to that $450 per month for his cell phone, $23,464 in extra payments to the Teacher Retirement System of Texas and a $15,000 annuity, and you get more than $376,000. That doesn’t count professional dues, annual premiums for disability and professional liability insurance, performance-based bonuses,and health insurance — all benefits noted in Hinojosa’s contract. We requested that information from the district but had not received any answers as of press time. In the Austin school district, which has about 86,000 students, Carstarphen’s benefits include $12,000 a year for automobile allowance, a $15,000 annuity and $5,377 in health insurance. The district also pays $9,953 per year for a long-term disability insurance policy and $1,046 for a life insurance policy. And in August, Carstarphen was awarded a bonus of $41,500 for meeting performance goals for the 2009-10 school year. (She has waived any bonus tied to this school year.) Her total: about $368,000. Readers may note that none of these compensation packages approaches the $443,000 high-end figure mentioned by Barrett; we’re still awaiting information that would confirm which district is spending that amount. We checked in with lawyer Neal Adams, who, according to the Tribune’s March 25 story, has negotiated most superintendent contracts in the state since 1987 as general counsel for the Texas Association of School Administrators. When we asked him whether he knew of any superintendents with higher compensation packages than Thomas', he said he didn’t have specific numbers but that there were probably some. So, where does that leave us? On the Tribune panel, Carter said the Beaumont schools chief was the highest-paid in Texas. He does have the highest salary, although Carter misquoted the exact figure. But additional perks are a significant portion of superintendents’ compensation and cannot be ignored. In terms of total compensation, Thomas is among the highest-paid, but our research indicates that at least a couple of superintendents get more. We rate Carter’s statement Half True. UPDATE, noon, April, 14, 2011: After our item was published, we received information from the Fort Bend school district, in the southwestern suburbs of Houston, about the 2010 compensation package of Superintendent Timothy Jenney. It exceeded that of the Beaumont schools chief. According to the TEA data, Jenney’s salary of $260,339 ranked No. 24 in the state. In addition to that, according to his contract, he received $9,600 a year for a car allowance and $4,200 for a cell phone and other technology. The district paid about $35,000 that year for Jenney’s life insurance and disability income protection insurance. For the year, Jenney received a performance-based contribution of $36,000 to a retirement plan and a $26,000 supplemental salary payment, plus a $20,000 annuity payment. Sum total: about $390,000.

pomt-06725	"The health insurance plan that (members of Congress) have is no different than any other federal employee's in the United States government."	true	/florida/statements/2011/aug/30/steve-southerland/southerland-says-his-health-insurance-no-different/	U.S. Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Panama City, is just eight months into his first House term. But he's already developed something of a reputation for his blunt comments and bold approach. Southerland paid a visit to a Tallahassee retirement home during Congress' annual August recess, where Westminster Oaks community residents asked Southerland about a variety of topics, including the future of entitlement programs including Social Security and Medicare. Somehow, according to an account provided by the Tallahassee Democrat, the forum turned to the perks (and mythical perks) of being in elected office. Southerland, a funeral home owner before his congressional run, assured the crowd that his salary ($174,000) is not excessive given the amount of hours required of House members. Plus, he said, he had to give up his role in the family business to comply with Congress' conflict-of-interest rules. "And by the way, did I mention? They're shooting at us. There is law-enforcement security in this room right now, and why is that?" he said. "If you think this job pays too much, with those kinds of risks and cutting me off from my family's business, I'll just tell you: This job doesn't mean that much to me. I had a good life in Panama City." His comments about working for the federal government didn't end there. An elderly woman asked if it would help the country's economic problems if more people could get the same health insurance that federal and state employees, including Florida Gov. Rick Scott, enjoy. Her tone was "accusatory," Southerland said in an interview with PolitiFact Florida, and he got defensive in reply. He told her he selected his Blue Cross Blue Shield plan from several options presented to him upon taking office, just like other rank-and-file federal employees. "The health insurance plan that I have is no different than any other federal employee's in the United States government," said Southerland. "I pay my portion." The woman's question wasn't unusual. Southerland said constituents ask him about members' supposed "instant pensions" and free health insurance all the time. Reporters from the Los Angeles Times and our friends at FactCheck.org investigated members' taxpayer-subsidized pay and benefits in summer 2009 as Congress debated health care reform. Southerland's claim about members of Congress getting the same health insurance option as career federal employees presented us with a different take. We wondered if he had it right. A primer about health care plans for federal workers The federal government is the nation's largest employer with more than 2 million employees. That makes its health care program, the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program, the largest employer-sponsored health insurance program. About 8 million people -- including most active federal employees, 1.9 million federal retirees, their spouses and children -- obtain private health insurance through enrollment in the federal program. This setup offers many different plans through an insurance exchange and is overseen by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. In 2011, the program offered 207 total plan options, including fee-for-service plans, HMOs and high-deductible health insurance plan options with a tax-advantaged account. The plans cover a variety of services, including hospital visits, surgeries, mental health, prescription drugs, emergency care and "catastrophic" benefits. An employee's plan selection is limited to providers near his or her home (and family). The most popular plan is offered by Blue Cross Blue Shield and covers 62 percent of federal employees and retirees. This year, the bi-weekly employee premium contribution for individual and family plans under standard Blue Cross Blue Shield coverage would cost $199.20. Blue Cross Blue Shield basic coverage would cost $122.53. Taxpayers pick up about 75 percent of the premium, and employees contribute the rest, according to the Office of Personnel Management. It's a process very similar to private industry practice, but private employers generally contribute more toward employees' plans, according to a 2007 study by the Congressional Research Service about congressional health benefits. And federal employees have a wider plan selection than private-sector employees, said Pete Sepp, spokesman for the National Taxpayers Union, a nonprofit organization that scrutinizes government and taxes. "They can buy into HMOs, straight insurance, health savings accounts, all kinds of options," Sepp said. "Whereas in the private sector with a given company, you may only have a handful." The same buffet of plans is available to federal government workers and members of Congress, experts we talked to said. They pick the plan that is best for them, and they pay the same price. In short, there is no discount for members of Congress, or their staffs. Other Congress-only benefits So Southerland is right that he has the same insurance arrangement as all other federal employees. Experts, however, pointed to a couple of things he's leaving out. First, Southerland could have mentioned that federal employees "have one of the most generous health care plans in the country," said David Williams, president of Taxpayers Protection Alliance, a nonprofit group that monitors government spending. For instance, federal employees are not required to have medical examinations and cannot be excluded based on pre-existing conditions. And there are also no waiting periods before their insurance kicks in. "It's a lot more generous than the private sector," Williams said. On top of that, members of Congress do have two optional health perks that not all other federal employees enjoy. One is use of the Office of the Attending Physician, a low-profile Navy clinic on the Capitol's first floor that offers basic medical services to members, Hill staffers and sickness-stricken tourists. The clinic was started in 1928 to respond to accidents and emergencies on the Hill, according to a July 2011 profile of the operation by the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call. Members can opt to regularly access the clinic for services such as X-rays, flu shots and physical therapy at an annual fee of $503. The other is access to medical and emergency treatment at military hospitals. There's no charge for outpatient care at Bethesda Naval Hospital (or at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, though it has closed). Southerland, who entered office in January, said in an interview with PolitiFact Florida he did not know about either service. "I've not needed a doctor since I've been there," he said. As an aside, Southerland's comments about his salary sparked criticism from national Democrats, who said Southerland was out of touch with his Panhandle district. "While he's complaining about only making $174,000, his constituents are struggling to put food on the table, keep a roof over their head or find a job," Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Adam Hodge said. Southerland told us that the original story about his comments left out the "positive" things he said he enjoyed about being in office. Moreover, he told the audience of retirees that he would answer any question about what life and compensation is like for freshman members. "At no time was I complaining," he said. "I was explaining." Our ruling Back to the claim at hand. Southerland said his health insurance plan is no different from "any other federal employee's" in the country. The key here is his use of the phrase health insurance plan. While Southerland does get some extra health care benefits as a result of being a member of Congress, his choices of insurance plans are the same as every federal employee using the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. He doesn't get a discount, or free coverage, just because he is a member of Congress. So we rate this claim True.

"Does anybody think spending $14.5 billion on temp census workers is good for the country in the long run?" Beck asked. "What would our grandparents say?" Beck then took issue with the cost of the 2010 Census. "The 2000 Census cost $4.5 billion," Beck said. "The 2010 Census is set to cost up to $14.5 billion." That'd be more than a 200 percent increase, and so we decided to check it out. Beck was accurate about the cost of the 2010 census. But that's not a one-year expense. It's the accumulation of 10 years worth of census work. At the U.S. Census, they talk about the "life cycle" cost of their decennial census counts, because each is the product of years and years of work. According to the U.S. Census Bureau's budget estimates presented to Congress in February, 2010 -- after factoring in appropriations from 2002 through 2009 plus the president's budget request for 2010 -- the estimated life cycle cost of the 2010 Census program is $14.8 billion. That includes census funds in the economic stimulus package passed in 2009. But Beck is off on the cost of the 2000 Census. Adjusted for inflation (the only fair way to compare costs over time), the life cycle cost of the 2000 census was $8.2 billion. Still, that's a pretty hefty jump -- about 80 percent. Some context, however, is in order. For starters, there were simply more homes to count in 2010 than in 2000. In 2000, there were 117.5 million housing units; and in 2010 there were an estimated 133.8 million. That's a nearly 14 percent increase. But there's more to the story than just adjusting for inflation and growth in the population that needs to be accounted for. The budget report notes that the cost of conducting a census has historically gone up over time. Even adjusted for inflation, the cost per housing unit went from $14 in 1970; to $29 in 1980; to $40 in 1990; and to $70 in 2000. The estimated cost per household in 2010 was $111. "Several factors that are independent of programmatic methodology contribute to this phenomenon," the report states. "For example, a desire for accurate coverage of a growing and increasingly diverse population adds complexity to each census. Also, experience reveals that people have become more resistant to answering surveys and providing information to the government. Adding to these difficulties is increased immigration and its diversity of languages and cultures, which creates challenges in maintaining a wholly inclusive census." The report notes that the average percentage increase in unit cost for the three previous census cycles was 71.5 percent. But the percentage increase for the 2010 Census was 58.5 percent. Officials with the U.S. Census Bureau make one other point about the increased cost of the 2010 Census. It incorporated two major shifts in responsibility. Starting in 2005 (which again is all part of the 2010 Census "life cycle") the Census Bureau began conducting an annual American Community Survey, in which it collects detailed household information that used to only be collected once every decade from those who got the census' long form. And the Census Bureau began a multi-year effort that includes the use of global positioning system (GPS) technology to modernize and enhance the capabilities of the nation's road map. In other words, the mission of the 2010 Census was different than it was in decades past. And while we're fact-checking the change in the cost of the census from 2000 to 2010, Census Bureau spokeswoman Shelly Lowe couldn't let Beck's comment about "spending $14.5 billion on temp census workers" go unchallenged. In fact, she said, the cost of the temporary workforce was slightly more than $2 billion. Beck's overall point that the cost of the 2010 Census went up considerably from 2000 to 2010 is accurate. But adjusted for inflation, it didn't go up as dramatically as he said. Using Beck's numbers, the change was more than 200 percent. But when you balance the cost to account for inflation and the fact that there were more homes to count, the increased cost was just under 60 percent. The Census Bureau also works differently than it did in past decades. For one, it now does an annual American Community Survey. Those kinds of details are important for an apples-to-apples comparison. And so we rate Beck's statement Half True.	None	Glenn Beck	None	None	None	2010-06-11T15:51:18	2010-06-07	['None']
pomt-14558	"Obama spent $7 billion to bring electricity to Africa, failed miserably."	pants on fire!	/global-news/statements/2016/feb/11/daniel-greenfield/blogger-mangles-info-african-electification-aid-pr/	Critics of American foreign aid often say the dollars are wasted. Daniel Greenfield, a fellow with the David Horowitz Freedom Center, a conservative think tank, put that argument at the top of an article that appeared on one of the center’s websites. "Obama spent $7 billion to bring electricity to Africa, failed miserably," went the headline in Greenfield’s piece, which was originally published July 31, 2015, but has continued to make the rounds. Greenfield then offered a copy-and-paste of several paragraphs from an op-ed written by two researchers at the University of California-Berkeley. Their point was that even if African nations were able to produce more power, millions of people would still lack service because the electric grid doesn’t reach them. We’ll get to problems of the grid and reliability in a bit, but the larger issue, and the focus of this fact-check, is whether the Obama administration has actually spent $7 billion to boost electric capacity in Africa. We reached out to Greenfield and did not hear back. The Power Africa initiative In June 2013, President Barack Obama unveiled Power Africa, a broad partnership among many donors, private companies and Sub-Saharan African nations to double access to power in the region. The lack of reliable service, or simply any electricity at all, is a major stumbling block to enterprise in this part of the world. According to the International Energy Agency which represents 29 countries dependent on foreign oil, two-thirds of the people in Sub-Saharan Africa don’t have power. Obama’s initiative aims to add 10,000 megawatts of generating capacity and make electricity more available to 20 million households and businesses. To make that happen, the administration said it would commit more than $7 billion over five years. The lion’s share of the total -- $5 billion -- would come from the Export-Import Bank, which offers both direct loans and insurance to back-up the deals American companies make with overseas buyers. Another government body, the Overseas Private Investment Corporation, would provide about $1.5 billion in direct loans or loan guarantees to do much the same thing. For example, if General Electric built power plants in Ghana, Ghana would be required to pay for the project, and U.S. insurance would make sure General Electric got its money should Ghana fall short. The Power Africa initiative is the starting point for statements about Obama spending $7 billion on electric projects in Africa. The key flaw in Greenfield’s assertion is the program has been slow to get off the ground. When Greenfield wrote his piece, only about a quarter of the total funds had been committed. The status of Power Africa According to the U.S. Agency for International Development, as of August 2015, about $1.7 billion in aid had been obligated. That includes over $1 billion in project financing aid from the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and about $600 million in technical assistance from USAID. Whether all of that $1.7 billion (or $2.1 billion if you include a new project announced in October) represents actual spending lies somewhat in the eye of the beholder. The Export-Import Bank generates a return on its loans and its default rate is low. In 2014, it delivered over $670 million in profits to the U.S. Treasury. Point being, money comes back. But even under the broadest definition of spending, Power Africa has spent much less than half of its earmarked money while it’s now about two and a half years into a five-year effort. Deborah Brautigam directs the International Development Program at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Brautigam told PolitiFact that a big part of the problem was the congressional battle in 2014 over reauthorizing the Export-Import Bank. "When Congress didn’t reauthorize the Ex-Im Bank, they couldn’t initiate any new projects," Brautigam said. Some Republicans criticized the bank as a case of the government picking winners and losers, which was out of step with free-market principles. The bank’s authorization lapsed at the end of September 2014, and a deal to put it back in business didn’t emerge until December 2015. Another problem was Power Africa relies on private companies to decide it makes sense to invest in a given African country. Brautigam said the government can’t force firms to move forward. Producing power vs. getting it to people The op-ed piece that Greenfield cited was focused on a specific part of the electricity puzzle in Africa. The challenge isn’t simply to generate electricity. The power grid to move it around is sorely underdeveloped, too. The researchers who wrote that item studied the situation in Kenya. They found that just 30 percent of Kenyans are connected to the grid, and in rural areas, only 5 percent of households and 20 percent of businesses within a half-mile of the grid are connected. They didn’t criticize Power Africa so much as describe its limitations. Co-author Edward Miguel, an economist at the University of California-Berkeley, said Greenfield’s piece distorted the Kenyan research. "It is a bit disappointing, to say the least, when someone runs with your research and writing and grossly misinterprets it," Miguel said. "I would prefer for Power Africa to focus on some different areas, but much of the funding appears to be going into investments that are useful." Rudy Gharib, spokewoman for Power Africa, said many of the early projects focused on boosting generating capacity "because of the long lead time needed to get those deals online and because most countries are facing capacity shortages and it is not possible to connect large numbers of new customers without addressing the issue of there not being enough power on the grid." Our ruling Greenfield said that Obama had spent $7 billion and failed to bring electricity to Africa. The projected dollar total was correct, but the statement missed the reality that as of August 2015, only about $1.7 billion had been committed. And a lot of the money that will be committed will be in the form of loans or loan guarantees, not gifts. How can you declare failure on a project that isn't yet completed? We rate this claim Pants on Fire.	None	Daniel Greenfield	None	None	None	2016-02-11T10:00:00	2015-07-30	['Africa', 'Barack_Obama']
pomt-13141	Says Donald Trump wants to deport "our Dreamers."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/nov/01/priorities-usa-action/pro-clinton-pac-says-trump-wants-deport-millions-i/	An ad by a political action committee supporting Hillary Clinton spotlights Donald Trump’s comments on deporting undocumented immigrant families. The ad, launched by Priorities USA Action on Sept. 28, is narrated in Spanish and includes snippets of media interviews in which the Republican presidential candidate firmly said he would deport people in the country illegally. It starts with Trump’s voice saying "this is a country where we speak English, not Spanish" over an image of a woman and two children sitting at a dining table. "Donald Trump wants to see us disappear," a female voice says in Spanish. It then cuts to a November 2015 MSNBC interview where Trump said "you are going to have a deportation force." "Trump will capture and deport millions, even our Dreamers," the narrator says in Spanish as images of a family and what appears to be a student fade away. Trump has not been consistent on his deportation plans. But in his immigration speech in Arizona on Aug. 31, Trump emphasized deportation priorities and the removal of "at least 2 million" "criminal aliens." He also said those who are here illegally and want lawful status, "will have one route and only one route: to return home and apply for re-entry." There’s an estimated 11 million people living illegally in the United States. For this fact-check, we focused on whether or not Trump wants to deport people in the country illegally who arrived in the United States as children, a subset of the undocumented population referred to as Dreamers. Who are Dreamers? "Dreamers" is a term used by advocates for potential beneficiaries of the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act, or the DREAM Act, which has stalled in Congress. President Barack Obama’s administration in 2012 announced a program to help this group of undocumented immigrants, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. It allowed those who met certain guidelines to apply for work permits and for deportation reprieve for two years, subject to renewal. Pew Research Center in 2012 estimated there were 4.4 million unauthorized immigrants ages 30 and under, and that up to 1.7 million were potentially eligible for DACA. Data through June 2016 shows 741,546 individuals nationwide have been approved for DACA. Obama in 2014 sought to offer deportation relief to more people through two more programs: an expanded version of DACA, and a new program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents, or DAPA. While the initial deferred-action program is still active, the expansions are on hold after a Supreme Court deadlock. About 5 million people might be eligible for the halted initiatives, or just less than half of the nation’s undocumented population. Trump’s position Trump would "immediately terminate President Obama’s two illegal executive amnesties," according to his 10-point immigration plan. (Neither program granted citizenship, but deferred deportation and allowed immigrants to apply for permission to work.) Trump’s plan says his administration would enforce all immigration laws and set priorities — including the removal of criminals, gang members and visa overstays. "Anyone who has entered the United States illegally is subject to deportation — that is what it means to have laws and to have a country," his plan says. It is not clear if Trump would cancel the existing deferred-action program or just not issue any new ones, said Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors stricter immigration policies. Toward the end of his immigration speech, Trump also said that after building a wall, ending illegal immigration, and accomplishing enforcement and deportation goals, "then and only then will we be in a position to consider the appropriate disposition of those individuals who remain." Priorities USA led us to a July 2015 CNN interview between Trump and Dana Bash, where she asked him specifically whether or not he would deport Dreamers. Trump responded with a mixed message. "It's a tough situation," Trump said. "We're going to do something. And one of the things we're going to do is expedite. When somebody is terrific, we want them back here. They have to be legally." Bash asked if they have to leave. "They're with their parents. It depends. But look, it sounds cold, and it sounds hard," Trump said. "We have a country. Our country is going to hell. We have to have a system where people are legally in our country." A Priorities spokesperson noted other media reports saying Trump would deport all immigrants in the country illegally, including Dreamers, that he would rescind Obama’s deferred action programs, and that undocumented immigrants seeking relief from Obama’s executive actions "could expose themselves to Trump’s mass deportation plan." Hypothetically, Trump could revoke the deferred action status of DACA recipients, which in turn would terminate their employment authorization and render them subject to removal, said Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, an immigration law expert and professor at Pennsylvania State University. "However the biggest impediment to deporting this cohort of immigrants would be the resources it would take to apprehend, detain, charge, try and remove so-called Dreamers," Wadhia said. "If he wanted to, he could target the vast majority of Dreamers for removal but it would not be easy or quick — it would likely take years to implement." Our ruling A Priorities USA Action ad said, "Trump wants to deport millions, even our Dreamers." Trump has made clear he would deport millions. More recently in the campaign, Trump said he would set priorities, starting with at least 2 million "criminal aliens." He has given mixed messages on the timeline of deportations for people who don’t pose safety threats. Trump has also said he would terminate Obama administration programs that defer deportation for undocumented people who arrived in the United States as children. If that happens, Dreamers may be subject to deportation. In interviews, Trump has been slightly more sympathetic to this group, calling their situation "tough." At the same time, he has consistently said all immigrants here illegally will have to go, but "terrific" ones could have their return expedited.

pomt-03305	A provision of the Senate immigration bill would require you to have government permission to get a second job.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/30/charles-kuck/immigration-claim-about-second-jobs-doesnt-really-/	The U.S. Senate passed its version of an overhaul of U.S. immigration law late last month, and debate over the legislation has been nonstop. (The U.S. House plans to take up its immigration bill in the fall.) Georgia immigration attorney Charles Kuck discussed provisions of the bill during a forum at a northwest Georgia college last month. The bill would affect the entire nation, not just the 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the United States, he said. But it was Kuck’s comments about the E-Verify mandate, captured in The Rome News-Tribune, that caught our attention. "When you want to get a second job, you’ll get what’s called a ‘tentative nonconfirmation’ that says somebody’s used this ID to work somewhere else," Kuck said. "So you have to have government permission to get a second job." We at PolitiFact Georgia have been known to moonlight outside our fact-checking assignments, so we decided to investigate Kuck’s claim about needing approval for more work. Kuck supports changing immigration law, is a board member of the Georgia Association of Latino Elected Officials and is a frequent commentator on national news programs. He told us his statement was based on the experiences of two of his Atlanta-area clients. When they applied for second jobs and their personal information was run through the E-Verify system, they were told by their potential employers that the identifications associated with their Social Security numbers were being used elsewhere. In this case, the identifications were being used by the men at their first jobs, so there was no fraudulent activity. But the mandate could cause unintended consequences for all workers, Kuck said. The Senate immigration bill includes a provision mandating employers enroll in the federal E-Verify program within five years. Just what is E-Verify? E-Verify is a federal Internet-based system that allows employers to verify that their workers are authorized to work in the United States. The system compares information from a worker’s employment verification form with federal data records to confirm employment eligibility. When the information doesn’t match, potential workers receive a "tentative nonconfirmation" from the government, which they can contest within eight days. The system is meant to prevent ineligible people from getting jobs, and it can also catch fraudulent activity, including identity theft. Although not nationally mandated for private employers, some have voluntarily enrolled in the program for more than a decade. Georgia requires all but the smallest private employers to use the online work authorization program. Before the Senate bill’s passage, there was criticism about potential problems E-Verify could create for legal workers. Testimony in April 2011 by officials from the U.S. Government Accountability Office officials noted that agencies have improved the program but challenges remained. Based on a report of fiscal 2009 data, the government reduced the number of eligible employees not automatically confirmed by E-Verify from about 8 percent to 2.6 percent. Of that lower figure, slightly more than one out of every 10 of those people were determined to be work-eligible after they contested the "tentative nonconfirmation" ruling and fixed errors in their records. The remainder, or 189,000 people, were never able to resolve their problems. It was unclear whether they were notified by their employers of their right to contest the ruling, whether they independently decided not to contest it or whether they were not eligible to work. Statistics found on the federal E-Verify website show that the number of people not automatically confirmed to work has dropped to 1.35 percent. Nearly one in five of those people contested and fixed the initial ruling. The rest weren’t able to resolve their problems or didn’t contest the findings. Critics, such as Chris Calabrese of the American Civil Liberties Union, say that even with a relatively low error rate, E-Verify imposes a burden on those Americans who will be wrongfully denied an opportunity to earn a living. We checked with several immigration experts about the possible employment problems with the E-Verify system. In theory, Kuck’s argument appears to be correct, said Carolina Antonini, an immigration attorney and professor at Georgia State University. None of her clients has experienced issues similar to Kuck’s clients. It would probably depend on the circumstances, said John Feere, a legal policy analyst with the Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies, which favors tighter immigration controls. In terms of using E-Verify as a mechanism to prevent identity theft, "it would make sense that if the government saw that I was taking on several other jobs, then the government would alert me," he said. "Does it happen as soon as a person applies for a second job? I’m not sure." Philip Wolgin, an immigration expert at the liberal Center for American Progress, said Kuck may be confusing another provision of the Senate bill that allows people to lock their own Social Security number to prevent identity theft. "There is nothing in the (Senate) bill or in the E-Verify program that flags people who apply for multiple jobs as tentatively nonconfirmed," Wolgin said, "and there is certainly nothing that forces people to ask the government for permission to work a second job." So is Kuck correct that you would need government permission to get a second job? The Senate bill includes a mandate for all employers to begin using the electronic employment verification system E-Verify within four years. That system flags workers whose employee data doesn’t match federal documents. But program and independent data show that most workers are automatically confirmed in the E-Verify system. It is possible that an employee whose Social Security number, for example, being used for one job could be flagged when that same number is used to secure another job. But it would most likely occur with multiple uses of the same information. Kuck’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rated his claim Half True.

pomt-13226	Says Hillary Clinton's "plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-predicts-hillary-clinton-will-double-/	One of the planned topics for the third presidential debate in Las Vegas was the economy, so tax policy came up in the face-off between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. At one point, Trump said of Clinton’s tax proposal, "Her plan is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes." Is that correct? Independent experts who have modeled the candidates’ tax proposals said that would be the exception rather than the rule. First, a quick summary of Clinton’s tax plan, which includes tax increases for the wealthy. Clinton proposes a 4 percent surcharge on income earned in excess of $5 million as well as a minimum tax rate of 30 percent for those earning more than $1 million. She would also limit certain exemptions and deductions to 28 percent; she would tax carried interest, a type of income typically earned by hedge fund managers, as ordinary income; and she would permanently reduce the tax threshold for estates to $3.5 million, or $7 million for married couples, while increasing the top estate tax rate to 45 percent. The general impact of these changes will be to raise taxes on the richest Americans. An analysis by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center concluded that "in 2017, taxpayers in the top 1 percent of the income distribution -- those with incomes above $730,000 in 2015 dollars -- would see their tax burdens increase more than $78,000." However, taxpayers in the bottom 95 percent of the income spectrum -- those earning less than $300,000 -- "would see little change in average after-tax income," the Tax Policy Center found. The Tax Foundation, which generally favors lower taxes, broadly concurred in its own analysis. Without accounting for the plan’s impact on the broader economy, "Clinton’s tax plan would raise taxes on the top 20 percent of taxpayers and cut taxes for taxpayers in all other income quintiles," the foundation’s analysis said. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung told PolitiFact that "Clinton will double tax rates on short-term capital gains." The campaign pointed to an article from Fox Business that explained Clinton’s proposal to levy higher taxes on investments held for a short period of time than on investments held for longer periods. "Under Clinton’s proposal, investments held between one and two years would be taxed at the normal income-tax rate of 39.6 percent, nearly double the existing 20 percent capital gains rate," the article said. However, Trump said "your taxes," suggesting that lots of Americans would be hit by Clinton’s tax increases. That’s a stretch, since, as noted in the Fox Business article the Trump camp pointed to, "only the top 0.5 percent of taxpayers would be impacted by the plan." We asked representatives of both groups whether they thought Trump’s comment was broadly accurate. "It may be possible to find a very specific case where this is true, but her plan would only raise taxes modestly and would actually cut taxes for many people," said Kyle Pomerleau, director of federal projects at the Tax Foundation. Roberton Williams, a fellow at the Tax Policy Center, said that if you parse his group’s analysis, it shows that, on average, the top 0.1 percent of taxpayers would see their effective tax rate go up from 34.4 percent to 41.5 percent -- almost a 21 percent increase. That’s a significant bump, but it’s far from double. Meanwhile, the bottom 80 percent would see tax cuts, he said, while those in the 80th to 95th percentiles would get small tax increases, on the order of about 0.1 percent, Williams said. "I suppose some cases could be imagined where taxes would rise a lot," Williams said. "Perhaps a person who has carried interest could see their tax rate go from the 23.8 percent top capital gains rate to a 47.4 percent marginal tax rate on income in excess of $5 million. With enough of that type of income, that person's taxes would go up a lot." Also, Clinton’s proposed minimum tax rate of 30 percent for those earning more than $1 million -- commonly known as the Buffett Rule -- could conceivably double taxation for people who are lucky enough to be paying a rate under 15 percent today, he said. (The Buffett Rule is named after Warren Buffett, who has criticized the fact that he is often taxed at a lower rate than his secretary.) But both of those scenarios are "very rare" cases, Williams said. Our ruling Trump said that Clinton’s tax proposal "is going to raise taxes and even double your taxes." Independent analyses found that the vast majority of taxpayers would see tax cuts or no change to their tax bill under the Clinton plan. The richest taxpayers would see increases -- and the very richest could see significant increases -- but even the typical rich taxpayer would not see their taxes double. Analysts said it’s possible that specific wealthy taxpayers with a certain confluence of income streams might see their taxes double, but that would be the exception that proves the rule.

pomt-10291	McCain's attacks on Obama are 'not true,' 'false,' 'baloney,' according to media outlets.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/14/barack-obama/off-on-the-wrong-footnotes/	An Obama TV ad called "Low Road" begins with an image of McCain and the announcer stating, "He's practicing the politics of the past." The ad then takes a page from movie trailers that steal snippets from movie reviews as part of their advertising campaign. As the image of McCain speaking at a lectern freezes in black and white, the narrator says "His attacks on Obama...'Not True'" as the citation, MSNBC 7/28/08, flashes on the screen. The announcer keeps reading, "'False' (FactCheck.org 7/28/08)...'Baloney' (USA Today Editorial 7/29/08)...'the low road' (New York Times Editorial) 7/30/08...'baseless' (Time 7/30/08). We decided to look at these citations to see if they say what the Obama campaign says they do. Let's take them one by one. The first quote, from MSNBC, relates to a McCain campaign ad which criticized Obama for his last-minute decision to cancel a visit with wounded troops in Germany during a recent tour of Europe. "He made time to go to the gym, but canceled a visit with wounded troops," an announcer in the McCain ad states. "Seems the Pentagon wouldn't allow him to bring cameras." We at PolitiFact looked into this claim at the time and concluded that the McCain ad was stretching the truth. We called it Barely True. In a July 28 television interview with Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., MSNBC reporter Andrea Mitchell called the McCain ad "literally not true" and said that she could attest - as a member of the traveling press corps - that Obama had no intention of bringing cameras with him to visit wounded troops. The second snippet, "False," from FactCheck.org also refers to this same alleged snubbing of wounded troops in Germany. "McCain's facts are literally true, but his insinuation — that the visit was canceled because of the press ban or the desire for gym time – is false," the item states. The last quote — "baseless" — from Time also refers to this same issue. Reporter Karen Tumulty, in the magazine's Swampland blog, wrote "So how many more times are the McCain campaign and the Republicans going to repeat what is a thoroughly baseless charge?" The "baloney" quote from a USA Today editorial (and the Obama camp gets points for noting that it was an editorial), relates to a McCain campaign ad that suggests Obama is to blame for the high price of gas. "Even by the elastic standards of political ads, this is more than a stretch," the editorial states. "It's baloney." The final quote — "the low road" — comes from a New York Times editorial (again, the ad notes that it is an editorial). Actually, the phrase is borrowed from the headline, "Low-Road Express." The editorial takes McCain to task for a litany of what it characterizes as false charges against Obama. Among them, "that Mr. Obama opposes 'innovation' on energy policy; that he voted 94 times for 'higher taxes'; and that Mr. Obama is personally responsible for rising gasoline prices." We don't take issue with the fact that these sources used the words that were quoted in the ad. They do. But the ads take evaluations of very specific McCain claims and give them a more far-reaching import. As presented, the ad essentially states, for example, that "His (McCain's) attacks on Obama (are) false," according to FactCheck.org. Jamieson, who works at the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg School of Communication, which produces FactCheck.org, said she felt like the quote was a distortion, and traded on FactCheck.org's reputation. "I saw that and said, 'FactCheck should fact-check that,'" Jamieson said. No media outlet has a problem with being accurately quoted, she said, but the ad leaves the impression that FactCheck.org has made a blanket determination that "everything Sen. McCain has said is false." The article took issue with just one McCain campaign ad. The nonpartisan fact-checking site has found some McCain statements to be true, some false; and the same for statements from Obama. How would Obama like it if McCain ran the same ad with the exact same setup and source citation? she asked. To suggest that these sources have concluded that the entirety of the McCain campaign is deceptive, well, that's deceptive, Jamieson said. We agree. With the exception of the New York Times editorial, which faults the McCain campaign for a number of alleged distortions and its overall tone, the snippets refer to very specific statements made by McCain about Obama. We realize that some details must go in a 30-second ad, but the shorthand presents an overall impression that the these media outlets have judged McCain's ad campaign much more broadly than they really have. We rule the source citations Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-08-14T00:00:00	2008-07-30	['Barack_Obama', 'John_McCain']

pomt-04117	Obamacare includes "a $63 charge every American will begin paying (in 2013) as a way to cover some of the increased costs associated with providing health insurance to those with pre-existing conditions."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2013/jan/10/jim-renacci/jim-renacci-says-every-american-will-pay-63-fee-pa/	Rep. Jim Renacci has never been a fan of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In fact, the Ohio Republican won a pair of congressional elections after lambasting the Democrats he defeated for backing it. Renacci, of Wadsworth, continued his crusade against the health care reform law in a Dec. 21 column published in The Daily Record of Wooster, Ohio, where he said that "many of the fees and penalties in the President’s health care law will begin to take effect" on Jan. 1, 2013. "One of them is a $63 charge every American will begin paying as a way to cover some of the increased costs associated with providing health insurance to those with pre-existing conditions," his column said. "For many, this new fee will be paid for by their employer. While that's good news for many American families, whose budgets are already stretched tightly, it is problematic for business of all sizes. For large businesses, this new fee could equal tens of millions of more dollars being shipped to Washington." In an email relayed by his press spokesman, Renacci elaborated on his criticism, noting that businesses won’t be able to use the money they pay for those fees to "hire expand or make capital investments." "If you want a real world example of how unfriendly to business the President’s health care law will be, look no further," Renacci said in the email. "Now is certainly not the time to make it more expensive to do business in America." PolitiFact Ohio decided to look into his claim about the fee. Details about the fee emerged last month when the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services released proposed regulations that would impose a three-year temporary assessment on employer sponsored health plans, starting in 2014. HHS estimated the fee would amount to $5.25 each month for every covered beneficiary, which works out to $63 per year. The fee is designed to raise $25 billion over three years to cushion health insurance companies from unexpected costs they’ll begin to encounter in 2014 when the law bans them from refusing to cover people who are already ill. According to the Associated Press, the fee would be assessed on all "major medical" insurance plans, including those provided by employers and those purchased individually by consumers. Most of the money would go into a fund administered by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The U.S. Treasury would get $5 billion to offset the cost of shoring up employer-sponsored coverage for early retirees. The per-person amount of the fees would diminish each year before phasing out in 2017. The fees are designed to raise $12 billion in 2014, $8 billion in 2015 and $5 billion in 2016. The law firm McDermott, Will & Emery analyzed the proposed regulations and said the yearly contributions that an employer pays would be based on the number of individuals covered under its plan, not the number of employees who participate. For example, a family of four covered under an employee’s insurance plan would be regarded as four "covered lives" and the employer would have to pay the fee for four people. The payments would be tax deductible to employers as an ordinary and necessary business expense. HHS spokesman Fabien Levy described the fee as one component of a comprehensive legislative package that’s designed to save money for consumers and businesses. Other money-saving changes have already gone into effect, including prescription drug savings for senior citizens and allowing adults under age 26 to remain on their parents’ insurance plans. "The health care law will help bring down costs and save money for American families," Levy said. "This program will help ensure employers no longer have to shoulder the cost of caring for the uninsured, which has raised businesses’ health care costs for decades." But the fee Renacci targeted has not been finalized, Levy said. Comments on the proposed regulation were due at the Department of Health and Human Services on Dec. 31. In an email, Renacci spokesman Shawn Ryan said Renacci’s date error was an "honest mistake," that wasn’t an attempt to mislead anyone. Although the rule has not been finalized, Ryan said that the Obama administration, through HHS, "has made it very clear - even by just proposing the rule - that they fully intend to implement it." In a news release, Columbus-area Republican Rep. Patrick Tiberi, the chair of the House Ways and Means Committee subcommittee on Select Revenue Measures, called the fee a "hidden tax" that would be imposed on 190 million Americans who are enrolled in health care plans. He also provided feedback to HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. His Dec. 21 letter to Sebelius said the fee would discourage employers from insuring their workers. "While we understand the importance of ensuring those with pre-existing conditions have access to affordable care, this regulation could cause some people to lose their health care coverage altogether," said the letter that Tiberi sent with other Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee. So where does this leave Renacci’s claim? There is an element of truth in his statement. The Department of Health and Human Services has indeed proposed a new $63 fee on every insured person that would be used to cover some costs associated with extending health insurance coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions. But his claim scrambles the details on some critical facts. The fee is part of a recently proposed rule that has not been finalized. If the proposal takes effect as it is currently written, the fee would be assessed beginning in 2014, not in 2013, as Renacci stated in his column. The fee would diminish over time before phasing out in 2017. Renacci’s column mentions how much the fees could raise in three years, but does not explain that it will end. Describing it as "$63 charge every American will begin paying," as he does in his column, is inaccurate. It would affect only those covered by major medical health insurance plans. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates Mostly False.	None	Jim Renacci	None	None	None	2013-01-10T06:00:00	2012-12-21	['United_States']
pomt-06271	Says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker "slashed" pensions and benefits for public employees.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/nov/25/mike-tate/top-democrat-says-gop-wisconsin-gov-walker-slashed/	On the day the campaign to remove Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker from office was launched, talk show host Al Sharpton asked Wisconsin Democratic Party chairman Mike Tate to tell MSNBC viewers "why it is so important that Walker be recalled." Sharpton wanted Tate to explain the budget-repair bill that Walker proposed a month after taking office in January 2011 -- the one that, because it curtailed collective bargaining for most state and local government employees, spurred weeks of public protests and national media attention. In the Nov. 15, 2011 interview, Tate replied that Act 10, "effectively eliminated collective bargaining rights for all of our public employees, our schoolteachers and our public service workers. "And beyond that," Tate continued, the Republican governor "slashed their pension and benefits." It is well established that Walker’s initiative, approved by the GOP-controlled Legislature, limited collective bargaining for all but a few groups of public employees. And it’s well known the law forces them to pay more for their pensions and health insurance -- giving the state and local governments flexibility, Walker argued, to balance their books. But did Walker also reduce -- or "slash," to use Tate’s word -- the pensions and benefits themselves? Walker’s treatment of public employees could be a key issue in a recall election, which would be held sometime in 2012 if the Democratic Party and other groups leading the recall campaign can gather enough signatures. So let’s evaluate Tate’s statement, in two parts. Pensions Before the budget-repair law -- which exempts police, state troopers and firefighters -- public employees contributed less than 1 percent of their pay toward their pensions; some made no contribution at all. For 2011, most workers covered by the law pay 5.8 percent and some pay 6.65 percent, according to the Office of State Employment Relations. Tate argued that employees "are effectively being asked to take a pay cut by contributing more of their own wages towards their defined benefit package." Indeed, many employees might view the higher pension contributions they have to make as a reduction in their pension benefit: In terms of their total compensation, their take-home pay is being reduced in order to fund the same pension benefit they’re already getting. No pension payments to workers at retirement are actually being reduced. But going forward, a relatively small number of public workers will earn a smaller pension benefit. The reduction affects about 1,500 public employees, primarily elected officials in local government, said Shawn Smith, spokeswoman for the state Department of Employee Trust Funds. The department administers retirement and other benefit programs for state and local government employees and retirees. That’s less than 1 percent of the more than 266,000 public employees who participate in the state retirement system, Smith said. For the 1,500, the "multiplier" used to calculate their pension was reduced from 2 percent to 1.6 percent for years of service logged after the budget-repair bill was enacted. Going forward, those employees will earn a somewhat lower pension, given that the multiplier is used along with average salary and years of service to determine the pension amount. So, for all public employees affected by the budget-repair law, the pension benefit, in a general sense, is reduced because they are paying more for it. But the pension benefit that ultimately will be earned by current employees will be lower only for a small number of them. Benefits Regarding the benefits part of Tate’s statement, Walker’s budget-repair law requires state employees, as well as local government workers who get their health insurance from a state plan, to pay at least 12 percent of the premiums. In arguing that the benefits themselves were cut, Tate cited a September 2011 memo from the state Department of Employee Trust Funds. It notes that the budget-repair law mandated a 5 percent reduction in the cost to the state of health plans. That was achieved, said Smith, by requiring the nearly 184,000 public employees and their dependents who are covered by a state plan to pay 10 percent co-insurance for certain medical services, up to $1,000 per year per family. That means the state now pays 90 percent, rather than 100 percent, for care that stems from an illness or injury, as opposed to preventative care. (Co-insurance, which requires the employee to pay a percentage of the cost of certain services, is different from a co-payment, which is a fixed amount that employees pay for certain services. Both are common in the private sector.) So, this is a double-hit to all state employees covered by Walker’s budget-repair law. They are paying more for their health insurance and getting less, given that the state is paying only 90 percent of the cost of many services rather than 100 percent. Our conclusion Tate said Walker "slashed" the pensions and benefits of state and local government employees. While the two benefits themselves are not being "slashed," the reductions along with the higher amounts the employees must pay for their benefits are significant. The PolitiFact definition for Half True is "The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context." That’s what we rate Tate’s statement.

pomt-05013	Federal regulations required the changes to Georgia's driver’s license renewal process.	true	/georgia/statements/2012/jul/17/david-ralston/house-speaker-says-911-regulations-led-new-guideli/	If you’ve had to renew your driver’s license lately, you know by now not to leave the engine running because you’ll likely have to wait. There’ve been scores of news accounts in recent weeks about Georgians waiting in long lines to renew their license, thanks to new rules that took effect earlier this month requiring drivers to present more personal records to confirm their identity. So who’s to blame for this new round of regulation? Many drivers have pointed their fingers toward the state Department of Driver Services. David Ralston, speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives, told reporters he was disappointed how the state agency prepared for the changes. However, the Republican lawmaker from Blue Ridge offered an explanation for the new regulations that suggested it is beyond the state’s control. Many of the changes that the state made were required by federal law, so state lawmakers' hands were tied, Ralston said, according to the Columbus Ledger-Enquirer. Ralston’s spokesman, Marshall Guest, confirmed that’s what his boss said and suggested some paths for us to use to find more details. PolitiFact Georgia wondered if the speaker was correct, or was he incorrectly designating the new level of bureaucracy to the wrong people? Georgia DDS officials say the changes were necessitated by a 2005 law passed by Congress called the Real ID Act. The act, which took effect three years after it passed, says that federal agencies may not accept a driver’s license or other state-issued forms of identification, unless the state meets rules under the federal law to verify the person’s identity. The act says a driver’s license should include the person’s full legal name, date of birth, gender, picture, driver’s license number, address, signature and physical features. The federal government has specific guidelines about what it requires from states, and Georgia says it is trying to follow suit. States should require a person to present a document without a photo that contains the driver’s full legal name and date of birth and Social Security number, the federal law says. The Real ID Act was passed as part of a Homeland Security measure after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. States were given the opportunity to get an extension to comply with the law. In 2007, the Georgia Legislature passed Senate Bill 5, which delayed implementation of the federal law until the governor felt comfortable the law would protect Georgians from identity theft. The state bill expressed concerns that the federal law would cost states $11 billion over the first five years of the program and that the federal government had not provided any money for its implementation. The state bill also mentioned worries that the federal law didn’t mention protections for information privacy or data security. Since 2007, state DDS officials have been working to meet the federal guidelines under the Real ID Act in phases. This May, Gov. Nathan Deal’s office announced it had created a system called SecureID that will protect Georgians from identity theft and comply with the Real ID Act. "This program will give Georgians the most secure IDs we’ve ever issued in this state," Deal said in a press release. "It is our duty to protect our residents’ identities to the best of our ability." So now, you’ll need proof of your full legal name, Social Security number and address to renew your driver’s license. It may not comfort some motorists as they stand in line to renew their license, but the new guidelines do come from the federal law passed in 2005. We rate Ralston’s statement as True.

pomt-08605	"Under Lee Fisher Ohio has lost nearly 400,000 jobs."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/sep/23/rob-portman/rob-portman-raps-lee-fisher-ohios-job-losses-while/	Editor's note: This item originally was rated as Mostly True, but was downgraded when job loss figures in it were updated. Like the refrain of a ubiquitous pop song, the phrase -- "Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his watch" -- is playing over and over on the airwaves. And like any good lyric, the phrase is catchy. Republican gubernatorial candidate John Kasich is singing it about incumbent governor Ted Strickland, and the Republican Governors Association has made the phrase the central theme of three commercials attacking Strickland on behalf of Kasich. And U.S. Senate candidate Rob Portman sings it about his Democratic challenger Lee Fisher, who is Ohio’s lieutenant governor and former head of the state’s economic development department, in a statewide ad titled "Job Czar." "Under Lee Fisher Ohio has lost nearly 400,000 jobs," is the key line in Portman's ad. The phrase has been aired so often, it's approaching the status of an oldie. Whether it's a goodie is the question. The Republicans are referring to the state’s net job losses since Strickland and Fisher took office in January 2007. Ohio lost about 390,000 non-farm jobs from January 2007 through July of this year, the latest figure available. So Republicans are largely accurate when they say Ohio has lost 400,000 jobs since January of 2007. Job losses were as high as 438,900 at the end of February of this year. When we reviewed the Republican Governor’s Association rendition that focused on Strickland, we rated it Half True. We said then that the claim hit a clunker when Republicans suggest that the governor was responsible for the job losses. Ohio has been losing jobs since January of 2000 - 568,300 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Of those, 403,800 came in the manufacturing sector. It’s also worth noting, since campaigns are trying to blame those in charge when the state lost jobs, that Republicans held the offices of governor and lieutenant governor seven of those years and held both houses of the legislatures until January 2009. Republican George W. Bush was president for eight of those years. Strickland has argued for the administration that Ohio - like Michigan and other Midwest states -- was especially hurt by forces beyond his control, namely a recession and the decline of manufacturing. Ohio and the nation have suffered through two recessions, one that started in 2001 and one that started in 2008, which triggered an avalanche of job losses here and was considered a global economic crisis. Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican elected in 2004 who is in his second term, says the same thing, at least he did July 22 during an interview in Cleveland. What made Daniels’ comments worth highlighting is that the rising GOP star was in town campaigning with Kasich. The two were beating up on Strickland for the state’s job losses. But Daniels became a bit defensive when questioned about Hoosier State less than stellar performance in the last several years. Indiana lost 174,000 net jobs since January of 2007. Echoing the sentiments of other governors in defense of their states’ economic woes, he said, "To some extent, everybody is at the mercy of national and global events, and we are no different." But this claim that targets Fisher has a slightly different tune. The ad that targeted Strickland phrased the job loss as happening "on his watch," which we think implies he is at fault. This claim phrased the job loss as happening "under Lee Fisher," which we think is more neutral language that conveys the idea that it occurred while he was the director of the agency. Also, Fisher’s role here was different than that of Strickland. While Strickland, as governor, may set policy for the administration to follow, Fisher held a hands-on position of control in the Department of Development. Consider it this way: It might be unfair to blame the high school principal for unruly behavior in a classroom, but reasonable to hold the teacher in charge of that class to a higher standard. That the ad focuses on Fisher as the state's development director raises another issue. Fisher stepped down as development director in February 2009. BLS data shows that during his tenure Ohio had a net loss of about 255,000 jobs; a significant number of jobs, although not as many as the Portman ad states. The higher jobs figure in the ad reflects net jobs lost into this year. Still, at a time when Ohio lost thousands of jobs, Fisher was in charge of the state agency most responsible for bringing new jobs to Ohio. That doesn’t mean he’s responsible for the job losses, but he was in charge of the department most capable of addressing the problem. We find Portman’s claim in his Job Czar ad to be Half True.

pomt-09029	"In Rick Perry's Texas, the governor threatens to leave, to secede from the greatest country in the" world.	false	/texas/statements/2010/jul/07/bill-white/bill-white-says-rick-perry-threatened-secede/	Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill White hearkened to a moment we’ve reviewed before when White told delegates to the Texas Democratic Party’s convention in Corpus Christi June 25: “In Rick Perry’s Texas, the governor threatens to leave, to secede from the greatest country in the” world. White spokeswoman Katy Bacon later confirmed White was referring to the Republican governor’s reply to a reporter after he spoke at a tea-party rally outside Austin’s city hall on April 15, 2009. Did Perry threaten to secede? The cited moment played out after an Associated Press reporter, Kelley Shannon, asked Perry after the 2009 rally if he thought the gathering reflected a national movement. Perry answered that it could be. He said people feel strangled by spending and taxation and they want help, according to an AP recording we reviewed in April 2010. Shannon then asked Perry about some associating him with the idea of secession or sovereignty for Texas. “Oh, I think there’s a lot of different scenarios,” Perry replied. “Texas is a unique place. When we came in the union in 1845, one of the issues was that we would be able to leave if we decided to do that. “You know, my hope is that America and Washington in particular pays attention,” Perry continued. “We’ve got a great union. There is absolutely no reason to dissolve it. But if Washington continues to thumb their nose at the American people, you know, who knows what may come out of that? So. But Texas is a very unique place and we’re a pretty independent lot to boot.” Perry next fielded a question from someone else about whether Texas might now be considered a natural terorrist state — no, Perry said — and the question-and-answer period closed. At the time, Perry’s comments were widely interpreted as indicating the Republican governor believed secession could legally occur; he subsequently did not back down from that conclusion. However, a constitutional expert advised at the time that the Civil War long ago vanquished secession as a legal option. Sanford Levinson, a professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said neither the Texas Constitution, the U.S. Constitution nor the Joint Resolution Annexing Texas to the United States of 1845, bestows an explicit right for the state to return to a Republic. Levinson said there is “no possibility whatsoever that the United States or any court would recognize a ‘right’ to secede.” Levinson noted that the 1845 resolution allows Texas to break into five new states, and it doesn’t specify whether that would require congressional approval. But, he said, that’s distinct from secession. Does Perry’s “who-knows-what-might-come” comment support White’s statement that Perry threatened to leave the union? Using the Nexis search tool, we found 169 major newspaper articles linking Perry and secede. None quoted Perry threatening to push for secession, though critics and comedians framed his words in that way. Typically, San Antonio Express-News reporter Roy Bragg wrote in an April 19, 2009 article: “The governor didn't make an actual threat to secede.” Bragg also quoted Harvey Tucker, a Texas A&M University political scientist, suggesting Perry saw political gain by speaking to secession. “He didn't intend (to) talk about it. He didn't plan it. He was just drawn into it,” Tucker said. An October 2009 article in The Dallas Morning News quoted Allison Castle, the governor's spokeswoman, saying Perry's intention in his April comment “was to point a critical finger at the federal government, not to encourage abandoning the U.S.” Bacon told us in an e-mail that Perry’s “speculation, saying the state could secede if it wanted to, is a saber-rattling threat. Think about secession and all that is associated with it. He was not talking about it in a historical navel-gazing” or constitutional-interpretive fashion. What we find: In a politically theatrical moment, Perry edged toward a secession threat. Then or since, however, he hasn’t said Texas should quit the United States. (You wudda read all about it.) White’s similarly theatrical statement at his party’s convention is False.	None	Bill White	None	None	None	2010-07-07T06:00:00	2010-06-25	['Texas', 'Rick_Perry']
pomt-09012	"The top 1 percent pay over half of the entire revenue for this country."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/09/trent-franks/trent-franks-says-top-1-percent-pays-over-half-ent/	It's a topic for many arguments: What's the fairest way to share the tax burden? In a July 7, 2010, appearance on MSNBC's The Dylan Ratigan Show, U.S. Rep. Trent Franks, R-Ariz., made clear that he feels the richest Americans pay too much. At one point in the interview, Cenk Uygur, the host filling in for Ratigan, asked Franks, "So, Congressman, if we can't cut defense spending and you don't want to raise taxes on the wealthy, where are you going to get your savings from, the poor and the middle class? Is that right?" Franks responded, "No, the fact is, you know, when you're always talking about raising taxes on the rich, I think the top -- the rich now, the top 1 percent, pay over half of the entire revenue for this country. And you don't realize that if you destroy those who have capital, you absolutely devastate those that are trying to get jobs." We won't take sides in the argument over the best tax policy, but we do think it's worth checking his statistic that "the top 1 percent pay over half of the entire revenue for this country." We found three problems with Franks' statement. 1. When it comes to the federal income tax (which is only one of many taxes -- more on that later) Frank's "over half" estimate is high. According to IRS statistics from the 2007 tax year, the last year available, slightly more than 40 percent of federal income taxes are paid by the top 1 percent. (For that year, it took an adjusted gross income of $410,096 to make it into that elite 1 percent.) 2. The federal income tax isn't the only tax levied by the federal government. It is the biggest when measured by revenue generated, but it doesn't even account for more than half of all federal tax revenue. The income tax generates 45 percent of federal tax revenue, followed by 36 percent for payroll taxes, 12 percent for corporate income taxes, 3 percent for excise taxes and 4 percent for other taxes. 3. Tax revenues aren't the only form of revenues that fund the government. As we reported in an earlier item, the federal government also collects fees paid to various agencies. In 2009, for example, the government took in the following: the U.S. Postal Service ($69 billion), Medicare premiums ($57 billion), deposits with the Federal Reserve Board ($34.3 billion), customs duties ($21.3 billion), Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. premiums and recoveries ($20.5 billion), auction proceeds from electromagnetic spectrum rights ($16.7 billion), energy sales by the Tennessee Valley Authority ($11.1 billion), natural resources royalties and revenues ($9.9 billion). Together, these non-tax collections totaled $240 billion, an amount roughly equal to 10 percent of what taxes bring in -- which is more than pocket change. So are there better yardsticks? There are. The Tax Policy Center of the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution found that in 2009, the top 1 percent shouldered the burden for roughly 23 percent of all federal taxes. To get to the level Franks' cited -- "over half" -- you have to increase the window from 1 percent to 10 percent. That is, the top 10 percent of American earners paid for 52 percent of all federal taxes that year, according to the Tax Policy Center. A big reason for the difference is that the top 1 percent pay 5 percent or less of payroll and excise taxes. (They also pay more than 50 percent of corporate income taxes and more than 70 percent of estate taxes.) We'll grant that Franks' statement was an off-the-cuff response to a question during a television interview. We'll also acknowledge that the top 1 percent of taxpayers does pay a disproportionate share of taxes generally. Even at 23 percent of the total federal tax burden, that's a lot bigger than their share of the population, and also bigger than their share of income (16 percent). That's the nature of a progressive tax system. Indeed, it's worth noting that the share being paid by the top 1 percent has generally risen over time. In 1987, the first year after President Ronald Reagan signed a sweeping tax reform bill, the share paid by the top 1 percent stood slightly above 16 percent. The top one-fifth of the population -- what one might call, in Franks' words, "the rich" -- is the only fifth, or "quintile," of the population that has seen its share of the tax burden go up during that time. Still, we can't brush off the inaccuracies in Franks' statement. He makes it sound as if the top 1 percent of the country is shouldering more than half of the burden of funding the federal government, when in fact it's about half that.

pomt-12829	Says ExxonMobil "fought to kill" a rule requiring oil and mining companies to disclose payments made to foreign governments.	true	/global-news/statements/2017/feb/08/sherrod-brown/yes-exxonmobil-under-tillerson-fought-oil-payment-/	A resolution on President Donald Trump’s desk would kill a regulation the oil lobby has opposed for six years. The rule by the Securities and Exchange Commission requires oil, gas and mining companies to report pretty much everything they pay to governments for the right to extract resources. The rule’s goal was to prevent corruption in developing countries where top officials might feather their nests and leave their people destitute. House Republicans, joined by a handful of Democrats, voted to nullify the rule on Feb. 1, and two days later on a straight party-line vote, the Senate followed suit. During the debate on the Senate floor, Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, said the transparency under the regulation was an "essential tool" against fraud and abuse, but it had powerful enemies. "Since the rule’s creation, ExxonMobil, led by Mr. Tillerson -- now the secretary of state -- and Big Oil allies, such as the American Petroleum Institute, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and the Heritage Foundation, have fought to kill it," Brown said. We decided to explore whether ExxonMobil fought to kill the rule. It did, and Tillerson played a direct role. The action began in 2008. That year, then Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., spearheaded a report on corruption in developing nations rooted in their natural resources. In the most extreme cases, money from oil or other resources set off a scramble for personal wealth that left nations in Africa, South America and Asia less stable and deeper in poverty. Transparency, Lugar wrote, was crucial to beating the "resource curse." "When oil revenue in a producing country can be easily tracked, that nation’s elite are more likely to use revenues for the vital needs of their citizens and less likely to squander newfound wealth for self-aggrandizing projects," he wrote. Lugar wanted a law that would tell the SEC to craft a rule for companies to follow. He co-sponsored an amendment with Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md., that became part of the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul bill in 2010. Under the measure, any oil, gas or mining company listed on the U.S. stock exchange had to report "taxes, royalties, fees (including license fees), production entitlements, bonuses, and other material benefits," paid to any government. The reporting had to be done country by country and project by project. ExxonMobil and the American Petroleum Institute, the oil industry trade group, opposed the proposal every step of the way. In 2010, Jay Branegan worked for Lugar as a staffer on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Now at the Lugar Center, a policy group in Washington, D.C., Branegan told us that in 2010, before Dodd-Frank passed, Tillerson himself came to Lugar’s office to argue against the amendment. "He listed a number of his and the industry’s objections to the bill, including that it would harm Exxon’s relations with Russia," Branegan said. "He was the only CEO to come in to lobby personally." We asked ExxonMobil spokesman William Holbrook for the company’s take on the accuracy of Branegan’s account. Holbrook said, "The SEC rule has been a concern for the industry at large, not ExxonMobil exclusively." Holbrook argued that the rule put ExxonMobil at a competitive disadvantage with state-owned companies and that "ExxonMobil is committed to being a good corporate citizen, and part of that commitment includes transparency in reporting payments to foreign governments." "The SEC largely ignored industry’s comments and recommendations in finalizing its rule," Holbrook said. ExxonMobil and the American Petroleum Institute had several changes in mind but a key one had to do with the details the SEC reported to the public. Ideally, they wanted the SEC to lump all payments a government received together, rather than show what each company paid. They certainly didn’t want to report for each project. ExxonMobil voiced its objections in letters to the SEC on Jan. 31, 2011, March 15, 2011 and Oct. 25, 2011. The SEC actually went through two cycles in writing the rules. After the SEC came up with version one, a lawsuit sent the commission back to the drawing board. The second try wrapped up June 27, 2016. As recently as March 2016, ExxonMobil raised objections to the revised approach, saying the SEC plan would increase costs, harm shareholders and "sow confusion." Not all major oil companies objected so vigorously to the rule. Royal Dutch Shell wrote, "While we believe the American Petroleum Institute proposal is superior to the Commission’s re-proposal, we would support the Commission re-proposal with certain minor changes." BP took the same line. A key factor for Shell and BP was that all 28 European Union countries, plus Canada and Norway, had already adopted disclosure rules modeled on the original SEC version. The two companies wanted to be able to give the SEC the same reports they were filing in the EU. The SEC adopted that. Jana Morgan, director of Publish What You Pay, an advocacy group that supports mandatory reporting, told us the nullification of the American rule would put the country in an odd position. "Canada and countries in Europe adopted similar legislation to the United States because the United States passed it first," Morgan said. "Assuming the regulation is pulled back, the United States will be out of sync with the global transparency standard." Our ruling Brown said ExxonMobil fought to kill a rule requiring oil and mining companies to disclose payments made to governments. Former ExxonMobil CEO Tillerson personally lobbied against the measure before it became law, and the company continued to oppose it as recently as March 2016. ExxonMobil preferred a different reporting regime, rather than no reporting at all, but its opposition was steadfast.

pomt-13190	As executive director of the Democratic Party of Virginia there were "300 people on my payroll in 2008."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2016/oct/25/levar-stoney/levar-stoney-says-he-oversaw-300-paid-workers-va-d/	Levar Stoney, a 35-year-old political operative running for Richmond mayor, was asked at a recent debate if he has the managerial chops to lead the city. "We know you served as head of the Democratic Party (of Virginia) and as secretary of the commonwealth," said Craig Carper, news director for WCVE Public Radio. "How do these skills translate to an executive position like mayor? How many people did you manage in these positions?" Stoney replied, "Well, when I was executive director of the Democratic Party, I was able to run the day-to-day operations of a multi-million dollar organization, a multi-million dollar operation that featured 300 people on my payroll in the year 2008." There’s no doubt that millions of dollars were running in and out of the Democratic Party of Virginia in 2008, when Barack Obama was first elected president and carried Virgina, a key swing state. Federal Election Commission reports show the state party spent nearly $17 million that year, much of it coming from national Democratic campaign sources. What caught our attention is Stoney’s statement that there were "300 people on my payroll" that year. Our experience is that you can often count the state party’s staffers on your fingers. Filings with the Federal Election Commission show that when Stoney became executive director that February, the party had a paid staff of 11. The number remained constant in March and increased to 16 in April and May. Then the numbers began to surge. The party, by our count, listed 51 people on its payroll in June, 140 in July, 238 in August and 298 in September. Matt Corridoni, a spokesman for Stoney, sent us a copy of the party’s report covering the almost six-week period from Oct. 16, 2008 to Nov. 24. We counted 301 people listed as "payroll" employees. Who were these people and what did they do? Corridoni said most of them were young people, fresh out of college or taking a break from their studies, who worked on a field staff to help Obama win Virginia. They fanned out to campaign offices across the state to reach out to voters, stage local campaign events and organize get-out-the-vote efforts. About half of the workers were from Virginia, the rest came from all over the country. The field staff was funded by millions of dollars pumped into the state party by the Democratic National Committee and Obama’s campaign. The staff’s activities, Stoney told us, were jointly coordinated by those national entities and the state party. Stoney said he didn’t have a personal hand in much of the hiring but, as executive director of the state party, had "the final sign off" on who came aboard. He said he worked with the national campaign to establish goals for the field staff and assigned mid-level managers at the party to supervise the daily work. "I was executive director of the party, so I was responsible for ensuring all these people got paid," Stoney said. He said he and others spent a lot of time finding homes for the workers and that he traveled the state "rallying and galvanizing" them. "We were given a task at the beginning of the year that Virginia would be a battleground in the election and you need to get people on the ground," Stoney said. He added that he carried out the mission and it helped Obama become the first Democratic presidential candidate in 44 years to win Virginia. In December 2008, with the presidential election in the books, the state party’s payroll fell to eight people. A final note: Stoney also was asked at the debate how many people he supervised when he was secretary of the commonwealth from 2014 until this April. He didn’t provide an answer, but we will. The state budget provided funding for 17 employees in the office, including Stoney, for the fiscal year that ended on June 30. The secretary of the commonwealth helps the governor make nearly 4,000 appointments to state boards and commissions. Among other duties, the secretary also helps the governor process restoration of rights requests from felons who have completed their sentences and keeps records on state lobbyists. Our ruling Asked how many people he supervised as executive director of the state Democratic Party, Stoney said "there were 300 people on my payroll in 2008." Records show the state party’s payroll did hit 300 that fall as it hired temporary field workers to help Obama’s presidential campaign in Virginia. It was a massive effort coordinated by the state party, the Democratic National Committee and Obama’s campaign. The caveat is that there were 11 people on the payroll in February 2008 when Stoney became executive director and that didn’t begin to significantly rise until June. And in December, when the election was history, the party’s payroll shrank to eight. So the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. That makes it Half True.

pomt-13814	"What the facts say" is ... "the best scenario for kids is a loving mom and dad."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/17/reince-priebus/gop-chair-wrongly-claims-facts-show-children-do-be/	Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus defended the 2016 Republican Party platform ahead of its convention in a July 17 interview with NBC’s Chuck Todd. While the platform isn’t yet in its final form, many observers have said the document so far lands to the right on social issues. Todd asked Priebus about the platform’s position on same-sex marriage. He referenced one draft that says "the data, the facts lead to an inescapable conclusion that every child deserves a married mom and dad" — based on claims that children raised in a traditional household are healthier and less likely to engage in crime and substance abuse. "It’s implying somehow that children of same-sex couples are more likely to be addicts, to engage in crime," Todd said. "Do you mean to have it imply that?" Priebus replied that it’s possible for children of same-sex parents and single parents to have successful lives, but the best scenario is for children to grow up in a traditional opposite-sex household. "The best scenario for kids is a loving mom and dad," Priebus said. "However, it doesn't mean at all that single parents or same-sex parents, that any parent in America can't love a child, can't raise a child, and that child can't be successful and loved. It doesn't mean that. It just means what the facts say." Do "the facts say" that "the best scenario for kids is a loving mom and dad" as opposed to same-sex parents? We’ve rated two similar claims False in the past, and not much has changed since we last looked into it in 2014. If anything, the scholarly consensus that children can fare just as well in same-sex households has strengthened. "The consensus is overwhelming that those children do very well in those (same-sex parent) families, and there’s no harm or bad consequence that occurs because of those parents not being opposite sex," said Ellen Perrin, a professor at the Tufts University School of Medicine who has researched this question. What the research shows Researchers at Columbia Law School reviewed scholarly works about the well-being of children living with gay or lesbian parents spanning the past three decades. The researchers found 78 relevant articles, and of those, 74 concluded that children of same-sex parents fare no worse than children of opposite-sex parents. Six of these articles were published in the last three years. The studies examine topics such as adolescent well-being, child physical and emotional health, family functioning and the effect of homophobic stigmatization. "Taken together, this research forms an overwhelming scholarly consensus, based on over three decades of peer-reviewed research, that having a gay or lesbian parent does not harm children," the Columbia researchers wrote. That leaves four articles that argue children face more risks with opposite-sex parents than they do with same-sex parents. However, the Columbia researchers say these studies are problematic because only a minority of the child subjects grew up with same-sex parents. Most subjects of these four studies grew up with opposite-sex parents but one of the parents eventually came out as gay or lesbian, often causing family breakup or turmoil. Some of this research conflates family composition and structure with family stability and history, said Gary Gates, an expert in LGBT demography at the University of California Los Angeles. Social science research suggests marriage — and not necessarily the gender makeup of that marriage — is associated with stability. "In other words, studies that compare children in long-term intact families with same-sex couple parents show that they generally do as well as kids in long-term intact families with different-sex parents," Gates said. Gates co-authored an overview of contemporary research about LGBT parents. The report found that LGBT parents and their children are doing "quite well," but research into the subject face problems like getting a large and diverse sample size. And there is little research into subcategories, like sibling dynamics among children with same-sex parent families or domestic violence. Perrin added that there is much more research into lesbian female parents than there is into gay male parents, but that imbalance is starting to even out, especially in light of the Supreme Court’s ruling in favor of gay marriage and more male gay couples are having children. In any case, evidence supporting Priebus’s claim is limited and problematic. "There’s no scholarly data that suggests this is a problem," Perrin said. We did not hear back from Priebus. Our ruling Priebus said, "What the facts say" is ... "the best scenario for kids is a loving mom and dad," as opposed to having same-sex parents. The limited pieces of research that appear to support Priebus’ claim have been called into question. And overall, scholarly research shows that what matters to children is the quality and stability of the parenting, rather than the parents’ particular sex, gender or sexual orientation. We rate Priebus’ claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6d388e00-e032-4283-84a1-9d3850f75429	None	Reince Priebus	None	None	None	2016-07-17T16:21:30	2016-07-17	['None']

pomt-10739	"John McCain is right on that one. The line-item veto is the best tool the president has to rein in excessive spending."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/07/mitt-romney/budget-pros-arent-so-sure/	In attacking former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani for successfully challenging the line-item veto in court, Mitt Romney asserts that the veto is a great way to cut spending. He says he used it more than 800 times as governor of Massachusetts. More than 40 governors have the power. But calling it "the best tool" for a president to cut spending is saying too much. In fact, federal budget experts are in some disagreement over how well a line-item veto would work if the power was restored to the president. President Clinton was given the power by Congress in 1996. It was declared unconstitutional in 1998. During the time that he had it, the so-called "pork barrel" special interest projects and targeted tax benefits he vetoed would have saved about $600-million over five years. The Congressional Research Service pointed out that for budget year 1998, the savings were about $355-million out of a total budget of $1.7-trillion. Congress would have to amend the Constitution to give the president the same power Clinton had. Short of that, Congress could give the president a limited power to rescind spending and force the House and Senate to vote on those proposed cuts. Currently, Congress can ignore presidential requests to rescind money. Budget analysts aren't sure what impact the line-item veto would have. "To the extent that the line-item veto act shifts power from the Congress to the president, it may change behavior in subtle ways that are difficult to observe," June O'Neill, then-director of the Congressional Budget Office, testified before the House Rules Committee on March 11, 1998. Louis Fisher of the Congressional Research Service agreed, writing in 2005 that as a result of deal-cutting over use of the veto between Congress and the White House, spending could actually increase. Fisher's idea is that in the reshaping of power between Congress and the White House that would occur with a line-item veto, presidents could barter for extra spending in areas they favored in exchange for letting other projects go unvetoed. It's this fuzzy picture that keeps us from going any further than Half True on Romney's claim that a line-item veto is "the best tool" for a president to cut spending.

pomt-09724	"Here in Florida, I’ve slashed government by 10 percent. That's $7 billion."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2009/oct/26/charlie-crist/gov-charlie-crist-says-he-has-reduced-size-state-g/	With conservative Marco Rubio nipping at his heels in the race for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist is trying to pump up his conservative credentials. In a new radio advertisement for his campaign, he says, "Here in Florida, I’ve slashed government by 10 percent. That’s $7 billion." It’s a statement Crist has also made on the campaign trail, and at a Hillsborough County Republican Party fundraiser earlier this month. It’s true that Florida’s budget has dropped by 10 percent, or about $7 billion, since Crist was elected governor in November 2006. The budget passed by the Legislature and approved by then-Gov. Jeb Bush in May 2006 came in at $73.9 billion. This year’s spending plan tops out at $66.5 billion. But can Crist, as his radio ad claims, really take credit for the cuts? In 2007, Crist did veto $459 million from the state budget, setting a state record with his veto pen. But the Florida Constitution requires that state lawmakers prepare a balanced budget, which is built around revenue generated by sales taxes, corporate taxes, other taxes and fees, and federal appropriations. And since 2007, that revenue has declined significantly as the nationwide recession has taken hold. State budget documents show that in the 2006-2007 fiscal year, $31.7 billion was available in the general revenue fund. This year, the fund had only $21.9 billion. (In fiscal year 2007, the fund had $28 billion, and in 2008, it had $24.3 billion.) With revenue down and a constitutional requirement for a balanced budget, Crist had to either cut spending or raise taxes. "This is not a concerted effort on the part of our governor and Legislature to cut the budget," said Dominic M. Calabro, president and CEO of Florida TaxWatch. "It is because of the worst economy Florida has had since the Great Depression." Crist has defended the budget-cut claim by saying that in other states, taxes were increased to cover shortfalls. While Crist didn’t push for tax increases to make up the entire shortfall, he did approve fee and tax increases this year — on everything from fishing licenses to initial vehicle registrations to cigarettes — that total $2.2 billion. So while it is true that state government has shrunk by 10 percent since Crist’s election, it had little to do with him, and a lot to do with the shrinking economy. For those reasons, we give Crist’s statement a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2009-10-26T13:10:03	2009-10-16	['None']

pomt-07440	Tim Kaine broke a campaign promise not to raise taxes.	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/21/republican-party-virginia/virginia-republicans-say-tim-kaine-broke-campaign-/	The Republican Party of Virginia was ready to roll when Democrat Timothy M. Kaine recently announced he will run for the U.S. Senate next year. The GOP posted on its website a list of unflattering numerical milestones from Kaine’s term as governor from 2006 to 2010. One item particularly grabbed our attention. Under the subhead "7 days," the GOP wrote that’s "How long it took Tim Kaine to break his campaign promise not to raise taxes." Kaine indeed asked for a tax increase on his seventh day in office. On Jan. 20, 2006, he proposed a $1 billion-a-year transportation package that called for higher levies on vehicle sales and insurance as well as increased traffic fines and registration fees. Whether he broke a campaign promise is more complicated. Kaine held a murky position on taxes during the campaign. So how do the Republicans justify their claim that Kaine promised not to raise taxes? Garren Shipley, the communications director for the state GOP, pointed us to a gubernatorial debate on Oct. 9, 2005. Jerry Kilgore, the Republican nominee, charged that Kaine had a history of supporting tax increases that guaranteed he would try to raise levies as governor. Kilgore portrayed himself as a tax cutter. "There you go again, Jerry, just making stuff up," Kaine retorted. Shipley said Kaine’s response "very strongly" implies he would not propose tax hikes. Perhaps. But a review of the debate transcript shows Kaine could have been responding to a variety of charges and claims Kilgore made in a minute-long barrage. In any event, Kaine’s reply hardly constitutes a no-tax vow. Shipley offers a second argument that is more complex. Kaine repeatedly promised he would not seek a tax hike for transportation unless he could guarantee the revenues would be sequestered and never used for any purpose other than improving roads, rail and public transportation. Shipley says Kaine broke his campaign vow by introducing the transportation plan without the guarantee. Kaine did promise not to seek a tax increase for transportation unless the money was "locked up." He objected to a legislative practice of siphoning money from state transportation fund during lean times to help pay for schools, prisons and health care. The practice led to the 2002 defeat of local referendums that would have raised taxes for roads in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads. Polls showed many voters in those regions did not trust state politicians to keep their promise that the revenues would never stray from transportation. Kaine solidified his position in a July 16, 2005, gubernatorial debate while answering a tax question posed by Bob Holsworth, a political scientist. "I have pledged, Bob, as you said, that I will not support any increase in transportation taxes or revenues so long as the Transportation Trust Fund is unlocked," Kaine said. "I don’t think I can look voters in the face and ask them for more money for transportation if there is a hole in the bucket and money is going to drain out." Kaine at first advocated that road money be locked through passage of a state constitutional amendment shielding transportation money from raids. But enacting a constitutional amendment is a three-year process. Business leaders in Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads weren’t willing to wait that long to ease traffic congestion. So Kaine, in August 2005, altered his position to open the possibility of raising taxes during his first year in office. While still endorsing a constitutional amendment, he gave himself wiggle room by saying he was also open to locking the transportation money through other means. Kaine was short on details. Days after his inauguration, Kaine offered specifics in his State of the Commonwealth address. He said that in lieu of a constitutional fix, he would amend any new transportation tax or revenue laws to ensure they would expire if the money was shifted to other programs. He also promised to veto any budget that diverted transportation money. Kaine’s protections would not have made the funds tamper-proof, however. The General Assembly was empowered to override any amendments or vetoes Kaine might use to safeguard the money. And future governors would not be bound by any commitments Kaine made to shield funds. When he unveiled his transportation plan on Jan. 20, the GOP criticized Kaine for breaching his campaign pledge not to raise taxes for transportation without a lock. The Richmond Times-Dispatch noted, however, in its following-day story, that Kaine as a candidate "refused to rule out new road taxes." Kaine’s bill died in the Republican-led House of Delegates, which has been and remains opposed to raising taxes. The 2005 House also killed 10 bills that would have placed before voters a constitutional amendment to put a lock on transportation money. Let’s review: The Republican Party of Virginia says that within a week of becoming governor in 2006, Kaine broke a promise not to raise taxes. Kaine indeed proposed a $1 billion transportation tax increase on his seventh day in office. There’s no evidence Kaine made a no-tax pledge during the 2005 campaign. To the contrary, Kaine set conditions under which he would seek a tax hike for transportation. Kaine did, however, leave himself open for criticism by compromising those conditions once he got into office. We rate the GOP claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

Dean Heller broke his promise to protect Nevadans’ health care and caved to President Trump, he wound up helping craft a partisan repeal bill that also would have slashed coverage protections for people with pre-existing conditions," Rosen’s campaign posted June 8. The attack from team Rosen concerns the 2017 Graham-Cassidy bill that would have turned federal health care programs into block grants to the states. The bill never came up for a vote, but Heller was an original co-sponsor. (The press release that unveiled the bill came with the headline "Senators introduce Graham-Cassidy-Heller-Johnson.") So the question is, would Graham-Cassidy have definitively "slashed" protections for Americans with pre-existing conditions, as the Rosen campaign said? We dug into the bill to see. While the claim pushes too far, the legislation did open the door to a loss of the ironclad guarantee under Obamacare. The bill and pre-existing conditions The Heller campaign disagreed with Rosen’s characterization of the health care bill. Heller’s team highlighted that Graham-Cassidy left the current law on pre-existing conditions untouched. "Insurance companies would still be prohibited from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions and would still be required to ensure patients can renew their coverage regardless of their health," said Heller spokesman Keith Schipper. But the bill’s rules for state waivers from many regulations in the Affordable Care Act created some ambiguity. A state would gain access to billions of dollars in block grants if it describes how (see page 11) it "shall maintain access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage for individuals with pre-existing conditions." Heller’s office emphasized the word "shall," saying it created an imperative to retain access. But the same waiver would give states the power to allow insurance companies to charge sick people more than healthy ones (page 145). Under the current rules, insurance companies can’t do that. They can’t factor in health, period. In addition, current Affordable Care Act rules limit the range for premiums and say companies can’t charge an older person more than three times what they charge a younger person. The waiver does away with those limits (starting at the bottom of page 144 in the bill). A state’s commitment boils down to maintaining "access to adequate and affordable health insurance coverage." "That’s not nothing" in terms of protecting people with pre-existing conditions, Indiana University health care law professor David Gamage told us in 2017. But beyond that, Gamage said the protection for pre-existing conditions gets murky. "The bill says states have to do something, but what that something is is unclear," Gamage said. "And it’s overwhelmingly likely that what some states do won’t be as robust as what people have now." Heller’s staff told us that while the bill gave discretion to Washington administrators to set rules for what it meant by adequate and affordable coverage, the intent was to follow existing law. Looking at the first version of the bill, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that 35 states plus the District of Columbia would see net funding cuts under the legislation. The health consulting firm Avalere, with funding from the Democratic-leaning Center for American Progress, had a similar finding. One way or another, it costs money to cover people with known health conditions, and most states would have less of it under the senators’ proposal. On top of that, Gamage said, Affordable Care Act regulations spread some of the costs across the private sector. Those regulations would go away, too, meaning it would be up to the states to make up the difference. Nevada results might vary Less money could push states to leave patients with less protections than they enjoy today. We looked at how Nevada might have fared under the bill. The Heller camp said, based on an analysis from Cassidy's office, the state would get more money than under Obamacare in the 2020-2026 period. On the other hand, the Kaiser Family Foundation estimated a loss of $1.2 billion lost over the period. The Avalere analysis showed the Silver State getting $2 billion less by the year 2026. When we looked at the losses compared to the number of state residents, Nevada would not have been hit as hard as some of the big losers, such as California and Minnesota. But at the end of the day, the independent estimate from the Kaiser Family Foundation still said Nevada would face constraints on how much it could do for people. Murky terms "The terms ‘adequate’ and ‘affordable’ are very much subject to interpretation," said law professor Wendy Netter Epstein at DePaul University. "What is adequate and affordable for one person may not be for another. And it almost certainly doesn’t mean that those with pre-existing conditions have to be charged the same as those without." If states fell short, Epstein said Washington regulators could try to hold their feet to the fire and press them to do better with their federal money, but "we can anticipate a whole lot of litigation." And even a win for Washington might not mean much in practice. "Folks who are sick and need health insurance coverage now don’t have the luxury of time to let these legal debates play out," Epstein said. Both Epstein and Gamage said in theory, states might find ways to squeeze much more health coverage out of each dollar. Or failing that, they might decide to put much more of their own money into health care and re-establish rules modeled on the Affordable Care Act. But they said neither outcome is likely. Epstein said there’s an underlying disagreement on what it means to cover people with pre-existing conditions. Under the Affordable Care Act, those people got the same kind of coverage at the same price as others. Under Graham-Cassidy, "insurers will have to continue to cover people, but not at the same rates. And the policies don’t have to provide the same coverage." Our ruling Rosen said that Heller backed a bill that would have "slashed coverage protections for people with pre-existing conditions." The legislation included language to protect people with pre-existing conditions, but it opened the door to insurance plans that might be more limited or less affordable than exist today. How much protection would be lost is impossible to predict. The proposal told states they had to plan to keep coverage accessible and affordable for people with pre-existing conditions. But it didn’t define those terms and that falls short of an ironclad guarantee. A full reading of the bill’s text shows that protections for pre-existing conditions would be less certain, but the statement pushes beyond the known impacts of the Graham-Cassidy bill. We rate this claim Half True. Clarification: After we published this fact-check, Heller’s office provided updated materials on the Graham-Cassidy legislation. We included that information, as well as a description of the Avalere study’s funding. The rating remained unchanged.

pomt-13005	Under Obamacare, "premiums have doubled and tripled" in Wisconsin.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/dec/13/ron-johnson/testing-ron-johnson-claim-under-obamacare-premiums/	President Barack Obama’s health insurance overhaul was a popular target during the 2016 campaign, as Republicans made the case change was needed and vowed to repeal it. U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, was among those taking aim at Obamacare. With Republicans poised to implement changes after presidential and Congressional victories, it seemed a good time to revisit one of Johnson’s claims. In an October debate, Johnson wrapped up a six-minute answer to an Obamacare question by asserting "premiums have doubled and tripled" in Wisconsin since the law was implemented. Did health insurance costs spike in Wisconsin after the Affordable Care Act? Let’s look at the numbers. Johnson cites, expands on study The debate question Johnson was responding to asked what he would do to reduce insurance costs, while noting rates on the federal health insurance exchange were poised to increase by about 16 percent in 2017. So it’s fair to assume his answer refers to that exchange, also called the individual market. Those are independent, non-group plans not run through employers or government programs such as Medicaid and Medicare. Johnson began by citing a study by the conservative Manhattan Institute, and the "doubled and tripled" statement referred back to that study. The study, which looked only at the individual market, calculated the average premium in 2013 and 2014 (before and after the individual mandate took effect) by averaging the five least expensive plans in each county nationwide. The institute published a before and after premium for males and females ages 27, 40 and 64. Johnson then extended the study to 2017 by adding the average rate increase in Wisconsin for 2015, 2016 and 2017, as calculated by the Wisconsin Office of the Commissioner of Insurance. That office listed increases of 3.8 percent in 2015, 8.4 percent in 2016 and 15.9 percent in 2017. The rate increase across the age and gender groups then ranged from an increase of 180 percent to 310 percent. Johnson cited those numbers at the debate, though he wrongly attributed them only to the Manhattan Institute. Yevgeniy Feyman, adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute and an author of the study, said Johnson’s methodology for extending the time period made sense. To make sure, PolitiFact Wisconsin used a methodology similar to Feyman’s to average the five lowest-cost plans available in each Wisconsin county from 2015-’17. That yielded increases similar to Johnson’s calculations and consistent with the claim that premiums doubled and tripled. "For all consumers, it’s clear rates increased in the first year and for some more than doubled," Elizabeth Hizmi, spokesman for the state insurance office, said in an email. "In most cases, rates significantly increased when you add in the compounding of rate increases." Hizmi said the agency didn’t do its own calculation of rates before and after Obamacare because before 2014 each insurer developed rates using different methodologies and filed their rate changes at different times. Loren Adler, associate director of the Center for Health Policy at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, said the Affordable Care Act did indeed have a significant impact in Wisconsin, which had the highest rate increase of any state in the individual marketplace. Claim applies to narrow band of people We’ll pause to note, however, that those increases apply to a relatively small group of Wisconsinites. Only 6 percent of state residents get non-group insurance such as the individual market, according to the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. Employer-sponsored insurance is the most common in Wisconsin — at 55 percent of the population — and those trends are very different from the ones Johnson cited. From 2014 to 2016, premiums for individual coverage in employer-sponsored plans rose by an average of 3 percent per year nationally, according to Kaiser. That’s a slower increase than the average of 5.2 percent per year in the three years before ACA took effect. That slowdown in rate increases also has to be put in context, though, since it is due in part to employees choosing higher-deductible plans, Kaiser notes. Study methodology questioned Adler also took issue with part of the Manhattan Institute’s methodology. The study simplified the final comparison by combining the pre-ACA rates paid by healthy people and the higher rates paid by those previously denied coverage, weighting the rates based on the percentage previously denied and how much more they typically paid. The result was a more straightforward conclusion but one that didn’t really reflect either of the two groups. Healthy people in the individual marketplace saw premiums grow by even more than the amount cited in the study, but sicker people likely saw premiums drop, or were able to get coverage when they previously couldn’t, Adler said. And that less-than-healthy group is not small: A 2009 study by the American Health Insurance Plans Center for Policy and Research said 34 percent of all policyholders were offered insurance at higher than standard rates. The Manhattan Institute study also did not factor in the subsidies that many people receive to offset the higher premiums in the individual market. PolitiFact National noted this in a 2013 fact check addressing a claim by Fox News host Sean Hannity based on the Manhattan Institute study. But both the study and Johnson were clearly referencing premiums, not out-of-pocket costs. Our rating Johnson said premiums have doubled and tripled in Wisconsin after Obamacare. That was based on extrapolating a study that looked only at 2014, but the study author said Johnson’s approach was methodologically sound. And an analysis by PolitiFact Wisconsin found similar numbers. Those increases are only true for the 6 percent of Wisconsinites buying insurance on the individual market, but that was the group specifically identified in the debate question to which Johnson was responding. And while the study did not differentiate on the health of policyholders, it did provide a general range for how premiums changed after the Affordable Care Act.

pomt-12506	Trump has "worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Truman."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/27/sean-spicer/trump-has-signed-more-bills-100-days-any-president/	Counting the number of laws he’s signed, President Donald Trump has been more productive in his first 100 days than any president since Harry Truman, according to press secretary Sean Spicer. "Despite the historic obstruction by Senate Democrats, he's worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Truman, and these bills deliver on some of his most significant promises to the American people," Spicer said at the White House daily press briefing April 25. This is a new assessment of Trump’s output so far from the White House; Trump previously, wrongly, said no administration had accomplished as much as he did, period. Trump has signed 28 bills so far. Spicer’s correct that this is more than every president going back about 70 years. However, this isn’t a perfect measure — primarily because not all bills are created equal. None of the bills Trump has signed into law are particularly significant. The numbers Truman signed 55 bills in his first 100 days after his 1948 election. (Truman first became president in 1945, when Franklin D. Roosevelt died in office. So we’re starting with the first 100 days of Truman’s first full term.) No president since Truman has signed as many bills in his first 100 days, according to data from GovTrack and research by political scientists John Frendreis, Raymond Tatalovich and Jon Schaff. The next highest after Trump, who has signed 28 bills, was John F. Kennedy, who signed 26. The lowest was George W. Bush, who signed seven. No president comes close to Roosevelt, who began the tradition of marking the first 100 days. He signed 76. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Note on the chart: For presidents Jimmy Carter through Trump, we did our own count using GovTrack. For earlier presidents, we used data confirmed by Frendreis, a political science professor at Loyola University Chicago. For Lyndon Johnson and Truman, who both came into office to replace a president midterm, we used the first 100 days after their re-election. We left out Gerald Ford because he did not serve a full term. Of the post-Truman presidents, Trump is "fairly typical" in terms of the number of bills signed so far, Frendreis said. The bills Spicer says that Trump has shepherded these bills through Congress. However, the 28 bills aren’t very significant and don’t appear to have required vote whipping from the White House. For example, three bills appoint individuals to the Smithsonian Institution board, two name buildings, and one designates a location for a National Desert Storm and Desert Shield Memorial. The most notable bills Trump has signed are a set of 13 that reverse Obama-era regulations on a range of issues including on internet privacy and gun control. While that was a goal for Republican lawmakers, it’s important to note these bills made it to Trump’s desk through a process made possible by the Congressional Review Act, which became law in 1996. The act gives Congress a narrow window to reverse regulations, so these 13 bills had to get through Congress within Trump’s first 100 days. Notably missing from the list of 28 bills that have reached his desk: A bill repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, along with several other laws Trump said he would try to usher through Congress within his first 100 days. Compare this to President Barack Obama, who signed 14 laws, but those laws included the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act and the $800 billion stimulus package. Or Roosevelt, who within 100 days signed 15 major bills including the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which established farm subsidies, and the National Industrial Recovery Act, which started public-works efforts to reverse the Great Depression. He signed bills that legalized the manufacture and sale of beer and wine and established the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. and the Tennessee Valley Authority. This doesn’t necessarily reflect badly on Trump. Generally speaking, it’s rare for a president to sign major legislation in his first 100 days, Frendreis said. "Outsider" presidents like Trump, in particular, need time to learn how to navigate the lawmaking process in Washington, and major legislation doesn’t move through Congress quickly. The first 100 days is "not necessarily an accurate reflection of how effective a president is going to be in leading Congress," he said. Our ruling Spicer said Trump has "worked with Congress to pass more legislation in his first 100 days than any president since Truman." In the first 100 days of his first full term, Truman signed 55 bills. The president with the highest count since then is Trump with 28. None of the bills Trump has signed so far are major pieces of legislation, so it doesn’t indicate that Trump has been particularly skilled at getting his agenda through Congress so far.

pomt-07763	"Every (Wisconsin) legislator that votes for this bill" will have to "give up the same amount of pay" as other state employees.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/24/jeff-fitzgerald/fitzgerald-wisconsin-legislaors-would-have-give-sa/	Facing a budget shortfall, many legislators in Wisconsin have talked about the need for shared sacrifice to justify Gov. Scott Walker's plan to require state employees to pay more for health and pension benefits. But what about the elected officials themselves? Are they making a sacrifice? In an interview with Fox's Sean Hannity on Feb. 22, 2011, Republican Jeff Fitzgerald, speaker of the Wisconsin State Assembly, said Wisconsin legislators would be subject to the same cuts the governor is proposing for other government workers. "You know, we are all in this together," Fitzgerald said. "Every legislator that votes for this bill as well is going to do the same for themselves. We have to give up the same amount of pay." Amid the fiery debate over benefits cuts and collective bargaining rights -- and the potential ripple effect around the nation -- we haven't heard much about how Walker's plan would personally affect the legislators who will vote on it, so we decided to check Fitzgerald's comment. Walker's plan would require most public workers to pay half their pension costs -- typically 5.8 percent of pay for state workers -- and at least 12 percent of their health care costs. A detailed analysis of Walker's proposal by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau says that under Walker's plan any participant in the Wisconsin Retirement System, including elected officials, "would be required to make an employee contribution to the WRS in an amount equal to one-half of all actuarially-required contributions, as approved by the Employee Trust Fund (ETF) Board." Under current 2011 rates, one half of the general participant rate would be 5.8 percent and one half of the executive/elected official rate would be 6.65 percent. So elected officials would actually be paying a little more than government workers, said Robert Lang, director of the Wisconsin's Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Currently, Lang noted, most general government employees pay a slight share -- less than 1 percent of their salary -- toward their pension, and elected officials don't pay anything. As for health benefits, the bill doesn't specifically mention the effect on elected officials. It simply talks about changes related to anyone participating in the state's "group insurance board coverage." That includes elected officials, Lang said. So elected officials also would have to pay the same share for health care as all state employees covered by the health plan. (For details, see pages 29 and 30 of the Legislative Fiscal Bureau analysis). There's one other piece of the bill that would affect the benefits of elected officials, and it has to do with the way pension benefits are calculated. Pension payments are based on a formula derived from the employee's salary, years of service and a set multiplier. For general employees, that multiplier is 1.6. For elected officials, the multiplier is currently 2.0. Under the budget repair bill, however, the multiplier for elected officials would drop to 1.6, the same as everyone else (see page 3 of the budget repair bill, or page 33 of the Fiscal Bureau analysis for further details). Bottom line, they'll be getting less in their pension checks. The new, lower multiplier won't take effect until the next legislative session. We also ran Fitzgerald's statement by Jeff Leverich, senior researcher for the Wisconsin Education Association Council, and he agreed with Lang. "That is our understanding too, co-pay applies to elected officials; however, some ambiguity remains about when they might be enacted given statutory language governing timing of compensation changes for elected" officials, Leverich stated via e-mail. According to Lang, elected officials would have to start paying more toward pension and health benefits immediately, just like everyone else. Leverich, of WEAC, also argued that while co-pays may be the same for elected officials, there would still be a disparity in bargaining positions. "Please realize, however, that the elimination of bargaining rights is a different order of magnitude," Leverich said. "The effects of the legislation on the two parties (legislators/public workers) is truly dissimilar." In short, Fitzgerald said the legislators who will vote on Walker's bill would have to give up the same amount of pay. Aside from the collective bargaining issues, Walker's plan would make state employees pay more for health and pension benefits. And according to the bill, elected officials would take the same hits. We rate Fitzgerald's claim True.	None	Jeff Fitzgerald	None	None	None	2011-02-24T17:42:15	2011-02-22	['Wisconsin']
pomt-00224	Says #MeToo movement sign suggested assaulting First Lady Melania Trump.	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/11/joshua-feuerstein/metoo-protester-not-pictured-2016-photo-disturbing/	A two-year-old viral photo with a disturbing sign about First Lady Melania Trump re-emerged on Facebook on Oct. 8, 2018, garnering more than 11,000 reactions and 8,000 shares. The photo caption said the sign-holder was part of the one-year-old #MeToo movement. That’s not true. The person holding the sign was planted to discredit protesters of President Donald Trump following the 2016 election, according to numerous news reports. Jack Posobiec, who is credited with planting the sign, also heavily promoted the debunked Pizzagate conspiracy theory and helped organize the DeploraBall, an informal inauguration party marked by clashes between Trump’s supporters and protesters. The photo was posted more recently by Joshua Feuerstein, a former pastor who uses social media to promote his vision of evangelical Christianity. Feuerstein notably made headlines in 2015 for his viral video attacking Starbucks over its holiday cups. The reposted 2016 photo shows someone in a crowd of people holding a sign that says "Rape Melania." "This is the tolerant left #MeToo movement ... suggesting a sexual assault against the First Lady!!! Wow!!" the accompanying post read. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That photo has made waves on the internet before, originally posted a week after the 2016 election on Twitter by Alan Beck, a Trump supporter whose account has since been suspended. "DC Trump Protestor (sic) ‘Rape Melania,’" the original tweet said. People debated the legitimacy of the image and whether it was Photoshopped, but photos of the sign exist from different angles, taken by different people, confirming it was there. Response and reactions from Twitter users caused "#RapeMelania" to trend on Twitter, which prompted criticism against the social media platform for allowing such a hashtag to trend.

pomt-01488	"Michelle Nunn’s own plan says she funded organizations linked to terrorists."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2014/sep/26/david-perdue/perdues-attempt-tar-nunn-terrorist-link-fails/	With Election Day just about five weeks away, and polls consistently showing a tight race with national implications, the battle to become Georgia’s next U.S. senator has turned ugly. In a newly released television ad that carries echoes of the late-campaign attacks that pundits said worked during the GOP runoff, Republican candidate David Perdue goes after Democrat Michelle Nunn for a supposed weakness on border security. Before he gets to that though, a narrator opens with a simple statement: "Michelle Nunn’s own plan says she funded organizations linked to terrorists." If that wasn’t clear enough, an overlay in all capital writing spells out what it calls an "exact quote" from a Nunn campaign document: "awards to inmates, terrorists." A simple sentence but serious implications. Is the ad right, that Michelle Nunn admits to financial ties to terrorists? PolitiFact Georgia decided to take a close look. The conservative National Review revealed in July that it had a 144-page series of Nunn campaign memos from last December. The story broke about a week after Perdue won the Republican nomination, in part by attacking rival U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston as "pro-amnesty" and in the pocket of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The leaked memos lay out Nunn's campaign strategy and include, among other things, detailed fundraising plans, a public relations strategy and list of anticipated attacks in the race. In those anticipated attacks and vulnerabilities is the reference to "service awards to inmates, terrorists" during her Points of Light tenure. The plan called for her team to have "pushback" documents ready for those anticipated issues as well as common, more broad attacks leveled against Democratic candidates. That means Nunn’s camp correctly predicted the GOP would attack her on the issue, not that there is a connection to be made. And about that connection? Perdue spokesman Derrick Dickey said the statement was based first on Nunn’s leaked documents and then cited a National Review story following up on the leak as evidence of the terrorist connection. "This isn’t something that we pulled out of thin air," Dickey said. The story refers to a link that PolitiFact Georgia already ruled as Mostly False when used in an attack ad from Ending Spending Action Fund. The Super PAC– which at nearly $2.8 million has injected the most outside money into the Georgia Senate race – centered its attack on MissionFish, a business that Points of Light owned until 2012 that collected donations from eBay users for about 20,000 charities. One of those charities, Islamic Relief USA, received about $13,500 in donations from MissionFish, and has partnered with the umbrella group Islamic Relief Worldwide (IRW) on disaster relief programs. A top Israeli defense official has accused IRW of having links to the terrorist group Hamas, and in June, the defense minister banned it from operating there. In 2012, one British bank closed an IRW account over counter-terrorism concerns. But the U.S. State Department does not consider the group a terrorist organization or front. The United Kingdom Charity Commission, which regulates IRW, also has found no such ties. The nonprofit released a statement following Israel’s ban, adamantly denying any links to terrorism. Islamic Relief USA, meanwhile, earns a perfect score from Charity Navigator for its transparency and accounting. The group does give grants to IRW for humanitarian programs in developing countries, as it does with other groups, said advocacy counsel Sharif Aly. But it also works with the American Red Cross and other charities in disaster relief, such as an ongoing effort to help with flooding in the Detroit area. "We are not terrorists and we do not support terrorism," Aly said. "Any money disbursed, inside or outside the United States, follows all regulations to ensure that." Nunn declined to be drawn into the debate this summer, when the memo was first unveiled. She did tell the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the memos, including the anticipated attacks, were more advice from supporters than a strict campaign blueprint. Nunn spokesman Nathan Click told PolitiFact Georgia that of course Nunn "absolutely" did not support terrorism or have any connections to terrorists. "That is not what the memo says," Click said. "It anticipates attacks that mischaracterize her record and distort her experience. That’s exactly what has happened." So where does that leave us with an attack that states as fact that Michelle Nunn’s own internal documents says she funded organizations that have terrorist ties? The Perdue ad plainly misconstrues what the Nunn internal memos said and why. PolitiFact Georgia has already ruled that tying Nunn’s nonprofit work to terrorism is off base. The effort to make the connection by incorrectly citing her campaign’s leaked memos verges on the ridiculous. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-12267	"Gas prices are the lowest in the U.S. in over ten years!"	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/06/donald-trump/donald-trump-right-gas-prices-now-lowest-over-10-y/	All presidents like to tout their policy accomplishments, and Donald Trump is no exception. On July 4 -- one of the major travel weekends of the year -- Trump tweeted, "Gas prices are the lowest in the U.S. in over ten years! I would like to see them go even lower." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We are fairly certain we know what Trump meant to say. But that's not what he said. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) What Trump likely meant to say On the one hand, the American Automobile Association told PolitiFact that gasoline prices on Independence Day weekend were the lowest they have been in 12 years -- since 2005. "Gas prices have been declining since the beginning of June," said Jeanette Casselano, a spokesperson for AAA. "At $2.23, today’s national gas price average is the cheapest price we’ve seen since January. "The combination of tepid demand and increasing gasoline and crude output continues to put downward pressure on gas prices, and motorists are benefitting." There’s value in comparing gas prices using a narrow window of time like the July 4 weekend, because comparing, for example, summer prices to winter prices is like comparing apples and oranges. What Trump actually said However, the way Trump phrased his tweet was more expansive. Rather than limiting the comparison to the July 4 weekend, the tweet suggests that at no point over the last decade-plus have gas prices been lower. And that would not be correct, according to data from the Energy Information Administration, a federal office. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com There were 85 weeks in which gas cost less than $2.26 per gallon, the price it was at the time of Trump’s tweet. That means that for about one-sixth of the time over the last decade, gas cost less than it does now. (The EIA data does mirror AAA’s assessment for Fourth of July weekend prices.) The Energy Information Administration’s data set uses nominal dollars rather than inflation-adjusted dollars, so just to be certain, we ran the data through the federal inflation calculator to see how adjusting for inflation affected that number. The answer: 58 weeks. That’s still about one-ninth of the last decade. Trump's role in gas prices Then there’s the question of whether Trump deserves bragging rights. In general, presidents have rarely had a direct impact on the price of gasoline, said Philip Verleger, an economist and head of the energy consulting firm PKVerleger LLC. "The only one who had an impact was Jimmy Carter, who instituted price controls that managed to ball up the distribution of gasoline, leading to lines at gas stations," he said. Overall, presidents are "not a big factor" on gasoline prices, he said. Indeed, gas cost less during much of President Barack Obama’s last year in office than it does now. Our ruling Trump tweeted, "Gas prices are the lowest in the U.S. in over ten years!" Trump likely meant to say that gas prices on the July 4 weekend are lower now than at any point since 2005. But Trump tweeted something more sweeping -- that gas prices haven’t been lower in more than a decade. That’s not correct. As such,we rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-02479	A Congressional Budget Office report says President Barack Obama’s executive order to raise the minimum wage for new federal contract workers "will cost the economy 500,000 jobs."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/feb/20/kai-ryssdal/marketplace-host-kai-ryssdal-talks-cbo-report-mini/	The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office re-entered the spotlight this week with a report that offered a little something for everyone on the effects of raising the federal minimum wage for workers. For those pushing for a $10.10 an hour wage, the CBO concluded 16.5 million low-wage earners would make more money a week under the proposal. For people opposing the increased federal wage, the report found that raising it to $10.10 an hour would cost the country 500,000 jobs. On American Public Media's Marketplace, host Kai Ryssdal tried to explain the developments to listeners. Marketplace is a business and economic affairs program that airs on NPR stations in many U.S. markets. "From the Congressional Budget Office today, this little tidbit: You remember President Obama's plan to raise the minimum wage for new federal contract workers to $10.10 an hour? He signed the executive order just the other day, right? Well, the CBO said today that will cost the economy 500,000 jobs by the second half of 2016. Me? I figure the partisan bickering over that starts right about ... now." A PunditFact reader flagged Ryssdal's comments and asked us if they were accurate. (You can hear them about 5 minutes into this podcast.) In this case, Ryssdal wrongly linked President Barack Obama's executive order for federal contract workers to what the CBO studied, which was the proposal to raise the minimum wage for workers nationwide. The CBO concluded if the federal government gradually increased the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour for all workers, and tied future increases to inflation, the economy would shed 500,000 jobs by the second half of 2016 (all things constant under current law). That’s about 0.3 percent of the workforce. For the record, CBO analysts also said the number of lost jobs could vary depending on a number of factors. Overall, the effect could be anywhere from a "very slight" decrease in employment to a reduction of 1 million workers, CBO found. The White House objected to CBO's findings, with economic adviser Jason Furman telling reporters the report "goes outside of the consensus view" of economists who study the effect of higher minimum wages on employment. The CBO analysis did contain good news for the White House, however. It concluded an additional 900,000 families would be pulled out of poverty and 16.5 million workers would get a raise if the minimum wage is increased to $10.10 an hour. Marketplace senior producer Sitara Nieves acknowledged the mistake in an email to PunditFact and said it would be corrected on air. Our ruling Ryssdal said a Congressional Budget Office report found that an executive order raising the minimum wage for new federal contract workers "will cost the economy 500,000 jobs." A CBO analysis did conclude that raising the minimum wage to $10.10 an hour could cost the country 500,000 jobs by the second half of 2016. But the analysis was looking at raising the minimum wage for all American workers, not just federal contract workers as Ryssdal said. We rate his claim False.

pomt-09259	Numbers on illegal immigrants "are down in terms of apprehensions, which indicates fewer illegal crossings, but also up in terms of actual enforcement actions."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/may/03/janet-napolitano/facts-illegal-immigrants-show-nuances-enforcement-/	Janet Napolitano, secretary of Homeland Security, appeared on ABC News' This Week and discussed a new law in Arizona that makes being an illegal immigrant a state crime and requires immigrants to carry papers that confirm their legal status. Napolitano is not a fan of the new law, saying it could invite racial profiling and was bad for law enforcement. And, she said, statistics are against the need for a new law. "And actually, the numbers, if you step back and look at it, the numbers actually are down in terms of apprehensions, which indicates fewer illegal crossings, but also up in terms of actual enforcement actions. So the numbers actually are countered to what the action of the legislature is," Napolitano said. "But you know what? There's still a frustration out there. It's a frustration, ultimately, that will only be solved with comprehensive immigration reform." Here, we're checking Napolitano's statement that apprehensions of illegal immigrants are down while enforcement actions are up. We asked the U.S. Department of Homeland Security about her statement, and they sent us two sets of numbers for fiscal years 2007, 2008 and 2009. The numbers they sent us showed that border apprehensions were down. On the southern border, apprehensions dropped from 858,638 in 2007 to 705,005 in 2008 and to 540,865 in 2009. For evidence that enforcement actions are up, the department sent us statistics on removals, which include deportations as well as people who leave the country without a formal order. Those numbers increased from 291,060 in 2007 to 369,221 in 2008 and 387,790 in 2009. We then asked a couple of independent experts for their thoughts of the numbers. The numbers of apprehensions at the border are going down because there are fewer people trying to get across the border since the U.S. economy soured in 2008, said senior demographer Jeffrey Passel of the Pew Hispanic Center, a nonpartisan research organization that collects statistics on Hispanics and immigration. "Immigration to the U.S. from Mexico is down, and it's down a lot," he said. Over the past several years, enforcement action on the border has tightened, he said. It is more difficult to get across the border, and people in Mexico have to pay more to smugglers to get them across. "It's harder to get in, and it's more dangerous," he said. As for the second statistic, counting removals as a proxy for enforcement action is problematic, Passel said. Some people who are being removed are in the interior of the United States, such as criminals who served a prison term and are being deported upon release. Still, those numbers have been going up, as Napolitano indicated. The Obama administration appears to be conducting fewer raids on job sites where illegal immigrants work, Passel said, because the adminsitration seems to prefer workplace audits, which result in fewer immigrant arrests. "At one level, the results are often the same, in that the workers lose their jobs," he said. "But the workers aren't getting picked up." We also spoke with Mark Krikorian, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, a nonpartisan research group that supports lower levels of immigration. Krikorian agreed that there has been an overall drop in people trying to cross the border, and an increase in the number of removals. But he too cautioned that using removal numbers as a proxy for "enforcement action" can be misleading. "They're part of a picture, but that's all they are," he said. He also said the trend in removals may be coming to an end. The Washington Post reported that immigration officials were setting quotas for deportations because they wanted to avoid a steep drop-off in the numbers for 2010. So Napolitano said that the numbers "are down in terms of apprehensions, which indicates fewer illegal crossings, but also up in terms of actual enforcement actions." We agree that apprehensions are down, which indicates fewer illegal border crossings. Removals are also up. But we question whether removals are the same thing as "actual enforcement actions." The picture there is a little more nuanced. So we rate Napolitano's statement Mostly True.	None	Janet Napolitano	None	None	None	2010-05-03T18:02:13	2010-05-02	['None']
pomt-00765	Says Marco Rubio "voted to deport" young people known as Dreamers.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/14/people-american-way/did-marco-rubio-vote-deport-dreamers/	On the day Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., announced his presidential campaign, opponents came out with an ad attacking his record. People for the American Way, a liberal advocacy group, released a Spanish-language radio ad that calls Rubio "just another Republican with a dangerous plan" and claims he supports tax cuts for the wealthy and cutting Medicare funding. The ad is set to run in Denver and Miami, Rubio’s hometown. The ad also pits Rubio against "Dreamers" -- young people who arrived in the United States illegally as children who have been granted temporary status for deferred deportation under a 2012 White House program. "Instead of giving Dreamers an opportunity to go to college and build a future, Marco Rubio voted to deport them," the ad’s narrator said. Rubio, a son of Cuban immigrants, has long been an advocate for changing immigration law, including a path to citizenship. Did he really vote to deport the approximately 700,000 immigrants covered by this program? The votes A spokeswoman for People for the American Way sent us evidence for the ad, which points to three instances where the group believes Rubio voted on legislation that amounts to deporting Dreamers. We also reached out to Rubio’s staff but did not hear back. To be clear: Rubio did not vote on any sort of yes-no measure that specifically called for deporting this group of individuals. Rather, these three votes had to do with an appropriations bill to fund the Department of Homeland Security. In February, the fight between Democrats and Republicans over Homeland Security funding ultimately turned into a proxy war over immigration. Many Republicans, including Rubio, wanted to pass a bill that funded Homeland Security but stripped money from programs that would fund the 2012 program -- called "deferred action for childhood arrivals," or DACA -- as well as President Barack Obama’s 2014 executive action that attempts to extend deferred deportations to a larger group of people. Rubio voted in favor of this limiting funding three times this year (Feb. 3, Feb. 4 and Feb. 5). Nowhere does this version of the legislation say young people protected by Obama’s 2012 action would be deported. Though by stripping funding from the program, it’s possible that they wouldn’t be able to renew their participation in the program, meaning they could face a greater threat of deportation in the future. Politico described it as such: Gutting the program "effectively could leave more than 600,000 of the so-called Dreamers open to being deported." (Pew says there’s 700,000.) Senate Republicans also proposed a version of the bill that would have targeted Obama’s 2014 expanded executive action but continued funding for the 2012 deferred action for childhood arrivals program, protecting Dreamers from deportation. But Democrats didn’t bite, hoping instead for a bill that left both programs in tact. So that bill never came up for a vote. In any case, the votes referenced by People for the American Way were not final; they would have simply moved the bill closer to a vote on final passage. Democrats blocked the bill from moving any further, and eventually Congress passed "clean" Homeland Security funding that did not block Obama’s immigration orders. While he does not support expanding the program to apply to more recent arrivals, Rubio expressed support for maintaining Dreamers’ status in the days after the vote -- at least while Congress works on a permanent solution. "Eventually that program has to end. It cannot be the permanent policy of the United States," he said in a Feb. 18 press gaggle. "What I'm not advocating is that we cancel it right now at this moment, because you already have people that have signed up for it. They're working, they're going to school. It would be deeply disruptive. But at some point, it has to come to an end. It can't be the permanent policy. And my hope is that it would come to an end because it's replaced by a permanent solution like the one I've outlined through the three-step process." It’s worth noting that back in 2012, Rubio supported a plan quite similar to Obama’s deferred action for childhood arrivals program. A spokesman told the Tampa Bay Times that Rubio’s plan never materialized because they were concerned that it would encourage illegal immigration. Our ruling A radio ad from People for the American Way said, "Marco Rubio voted to deport" young people known as Dreamers. Rubio did not literally vote to deport young immigrants protected by Obama’s "deferred action for childhood arrivals" program. He voted in favor of an appropriations bill that would have stripped funding from the program, which might have resulted in future deportations if it had passed. But that’s only speculation. Additionally, Rubio has specifically said that he does not support affecting the status of current Dreamers, though he does oppose expanding the program and has said it should not be permanent policy. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-01195	Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed became a city resident in the last annexation, opening the door to his candidacy.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/dec/03/keisha-lance-bottoms/councilwoman-right-annexation-drew-reed-city/	Atlanta may have been founded as the end of the line, but it has hardly held to that designation. Founded in 1847, Atlanta’s original city limits were a single-mile radius around the Zero Mile Post, or terminus of the Western & Atlantic Railroad. Today, the city covers nearly 132 square miles of land stretched out over two counties. Terminus is little more than a marker next to the southern entrance of Underground Atlanta (and a particularly distasteful safe haven for "The Walking Dead" fans). With two more communities on the edges of the city debating whether to join Atlanta, one city councilwoman was quoted in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution story talking about what recent annexations meant for the city. "You brought in a mayor with the last annexation," District 11 Councilwoman Keisha Lance Bottoms said of Mayor Kasim Reed, referring to the 2006 annexation of what is now known as southwest Atlanta. Is that right, that growing Atlanta’s borders created the opportunity for Reed, a former state senator, to become Atlanta’s 59th mayor? The AJC Truth-O-Meter spun back in time to find out. The city’s Geographic Information Systems department keeps detailed maps of Atlanta’s 133 annexations. All but 18 of those actions have been to grow the city, including the massive addition of Buckhead and Lakewood in 1952. One of the outliers was a decision to hold off on annexing Sandtown in 2006. That south Fulton community, along with the DeKalb County sections of the historic Druid Hills community, is now weighing whether to join Atlanta. If there is another round of annexations, it will be the first changing of the city’s borders since 2007, when Atlanta absorbed three Southside subdivisions. Bottoms, though, said she was referring to the much larger 2006 annexation that brought in about 2,000 residents from then-newly developed subdivisions along Cascade Road as it passes south and west out of the city. The councilwoman herself has lived in that area, also known as Midwest Cascade, since the mid-1990s. She was active in her subdivision’s homeowners association when the community was part of unincorporated Fulton County. The annexation paved the way for her to run for the council, where she has served since 2010. Reed was sworn in that same year. PolitiFact Georgia recently ruled Mostly True that Reed’s first term was marked by keeping campaign promises such as a major pension overhaul and hiring more police officers. "We both lived in the same area, in two different neighborhoods," Bottoms said. "Annexation meant there was an opportunity for people who had lived there to run for city office and get involved." Reed has said he supports annexing Druid Hills from DeKalb County and Sandtown in south Fulton, if those residents seek to join the city. But that is not because the former state senator – who represented pieces of unincorporated Fulton and Atlanta during his legislative tenure – was exactly the beneficiary of annexation the way that Bottoms described. Reed lived in Loch Lochman Estates during the 2006 annexation. That subdivision is literally down the street from what became Atlanta – but it was not included in the expansion. Today, it remains part of the unincorporated county. But Reed’s spokeswoman said that annexation did prompt him to move to Midwest Cascade, where he still lives. "He moved, but he is in the same neighborhood," spokeswoman Anne Torres said. "So the councilwoman is right to say that annexation did bring him in." So where does that leave us? We won’t quibble with Bottoms’ reference to the last annexation, considering the small size of the 2007 additions. She is not quite right on her claim that the larger 2006 annexation included Reed’s subdivision, which opened the door to his candidacy. The mayor’s office said, though, that the move did push him to a different house in the same neighborhood so he could be a city resident. To that end, her point is correct. There is some additional context needed to make sense of it all. But overall, we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-15086	"You know our current president is (Muslim). You know he's not even an American."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/18/town-hall-audience-member/obama-muslim-audience-member-says-donald-trump-201/	We thought (hoped, maybe) the idea that President Barack Obama is Muslim from Kenya was dead and buried. But even in 2015, it lives on. This myth has been debunked over and over and over again. We’ve been fact-checking claims about this since 2007, the year PolitiFact went live. Yet it resurfaced Sept. 17, 2015 in Rochester, N.H., at a town hall event for Republican presidential candidate and real estate mogul Donald Trump. An unidentified audience member asked the first question: What would President Trump would do about Muslims in the United States? Here’s the exchange. Audience member: "We have a problem in this country. It's called Muslims. You know our current president is one. You know he's not even an American." Trump: "We need this question. This is the first question." Audience member: "Anyway, we have training camps growing where they want to kill us. That's my question: When can we get rid of them?" Trump: "We're going to be looking at a lot of different things. You know, a lot of people are saying that and a lot of people are saying that bad things are happening. We're going to be looking at that and plenty of other things." Trump was immediately criticized for not countering the man’s comments -- both the assertion that Muslims are a "problem" and that Obama is one. A recent CNN poll found that 29 percent of Americans and 43 percent of Republicans think Obama is Muslim. Let’s revisit why we know this is not true. (He’s actually Protestant.) Muslim? In 2010, we rated the statement "President Obama is a Muslim" Pants on Fire. Our fact-checking has shown that Obama is a Christian. According to the president's memoirs and independent biographies, Obama became a Christian when he was in his 20s while working as a community organizer in Chicago. (He was not raised in any particular faith as a child.) Obama said the churches there impressed him with their commitment to social justice and the hope they gave to the poor. Several independent reports have documented Obama's church membership and faith life. In office, Obama has not attended one church regularly. Instead, he has worshipped at various churches in the Washington area, including the Allen Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, and St. John's Episcopal Church. He also has attended services at Camp David, the presidential retreat. PolitiFact has debunked claims in chain e-mails that he attended a radical Islamic school, that his political rise mirrored a biblical tale about the Antichrist, and that he took the oath for U.S. Senate on a Koran. All three earned our lowest rating, Pants on Fire. Why do so many people keep saying he's Muslim? One explanation is that there is genuine confusion about his religion because Obama has Muslim ancestors on his father's side and a traditionally Muslim middle name, Hussein. Another possible explanation is that people who disagree with him politically and dislike the Muslim religion like to associate him with something they perceive to be negative. Born in Kenya? The audience member also said Obama isn’t an American. In case you’ve forgotten, back in 2011 and 2012, Trump argued that Obama wasn’t really eligible to be president because he was born in Kenya, not the United States. This is also not true -- Obama was born in Honolulu. PolitiFact went to great lengths to document Obama’s Hawaii birth certificate. See our guide to Obama’s birth certificate. As part of his "birther" crusade, Trump said in 2011, Obama's "grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya and she was there and witnessed the birth." The claim is based on an Oct. 16, 2008, telephone call between Bishop Ron McRae of the Anabaptist Churches of North America and Sarah Obama of Kenya, Barack Obama's elderly step-grandmother. In the call, we hear a very rough Swahili-to-English translation in which an elderly woman agreed to a leading question that Obama was born in Kenya and that she was present. But the grandmother and translator immediately, clearly and repeatedly corrected the answer to say that Obama was born in the United States, and she was not present. We rated Trump’s claim False. Just this year, an image circulating on Facebook accused Obama of reaching back to his Kenyan roots for inspiration in choosing to drop President William McKinley as the namesake of America’s tallest mountain. The image said, "‘Denali’ is the Kenyan word for ‘black power.’" In reality, Denali means "high" or "tall" in a native Alaskan language and has been used by native Alaskans as a name for the mountain for generations. Pants on Fire! Our ruling An audience member at a Trump campaign event said, "You know our current president is (Muslim). You know he's not even an American." PolitiFact and others have repeatedly debunked both of these claims -- that Obama is Muslim and that he wasn’t born in America. Against all odds, they live on. Obama is Christian and was born in Honolulu, Hawaii. We rate the audience member’s claim Pants on Fire!	None	Town hall audience member	None	None	None	2015-09-18T12:24:43	2015-09-17	['United_States']

pomt-11668	Says James Comey suggested and CNN reported that the basis of the wiretapping warrant for Trump adviser Carter Page was "all based on a dossier."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/jan/05/elizabeth-foley/taking-closer-look-steele-dossier-and-carter-pages/	Critics of the federal investigation into claims President Donald Trump’s campaign colluded with the Russian government have latched onto a theory that the inquiry only began after the FBI received a controversial dossier funded by Democrats and littered with unproven allegations. But that, too, is unproven. On CNN Jan. 2, Florida International University law professor Elizabeth Foley claimed that the 35-page collection of research memos, which has come to be called the Steele Dossier, started a chain of events that led to the wiretapping of Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page. Here’s what she said, and how CNN’s Anderson Cooper and Jeffrey Toobin reacted. "On July 7, Carter Page goes to Moscow to give a speech at a University," Foley said. "On July 19, this is 2016, (former British intelligence officer Christopher) Steele submits a salacious dossier to the FBI about some sort of quid pro quo being discussed between Page and Russian oligarchs. He submits that to the FBI on July 19. About a month later we have the FBI going to the foreign intelligence surveillance court to get a wiretap, to get surveillance of Carter Page. And this is all based on a dossier." "You have no proof of that!" Cooper interrupted. "You don’t know that!" echoed panelist Jeffrey Toobin. "That’s what Jim Comey has suggested," Foley said. "That’s what CNN reported in April (2017). And that’s also what the New York Times previously reported in April 2017. So, all of sudden now they are trying to walk back the genesis of this investigation and switch it to (Trump adviser George) Papadopoulos. If they really believe national security was at risk and there was some collusion why would they have waited four months?" "I'll double check this, professor, but I don’t believe that we reported that was the basis for this," Cooper responded. "But I’ll double check it." Cooper did look into it, and so did we. We can’t say what motivated the FBI to begin an investigation into Page, but the reporting that Foley said traced the genesis of the Page investigation to the Steele Dossier isn’t cut-and-dried. What’s been reported The dossier in question was compiled by a former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele and contained numerous explosive but unverified claims. The memos were compiled by a research firm called Fusion GPS, who was first hired by The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative publication that was reporting on the Republican primary field. After the Republican primary, Fusion GPS was hired on behalf of Clinton’s campaign. That’s when the firm hired Steele. The dossier circulated among Washington lawmakers, intelligence agents and journalists for months before becoming public knowledge, when unnamed U.S. officials told CNN in January 2017 that intelligence officers presented Trump with a summary of the document. (Then BuzzFeed published its entirety.) The dossier claims that Page met with Russians and discussed quid-pro-quo deals relating to sanctions and Russia's interference in the election. Trump, himself, has blamed the dossier for launching the FBI probe into his campaign. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Shortly after the original CNN broadcast where Foley made the claim, Cooper did his own fact-check of Foley’s claim. He read aloud an excerpt of a story CNN published on April 17. CNN reported that the FBI used the Russian dossier as "part of the justification" — not the only reason — to win approval to secretly monitor Carter. It went on to paraphrase unnamed officials "familiar with the process," who said that if information from the dossier was used, it would only be after the FBI corroborated the information through its own investigation. "The officials would not say what or how much was corroborated," CNN reported. "U.S. law enforcement and intelligence officials have said U.S. investigators did their own work, separate from the dossier, to support their findings that Russia tried to meddle in the 2016 presidential election in favor of Trump." In other words, the dossier was part of the reported reason, but we really can’t say how much. In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Foley said CNN offered no evidence to support this assertion that the FBI did in fact corroborate the report other than paraphrasing an unnamed source. "While the CNN report intimates that there may be other sources of information besides the dossier, neither CNN nor any of its sources proffer any clue as to what those sources may be, or even whether there is any reliable evidence that such sources actually exist," Foley said. As for the New York Times, Foley was referring to a report published on April 19 about Carter’s visit to Moscow that garnered the attention of the FBI. The report does not mention the dossier, but said the investigation spawned after his July 2016 trip to Moscow, in which he was critical of American policy toward Russia. "It is unclear exactly what about Mr. Page’s visit drew the FBI’s interest: meetings he had during his three days in Moscow, intercepted communications of Russian officials speaking about him, or something else," it said. What about James Comey? The CNN report says the dossier was cited by Comey in some of his briefings to members of Congress, but that doesn’t mean he suggested it was the basis of the probe. "The dossier has also been cited by FBI Director James Comey in some of his briefings to members of Congress in recent weeks, as one of the sources of information the bureau has used to bolster its investigation, according to U.S. officials briefed on the probe," CNN reported. When we showed Foley this excerpt showing Comey used the dossier "as one of" the bureau’s sources, she pushed back again, saying "innuendo is not fact." She said the only facts reported by the CNN story are that the Steele dossier was relied on to justify the collusion investigation and that Comey had relayed information about the dossier, as salient to his agency’s investigation, to members of Congress. We also looked at transcripts of Comey’s testimony in front of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on June 8 to see what he’s said on the record. Comey would not answer publically whether the FBI was able to confirm anything in the Steele dossier, but he did respond to several questions about it. And in one instance, Comey described some material in the dossier as "salacious and unverified." "The (intelligence community) leadership thought it important, for a variety of reasons, to alert the incoming president to the existence of this material, even though it was salacious and unverified," he said. Our ruling Foley said James Comey and news reporting showed the basis of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act warrant for Carter Page was "all based on a dossier." This is not accurate. CNN and the New York Times never reported that the dossier was the basis for Carter’s probe. CNN reported that it "part of the justification" and the New York Times didn’t even mention the dossier. We couldn’t find any evidence that proved Comey suggested that Page’s warrant was "all based on a dossier." According to CNN’s unnamed sources, Comey has cited the dossier, but has not confirmed publically how much of it has been verified. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-08814	"Phoenix, Ariz., is the No. 2 kidnapping capital of the world."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/16/courtney-combs/state-rep-courtney-combs-says-phoenix-no-2-kidnapp/	A stake through the heart will kill a vampire. A silver bullet can stop a werewolf. But no known substance, it seems, can stop the monstrous notion that Phoenix has the second-highest kidnapping rate in the world -- an eye-popping claim that has more lives than even disco music. The latest conservative to parrot this line is State Rep. Courtney Combs, a Republican from Butler County and the Ohio lawmaker most involved in the debate over illegal immigration. Combs, who is drafting legislation to bring an Arizona-style immigration law to Ohio, appeared July 16 at the City Club in Cleveland to take part in a discussion on illegal immigration. Halfway through the program, after detailing a spring trip to Cochise County, Arizona, to see the impact of illegal immigration, Combs said "Phoenix, Ariz., is the No. 2 kidnapping capital of the world" to underscore how dangerous the state has become. Combs is far from alone in making this kind of claim. U.S. Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona said something similar Aug. 1 on CBS News' Face the Nation. He said Phoenix is "called the kidnapping capital of the United States because the illegal immigrants who are brought to Phoenix for distribution throughout the country are held in drop houses, and they are mistreated, horribly treated." The claim has been checked several times by PolitiFact. Rhode Island talk show host Helen Glover called Phoenix the kidnapping capital of the Western Hemisphere July 9, Sen. John McCain pushed the Phoenix as No. 2 kidnapping capital stat on "Meet the Press" June 27, and Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst made the Phoenix as No. 2 claim June 18. It's been repeated so much by conservatives that Rachel Maddow poked fun at the repeated GOP mistake, saying "it's like its just too good a talking point to stop using even though its not true." She made the quip Aug. 2 in a segment of her MSNBC show dedicated to myths about illegal immigration. In fact, Combs said he made the assertion because he heard McCain say it "on one of those talk shows" as well as being told by Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever during Combs' fact-finding foray to Arizona. "I was quoting from what I thought were reliable sources," said Combs. "When I heard it from John McCain who is a US Senator from Arizona, I presumed he knew what he was talking about." PolitiFact found that, in a nutshell, the story goes back an ABC News report from Feb. 11, 2009: "Phoenix, Ariz., has become the kidnapping capital of America, with more incidents than any other city in the world outside of Mexico City and over 370 cases last year alone." However, ABC never said how the kidnapping ranking was reached. Also, while ABC’s story specifies the number of kidnappings that have occurred in Phoenix since 2008, it doesn’t say how many kidnappings were reported in other cities. And ABC has yet to provide us with supporting evidence, although we first published an item on this back in June. Neither the FBI nor the U.S. National Central Bureau of Interpol, an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice that serves as the United States' representative to Interpol, could confirm that Phoenix has the second-highest frequency of kidnapping cases worldwide. It's simply not tracked. But overseas kidnapping experts say that cities in Mexico and Latin America see significantly more kidnapping cases than Phoenix. The experts list Mexico City; Caracas, Venezuela; Tegucigalpa, Honduras; San Salvador, El Salvador; Guatemala City, Guatemala; and Bogota, Columbia as places with probable higher kidnapping rates than Phoenix. Meanwhile, there are also problems that many places don't keep kidnapping data, kidnappings in places outside the Unites States are usually under-reported, and the definition of kidnapping can vary widely. While Phoenix has experienced hundreds of kidnappings over the past few years, we couldn't find reliable around-the-planet evidence to confirm they are number two in the world. In fact, experts advise that such rankings can't be made based on available information. If they could, they speculate, other cities would prove to have more kidnappings than Arizona's capital. So we have found nothing confirming Phoenix as No. 2 in kidnappings in the world, or in the Western Hemisphere, or in North America. Combs, to his credit, immediately backed away from his statement when told this claim has been thoroughly debunked. "I don't check out and verify everything that comes out, and I suppose I should if I'm going to repeat it in a debate," Combs said. "I appreciate you correcting the situation." We appreciate that Combs is willing to admit that he didn’t know what he was talking about, but he should have. This claim has been rated false repeatedly as it has made the rounds, yet here it is again. If you repeat a statement that has been proven false, it amounts to a reckless disregard for the facts. You may as well touch a match to your inseam. We move this statement to our lowest rating: Pants On Fire.

pomt-02478	On adoption by gay couples	full flop	/florida/statements/2014/feb/20/charlie-crist/after-he-left-gop-charlie-crist-said-he-no-longer-/	PolitiFact Florida has explored former Gov. Charlie Crist’s change of positions on a number of issues, including gay rights. Here, we wanted to look at his record on gay adoption. At one time, Florida gained national attention as a state that banned gay adoption. PolitiFact’s Flip-O-Meter doesn’t pass judgment on someone’s stance change -- we simply measure if the person did indeed "flip" and to what extent. Many politicians of both major parties have "flipped" -- or gay rights supporters might say "evolved" -- in their stances on gay rights; we leave it up to readers to decide how they feel about those flips. 2006-08 In 2006, Crist was Florida’s Republican attorney general running for governor. At the time, Florida banned gay couples from adopting but allowed them to serve as foster parents. During the race, Crist often said he was against such adoptions. "I think we need to encourage the traditional family for adoption and that's what I support," Crist told reporters in February 2006. In an MSNBC debate Oct. 30, the moderator asked Crist his opinion on gay adoption. "I am opposed to it. I think that we have in our state some rules that permit adoptions within our system, but I don’t think gay adoption is appropriate," said Crist, who would go on to win the race. "I believe that the traditional family is the best means by which to raise children." Some state lawmakers pushed to drop the ban in 2007 but Crist continued to express support for it. In 2008, foster parent Frank Martin Gill of North Miami, filed a lawsuit seeking to overturn the ban. When asked about the ban, Crist reiterated his support for it. "No second thoughts," he said, in an October 2008 Miami Herald article. In November 2008, a Miami-Dade judge struck down the ban and declared it unconstitutional. The state continued to fight for the ban in court, and Crist reiterated his stance to the Palm Beach Post editorial board in February 2010. "My belief is the best way to raise a family is in the traditional family," Crist said. "That’s how I feel. That’s what the current law is in Florida. I respect the law." But within months, his stance would change. 2010 Senate race As Crist was lagging behind in the Republican Senate primary against Marco Rubio, he left the GOP to run as an independent in April 2010. Crist needed independent and liberal voters to stand a chance. Crist told Time magazine in June 2010 that he would be open to changing Florida's law to allow a judge to determine what's best for the child. "That might be a way to go, and it's certainly something we ought to look at," he said. "A better way and approach would be to let judges make that decision on a case-by-case basis," he told the Florida press association in June 2010. On Sept. 12, 2010, Crist released a position paper on gay rights including adoption: "We need to take politics out of adoption decisions. That is why I oppose Florida's current law that requires Family Law judges to ignore what is right for a child in order to adhere to what Florida law blindly demands. There is only one question that matters: What is in the best interest of that child?" On Sept. 22, an appeals court struck down the ban, and Crist announced that Florida would no longer enforce the policy that had been in place since 1977. He called the ruling "a very good day for Florida" and "a great day for children." (That ruling is still in effect today.) "Children deserve a loving home to be in, and the opportunity for judges to make this call on a case-by-case basis for every adoption," Crist said. In a Senate debate in October, Crist was asked to explain his reversal on gay adoption. "As we get older, I call it the convergence of life experience and wisdom. When you learn through the time of life more tolerance and become less judgmental, I think that's a good place to be," Crist said. We sent a summary of our finding to Crist and former Sen. Steve Geller, a Broward Democrat who is informally advising Crist. Geller noted that "many people’s views on issues involving gays were evolving during this time. President Obama, Bill Clinton, most voters, and others evolved. Those who did so earlier versus those who have stayed opposed need some credit." Our ruling During his 2006 Republican race for governor, Crist repeatedly supported the state’s ban on gay parents adopting and argued in favor of the "traditional family" adopting. By June 2010, Crist had ditched the GOP and was running as an independent -- and made statements in support of Floridians adopting. He became vocal about his support in September in a position paper on gay rights. There's no dispute here: Full Flop.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2014-02-20T11:53:34	2014-02-10	['None']
pomt-08197	The health care reform law "reduces the deficit by nearly $1.2 trillion over the next two decades."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2010/nov/23/bobby-scott/bobby-scott-says-health-care-reform-may-cut-defici/	In his quest to see all Bush-era tax cuts expire, Rep. Robert C. "Bobby" Scott criticizes Republicans for avoiding "tough" budgetary choices. In a recent press release in support of allowing the tax cuts to expire, Scott, D-3rd, lambastes Republican legislators and President George W. Bush for enacting them without offering ways to cover the costs. "Democrats can and have made these tough choices – most recently with the enactment of Health Care Reform, which provides the largest benefit to the middle class since the enactment of Social Security and at the same time reduces the deficit by nearly $1.2 trillion over the next two decades," Scott says. Amid all the debate over health care reform, we wondered whether the new law really would slice the deficit by $1.2 trillion. Scott, like President Obama in a similar claim check by PolitFact National, uses numbers from the Congressional Budget Office. According to the CBO, the health care act is indeed expected to trim the deficit because tax increases and cost savings in the reforms are expected to outweigh the costs of its new programs and tax credits. The projection for the first 10 years is solid. The CBO analysis says the health care act "would produce a net reduction in federal deficits of $138 billion over the 2010-2019 period as result of changes in direct spending and revenue." But the projection for the next decade is far more speculative. The CBO typically only calculates the impact of legislation's cost over 10 years. But it will create calculations for a longer period if Congress requests it, which many members did for health care reform. Here's what the CBO said about computing health reform's effect on the deficit between 2020 and 2030: "A detailed year-by-year projection for years beyond 2019, like those that CBO prepares for the 10-year budget window, would not be meaningful because the uncertainties involved are simply too great. Among other factors, a wide range of changes could occur — in people’s health, in the sources and extent of their insurance coverage, and in the delivery of medical care (such as advances in medical research, technological developments, and changes in physicians’ practice patterns) — that are likely to be significant but are very difficult to predict, both under current law and under any proposal." But the CBO was willing to estimate that in the second 10 years, the health care legislation would reduce deficits "in a broad range around one-half percent of GDP." The GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is the amount of goods and services produced within the borders of a nation during a year. The CBO estimates the United States’ GDP will slightly exceed $22.5 trillion by 2020, up 4 percent from the year before. To arrive at the $1.2 trillion figure, Scott is assuming that the GDP will continue to rise at that rate. And if it does, he’ll be right, if not conservative, in his claim. Based on a 4 percent GDP increase each year with the deficit being reduced by half a percent, the deficit would actually be reduced to $1.4 trillion by 2030.e to the $1.2 trillion. The GDP has risen by more than 4 percent all but five times over the last 50 years. Four of those occurrences have been in the last decade, including 2008 and 2009. Last year was the only time the GDP shrank in during the last five decades, falling 7.9 percent from 2008. But looking at 20-year projections and using numbers that even the CBO says are dicey seems like shaky ground. Is Scott making a safe extrapolation or a leap of faith? "I don't think $1.2 trillion is an overstatement," said Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. He said translating percentages of GDP into dollars is the only way to convey it to the public. "It's perfectly reasonable to put that into terms people can understand," Horney said. Even so, CBO director Douglas W. Elmendorf noted that the projection is based on "assuming that all of its provisions would continue to be fully implemented." That's a big assumption. For example, on Dec. 10, 2009, the chief actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Servicesissued a reportconcluding that the plan to reduce payment updates to health care providers through Medicare "are unlikely to be sustainable on an annual basis" and that further reductions in Medicare growth rates through the Independent Medicare Advisory Board "may be difficult to achieve in practice." Robert Book, a health economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said a deficit reduction number extrapolated from a forecast of the GDP is dubious. "GDP estimates are extremely uncertain," Book said. "Ten years ago, who would have predicted we'd have a recession last year? Nobody could possibly have known that." And besides, he said, if the plan reduces deficits "it just means it raises taxes a lot." "So the number is probably not right, and even if it were, it's meaningless," Book said. So, let’s review: Scott says health care reform would reduce the deficit by nearly $1.2 trillion over the next two decades. While it’s true that the CBO report he relies on says the health care bill -- with the proposed reconciliation -- would continue to improve the deficit situation in the second 10 years, it does not arrive at a $1.2 trillion figure. To do that, Scott relies on speculative GDP projections to predict a number that that CBO itself says would "not be meaningful because the uncertainties involved are simply too great." So we rate the claim Half True.	None	Bobby Scott	None	None	None	2010-11-23T16:03:05	2010-11-16	['None']
pomt-09862	Page 992 of the health care bill will "establish school-based 'health' clinics. Your children will be indoctrinated and your grandchildren may be aborted!"	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/07/liberty-counsel/school-health-clinics-would-not-provide-abortions/	Critics of the Democratic health care proposal have been increasingly raising concerns that the plan would provide taxpayer-subsidized abortions (a claim we address here ). The Liberty Counsel, a conservative group, puts a different twist on that concern, alleging that Page 992 of the bill "will establish school-based 'health' clinics. Your children will be indoctrinated and your grandchildren may be aborted!" The claim comes from a long list of items allegedly in the bill that is posted on the group's Web site and has been widely circulated in a chain e-mail. The list looks a lot like one that we checked in July, based partly on blog postings by Peter Fleckenstein on his blog Common Sense from a Common Man . In fact, the Liberty Counsel says it adapted its memo from Fleckenstein's original work. The group describes its mission as an "education and policy organization dedicated to advancing religious freedom, the sanctity of human life and the traditional family" and is affiliated with Liberty University School of Law in Lynchburg, Va. The group said it was so troubled by Fleckenstein's analysis that it "doubted its accuracy, so the staff in our D.C. office compared it to the voluminous bill. What they found astonished us so much that we had to share it with you today. You can read our updated and revised overview of HR 3200 and you will be alarmed, too." It appears to us that Liberty Counsel elaborated on Fleckenstein's original take on the clinics. He wrote, "PG 993 Govt will establish school based health clinics. Ur kids wont have a chance." School-based health clinics are different from the traditional nurse's offices that schools have long had. Typically, the clinics are staffed with nurse practitioners, doctors and social workers who do everything from administer immunizations to provide nutrition advice. They can also provide counseling. Federal and state governments have long provided funding to support these clinics, which tend to crop up in areas where students have limited access to other health care services. "These clinics have been around for 30 years," said Divya Mohan Little, communications director for the National Assembly on School-Based Health Care. "They've been getting a lot of attention recently in a time of recession because fewer kids are being covered and aren't able to see doctors." Of the 2,000 clinics nationwide, none provide abortions and the bill would not change that, said Mohan Little. There are three major versions of the bill floating around the House — one in the Energy and Commerce Committee, one in the Ways and Means Committee and one in the Education and Labor Committee — and we checked all three just to make sure. All three bills have identical language when it comes to the school clinics. Basically, the bill would provide grants so the clinics can continue providing "comprehensive health assessments, diagnosis, and treatment of minor, acute, and chronic medical conditions and referrals to, and follow-up for, specialty care." The money could also be used to provide "mental health assessments, crisis interventions, counseling, treatment and referral to a continuum of services including emergency psychiatric care, community support programs, inpatient care and outpatient care." The clinics would have the option to provide, "oral health, social and age-appropriate health education services including nutritional counseling." Clinics getting federal dollars must act in accordance with federal, state and local law, according to the bills. For example, clinics in Louisiana are not even allowed to counsel students on abortion, according to the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals. And here's the important part: the bills now before the House say nothing about the school clinics being able to offer abortions. Perplexed, we called the Liberty Counsel to see how they could make the connection from innocuous langauge about clinics that have been around for 30 years to the claim that "children will be indoctrinated and your grandchildren may be aborted!" We spoke with Sarah Speller at the Liberty Counsel, who told us that the group had been getting a lot of calls about the memo and that everyone there was very busy as a result. However, she assured us that "as far as our office can tell, everything in the overview is accurate. That's about all I can tell you," she said. "I'm just relaying what I've been told to say." That's not persuasive. We see no language in the three main versions of the bill that would allow school-based clinics, which have a long history of providing basic health services to underprivileged students, to provide abortions. Nor would the clinics even be new — they have been around for three decades. So we rate the claim Pants on Fire!	None	Liberty Counsel	None	None	None	2009-08-07T18:20:35	2009-07-29	['None']

pomt-02431	"Georgia’s civil forfeiture laws are among the worst in the country and the very worst in the South."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/mar/03/americans-prosperity-georgia-chapter/georgias-forfeiture-laws-viewed-harshly/	There aren’t many issues that can bring the American Civil Liberties Union and the tea party together, but there is one matter that has them and others on the same side. A coalition of organizations -- they call themselves Georgians for Forfeiture Reform -- recently held a news conference at the Georgia Capitol to plead for changes to the state’s civil forfeiture laws. How bad are the laws? "Georgia’s civil forfeiture laws are among the worst in the country and the very worst in the South," Americans for Prosperity Georgia spokesman Joel Aaron Foster said in a press release beforehand. Lee McGrath, legislative counsel for the Institute for Justice, a Virginia-based organization that has taken a close look at the issue, repeated the talking point at the news conference. PolitiFact Georgia wondered if this claim is correct, or is this another example of some groups exaggerating the significance of a problem? Critics say some law enforcement officers unfairly keep money seized from motorists who are investigated for drug trafficking and other offenses and eventually cleared. One man spent $12,000 in legal fees to recover $43,000 police took from him when he was pulled over in South Georgia, the institute noted. The coalition wants the Georgia Legislature to pass House Bill 1, which would put law enforcement and prosecutors under greater scrutiny over how they use cash and property seized in criminal investigations. Supporters want Georgia’s forfeiture laws to be patterned after the rules in North Carolina, in which a jury can consider seizing property only after a conviction, and only if it was used for a crime. The legislation, sponsored by House Judiciary Committee Chairman Wendell Willard, R-Sandy Springs, received committee approval in early February. Its co-sponsors include House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, D-Atlanta. The bill has yet to come up for a vote in the House of Representatives. Some law enforcement leaders, such as Gwinnett County District Attorney Danny Porter, support the legislation after initial reluctance to do so. Others, such as the Georgia Sheriffs’ Association, think Georgia laws are fine and have said no changes are necessary. To be clear, PolitiFact Georgia is not making a judgment call on whether Georgia has the worst forfeiture laws around. Instead, our goal is to see whether the claim is based on valid reports and research about Georgia’s forfeiture laws. Lawmakers worked out what they hope is a compromise to get the bill passed shortly after The Atlanta Journal-Constitution published several reports last year that called into question how forfeiture funds are used. The newspaper found Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard spent thousands of dollars of forfeited funds on galas, sports tickets, staff parties and elaborate home security. Last year, Douglas County District Attorney David McDade was accused of using his forfeiture account to give side jobs and government cars to favored employees. Current state law requires agencies to file reports on their forfeiture activity with a state-run website each year, but the AJC found that few complied and that those who did gave little information. The new proposal would standardize the process and require more disclosure. The Institute for Justice released a report last year on forfeiture laws and found similar issues concerning the state’s disclosure process. A random sample of 20 law enforcement agencies found only two were providing annual reports, the institute found. Other agencies were submitting reports omitting key details. "Reports from police departments in Atlanta, Dunwoody, Marietta and LaGrange, for example, provide only dollar amounts but no descriptions of the properties taken," the institute wrote in its study. The study did not contain responses from those departments to the concerns outlined in the report. Dunwoody police Chief Billy Grogan said the department complied with all reporting requirements. Georgia’s grade on the quality of its forfeiture laws put it on the dishonor roll. D-. Thank God for Michigan, Texas, Virginia and West Virginia. They received the same grade, the lowest in the nation. Another study by a three-person team of researchers on state forfeiture laws showed some of what critics such as the Institute for Justice say is troubling about Georgia’s forfeiture laws. For example, Georgia puts property owners in the position of providing the burden of proof to reclaim their property. The study, though, does not rank which states have the best or the worst laws. So where does this leave us? To sum up, Georgians for Forfeiture Reform argues the Peach State has some of the worst civil forfeiture laws in the nation and the worst in the South. The claim is based on a recent report by one of the groups lobbying for legislation they believe will be more equitable to Georgians. It does rank Georgia at the bottom nationally, with a few other states. Another report highlights what critics say are some of Georgia’s flaws. Unfortunately, there’s little independent research on how states fare on the topic. The claim is also based on an interpretation of those laws. With these caveats, we rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-01952	"The number of terrorists out there" has doubled.	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/22/dick-cheney/dick-cheney-number-terrorists-has-doubled/	Former Vice President Dick Cheney continued to criticize President Barack Obama over foreign policy during an appearance on ABC’s This Week. While the focus is currently on Iraq and the growing prominence of ISIS, Cheney said Obama’s miscues are broader and potentially dangerous. One statistic that he said supported his point: The sharp rise in the number of terrorists operating worldwide. "We’ve got a much bigger problem than just the current crisis in Iraq," Cheney said. "The Rand Corporation was out in the last week with a report that showed that there’s been a 58 percent increase in the number of groups like al-Qaida, Salafi-jihadists, and it stretches from West Africa, all across North Africa, East Africa, through the Middle East, all the way around to Indonesia -- a doubling of the number of terrorists out there." In other words, he said we’ve got "a hell of a problem." PunditFact wanted to look into Cheney’s point about the stark rise in the number of terrorists in groups like al-Qaida in recent years. His claim is nearly verbatim the findings of a report released June 2014 and prepared for the Secretary of Defense by the Rand Corporation, a nonpartisan think tank whose work is cited by Democrats and Republicans. The report focused on Salafi-jihadist groups, which are a specific category of militant Sunni Islamists marked by their emphasis on reclaiming a "pure" Islam and the belief that violent jihad is required as part of religious duty. The report focused on these groups because most deem the United States an enemy and are willing to kill civilians on a large scale. The findings in the report are based on publicly available documents, such as internal memos, statements and other writings obtained from al-Qaida and other leaders by counterterrorism groups and news organizations like the Associated Press. Members of al-Qaida are an example of Salafi-jihadists, but not all jihadists are considered as part of al-Qaida or as formal members of its affiliates. The group taking over cities in Iraq, ISIS, is no longer part of al-Qaida after leader Ayman al-Zawahiri dismissed them in January 2014. Other groups in Africa, Asia, the Middle East and the Caucuses may occasionally work with or are allied with al-Qaida but are not members, such as Boko Haram in Nigeria, which gained worldwide infamy for kidnapping about 250 Nigerian schoolgirls. Still, others operate as lone wolves inspired by the movement, such as Maj. Nidal Malik Hasan, who shot and killed 13 people in an attack at Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009, and the Tsaernev brothers who executed the 2013 Boston Marathon bombings. The report did not include other groups trying to build an Islamic state and presenting a threat to the United States and its interests, such as the Muslim Brotherhood, Taliban and Hezbollah, whose religious views are sometimes contradictory to Salafi-jihadists. All that said, the number of Salafi-jihadist groups (al-Qaida, its affiliates, other violent Islamists) jumped 58 percent, as Cheney said, from 31 groups in 2010 to 49 in 2013. The growth primarily happened in North Africa and countries along the Mediterranean Sea, known as the Levant, which includes Syria, Iraq, Jordan, Palestine, Cyprus, Lebanon and Israel. Figuring out how many jihadist fighters that amounts to is tricky, as the groups don’t report their membership and their numbers can fluctuate. Still, the report says the population of fighters more than doubled between 2010 and 2013 looking at estimates both low (under 20,000 fighters to more than 40,000) and high (about 50,000 to more than 100,000). So, while the number of groups has increased 58 percent, the number of fighters in those groups has doubled, the report states. Here's a chart that shows the estimated increase: \ (Source: Rand Corp.) The biggest increase was in Syria amid the rebellion to the regime of Bashar al-Assad. Further, Libya is "perhaps the most active Salafi-jihadist sanctuary in North Africa" as a result of groups forming after the killing of its longtime leader, Muammar Qaddafi, wrote Seth Jones, the author of the report and director of Rand’s International Security and Defense Policy Center. Membership has flourished partially because of weak governments in the Middle East and Africa, which not surprisingly has led to more attacks in recent years. Most, though, have been directed locally and not toward the U.S., its embassies or allies. There were roughly 400 attacks carried by al-Qaida and its affiliates in 2010, which rose to more than 900 in 2013, according to Rand. The report classifies the groups among three threat levels to the United States. Those presenting a high threat, meaning they are working on plots that target the United States and its embassies and citizens abroad, include core al-Qaida, al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and "inspired" individuals we mentioned earlier. Groups with a "medium" threat, or plotting against overseas targets, are al-Shabaab (the Somali group behind the mall attack in Nairobi, Kenya) and Ansar al-Sharia Libya. The big question, of course, is what to do to address it. Jones’ report urged U.S. military leaders to be more aggressive in targeting Salafi-jihadist groups in Syria, home to more than half of the jihadists in the world. The problem is the Assad government is not an ally. He also warns that a complete exit from Afghanistan could backfire by creating ‘breathing space" for al-Qaida and other groups to regroup and spread. "The American departure from Afghanistan will most likely be a boost for insurgent and terrorist groups dedicated to overthrowing the Kabul government, establishing an extreme Islamic emirate, and allowing al Qaeda and other groups to establish a sanctuary," Jones wrote for the Wall Street Journal. "As in Iraq, the withdrawal of U.S. troops does not make the terrorism problem go away." Our ruling Cheney referenced a Rand Corp. report that showed "a doubling of the number of terrorists out there." The report he mentions does not look at all terrorism -- just a branch that has the United States and its interests in its crosshairs and is on the rise. We think it’s clear from his comment that he was referencing the report’s finding that members of Salafi-jihadist groups -- who engage in violent jihad activities -- have doubled. That’s true from 2010 to 2013 based on Rand’s low- and high-end estimates. We rate his statement True. Update (10:45 a.m. June 24): We've updated this item to make more clear that Cheney was talking about the total number of terrorists, not the number of terrorist groups. Our rating remains True.

pomt-15088	The Iran deal "trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves."	false	/texas/statements/2015/sep/18/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-iran-deal-trusts-iranians-inspect-th/	With a dash of imagined dialogue, Ted Cruz of Texas made his case for the United States not to support the agreement backed by most Democrats, including President Barack Obama, that would allow Iran to develop nuclear energy but not nuclear weapons and bring an end to longstanding economic sanctions. The Republican senator and presidential candidate told the Greater Houston Partnership on Sept. 1, 2015, that the Iran deal doesn’t lead to independent inspectors marching in. "This deal," Cruz said, "doesn’t send in American inspectors; this deal doesn’t send international inspectors. This deal trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves. Let me repeat that: This deal trusts the Iranians to inspect themself." Cruz said as much again at the Sept. 16, 2015, GOP presidential debate in California. "And most astonishingly," Cruz said, "this agreement trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves. That makes no sense whatsoever." In Houston, Cruz likened the self-inspection element to a scene from "Scarface," the 1980 movie starring Al Pacino as Tony Montana, a Cuban immigrant intent on taking over a drug cartel. "This is the equivalent," Cruz said, "of law enforcement picking up the phone and calling Tony Montana and saying, ‘Hey Tony, you got any drugs?’ "‘I don’t got no drugs.’ "‘Thank you, Tony.’ "That," Cruz said, "is essentially the Iranian nuclear inspection regime." Setting aside Cruz’s cinematic vignette, is he right the Iran deal, which the Senate fell short of rejecting in a Sept. 10, 2015, vote, trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves? Cruz’s office told us he concluded as much based on reporting by the Associated Press on a confidential "side agreement" about how an international agency will check conditions at a longtime Iranian military-industrial site. Spokesman Phil Novack also said by email that Cruz "has participated in multiple intelligence briefings -- both classified and unclassified -- about this Iranian deal. Without revealing the details of those briefings, they are entirely consistent with the public reports that the so-called inspections regime simply entrusts Iran with inspecting itself." We’ll get to more of Cruz’s backup. Longstanding safeguards First it’s worth noting international inspections of Iranian facilities date back decades. By phone, Jeffrey Lewis, publisher of armscontrolwonk.com, which presents blogs on arms control, disarmament and non-proliferation, told us that like many nations, Iran has previously committed to "safeguards" agreements reached with the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nations entity entrusted with monitoring nuclear non-proliferation commitments. The agreements confirm the IAEA’s power to check on the possible development of nuclear weapons. A 1974 agreement, for instance, gives the agency authority to monitor "all source or special fissionable material in all peaceful nuclear activities within the territory of Iran, under its jurisdiction or carried out under its control anywhere, for the exclusive purpose of verifying that such material is not diverted to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices." Separate from that, Lewis said, the UN agency maintains confidential agreements with the many nations it monitors, including, he said, details on where cameras might be placed inside specific facilities. Typically, the IAEA says, its negotiated safeguards exist to "to deter the spread of nuclear weapons by early detection of misuse of nuclear material or technology, thereby providing credible assurances that states are honoring their legal obligations. The IAEA plays a crucial independent verification role," it says, "aimed at assuring the international community that nuclear material, facilities and other items subject to safeguards are used only for peaceful purposes. A 24-page agency safeguards booklet, dated June 2015, notes the agency won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2005. The booklet calls the safeguards a "set of technical measures that allow the IAEA to independently verify a state’s legal commitment not to divert nuclear material from peaceful nuclear activities to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices." Some 182 countries have safeguards agreements, the booklet says. "Nuclear material subject to safeguards includes special fissionable material from which nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices could readily be made (e.g. plutonium-239; uranium-233; uranium enriched in the isotopes 235 or 233) and source material (e.g. natural uranium, depleted uranium or thorium), which cannot be directly used for nuclear weapons," the booklet says. But there’s room for suspicion. We noticed a passage suggesting the agency earlier caught Iran not complying with its oversight--and that was addressed: In 2002, information came to light regarding previously undeclared nuclear material and activities that the Islamic Republic of Iran (Iran) should have declared but had not declared to the IAEA. At time of writing, while the IAEA continues to verify the non-diversion of declared nuclear material at the nuclear facilities and LOFs declared by Iran under its Safeguards Agreement, the IAEA is not in a position to provide credible assurance about the absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities in Iran, and therefore to conclude that all nuclear material in Iran is in peaceful activities. In November 2013, the IAEA and Iran agreed on a Framework for Cooperation, within which verification activities are being implemented by the IAEA to resolve all present and past issues. The 2015 agreement The July 14, 2015, agreement, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, was negotiated with Iran by world powers including the United States and Russia. And far as we can tell, it’s silent about Iran getting to inspect its own facilities. Per the agreement, the IAEA will have Iran’s permission for 15 years to "implement continuous monitoring, including through containment and surveillance measures, as necessary, to verify that stored centrifuges and infrastructure remain in storage, and are only used to replace failed or damaged centrifuges." A section in the nearly 160-page deal on modern technologies and the IAEA’s long-term presence states Iran will permit the agency to use equipment that relays changes in nuclear enrichment to IAEA inspectors plus other technologies. Also, the agreement says, Iran will facilitate automated collections of measurements from nuclear sites. That section goes on: Iran will make the necessary arrangements to allow for a long-term IAEA presence, including issuing long-term visas, as well as providing proper working space at nuclear sites and, with best efforts, at locations near nuclear sites in Iran for the designated IAEA inspectors for working and keeping necessary equipment. Iran will increase the number of designated IAEA inspectors to the range of 130-150 within 9 months from the date of the implementation of the JCPOA, and will generally allow the designation of inspectors from nations that have diplomatic relations with Iran, consistent with its laws and regulations. Cruz cites a news story In an email to Novack, Cruz's spokesman, we noted the inspection mentions in the agreement. Novack replied by pointing out other language in the agreement that he said shows Iran will be providing information to the IAEA to create a baseline for future action. "This does not mean the information Iran initially reports is complete. In these circumstances, we are trusting Iran to give us necessary information," Novack said. Novack singled out references in the agreement to Iran providing information enabling the international agency to verify production of "uranium ore concentrate" and to track centrifuge rotor tubes and bellows as well as "heavy water stocks" associated with nuclear power. The sections also provide for the IAEA to verify and continuously monitor such items. The spokesman earlier said that Cruz reached his conclusion about the deal trusting Iran to inspect itself from an August 2015 AP news story indicating the IAEA agreed to let Iran inspect Parchin, a military-industrial site in the country that critics once accused Iran of using to develop nuclear weapons. The AP’s Vienna-datelined Aug. 20, 2015, news story said its reporter had obtained "one of the side arrangements between the IAEA and Iran in regards to inspecting Parchin" in Iran. The story presented what the AP described as the transcript of the original draft agreement between the IAEA and Iran "covering inspections at the Parchin military site, where Iran has been accused of pursuing nuclear weapons development a decade ago." The story also noted the Parchin agreement was "separate from the much broader Iran nuclear deal signed by Iran, the U.S. and five other world powers in July" 2015. Below is most of the transcript of the draft document which the AP says that two officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed as not differing from the final agreement between the IAEA and Iran: Separate arrangement II agreed by the Islamic State of Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency on 11 July 2015, regarding the Road-map, Paragraph 5 1. Iran will provide to the Agency photos of the locations, including those identified in paragraph 3 below, which would be mutually agreed between Iran and the Agency, taking into account military concerns. 2. Iran will provide to the Agency videos of the locations, including those identified in paragraph 3 below, which would be mutually agreed between Iran and the Agency, taking into account military concerns. 3. Iran will provide to the Agency 7 environmental samples taken from points inside one building already identified by the Agency and agreed by Iran, and 2 points outside of the Parchin complex which would be agreed between Iran and the Agency. 4. The Agency will ensure the technical authenticity of the activities referred to in paragraphs 1-3 above. Activities will be carried out using Iran's authenticated equipment, consistent with technical specifications provided by the Agency, and the Agency's containers and seals. A day earlier, an AP news story said the Parchin agreement allowed Iran to use its own inspectors on the site rather than leaving that to the IAEA, which "normally carries out such work." That story said the Parchin agreement was worked out between the IAEA and Iran, with the U.S. and the other world powers involved in the larger Iran deal not being party to it, though the nations were briefed, the story said, and they "endorsed it as part of the larger package." The Parchin agreement, the AP story said, "diverges from normal procedures by allowing Tehran to employ its own experts and equipment in the search for evidence of activities it has consistently denied — trying to develop nuclear weapons. Olli Heinonen, who was in charge of the Iran probe as deputy IAEA director general from 2005 to 2010, said he could think of no similar concession with any other country." IAEA says ‘safeguards standards’ not compromised We emailed the IAEA about Cruz’s claim and didn’t hear back. But after the AP story broke, the agency’s director general, Yukiya Amano, issued a statement saying he couldn’t release separate agreements with countries without violating confidentiality. Suggestions the agency had given responsibility for nuclear inspections to Iran, Amano added, "misrepresent the way in which we will undertake this important verification work." Amano also said the side arrangements "are technically sound and consistent with our long-established practices. They do not compromise our safeguards standards in any way." Other analyses In August 2015, Heinonen, a Harvard University researcher who spent more than 25 years with the IAEA, wrote an oped article about the described Parchin side deal stating that if "the reporting is accurate, these" inspection "procedures appear to be risky, departing significantly from well-established and proven safeguards practices. At a broader level, if verification standards have been diluted for Parchin (or elsewhere) and limits imposed, the ramification is significant as it will affect the IAEA’s ability to draw definitive conclusions with the requisite level of assurances and without undue hampering of the verification process." Heinonen called for the described document to be made public by the IAEA and Iran, with U.S. support, accompanied by explanations responding to concerns about the Parchin process. To our inquiry, Heinonen pointed by email another confidential side agreement as noted by the IAEA in its "road-map" to clarify outstanding issues regarding Iran’s nuclear program. That July 14, 2015, document says the IAEA and Iran agreed on a "separate arrangement" premised on Iran this year answering agency questions per "possible ambiguities" leading up to the general agreement taking effect. Heinonen told us observers need to be able to see relevant side agreements before concluding Iran is being allowed to inspect itself. "To this end, we are missing facts...By having such facts on the table, we can assess the IAEA approach on this issue," Heinonen wrote. To our inquiries, other arms control experts mostly told us the side agreement described by the AP doesn’t show Iran is going to be left to inspect itself. Lewis, referring to the reported Parchin agreement, said: "This is a one-time managed access to a single facility by the IAEA. It is not the procedure for any other inspection. It is specially designed to answer questions relating to work carried out at this site between 1996-2002." Similarly, Justin Logan, director of foreign policy studies at the libertarian-oriented Cato Institute, told us by email it’s worth keeping in mind it takes ample "fissile material" to make a nuclear weapon and "large infrastructure." At Iran’s known facilities where uranium enrichment is taking or has taken place, Logan said, IAEA inspectors will be present and have daily access. By phone, Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, which has encouraged Congress to support the agreement, called Cruz’s claim an "absolutely incorrect" mischaracterization. Kimball said that even at the Parchin site, he believes the IAEA will provide information "about where they want to sample at the site, which areas they want to soil or surface samples to see if there is individual radioactive material in these areas." Then, Kimball said, "the Iranian specialists in the presence of the IAEA inspectors will actually do the scooping, the swiping." After that, Kimball said, whatever is collected will be "put into packages the IAEA will take possession of (and) take to their labs for testing. By email, Kimball also pointed us to an Aug. 21, 2015, opinion article in The Hill, a Washington, D.C., newspaper, headlined: "No, Iran is not allowed to inspect itself." In the piece, Mark Hibbs and Thomas Shea, experts on IAEA safeguards, spell out their expectation that IAEA officials would keep a close watch on Iranian staff gathering samples at Parchin and ensure the samples reached U.N. labs without being tainted. Iran, the two wrote, "will not be allowed to inspect itself." Another association official, Kelsey Davenport, followed up with an email noting that NBC News, citing unidentified senior U.S. officials, said in an Aug. 19, 2015, news story that Iran would be allowed to inspect Parchin itself only regarding signs of past military activity and still, U.N. inspectors "would be on site to supervise the Iranians at every step of the way," NBC said. Davenport also pointed out an Aug. 20, 2015, post on the Arms Control Association’s website by Tariq Rauf, director of the Disarmament, Arms Control and Non-Proliferation Programme at the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. In the post, Rauf asserted that even if Iranians were permitted to collect samples at Parchin, IAEA officials would be present to ensure no monkey business. Rauf went on: "It would be unusual but by no means technically compromising to have Iranian technicians collect swipe samples at sites and locations at Parchin in the physical presence and direct line of sight of IAEA inspectors, including filming, and using swipe kits and collection bags provided by the IAEA. The agency inspectors then would seal the bags containing the swipe samples; they could leave behind one sealed bag at the IAEA office in Iran as a ‘control’ to be used if there is a dispute later about the results. The other three or four bags of swipe samples would be taken by the IAEA" to UN laboratories for testing. We also reached Fred Fleitz, author of a July 2015 National Review article stating Iranians would be permitted to collect samples for the IAEA at Parchin. Fleitz, a senior official with the conservative Center for Security Policy, which focuses on national security in the belief that national power must be preserved and properly used, said by phone that Cruz‘s Houston claim implied "the Iranians are going to do all the inspections. That's inaccurate. Iranians will be doing some inspections," he said, including at Parchin. Fleitz later said by email that Cruz proved "exactly right" in a Sept. 15, 2015 National Review commentary by saying "in certain circumstances, Iran will inspect itself." In his Houston stump speech, he speculated, Cruz left out such caveats. Our ruling Cruz said the Iran deal "trusts the Iranians to inspect themselves." A confidential side deal might allow Iranian staff to take photos and video and collect samples at the Parchin site yet the IAEA has generally insisted its protective protocols aren't being compromised. The Parchin uncertainty aside, Cruz didn’t offer nor did we find evidence the overall agreement trusts Iranians to inspect themselves. In contrast, his statement left the impression Iran would be conducting all inspections under the agreement by itself. That’s not so. We rate the claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-05962	"Right now, American oil production is the highest that it’s been in eight years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-oil-production-eight-year-hig/	In his State of the Union address on Jan. 24, 2012, President Barack Obama talked up U.S. oil production. "Nowhere is the promise of innovation greater than in American-made energy," Obama said. "Over the last three years, we’ve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration, and tonight, I’m directing my administration to open more than 75 percent of our potential offshore oil and gas resources. Right now, American oil production is the highest that it’s been in eight years. That’s right – eight years. Not only that – last year, we relied less on foreign oil than in any of the past sixteen years." This passage includes a number of claims, but here we’ll focus on the one that "right now, American oil production is the highest that it’s been in eight years." We looked at a similar claim on March 15, 2011, and rated it Mostly True. But we will update our assessment based on new data. We turned to the Energy Information Administration, the federal government’s official office for energy statistics. Since Obama said "oil production," we will only look at crude oil extracted from U.S. territory, rather than natural gas or other petroleum products. Here are the annual totals, in barrels produced, going back to 2003: 2003: 2,073,453,000 2004: 1,983,302,000 2005: 1,890,106,000 2006: 1,862,259,000 2007: 1,848,450,000 2008: 1,811,817,000 2009: 1,956,596,000 2010: 1,998,137,000 The full-year data is available only through 2010, but 10 months of data from 2011 have been made public. Through the end of October 2011, production totaled 1,713,038,000 barrels. If that pace continues, the year-end total should be around 2,055,646,000 barrels -- higher than any year since 2003. That’s eight years ago, just as Obama said. The last time we looked at this question in March 2011, we noted that production levels actually have been quite stable over the period in question. The estimated level for 2011 is only about 13 percent higher than for the lowest year in that eight-year period. So the increase the president is referring to is not particularly dramatic. In addition, levels of production were typically higher from the 1950s to the 1990s. However, one caveat we mentioned in our last analysis -- that the Energy Information Administration projected that production totals were poised to fall over the subsequent two years -- no longer appears to be accurate. The most recent "Short-Term Energy Outlook," published on Jan. 12, 2012, forecast increases in total crude oil production in 2012 and 2013, thanks to increases in onshore production in the Lower 48, which overshadow declines in production in Alaska and the Gulf of Mexico. The last issue is whether Obama and his administration claimed credit for this achievement and whether they deserve it. The government does play a role in shaping oil production, but many other factors, including private-sector business imperatives and the domestic and international energy market, are factors as well. We think Obama’s phrasing suggests that he thinks the administration’s policies have played a role, saying, for instance, that "over the last three years, we’ve opened millions of new acres for oil and gas exploration." But we also think he does so cautiously. Our ruling Obama was correct when he said that "right now, American oil production is the highest that it’s been in eight years." We think he may have overstated his administration’s role in achieving that, but not wildly so. We rate the claim Mostly True.

"And let’s see, 60 percent of Americans now support legalizing marijuana," Johnson said on the Sept. 4, 2016 edition of the "Upfront with Mike Gousha" public affairs show on WISN (Channel 12). Only a month earlier, the former Republican governor of New Mexico had made a less aggressive claim, saying "most" Americans supported legalization. PolitiFact National’s rating was True, as multiple polls generally showed support in the low 50s. It seems unlikely that in a few short weeks it would jump to 60 percent. But let’s take a look. Previous factcheck When Johnson made his earlier claim, our colleagues found that in 12 of 14 national polls taken since the start of 2014, 50 percent or more of Americans supported legalization. The information, covering a period of more than 2.5 years, was taken from the PollingReport.com database As for the other two polls, legalization led in one by 48 percent to 47 percent and in the other by 49 percent to 48 percent. In the three latest polls in the database, the numbers crept closer to 60 percent, with support at 54 percent, 56 percent and 58 percent. But averaging the 14 polls, legalization led 53 percent to 44 percent. Another poll Johnson’s campaign, however, pointed us to another relatively recent poll that wasn’t included in the database. The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll, conducted in February 2016, found that 61 percent of Americans said the use of marijuana should be made legal. (Interestingly, 53 percent said marijuana use in their communities was a moderately serious, very serious or extremely serious problem, compared to 45 percent who said it was not at all serious or not too serious.) Reporting on the poll, the Washington Post’s Wonkblog said the 61 percent support, a notch above Johnson’s claim, was an all-time high. A parting note, though it doesn’t bear on our rating of Johnson’s claim about national numbers: In a July 2016 poll of registered voters in Wisconsin, the Marquette Law School Poll asked: When it comes to marijuana, some people think that the drug should be fully legalized and regulated like alcohol. Do you agree or disagree with that view? The results: 59 percent agreed, 39 percent disagreed. Our rating Johnson said: "Sixty percent of Americans now support legalizing marijuana." A March 2016 poll found 61 percent support, but that is the only recent survey we could find showing support that high. Fourteen other polls going back more than two years show a majority of Americans back legalization, but generally support was in the low 50s.

pomt-10414	It doesn't make sense "historically" to drop out because the 1968 race was still competitive when "Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/26/hillary-clinton/campaign-in-68-didnt-start-until-march/	Sen. Hillary Clinton has dismissed arguments that she should drop out of the race for the Democratic Party nomination, saying past races were competitive into the summer. "My husband did not wrap up the nomination in 1992 until he won the California primary somewhere in the middle of June, right? We all remember Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in June in California. I don't understand it," Clinton told the editorial board of the Argus Leader, a South Dakota newspaper, on May 23, 2008. "Historically, that makes no sense," she said of the idea that she should drop out. The remarks caused controversy because some people interpreted them to mean she was suggesting she should stay in the race because Sen. Barack Obama might be assassinated. In the context of the full exchange, however, Clinton is making an argument she's made previously, that it's too early for her drop out because nomination races in years past have extended into June. We previously examined her claim that the 1992 nomination fight didn't end until June, when her husband, Bill Clinton, won in California. We concluded that Sen. Clinton overlooked some key facts in making that argument, and gave her a Barely True. In this case, she mentions Robert Kennedy's attempt to win the Democratic nomination of 1968. His quest ended tragically when he was assassinated hours after winning the California primary on June 5, 1968. We decided to look into the details of the 1968 campaign to see if Clinton's Kennedy analogy holds up any better than her Clinton analogy. In short, it doesn't. We found that the timetable for the 1968 race diverges from the current race in several important ways that make her comparison not very accurate. For one thing, the 1968 race started much later than the 2008 race, in terms of both when candidates declared to run and the primary calendar. In 1968, incumbent President Lyndon Johnson was widely expected to seek another term. But dissatisfaction with the Vietnam War prompted talk of a challenger. Kennedy's friends urged him to run, but Sen. Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota entered the race first. McCarthy exceeded expectations dramatically when he took 41.9 percent of the vote in the New Hampshire primary on March 12, 1968, compared with Johnson's 49.6 percent. With Johnson's vulnerability revealed, Kennedy entered the race. Johnson then surprised everyone by withdrawing on March 31. "I do not believe that I should devote an hour or a day of my time to any personal partisan causes or to any duties other than the awesome duties of this office — the presidency of your country," Johnson said in an address to the nation. "Accordingly, I shall not seek, and I will not accept, the nomination of my party for another term as your president." The race between Kennedy and McCarthy was tumultuous. Kennedy seemed to be outpacing McCarthy, but lost to him in Oregon on May 28. The California primary, set for June 4, was widely seen as a crucial turning point. Kennedy won the primary, but was assassinated shortly after midnight on June 5 by Sirhan Sirhan. Ultimately, Johnson's vice president, Hubert Humphrey, secured the nomination at a chaotic convention in Chicago that August, and then lost to Republican Richard Nixon. So, the chronology of the 1968 race has some important distinctions from 2008. The 1968 race didn't start in earnest until the middle of March. One might even argue that it didn't begin until the very end of March, after the sitting president announced that he wouldn't seek re-election. Compare that to this cycle, when the field of candidates was largely settled nearly a year before the first primary vote in January 2008. Clinton and Obama were declared candidates for their party's nomination in early 2007 with no national figure around to cloud the picture. Also, the 1968 New Hampshire primary, the first significant vote of the year, was March 12. In 2008, New Hampshire had its primary on Jan. 8, and Iowa held its crucial election five days before that. If you calculate days between the New Hampshire primary and June 3 of each year, the distance was 81 days in 1968, but 141 days in 2008. So Clinton is right that the 1968 contest was still going on in June of that year, and it was still competitive. But she ignores important facts that make her comparison between that election year and this one inaccurate. We are not evaluating the question of whether Clinton should drop out of the race, but we find her historical argument that there's nothing unusual about a Democratic primary still being contested in June to be technically accurate but completely misleading. We rate this claim, like the last one, Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14243	"The Katy Freeway, or Interstate 10 west of Houston, is the widest freeway in the world, with up to 26 lanes, including frontage road lanes."	false	/texas/statements/2016/apr/13/sylvester-turner/worlds-widest-highway-not-where-sylvester-turner-t/	You don’t have to look hard in Texas to find supersized variations of everything from donuts to state fair mascots to steak-eating challenges. According to Houston Mayor Sylvester Turne,, there’s a category Houstonians alone can claim. Twice in two months, Turner singled out one of Houston’s major highways. At a March 4, 2016, press conference, Turner said: "The Katy Freeway, or Interstate 10 west of Houston, is the widest freeway in the world, with up to 26 lanes including frontage road lanes." Turner went on to hammer that an expansion of I-10 that finished in 2008 still left drivers sitting in traffic during peak drive times, saying cities should consider other methods to control congestion beyond expansion. Houston’s 14 expressways are all big, of course. But is the Katy Freeway really the widest on the planet? For starters, the mayor counting main lanes along with frontage roads to judge width struck us as unusual. To our inquiry, Brad Eaves, principal at the Houston firm TEI, agreed, saying that from a traffic standpoint, he’d consider main lanes of a freeway and the frontage roads separately since each one serves a different function: Main lanes are high-speed, long-trip roadways while frontage roads serve a purpose that’s a little different. While he’s heard this stat before, since he’s "obviously not familiar with every freeway in the world," he could not confirm whether Turner’s claim is true or not. We could have wandered many ways to check this claim. For starters, a Google search of "widest freeway in the world" pulled up more than 92,000 results. The first, a May 2015 Chron.com article that also included this claim. Turner’s spokeswoman, Janice Evans, also sent us a link to the same story as the source for Turner’s claim. That Houston Chronicle story called the Katy Freeway the world’s widest, at 26 lanes including managed lanes and frontage roads near the interchange with Beltway 8. This wasn’t the newspaper’s judgment, however. Rather, the story referred to an August 2012 Business Insider web post listing the "11 wildest highways to drive before you die," with the Katy Freeway chunk of I-10 (which runs from Jacksonville, Florida to Los Angeles) designated the world’s widest. Here’s the full Business Insider entry, which appeared between mention of Bolivia’s treacherous Yungas Road and mention of the Karakoram Highway in the Himalayas: "With 26 lanes in certain parts, the Katy Freeway, or Interstate 10, is the widest highway in the world. It serves more than 219,000 vehicles daily in Texas. Built in the 1960s, Interstate 10 expands across a 23-mile stretch from its intersection with Interstate 610 to the city of Katy in Texas." In the entry, the words "Katy Freeway" link to a web page sponsored by Webinfolist.com, "Civil Engineer," presenting definitions including: "Highway is defined as the main road intended for travel by the public between cities and towns. The Pan-American Highway is the longest international highway which connects many countries. It is nearly 48,000 kilometers long. "Whereas," the definition continues, "the Katy Freeway in Houston, Texas, USA, is the widest highway, having a total of 26 lanes in some sections." We saw no sourcing for the characterization and our attempts to draw elaboration, repeatedly by email, proved a dead end; no replies. At the least, then, we know where the mayor’s wording likely originated. Our own width search Our search for fuller perspective started with TXDOT data indicating that in 2014, I-10 just west of the 610 loop saw a daily average of 316,182 cars. One thing that is clear: the freeway’s designation as the world’s widest folds in its frontage lanes. The freeway alone is 13 lanes at its widest, with most sections consisting of 10 to 12 lanes, Doug Hecox, a public affairs specialist with the Federal Highway Administration, told us via email. The FHWA uses the Highway Performance Monitoring System, a database that collects information on the nation’s public roads. Congress uses data from the system in reports that determine highway funding, and states and local governments use data to assess everything from highway condition to air quality trends. We’d reached out to the agency to gauge how I-10 compares in width to other major U.S. roadways -- never mind highways of the world. When comparing freeway lanes alone, I-10 doesn’t appear to be especially wide. In fact, as of July 2010, at least eight sections of other U.S. freeways had more lanes. A section of I-405 in Los Angeles had 14 freeway lanes, parts of I-75 in Atlanta had 15 lanes, and we spotted stretches of freeway in more than 10 other cities with 12 or 13 lanes. This means, according to the agency, highways in six other states had more lanes than the Katy Freeway. Hecox told us the agency doesn’t include frontage roads nor does it have a way to include them. And in Canada… Considering highways globally starts to make the Katy look picayune. As of 2016, for instance, Highway 401 near the Toronto Airport ran 18 lanes across. And, the Hong Kong-Macau Expressway, otherwise known as the G4, made headlines in October 2015 when a newly-installed checkpoint funneled 50 lanes -- yes, 50 lanes, to accommodate multiple toll booths-- into 20, causing an hours-long traffic jam. Our ruling Turner called the Katy Freeway, a Houston portion of I-10, the widest freeway in the world, with up to 26 lanes, including its frontage roads. If frontage and managed lanes are included, I-10 is quite the behemoth. Problem is, hardly anyone includes frontage roads when measuring American freeways. Get rid of the frontage roads and the Katy drops to 13 lanes at its widest, not much different than several other freeways across the country. As for the rest of the world, we found a wider freeway in Canada, and a reported 50-lane highway in China that makes the Katy look like a country road. We rate this claim False.

pomt-14358	Says Senate Republicans are "following a longstanding tradition of not filling vacancies on the Supreme Court in the middle of a presidential election year."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/22/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-exaggerates-tradition-not-confirmi/	Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said his party is following a longstanding tradition by vowing not to consider any Supreme Court nominee until after a new president is inaugurated in 2017. McConnell has said he won’t even meet with federal appeals court Judge Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama’s nominee to replace conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, who died in February — let alone hold hearings or a vote on Garland. Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace asked McConnell if it would be hard to maintain such a rigid argument over the next several months. McConnell responded by listing prior comments from several Democratic senators. "We're following the Biden rule," he said, referring to comments made by Vice President Joe Biden in 1992. "And Biden was chairman of the Judiciary Committee in 1992, in presidential election year, he said the Senate should not act on filling a Supreme Court vacancy if it had occurred that year. Harry Reid when he was back in 2005 said the president nominates, but the Senate doesn't have to vote. Chuck Schumer, who will be the next Democratic leader, said in 2007 they wouldn't confirm. The Democrats were in the majority in the Senate, they wouldn't confirm a Bush appointment to the Supreme Court if one occurred within 18 months of a presidential election. "So, all we're doing, Chris, is following a long standing tradition of not filling vacancies on the Supreme Court in the middle of a presidential election year." It is more than a stretch for McConnell to say it’s a "tradition" for the Senate not to fill a Supreme Court vacancy in an election year. In the past century, there have been 25 presidential elections. Just four Supreme Court seats opened up in those election years. In three of those instances, the Senate confirmed the president’s nominee, and just once — the only election-year court opening in the past 80 years — did the Senate refuse a nominee. So the scenario McConnell described has happened exactly once in the past century, in 1968, and that decision did not actually leave a vacancy on the court for any period of time. "This is entirely a matter of circumstance," Sarah Binder, a political scientist at George Washington University, previously told PolitiFact. It’s "certainly not a norm or tradition by presidents refraining from nominating in a presidential election year, or by senators refusing to consider such nominations." One-time 'tradition' In June 1968, Chief Justice Earl Warren told President Lyndon Johnson he planned to retire. Johnson nominated sitting justice Abe Fortas to succeed Warren as chief. Fortas hit strong bipartisan Senate opposition and asked that his name be withdrawn for chief justice (though he stayed on the court as an associate justice). Johnson had also nominated Homer Thornberry to take Fortas’ place on the court. But that nomination, too, was withdrawn, as Fortas never became chief justice. While there was some opposition to the Fortas nomination based on the fact that Johnson was a lame duck, Fortas’ failed confirmation primarily resulted from ethical questions over fees he received, his prior decisions and his closeness with Johnson. In any case, the Senate’s decision not to confirm didn’t actually leave a vacant seat on the court because Warren chose to stay on the bench. Scalia’s seat, however, will remain vacant for as long as the Senate refuses to confirm a nominee. Without a ninth justice to break ties, it’s possible that many decisions will result in a 4-4 deadlock, which would mean the decisions of the lower court would stand. There are more examples in the past century of the Senate confirming Supreme Court nominees for seats that open up in election years, though it is still a rare occassion. You have to go back about 80 years, as McConnell correctly noted on Fox News Sunday. In 1932, President Herbert Hoover nominated, and the Senate confirmed, Benjamin Cardozo. In 1916, Woodrow Wilson nominated John Clarke and Louis Brandeis, and they both made it through the Senate. McConnell’s talking point also ignores the two instances in the past century when the Senate confirmed Supreme Court nominees in election years, even though the seat opened up in the year prior. In 1988, the Senate confirmed Ronald Reagan’s nominee, Anthony Kennedy, though the seat became vacant in 1987. And in 1940, the Senate confirmed Franklin Roosevelt’s nominee, Frank Murphy, though the seat became vacant in 1939. A few 19th century presidents also nominated Supreme Court justices in election years, though not all of them were successful, according to a February 2016 article in the Cook Political Report by University of Georgia political scientist John Anthony Maltese. Maltese found that since the country’s founding, soon-to-depart presidents have made 32 Supreme Court nominations. Those nominations came within a period ranging from within 365 days of a successor’s election through the successor’s inauguration. Of those 32 nominations, the Senate confirmed 18 — hardly proving that McConnell or his Democratic opponents have reason to claim tradition. The record shows that Republicans’ inaction on Obama’s nominee is not rooted in some longstanding tradition, especially in the past century. SCOTUSblog editor Amy Howe wrote, "The historical record does not reveal any instances since at least 1900 of the president failing to nominate and/or the Senate failing to confirm a nominee in a presidential election year because of the impending election." Our ruling McConnell said Senate Republicans are "following a longstanding tradition of not filling vacancies on the Supreme Court in the middle of a presidential election year." McConnell’s use of the phrase "longstanding tradition" is misleading, as the Senate has chosen not to fill a Supreme Court seat that opens up during an election year just once in the past 100 years. The reality is that, at least in recent decades, the Senate has rarely been presented with the opportunity to consider a Supreme Court nominee in an election year. It’s so rare that there’s no fully analogous scenario to compare with the current debate over filling Scalia’s seat. McConnell’s statement is not accurate, so we rate it False.

pomt-00926	Says she has opposed measures to weaken the Dodd-Frank Wall Street regulatory bill and campaign-finance legislation when they were offered as stand-alone bills.	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/feb/26/ann-mclane-kuster/did-kuster-flip-flop-when-voting-cromnibus/	Evoking the old cliche about lawmaking and sausage, Democratic U.S. Rep. Ann Kuster faces questions about whether she changed her stance on two votes, going one way when faced with a pair of stand-alone bills and the other way after those measures were wrapped in a much larger package. The dispute involves two policy measures tacked onto a massive spending bill known as the "CRomnibus." That bill, passed in December 2014 by the outgoing Congress, approved enough money to keep the federal government in operation through September 2015. One of the "riders" – that is, unrelated amendments – rolled back some of the protections enacted after the Wall Street bailouts in 2008 by the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The other amended the Federal Election Campaign Act to increase the amount of money that individual donors can contribute to national political party committees. The White House urged Congress to approve the bill despite continued objection to those two provisions. The two U.S. House members from New Hampshire split their votes on the bill. Then-Rep. Carol Shea Porter, a Democrat, voted against the spending measure, while Ann Kuster, also a Democrat, voted for it. In an interview with the Concord Monitor in January, Kuster said she didn’t agree with the riders but felt it was her duty as a member of Congress to keep the government running. She said it was bad form to make such policy changes in an appropriations bill, and she wished she’d been given the chance to vote against them without risking a government shutdown in the process, she said. "As standalone bills, I would be opposed," she said. We wondered: Has Kuster ever had the opportunity to vote on those issues outside the context of a spending bill? On the campaign finance issue, Kuster co-sponsored a bill in the days after the interview to undo the changes adopted in the spending bill that increased the amount of money a single donor can give to national party committees each year. (The spending bill raised the limits from $97,200 to as much as $777,600.) So while she hasn’t voted contrary to the campaign-finance rider in the past, she acted almost immediately to undo what was passed in the spending bill. This gives her claim a ring of truth. On bolstering the provisions of Dodd-Frank, however, Kuster’s record is mixed. Recently, she’s defended the law, but in earlier votes, she supported softening some of its provisions. In October 2013, for instance, Kuster voted in favor of a bill to repeal a provision of Dodd-Frank that would require banks to keep risky investments away from holdings that receive government backing through federal deposit insurance and Federal Reserve discount window lending. The legislation, called the Swaps Regulatory Improvement Act and co-sponsored by Reps. Randy Hultgren, an Illinois Republican, and Jim Himes, a Connecticut Democrat (and former vice president of Goldman Sachs), would have eliminated a prohibition against certain types federal assistance to swaps entities. The measure passed the House Financial Services Committee in February 2012 and made it to the House Agriculture committee – on which Kuster sits – in March 2013. (The bill went before the agriculture committee because the risk involved in loans to farmers is often mitigated through commodity-based derivatives.) Kuster was among the 31 representatives on the committee to vote for the bill in committee, while 14 lawmakers disagreed. Then, the bill came before the full house as H.R. 992 in October 2013. Kuster was among 70 Democrats who joined 222 Republicans to pass the bill. All told, 119 Democrats – including Shea-Porter – and three Republicans opposed the measure on the floor. This bill was never heard in the Senate, but much of its substance was eventually folded into the CRomnibus. In addition, Kuster was among a minority of Democrats last September who supported a bill to exempt a segment of the market for derivatives from Dodd-Frank’s new rules. Only after the November election, in which Democrats lost seats, did Kuster join all but 29 Democrats in January when she voted against the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act. The legislation was essentially the same as the September bill, along with a two-year delay of a provision that would restrict banks from making certain kinds of speculative investments. Kuster and other Democrats proposed 14 amendments to that bill – hers was to strike the delay altogether – but House rules, which heavily favor the majority, didn’t allow them to be taken up on the floor. Kuster’s camp acknowledged she voted for the swaps amendment and other measures related to Dodd-Frank. "She has voted in the past, through standard House procedure, for bills that would improve the Dodd-Frank law by addressing parts of the law that could unintentionally harm middle class families and main street small businesses," Kuster spokeswoman Rosie Hilmer said. It’s worth noting that the securities and investment industry was one of the most prominent contributors to Kuster’s campaign in 2014, according to the nonpartisan campaign-finance clearinghouse OpenSecrets.com. With $143,041 in donations from that sector, she trumped her opponent, Marilinda Garcia, by nearly three times over. She also raised more than three times as much from that sector as Shea-Porter, the Democrat running for New Hampshire’s other House seat, and Republican Frank Guinta, who beat Shea-Porter to win that seat. Kuster raised $90,000 more from the securities and investment industry in her 2014 campaign than she did in her 2012 campaign. Our ruling Kuster says she has opposed measures to weaken campaign-finance restrictions and financial-services protections when they were offered as stand-alone bills. She can make a plausible case on campaign finance, but her record on financial-services protections is more mixed. Early on, she voted for several measures that would weaken the Dodd-Frank act; only recently has she taken a firm stance against efforts to ease provisions of Dodd-Frank. Her statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate Kuster’s claim Half True.	None	Ann McLane Kuster	None	None	None	2015-02-26T16:01:23	2015-01-06	['None']
pomt-10678	"If we went back to the obesity rates that existed in 1980, that would save the Medicare system a trillion dollars."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/17/barack-obama/a-trillion-is-too-much/	A trillion dollars? Really? That's a lot of money — $1,000,000,000,000, to be exact. Obama is accurately quoting that number from a report issued by the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning think tank. The report states, "If we were able to reduce obesity to 1980s levels, Medicare would save $1-trillion." It attributes the number to the Centers for Disease Control and the Commonwealth Fund. At issue is the increased prevalence of obesity. The percent of the U.S. population considered to be obese has roughly doubled since the 1980s. Researchers have documented that these people need more health care due to complications from obesity-related diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, certain types of cancers and other illnesses. Researchers have also developed models to calculate costs for obesity-related health care. We agree that obesity drives up health costs, but getting to $1-trillion just doesn't add up, according to our estimates. (Factcheck.org, a political fact-checking Web site at the University of Pennsylvania, found the same thing; check out their analysis here . ) The Centers for Disease Control cites a study on health spending due to obesity and overweight that shows numbers significantly less than $1-trillion. We tracked down one of the authors of the study the CDC cited: Eric Finkelstein, a health economist with the research group RTI International who has studied the issue extensively and written several papers on the topic. Finkelstein said obesity accounts for excess health spending of about $90-billion a year. About half of that — about $45-billion — is billed to Medicare and Medicaid together. Medicare's share of obesity spending therefore is between $20-billion and $25-billion. If obesity rates rolled back to 1980s levels, Medicare spending would be about half that, or about $12-billion a year. Now we get to the slipperiness of Obama's quote. He says if obesity rates rolled back, Medicare would save $1-trillion. But he doesn't give a time frame, and neither does the report he's quoting from. Maybe he meant it would have saved $1-trillion since the 1980s. But that doesn't make sense either.

pomt-06579	The Atlanta Beltline paid nearly $3.5 million for less than a quarter-acre.	false	/georgia/statements/2011/sep/28/john-sherman/did-beltline-overspend-land/	In recent years, most political and business leaders in the city of Atlanta have hailed the Atlanta Beltline project as a marvel of modern development. The vision: safe, vibrant neighborhoods with more parks and trails along a 22-mile loop of mostly abandoned rail lines that will be connected to existing MARTA and future transit systems. It’s expected to be several years before the Beltline is fully developed. "The Atlanta Beltline is the most comprehensive economic development effort ever undertaken in the city of Atlanta and among the largest, most wide-ranging urban redevelopment projects currently under way in the United States," Atlanta Beltline Inc., the operational arm of the effort, says on its website. Some government watchdogs are not so impressed. They see the Beltline as a project fraught with overspending. One group recently put out a newsletter with what it says is an inexcusable example of government waste. A PolitiFact reader asked us to check it out. The Fulton County Taxpayers Foundation’s September newsletter, titled "The Atlanta Beltline: Is It Feasible?," contained a claim that Beltline officials wildly overspent on the purchase of a small piece of land in Atlanta’s Old Fourth Ward. "Several parcels were purchased by Georgia Power from the city of Atlanta and then sold back to the Atlanta Beltline Inc. for seemly huge profits," the group’s president, John Sherman, wrote in the newsletter. "O Dallas Street, .1756 acre, was sold to Georgia Power on Nov. 30, 2002, by the city of Atlanta for $350,000 and resold to the Atlanta Beltline Inc. on Dec. 21, 2007, for $3,485,000." In an e-mail, the foundation called it "the highest price ever paid for land." Did the Beltline really pay nearly $3.5 million for less than a quarter-acre? Beltline spokesman Ethan Davidson said Sherman was way off track on that point and several other claims in his newsletter, such as how many people are on the Beltline payroll. He presented us a settlement statement that shows it was slightly more than 2 acres purchased. Sherman countered with Fulton County tax records of his own to claim he’s correct. So who’s right here? For much of the past decade, Sherman has been one of the most vocal critics of spending practices at City Hall. He’s argued that Atlanta should more frequently consider "managed competition," the idea of allowing private companies to bid for government contracts if they can do the work as well as the city and for less money. The foundation says its newsletters go out to tens of thousands of readers. The newsletter was mentioned in an Atlanta Progressive News article. Stan Anderson, a former manager at the Fulton County tax assessor’s office, noticed the Beltline was buying land for more than what he believed it is worth. Anderson, who helps people appeal their property assessments for the foundation, alerted Sherman to some of these purchases. The land in question lies near a portion of the Beltline located close to the old City Hall East site, the massive brick building that was once the headquarters for Atlanta’s police and fire departments. After years of effort, the city finally sold the property this summer to developers who plan to convert it into a mix of residential and office space. Georgia Power did indeed sell land for nearly $3.5 million in late 2007 to the Atlanta Beltline Inc. That was before the Great Recession and when Atlanta’s intown real estate market was considered a great investment. It’s been converted into trails and green space and now called the Historic Fourth Ward Park. The big question: Was the land less than a quarter of an acre, as Sherman wrote in the newsletter? Or was it 2.1 acres, as Beltline officials told us? Georgia Power spokeswoman Konswello Monroe said the sale included several parcels that totaled more than 2 acres. Sherman connected us with Anderson, who said the Beltline and Georgia Power were correct. Anderson believes Sherman may not have added all six parcels before hitting the send button on his newsletter. "I don’t think Mr. Sherman had any intention of misleading anybody," Anderson said. "He was upset about the amount [the Beltline was] paying per acre." Sherman stressed those concerns in some of his conversations with us after learning of the error. "Even if you took their figures, the cost of the land is more than $1.5 million an acre," he said. "This is absolutely crazy." Sherman also wonders why the Beltline paid nearly 10 times what Georgia Power bought the land for five years earlier. Did the Beltline overpay for the land? "No, because that was fair market value in 2007," Davidson, the Beltline spokesman, said. Davidson also argues the project has saved the city money. The city initially wanted to use the property as part of a tunnel to manage sewer overflow that Atlanta Watershed Management officials wrote in one document would have cost $40 million. The creation of a stormwater retention pond at the park cost less than $30 million, city officials say. The bottom line here is Sherman’s newsletter correctly stated how much the Beltline purchased the property for, but was wrong about the size of the property, creating a false impression for anyone who read it. We rate his claim False.	None	John Sherman	None	None	None	2011-09-28T06:00:00	2011-09-12	['None']

pomt-14939	"The federal government owns about half of the West, yet it continues to acquire more land."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/oct/27/jeb-bush/washington-owns-half-us-western-states-jeb-bush-sa/	GOP presidential candidate Jeb Bush has announced he wants a sea change in the federal government’s land management practices. In his Western Land Resource Management plan, which Bush released Oct. 21, 2015, the former Florida governor said federal land holdings are out of control — and therefore, so are expenses and Washington’s influence across the region. "The federal government owns about half of the West, yet it continues to acquire more land," Bush said in the plan, which calls federal holdings "a liability to economic freedom and growth." He advocated more state and local control over these lands. Does Washington really own half of Western states, and is it looking for more? We decided to survey this for ourselves. The West vs. Washington There’s no exact total of how much land Washington owns and manages, partly because the total is constantly changing, but it’s a lot. According to the most recent data in a 2012 Congressional Research Service report, the government owns about 635 million to 640 million acres, or about 28 percent of all the land in the country. Most of that land is administered by three agencies in the Department of the Interior: the National Park Service (80 million acres); the Bureau of Land Management (248 million acres); and the Fish and Wildlife Service (89 million acres, plus another 217 million acres of marine refuges and monuments). In the U.S. Agriculture Department, the U.S. Forest Service is in charge of another 193 million acres. The Defense Department runs another 19 million acres in bases, training ranges and more. The rest is divided among several other departments and agencies. There is not an equal split among states, however. To Bush’s point, the federal government owns about 47 percent of the land in 11 Western states — Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Utah, Washington and Wyoming. If we head east of the Mississippi River, Washington owns and manages only about 4 percent. This disparity is partly because of history. Most land in the West was at one time public, ranging from purchases from France, Mexico and Russia to land seized from Mexicans and Native Americans. The federal government has transferred land to private interests over the years and has focused on conservation during the last century, but these vast holdings have long been a contentious issue. Many Republicans in Western state legislatures would prefer to keep land-use decisions local. One group called the American Lands Council, headed by Utah Republican state Rep. Ken Ivory, is leading the charge in pushing for transferring federal land to states. The Council did not get back to us for this fact-check, but their website says the group wants federal lands transferred to states to "provide better public access, better environmental health, and better economic productivity." Bush’s plan calls for local control and a smaller federal footprint in general. Conservationists and researchers fear the real reason states want these transfers is to sell or lease public lands to private developers for ranching, mining or forestry. This land is our land As Bush says, the federal government is looking to make more acquisitions. His campaign pointed out the Interior and Agriculture departments made a fiscal year 2016 budget request that asked for almost $575 million for land acquisitions (plus $325 million for state conservation grants). The money was earmarked for acquisition projects across several federal agencies that ranged from national park lands to scenic trails to wildlife refuges. That doesn’t necessarily mean those agencies will get that money. The 2016 budget request is dependent on the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a pot of cash pooled from fees on offshore oil and gas leases. Authorized in 1965, the fund is the main mechanism for land purchases and broad conservation efforts. Congress is authorized to set aside as much as $900 million per year from this fund for land acquisition — note the 2016 request is for $900 million in all — but lawmakers rarely give conservation efforts that much. They usually shift the bulk of the money to other expenses and leave little for conservation efforts. Congress authorized $306 million total after a similar $900 million request in 2015. Complicating matters this year is that Congress failed to reauthorize the fund when it expired on Sept. 30. Bush said in his plan he supported a permanent reauthorization of the fund. "There are additional funding sources for federal land acquisitions, but they are not as significant as LWCF," said Martin Nie, director of the Bolle Center for People & Forests at the University of Montana. "And yes, federal agencies are often in the process of both acquiring more land and conveying (or exchanging) other federal lands." Greg Zimmerman, policy director at the pro-conservation Center for Western Priorities, also pointed out that total federal acreage has fallen some over the years. That same CRS report concluded the five government agencies we mentioned earlier shed about 18 million acres between 1990 and 2010. Most of that change is from the Bureau of Land Management getting rid of land in Alaska, where the federal government still owns about 62 percent of the state. Our ruling Bush said, "The federal government owns about half of the west, yet it continues to acquire more land." He’s right that Washington owns about 47 percent of the land in the 11 most Western states. Government agencies also continue to request funds for land acquisitions, although the major source for these transactions recently expired. The federal government routinely acquires and disposes of land, but overall has less acreage now than it did 25 years ago. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-06238	It’s legal to "sign a recall petition (against Gov. Scott Walker) even if you have already signed another recall petition," but only one signature counts	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/dec/02/one-wisconsin-now/one-wisconsin-now-says-its-legal-sign-walker-recal/	The liberal group One Wisconsin Now, worried about possible confusion over who can sign petitions to recall Gov. Scott Walker, issued a "recall petitioners’ rights" memo in late November 2011. The group said you only have to be a qualified voter in Wisconsin; you don’t have to have voted here before or even have registered to vote. Mildly surprising to some perhaps, but the next claim really jumped out. The group wrote: "You can circulate or sign a recall petition even if you have already signed another recall petition (note, however, that only one signature per person will be counted)." Can you really sign a petition twice? And will it count for one signature -- or none, or two -- if you pen your name on separate petitions? It’s one of many points, from both sides, that has prompted confusion -- and accusations that opponents are misleading folks for their advantage. We already looked at a few process-related questions. Here’s one more. In state statutes, the recall law (Section 9.10) lists eight ways a signature could be nullified. Among them: It’s not dated, was too early or late, the signer lives out of state, the address can’t be confirmed. There was nothing noted about a case of multiple signatures. But deeper in the statute, we found an answer: "If a challenger can establish that a person signed the recall petition more than once, the 2nd and subsequent signatures may not be counted." That means the first signature is still good, but duplicates can be thrown out, said Reid Magney, spokesman for the Government Accountability Board, which oversees elections the recall process. That doesn’t guarantee they will be. It’s up to the incumbent to challenge the validity of signatures. The state Accountability Board will review the petitions, but isn’t staffed to systematically check for duplicates, Magney said. That puts the onus on the gatherers or Walker’s side. If people do sign more than once, they face no penalties. "There are no legal restrictions," Magney said. That doesn't speak to practical concerns. Magney, for instance, noted that people signing more than once could put their own cause in jeopardy because that falsely inflates the true number of signatures. Magney said the Government Accountability Board is not encouraging people to sign multiple times. But he added there is an instance in which they could be justified in doing so. "People should not sign a petition more than once unless they have some good faith reason to believe that the first petition was somehow fraudulent and believes the circulator doesn’t intend to file it," Magney said. Magney said the agency has tried to make that clear after an anonymous Facebook group (Operation Burn Notice) said it believed "burning recall petitions is fun and games." One Wisconsin Now’s executive director, Scot Ross, cited the same motive for publicizing the fact that signing twice is not illegal. The group is concerned about fraud, especially illegal destruction of recall petitions. Ross said One Wisconsin Now supports but is not directly involved in gathering signatures as the Democratic Party and allied groups push to get 540,208 valid signatures by Jan. 14, 2012, when the 60-day period closes. On the right, recall critics including the Republican Party of Wisconsin, and the MacIver Institute for Public Policy, have raised a different set of concerns. Also citing Facebook chatter, they have raised alarms about fraud and double counting, contending that some duplicates will not be weeded out by state officials. "Without a systematic review of signatures, how will we know if the proper process was followed and the threshold for recall was reached legally?" Brett Healy, president of the MacIver Institute, told us. "What is to stop someone from signing a petition three times or 30 times?" Magney said the state agency will look for obvious cases of fraud. Our conclusion We can’t predict whether all multiple signers will be found, but state law makes clear that one -- and only one -- signature is to be counted. And it’s perfectly legal to sign more than once. That was the focus of the statement from One Wisconsin Now. We rate it True.

pomt-10990	"In 1984, the New York Times said Trump would be our BEST president."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/13/bling-news/fake-headline-says-new-york-times-said-trump-would/	There was a time decades ago when the New York Times praised the idea of a President Donald Trump, a viral story on Facebook said. "This is amazing: In 1984, the New York Times said Trump would be our BEST president...They forgot...," said a July 9 headline by Bling News, a website with clickbait headlines that lacks original reporting. Facebook users flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. Read more about our partnership with Facebook. The story mischaracterizes what the New York Times magazine wrote about Trump in 1984 in an article headlined "The expanding empire of Donald Trump." At the time Trump, was the 37-year-old owner of the New Jersey Generals, a franchise in the upstart United States Football League. He was also the owner of many other businesses and properties. The Times wrote: "Donald J. Trump is the man of the hour. Turn on the television or open a newspaper almost any day of the week and there he is, snatching some star form the National Football League, announcing some preposterously lavish project he wants to build. Public-relations firms call him, offering to handle his account for nothing, so that they might take credit for the torrential hoopla." Nothing in the article declared that Trump would be the best president. The article did include a line that Trump said he didn’t want to be president: "He is constantly asked about his interest in running for elective office. Absolutely not, he answers," the Times wrote. "All of the false smiles and the red tape. It is too difficult to really do anything. He dislikes meetings and paperwork and is in the enviable position of being able to avoid both." Bling News drew its report from another website, 100percentfedup. That website posted this update and correction following an article by Factcheck.org: "We like to think our readers can think subjectively and ‘get’ our nuanced titles once they read the article. We give you credit for understanding where we’re coming from. Factcheck.org has claimed that the New York Times didn’t say Trump would be our BEST president. To clarify, if you read the intro paragraph of the article we hope you’ll think subjectively and understand what we said about the article. We believe that the New York Times INADVERTENTLY DESCRIBED HOW TRUMP WOULD BE A PERFECT FIT FOR THIS TIME IN AMERICA, therefore, THE BEST PRESIDENT ‘FOR THIS TIME IN AMERICA.’" We found no contact information on Bling News’ website. The New York Times magazine story in 1984 didn’t say that Trump would be our best president; instead, it was an in-depth profile of Trump the businessman. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-08112	The Bush-era tax cuts failed to increase employment and "work-force participation fell in 2001 and has never returned to the record level set in 2000."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2010/dec/11/jim-moran/rep-jim-moran-says-bush-tax-cuts-did-not-improve-e/	Democratic Congressman Jim Moran didn’t want tax cuts then, and he doesn’t want them now. Explaining his vote against any extension of the Bush-era cuts, Moran paints the acts in 2001 and 2003 as abject failures. "When the Bush plan was first proposed in 2001, the great cost of those tax cuts was sold to the public as a means of generating economic growth. That has proven to be false. The decade that followed the 2001 tax cuts featured the slowest average annual growth since World War II," he said in a Dec. 2 press release. Moran continues: "Nor did lower taxes increase employment. Work-force participation fell in 2001 and has never returned to the record level set in 2000 – before the tax cuts took effect." We were intrigued by the Congressman’s correlation between employment and the tax cuts. So we looked into the numbers. Asked for a source, Moran’s chief of staff, Austin Durrer, sent us a New York Times business blog post by David Leonhardt, which does reinforce the congressman’s statement. Getting to the bottom of Moran's claim required us to examine two contentions in the congressman's statement: 1) That overall U.S. employment was not increased by the Bush tax cuts; 2) That work-force participation actually fell. These two contentions may sound similar, but in the specialized world of economists they are defined differently and involve separate sets of statistics. Employment "Nor did lower taxes increase employment," Moran said. There were 132 million Americans employed when the first round of Bush tax cuts passed in June, 2001, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. There were 130.5 employed at the end of last month. That’s a decrease of 1.5 million workers. So technically, Moran is correct. But he omits an important consideration: After the more-sweeping second round of tax cuts took effect in June 2003, there was a significant increase of jobs that lasted until recession’s onset at the end of 2007. There were 129.8 million Americans employed in June, 2003 and almost 138 million with jobs in December, 2007. That’s an increase of 8.2 million workers. The recession at the end of the decade is the great equalizer that makes Moran’s statement factually accurate. But you can’t dismiss that the number of workers steadily increased for better than four years after the second Bush tax cut. So we’d rate Moran’s statement that lower taxes did not increase employment Half True. Work-force participation "Work-force participation fell in 2001 and has never returned to the record level set in 2000 -- before the tax cuts took effect," Moran said. Work-force participation is the percentage of the population 16 and older that is employed. Most economists regard it as a more meaningful measure of employment than the total number of Americans working. Here’s why: The total employment figure does not take into account that the United States’ population is growing and additional workers enter the job market every day. The U.S. has to create about 125,000 new jobs a month just to keep its employment and unemployment rates steady. The measure of work-force participation includes population growth. Moran is correct in saying work-force participation peaked in 2000. The high-water mark came in April that year when 64.7 percent of the U.S. population -- 16 and older -- had jobs. In June, 2001, when the first Bush tax cuts were approved, participation was at 63.7 percent. Last month, it was 58.2 percent -- the lowest measure since mid-1983. The participation percentages varied slightly from passage of the second Bush tax cuts to the start of the recession. In June, 2003, participation was 62.3 percent; it was 62.7 percent in December, 2007. Economists caution against measuring the success or failure of tax cuts by employment figures. "The point of the tax rate cuts was to increase incentives for working, saving, and investing -- and therefore productivity and growth," said Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation. "Labor Force Participation is just one variable. There is also job totals, work hours, investment, productivity, etc. Those variables all responded well." Gary Burtless, a senior fellow specializing in labor market policy with the left-leaning Brookings Institution, says Moran’s point is valid. But he, too, says labor force growth is a small component in measuring the effectiveness of tax cuts. "Tax changes can affect participation rates, though their impact has often been greatly exaggerated, especially by folks self-identifying as supply siders," he said. So it’s fair to argue that the merits of tax cuts should not be reduced to employment figures. But Moran is accurate when he says work-force participation fell after 2000 and the tax cuts did not restore them to previous highs. We rate this part of his statement True. Summary Moran says the Bush tax cuts failed to boost jobs. He cites two measurements. As he notes, total employment didn’t go up over the decade. But he neglects to mention numbers were on the rise before the advent of the worst economic downturn in 80 years. He’s half right here. He’s correct in saying work-force participation fell since a record in 2000. When you put both parts of his statement together, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-01686	"Far more children died last year drowning in their bathtubs than were killed accidentally by guns."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/aug/15/tucker-carlson/carlson-guns-dont-kill-people-bathtubs-do/	Gun safety advocates are pushing laws to make it harder for children to play with guns kept at home. A bill in the New York Legislature, for instance, would require gun owners to secure their weapons by either keeping them locked up or installing a trigger lock. Failing to do so could warrant fines, loss of a firearms license or potentially jail. Behind the New York proposal lies the tragic story of a 12-year-old boy who was accidentally killed by his friend when he went over to the friend’s house. Fox News discussed the New York story on Fox and Friends Weekend on Aug. 9, 2014. Tucker Carlson, show co-host and editor of the Daily Caller, a conservative news website, challenged the basic premise behind the bill. While the death of a child is "the worst tragedy imaginable," Carlson said there’s a deeper truth. "Far more children died last year drowning in their bathtubs than were killed accidentally by guns," Carlson said. "I’d like to see a package on ‘Do you have a bathtub at home because I want to know before I let my child go over to your house.’ A little perspective might be helpful." We reached out to Carlson to learn the source of his claim about deaths in bathtubs and deaths from guns. We didn’t hear back. We went to the federal government’s Center for Health Statistics to get some of that perspective that Carlson recommended. The data we found undercuts Carlson’s assertion. As the following table shows, total deaths for children 17 and under due to drowning in a bathtub were 95 in 2011, the latest year the numbers are available. Total deaths from accidental gun shots were 102. The one age range where Carlson might be able to make a case is for children 0 to 4 years old. For that group, 73 died in a bathtub and 29 were killed by guns. But in every other age group, guns are more deadly than bathtubs. Age Drowned in a bathtub Accidental gunfire 15-17 years 7 28 10-14 years 12 29 5-9 years 3 16 0-4 years 71 29 Total 93 102 Carlson didn’t say what age children he had in mind, but in the context of the story he was responding to — and his rhetorical question about something "I want to know before I let my child go over to your house" — this is not about children under 4 years old. Parents don't let toddlers "go over" to a friend’s house. For that age range, Carlson’s comparison is off by a factor of three. Bathtubs caused 22 deaths for kids 5 and older and guns caused 73 deaths. The Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a 2012 report on bathtub drownings. From 2006 to 2010, total deaths were 434 for an average of 87 per year. The bulk of those deaths, 348, involved children under 4 years old. Most of the time, 62 percent, the immediate cause was a parent or other caretaker leaving the room. Our ruling Carlson said far more children died last year drowning in their bathtubs than were killed accidentally by guns. First, there is no data for last year. The most recent data is from 2011. What that shows is that children 17 and under are more likely to die from accidental gunfire than from drowning in a bathtub, although the difference is small. However, for children 5 years old and up, government data show that guns are three times more deadly than bathtubs. Carlson was not just wrong, but with his phrase, "far more children died," he was emphatically wrong. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-05190	"Overwhelming Democrat and Republican votes" in 2011 for legislation in two special sessions on jobs demonstrated the bipartisan nature of the Wisconsin Legislature.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/13/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-he-got-overwhelming-bipartis/	Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s optimistic talk of attaining bipartisan cooperation in the wake of the June 5, 2012 recall election got a skeptical reaction from a conservative radio talk show host the day after Walker’s big win. WTMJ’s Charlie Sykes asked Walker if he really expected Democrats who have been "protesting, litigating and recalling" for 16 months to join with him on new legislative efforts. Walker said his "gut instinct" is that lawmakers and the public are "ready to move on" and agree on the need to focus on job creation. What’s more, he said there was precedent: Just check the record from legislative action in 2011. "In January and February last year, we had overwhelming Democrat and Republican votes for our special session on jobs and we had them again in the fall," Walker said. Was there really a time during Walker’s tumultuous tenure when the two parties got along? Republicans held strong majorities in both the Senate and Assembly in the early session (19-14 Senate and 59-39-1 Assembly), but their Senate margin was pared to a single vote during the fall session after a series of recall elections. Walker’s office referred us to a list of votes taken during the special sessions in 2011. We checked the Legislature’s official voting records and found a decidedly mixed record of bipartisan votes. We found a decidedly mixed record of bipartisan votes. A total of 29 bills identified as part of the two special "jobs sessions" came to a vote in at least one full chamber of the Legislature in 2011: -- Of those, 12 split almost exactly along party lines, with Republicans united and able to easily push through bills despite united opposition. Democratic support was typically a smattering of one, two or three votes. On one, a tort reform measure, not a single Democrat joined the majority. -- Of the 29, the same number -- 12 -- had strong bipartisan backing. There were 5 other votes that didn’t fall neatly into either category, typically getting bipartisan support in one chamber but little or none in the other. So, at best only 12 of the 29 bills could be said to have had "overwhelming" bipartisan support. The strongest show of inter-party cooperation came on bills that were tied to helping small businesses. Those included measures on new tax credits for businesses relocating to Wisconsin (32 of the 53 Democrats from either the Senate or Assembly joined the majority), and an expansion of economic development tax credits (all but 20 Democrats joined in). Another measure that drew significant support from both sides was a major rewrite of the state’s outdated telecommunications law to reflect the realities of the cellular phone era. Some Democrats raised concerns it could hurt rural residents, but only 21 voted no. No Democrat opposed a bill that aimed to let small film projects to benefit from the state’s film tax credit program. On the flip side, accord was almost non-existent on Walker’s move to side-step environmental reviews to allow commercial development of wetlands near Lambeau Field (only one Democrat joined the majority). The same was true on a hotly contested bill that boosted protection from lawsuits for businesses. (This was a straight party-line vote). Of course, the ultimate partisan split came on the budget-repair bill Walker introduced in the January special session. It included the major limits on collective bargaining for most public employees and required that state employees pay more towards their pension and health benefits. When Republicans made plans to approve the bill in less than a week, 14 Democratic members from the state Senate left the state to block a vote, with massive protests engulfing the Capitol for weeks. Ultimately, the bill was split into two parts. No Democrats voted for the part that included the union limits, and only four joined the majority on the other portion, which delayed state debt payments to pay for rising costs of prisons and health care. Our rating Walker said bipartisanship was on display in "overwhelming Democrat and Republican votes" in 2011 for legislation passed in two special legislative sessions on jobs. If a couple Democrats join all the Republicans on a vote, is that really "bipartisan?" In a highly technical sense, maybe, but in common usage it means both parties are supportive. And that was far from the case. What’s more, Walker claimed the special-session bills had "overwhelming" support from both parties. About 40 percent had strong bipartisan backing. And the special-session vote that consumed the state for months was a bitter partisan battle for the ages. There’s an element of truth here, in that some votes were truly bipartisan, but it was far from "overwhelming." We rate Walker’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-10397	From Obama's book: "I found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mother's race."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/10/chain-email/obama-didnt-write-that/	An e-mail making the rounds purports to cite quotations from Sen. Barack Obama's memoir, Dreams from My Father . Most of the quotes have to do with Obama's thoughts on race relations and growing up as a black man in America. Many of the quotes are real, though taken out of context and edited for maximum negative effect. The e-mail was sent to us by 20 PolitiFact readers who said they wanted to know if the claims were true. (For more on the e-mail and a link to its full text, read our article on the e-mail and Obama's book .) One quote stands out as totally false. "I found a solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against my mother's race." We read the book, and thought this line sounded out of place. To be doubly sure, we purchased an electronic edition of the book via ebooks.com, and searched for the words solace, grievance or animosity. We were not able to find the sentence, or anything close to the sentence, in Obama's book. The quote is actually lifted from an article in the American Conservative. Author Steve Sailer wrote a detailed analysis of Dreams from My Father, describing the narrator as "a humor-impaired Holden Caulfield whose preppie angst is fueled by racial regret" but also praising it as "an impressive book" with an "elegant, carefully wrought prose style." The "grievance" quote comes from the following passage: "In reality, Obama provides a disturbing test of the best-case scenario of whether America can indeed move beyond race. He inherited his father's penetrating intelligence; was raised mostly by his loving liberal white grandparents in multiracial, laid-back Hawaii, where America's normal race rules never applied; and received a superb private school education. And yet, at least through age 33 when he wrote Dreams from My Father , he found solace in nursing a pervasive sense of grievance and animosity against his mother's race." But those are Sailer's words, not Obama's. It's an arguable point whether it's a fair characterization of the views expressed in Obama's book. The bottom line is an e-mailer somewhere took the sentence, rewrote it, and passed it off as Obama's words. For this reason, we rate this statement Pants on Fire!

pomt-09280	GM has "repaid our government loan, in full, with interest, five years ahead of the original schedule."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/27/ed-whitacre/ceo-says-gm-has-repaid-government-loans-full/	In an ad reminiscent of Lee Iacocca's "Thanks, America" commercials in 1983 after Chrysler had repaid government-backed loans, General Motors CEO Ed Whitacre has taken to the prime-time airwaves to boast that GM has paid back its government loans, in full, and ahead of schedule. "A lot of Americans didn't agree with giving GM a second chance," Whitacre says in the ad. "Quite frankly, I can respect that. We want to make this a company all Americans can be proud of again. That's why I'm here to announce we have repaid our government loan, in full, with interest, five years ahead of the original schedule. But there's still more to do. Our goal is to exceed every expectation you've set for us." In addition to Whitacre, the loan repayment has been trumpeted by President Barack Obama and numerous members of his administration. It's true that GM has squared up on its government loans, but Whitacre isn't telling the full story. With GM in deep trouble and hundreds of thousands of jobs in the balance, the Obama administration -- through the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) -- stepped forward with tens of billions of dollars worth of assistance. As of March 31, 2010, the U.S. Treasury had committed approximately $52.4 billion to GM. Only a fraction of that, $6.7 billion, was in the form of loans. Most of the government's GM investment was converted to an ownership stake in the New GM, the company that emerged from bankruptcy: $2.1 billion in preferred stock; and 60.8 percent of the company's common equity. GM had already made several installments in paying back the $6.7 billion loan. But on April 21, 2010, GM announced that it had paid back the entirety of the remaining $4.7 billion in loans from the U.S. government (and another $1.1 million to the Canadian government). GM had until 2015 to pay back those loans. So the loan portion of the GM bailout was, in fact, settled, with interest, five years ahead of schedule. But the U.S. government is still on the hook for the bulk of its investment in GM. Again, the U.S. Treasury owns $2.1 billion in preferred stock and a 60.8 percent stake in the company. GM plans an initial public offering (IPO) as soon as this summer, and the government plans to sell off its interest in the company over time. The better the company does, the more the government looks to recoup. But the prospects for the government getting all its money back don't look promising. On March 18, 2010, the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projected the government will end up losing $34 billion in TARP funds extended to the automotive industry. The CBO didn't break out how much of that is tied to GM, but it's fair to say most of it. While we found a GM official quoted as saying he thinks taxpayers will eventually get all their money back, few industry experts agree. In an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal, Paul Ingrassia, the newspaper's former Detroit bureau chief and author of Crash Course: The American Automobile Industry's Road from Glory to Disaster, wrote: "It won't be easy for an IPO to raise $52 billion for the government shares. That's more than Ford Motor's current market capitalization, some $48 billion. And Ford, the only U.S. car company to avoid bankruptcy, already is profitable, which GM isn't. For GM to show sustained profits means doing business in a new way and breathing new life into long-moribund brands." It likely will take years to find out exactly how the government fares in selling off its GM stock, but in an April 23, 2010, letter to congressional leaders, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said investments in GM "will likely result in some loss, but we currently anticipate that it will be much lower than was forecast last year." Aside from the outstanding stock issue, Whitacre's announcement has come under fire from Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, who notes that the loans were repaid not with GM earnings (in fact, SEC filings show GM expected to have negative net cash flows in the fourth quarter of 2009) but rather from GM tapping into a multi-billion-dollar TARP-funded escrow account. "Therefore, it is unclear how GM and the Administration could have accurately announced yesterday that GM repaid its TARP loans in any meaningful way," Grassley wrote in an April 22, 2010, letter to Geithner. "In reality, it looks like GM merely used one source of TARP funds to repay another. The taxpayers are still on the hook, and whether TARP funds are ultimately recovered depends entirely on the government's ability to sell GM stock in the future. Treasury has merely exchanged a legal right to repayment for an uncertain hope of sharing in the future growth of GM. A debt-for-equity-swap is not a repayment." Grassley's claim about the origin of the money used to repay the loan was acknowledged by company and government officials. In an April 21, 2010, interview on the Fox Business Network, GM's vice chairman, Stephen Girsky, was asked if GM is just paying the government back with government money. "That is, in effect true," Girsky said. "But a year ago, nobody thought we'd be able to pay this back. They gave us five years to pay it back, we're paying it back in nine months. ... This is one step along the way in the road to recovery here.'' Elaborating on that point, he said: "The business is stabilizing. Our performance is starting to improve. The cash flow is better. The financial condition is stabilizing. So we felt it prudent to start to get the taxpayer their money back." In a Senate Finance Committee hearing on April 20, 2010, Neil Barofsky, the special inspector general for the TARP, was similarly asked if GM was "taking money out of one pocket and putting it in the other to do that." "The source of that was an equity capital facility ... that's basically escrow money," Barofsky said. "Some of the money that was given to GM, it basically wasn't all given as a lump sum check, saying, here, all this money's available to you," Barofsky explained. "Some of it was put in what's called an equity capital facility, which they can draw down. And they have to sort of report to the government what they're going to do with the money . . . . If there's any money left in that account after a certain period of time, it has to be used to repay the debt. "And basically what GM is doing is it's pulling that forward, and it's taking the money out of this TARP capital facility and using it to pay off the debt, the $6.7 billion debt that was previously owed." ABC News quoted a Treasury Department spokesman saying that "the cash in the restricted account was the property of GM." "This account was expected to be used for extraordinary expenses," the Treasury official said, "and the fact that GM has decided that it does not need to reserve these funds for expenses is a positive sign for our overall investment." In an interview with PolitiFact, Lawrence J. White, economist at New York University's Stern School of Business, warned not to make too much of the source of the funding. "To me, money is fungible," he said. ''At the end of the day, it shows that GM found itself with enough of a surplus to pay back this piece of government support. The escrow was not a new government loan to pay back the old loan. "It's a genuine paying back," White said. "It does reduce the federal government's involvement." Still, he said, "it sure doesn't wipe clean the slate" with the U.S. government. Whitacre's claim may be "technically accurate," White said, "but if it was meant to give the impression that that clears GM from its financial involvement with the federal government, that's not correct." Said David Zaring, professor at the Wharton School of Business: "It’s absolutely an exaggeration based on the fact that the government owns 60 percent of the company. But yes, that’s a repayment of money by a company the taxpayer owns. In that sense, I wouldn’t really crow too much about the repayment, if I were Ed Whitacre." Several economists we spoke to said the repayment is undeniably a sign of progress for the struggling company. But nearly 90 percent of the government's investment in General Motors through TARP still hangs in the balance, and most industry experts doubt stock sales will recoup anywhere near what the government put up. In an op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal on the day of the loan payoff announcement, Whitacre at least noted the issue of the remaining equity in GM still held by the U.S. government -- though even there he didn't quantify the government's financial stake. But we bet many more people saw the television ad we're fact-checking here. We think the TV ad would leave most reasonable viewers with the impression that GM has fully settled up with the government. Whitacre can accurately claim that GM has retired its $6.7 billion in loans from the U.S. government. But with the government still owning 60 percent of the company and the prospects slim for getting all its money back, we think that's highly misleading. And so we rate Whitacre's statement Half True.

pomt-14482	"Building a wall" on the U.S.-Mexico border "will take literally years."	true	/texas/statements/2016/feb/27/rick-perry/rick-perry-claims-donald-trumps-wall-southwest-bor/	Donald Trump says part of the answer to the complicated question of immigration has a seemingly simple solution: Build a "great, great" wall along the southern border and make neighboring Mexico pay for it. The logistics of that idea leave many people, including former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, agog. "Building a wall" on the border "will take literally years. I don’t care how good of a builder you are," Perry said about 40 minutes into an interview on the Jan. 15, 2016, edition of the Simon Conway Show on WHO in Des Moines. "And plus the private property rights," Perry said. "This is an issue that really gets complex in a hurry. I know because I’ve had to deal with it." Perry’s assertion got us thinking, what would go into building a wall from southernmost California to the southern tip of Texas? And would Trump’s wall indeed take years to build? We didn’t take Perry’s claim as an uncheckable prediction in that when he spoke, there already existed exhaustive studies and reports on building a border fence as ordered by Congress in 2006, particularly those conducted by the General Accounting Office, the nonpartisan investigative arm of Congress. We failed to connect with Trump’s camp about this statement while a Perry spokesman, Stan Gerdes, said by phone that while the former governor didn’t send a crew to the border to estimate how long a wall would take to build, it’s Perry’s experience-rich opinion it would definitely take more than a year. Some assumptions Before assessing Perry’s claim, we have to make assumptions in part because Trump’s plan for the wall is pretty vague. We’re also going to share declarations by Trump and others that occurred after Perry spoke. Typically, we wouldn’t do so out of fairness to the person making a claim. But not doing so here might leave us short of being up to date. What we know of late is that Trump told MSNBC on Feb. 9, 2016 the wall would be a "real wall," likely 35 to 40 feet tall and 1,000 miles long. The U.S.-Mexico border is actually just less than 2,000 miles long, but Trump said there are natural barriers over a portion of the border, meaning the U.S. would only need a wall along 1,000 miles of it. Some perspective: A 1,000-mile wall would be about one-13th the length of the Great Wall of China, but more than twice the proposed length of the concrete and fence barrier that separates Israel from the West Bank, according to a Nov. 11, 2014 Washington Post news article. Trump has also conceded the wall will cost billions. He’s been quoted saying costs will total up to about $8 billion, all out of Mexico’s pocketbook. At the Feb. 25, 2016, GOP debate, he upped that speculated price tag to $10 billion to $12 billion. Former Mexican President Felipe Calderón opposes Trump’s idea, according to a Feb. 8, 2016 CNN news article, where Calderon called Trump’s wall "stupid," as does former Mexican President Vicente Fox, who said in a Univision interview posted online Feb. 25, 2016 that Mexico is "not going to pay for that f****** wall." Trump’s response to Fox’s declaration? "The wall just got 10 feet taller," he said at the Republican presidential debate in Houston the same day. In August 2015, Trump told New Hampshire residents the wall would be made using "beautiful nice precast plank" (see the video above this story). So we know it’s going to be a solid wall. And if Trump becomes president, is it feasible to have a wall up in a year or less? The existing fence There’s currently about 670 miles of fencing along the 1,954-mile U.S.-Mexico border. That is, the fence is not a fluid structure from point A to point B. Rather, it’s a fragmented barrier of metal posts and fencing standing about 18-feet tall, according to a Jan. 1, 2016, Associated Press news article. When he was governor and running for president the first time, Perry voiced opposition to the fence, expressing a sentiment perhaps echoed in his skepticism about Trump’s promised wall. "No, I don’t support a fence on the border," Perry said in New Hampshire, according to a Sept. 3, 2011 news story in the Dallas Morning News. "The fact is, it’s 1,200 miles from Brownsville to El Paso. Two things: How long you think it would take to build that? And then if you build a 30-foot wall from El Paso to Brownsville, the 35-foot ladder business gets real good." Earlier, the fence was started as a result of the 2006 Secure Fence Act, which approved the construction of an about 700-mile fence stretching from parts of Tecate, California to Brownsville. Five years later, President Barack Obama said the fence is "now basically complete" – a claim PolitiFact deemed Mostly False on May 16, 2011. Around that time, the vast majority of the mandated fencing had been answered with vehicle barriers and single-layer pedestrian fence even while the act called for double-layer fencing, of which there was about 36 miles in place. As of 2012, the fence and fence-related costs totaled about $6 billion. A 2009 Government Accountability Office report said that on average, the cost had run between $1 million and $3.9 million per mile of fence, depending on things like "type of fencing, topography, materials used, land acquisition costs, and labor costs." Raul Meza, a structural engineer and El Paso’s state director for the Structural Engineer’s Association of Texas, who lives about four miles from a portion of the border fence, told us by phone he thinks a wall would be even more expensive to build because it requires more time and labor. In January 2016, PolitiFact Florida found estimates for the wall’s cost ranging from $5.1 billion to $25 billion, with additional costs for maintenance. There’s been little announced in terms of a timeline for the wall’s construction. Trump told Meet the Press on Aug. 15, 2016 construction would be "under budget and ahead of schedule." Constructing Trump’s wall By telephone, Sharon Wood, dean of the University of Texas’ Cockrell School of Engineering and a former chair of UT’s civil engineering department, told us a wall, like the one Trump is suggesting, would likely be made using steel-reinforced concrete. "You can buy small reinforcement bars if you just go to Home Depot… Obviously for a larger structure, you’re going to use larger sizes," Wood said. "You don't buy it from Home Depot, but it’s the same type of process." A Feb. 17, 2016, CNN news article backs up this idea. Engineers asked to speculate about the envisioned project suggested precast concrete panels reinforced with steel would likely be used. They also came to the conclusion that building the wall would take around 339 million cubic feet of concrete and 5 billion pounds of steel. Meza told us two ways to build a reinforced concrete wall would entail either building it along the border on site, or building concrete panels at different construction firms -- which Trump seemed to endorse in his August 2015 remarks -- and having the panels transported and installed. Meza said precast panels would save time but add to the bill due to transport costs. Yet there’s more to building a large project than outright construction. James Jirsa, a UT-Austin civil engineering professor who specializes in concrete structures, told us there’s usually a planning period, lasting at least a year, to survey terrain and settle design issues. That period, he said, is followed by a bidding period for land that can also be time-consuming. The federal government has the right to build on private property when it deems projects a public necessity, though it is required to offer compensation – a process, celebrated by Trump, called eminent domain. This part of pre-construction can take years, depending on whether or not landowners dispute it. "Every piece of land is different," said Paul Barkhurst, an eminent domain litigation lawyer based in San Antonio. "You’re talking about a massive project across many, many states. It just depends on how much resources they want to put on it. One case could drag on for years because the land owner can challenge the right to take and the landowner can challenge the amount of compensation." Wood said an environmental impact and hydrological study may also be necessary, to see how the wall would affect nearby water and the flow in the Rio Grande. Then comes the raw building of the wall. Wood said there aren’t many structural loads to consider, but the builders would have to find a way to make sure the foundation is solid, even if the Rio Grande floods. This involves digging out the foundation and putting in casts of the concrete foundation and then building. "To be honest, that’s pretty straightforward," Wood said, saying the excavation of the foundation would probably take the most time. So how long would it take? Wood said that when just looking at the building the wall, pre-construction steps aside, it’s possible though highly unlikely that the wall could be completed in a year, say, if it were a "national priority and all of the resources were put in one place." If "you were to mobilize every single construction worker in the country," Wood said, "and take them down to the Texas border, I bet they could get it done very quickly." Separately, Jirsa opined that he and most engineers would probably agree that such a wall could not be built in under a year while Meza said the time it takes to build the avowed wall hinges largely on how much money goes toward construction. If money were no object, he said, the best-case scenario from the initial design phase to the wall’s completion would be five to 10 years. "I think that would be reasonable," he speculated. Our Ruling Perry said: "Building a wall" on the U.S.-Mexico border "will take literally years." If Trump has a fast-track plan to plan the wall, purchase required land, complete needed studies and erect the wall in a year or less, it’s not public. Meantime, engineering experts agree the wall would most likely take years to complete. Keep in mind, too, it took more than six years to build roughly 700 miles of fence and barriers along the roughly 2,000-mile U.S.-Mexico border. We rate this speculative claim True.

pomt-05654	"Every 1 percent increase in the cost of health insurance today causes about 30,000 Georgians to be uninsured."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/20/judson-hill/health-insurance-coverage-loss-claim-need-overhaul/	We all know how rough the economy has been in Georgia in recent years. Personal bankruptcies in the state are among the highest in the nation. Job growth is near the bottom. Georgia has more bank failures than any state. But a state senator from Cobb County offered up a statistic earlier this month that added a different dimension to the economic troubles. "Every 1 percent increase in the cost of health insurance today causes about 30,000 Georgians to be uninsured," said Sen. Judson Hill, a Republican from Marietta. Hill said this during a Georgia Senate debate of a bill he wanted passed. Senate Bill 471 is aimed at authorizing the state’s Insurance Department to work with other states to create a more competitive health insurance market that will result in lower costs for customers. The Republican-led Senate passed the bill by a 2-1 ratio. The Georgia House of Representatives has not yet voted on the bill. Hill told us that the state loses millions of dollars a year when it has to pay for medical costs of uninsured Georgians who use emergency rooms as their first source of primary medical care. "[The state is] saving a lot of money by helping the uninsured get health insurance," the senator said. Still, PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether Hill was right about this claim. Do 30,000 Georgians lose their health insurance when there is a 1 percent increase in cost? Hill said the numbers came from a study he read several years ago. Hill offered some more details through a Senate spokeswoman. The senator pointed to a few national statistics on how many Americans lose their health insurance and estimated what the numbers would be in Georgia. Health insurance cost experts believe there is a correlation between rising insurance costs and more people losing their insurance. Rising health insurance premiums are generally a result of increased quantity and quality of medical services, some researchers have found. The numbers of how many lose their insurance when costs rise 1 percent varies from the studies we’ve seen and Hill sent us. Some of these estimates are based on data that’s in some cases more than a decade old. In 2005, a Harvard University professor, a University of Michigan professor and a researcher from the National Bureau of Economic Research produced a study that examined the increase in health insurance costs and the decrease of those insured in the 1990s. "Our estimates suggest that a 1 percent premium increase results in a net increase in uninsured of 164,000 people. This compares with an estimate by the Lewin Group of 300,000 individuals losing employment-based coverage because of a 1 percent premium increase," the study found. We did not hear back from any of the researchers. The Lewin Group, through a spokesman, declined to comment. Georgia has 3.15 percent of the nation’s population, according to U.S. Census Bureau data. Using the study’s estimate, that would mean 5,166 Georgians would lose their health insurance, a far cry from Hill’s statement. Using the Lewin Group’s estimate, the number of Georgians losing their insurance would be 9,450, which is slightly closer to the senator’s statement. Hill argued the numbers are higher. "The upper side of that number is approximately 500,000; Georgia represents about 3-4 percent of that number because Georgia has a high number of insured lives," Hill wrote in an email. The highest national estimate Hill sent us was 400,000. The senator mentioned the Lewin Group study, a Congressional Budget Office study that put the number at 200,000 people who lose health insurance for every 1 percent increase in cost and another group that estimated between 200,000 and 400,000 people lose their insurance. Hill told us in a telephone interview that he had heard estimates of 28,000 Georgians who lose their insurance each time costs rise by a percentage point. He rounded the estimate to 30,000 in his comments to the Senate but conceded the estimate may be lower. "My real purpose is to do everything we can to make sure health insurance is more affordable," the senator said. In 2010, nearly one in five Georgians lacked health insurance, according to an annual report by Georgia State University researchers, who compile an annual study on the topic based on U.S. census data. In 2008, the year the Great Recession’s footprints could be seen throughout Georgia, 18 percent of Georgians were uninsured, the GSU researchers found. Georgia State associate professor Bill Custer talked about the recession’s impact with PolitiFact Georgia. He said there’s been a rapid increase in the number of Georgians uninsured because incomes have fallen. "It’s difficult to give a magnitude on that relationship," Custer said when asked whether Hill’s numbers are correct. "If someone put a gun to my head, I’d say he’s pretty close. But thankfully, no one has done that." Even if we use the highest national estimate of the number of people who lose their insurance if costs increase by 1 percent, 500,000, the number of Georgians who would lose their insurance would be 15,000. That’s based on 3 percent of Americans living in Georgia. Considering the recession’s impact in Georgia and that a larger percentage of Georgians were uninsured between 2008 and 2010, maybe the total is higher. Custer, the Georgia State expert, believes Hill is close with his estimate. We’re a little more skeptical about the senator’s math. Our rating: Mostly False.

pomt-11366	Mexico has "very strong border laws -- ours are pathetic."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-base-comparison-us-mexico-border-laws/	President Donald Trump offered an unflattering comparison between immigration laws in the United States and those of its southern neighbor, Mexico, in a series of immigration tweets. "Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA...They have very strong border laws -- ours are pathetic. With all of the money they make from the U.S., hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours, at least until Congress changes our immigration laws!" Trump tweeted on April 2. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We decided to take a closer look at Trump’s comparison of the countries’ immigration policies. Is Mexico really more strict about who it admits? White House cites an old law The White House held up an article published in the conservative-leaning Washington Times in 2010 as support for Trump’s statement. Among other points, the article said that Mexican law since 2000 "mandates that federal, local and municipal police cooperate with federal immigration authorities in that country in the arrests of illegal immigrants." The article outlines steep felony penalties for violations and says Mexico can use the law to kick out foreigners for a variety of reasons, including a lack of financial self-support. There’s a problem with citing this nearly eight-year-old article, however: The 2000 law has largely been superseded by a law enacted in 2011. Notably, the 2011 measure decriminalized the act of entering the country without documentation and allowed undocumented immigrants to use education and health services. It also set criminal penalties for abuse of migrants by immigration agents. The 2011 law stemmed from two impulses, said Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a group that generally opposes a hard-line approach to immigration. "They wanted to create a law that respected immigrants and cleaned up human-rights violations," Selee said. "They also didn’t want to embarrass themselves with the United States. Mexican human-rights advocates would beat them over the head for the punitive aspects of the old law, while also enabling enforcement capabilities. It was a delicate balance." Meanwhile, the article’s point about requiring local Mexican jurisdictions to cooperate with the federal government is a red herring for the United States, said David Bier, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. "The requirement for states and localities to cooperate is neither here nor there, because the U.S. system of federalism prevents any such law from existing," Bier said. Immigration policy specialists added that there’s a difference between the Mexican laws on the books and enforcement of those laws. "As anywhere, individuals who are caught without proper authorization in Mexico will be deported from the country," said Sonja Wolf, a researcher with the Drug Policy Program at the Centro de Investigación y Docencia Económicas (CIDE), a think tank in Aguascalientes, Mexico. "The question is to what extent the authorities have the capacity and the will to implement the legal requirements." Some missing context One point bolstering Trump’s position is that Mexico does allow a much lower rate of immigration as a percentage of its population than the United States does. In that sense, Trump has a point that the United States is broadly more open to immigration than Mexico. But most of the additional evidence weakens Trump’s argument in the tweet. For starters, it’s important to remember that the enforcement mechanism of U.S. immigration laws is robust and has become more so in recent years. The U.S. Border Patrol "has 19,000 officers with a budget of $3.8 billion," said Douglas S. Massey, a professor of public policy and sociology at Princeton University who specializes in immigration between the United States and Mexico. "It is the most controlled and hardened border anywhere in the world with the exception of Korea's DMZ." Since the late 2000s, increases in Border Patrol resources have combined with a tougher protocol for handling incoming migrants, including more deportation proceedings and incarceration. "Based on the previous 20 years’ experience, we would have expected increased apprehensions of Mexicans after 2009 as the U.S. economy improved and unemployment plummeted," said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at the Pew Research Center. "Instead, apprehensions of Mexicans continued to decline." The United States removed more than 3 million non-citizens from the United States between 2008 and 2016. "Immigration crimes are still the No. 1 reason for a federal criminal arrest in the United States," Bier said. Another important point: In recent years, Central Americans have accounted for a growing share of migrants coming into Mexico, due to deteriorating conditions in countries such as El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. While Mexico has taken a variety of measures to limit illegal immigration and asylum for Central Americans, specialists have deemed efforts on Mexico’s southern border to be largely unsuccessful. "Mexico's borders are quite porous," said Wolf of the Mexican think tank. "There are many areas where people and goods can pass through fairly easily, and there is little that the migration authorities or the security forces could do about that." A final note: In recent years, the United States and Mexico have significantly increased their cooperation on cross-border issues, such as drug trafficking and terrorism. This cooperation deepened due to the Merida Initiative during the presidencies of George W. Bush and Barack Obama, "and, at least up until now, it has continued through the Trump administration," said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Wilson Center’s Mexico Institute. Our ruling Trump tweeted that Mexico has "very strong border laws — ours are pathetic." Broadly, Mexico does admit fewer immigrants than the United States. But the strict Mexican law cited by the White House as evidence has largely been supplanted by a softer 2011 law. In addition, Trump underplays the increasing robustness of U.S. immigration laws and enforcement even under his predecessors, while downplaying how porous Mexico’s own southern border is.

pomt-04676	"After a decade of decline, this country created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last two and a half years."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/06/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-us-has-gained-half-million-ma/	During his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., President Barack Obama touted recent growth in manufacturing jobs. "After a decade of decline, this country created over half a million manufacturing jobs in the last two and a half years," Obama said. Because of the wording of his claim, we are examining whether the numbers are right, not whether Obama's policies were instrumental. To check the numbers, we turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment numbers. We used seasonally adjusted statistics for manufacturing jobs. A decade of decline It’s not news that manufacturing jobs have been in decline in the United States in recent years, though sometimes with ups and downs. Generally, the decline has been due to broad economic shifts both inside and outside the United States, as well as changes in technology. Manufacturing’s share of U.S. employment was 29 percent in 1960, but it fell to just 9 percent by 2011. Even the raw numbers of manufacturing jobs fell over that period -- from 15.7 million to 11.7 million -- despite a large expansion of the overall U.S. workforce. Between December 1999 and December 2009 -- the decade Obama appears to be referring to -- manufacturing employment fell from 17.3 million to 11.5 million, a decline of just over one-third. So Obama’s correct that manufacturing jobs had experienced "a decade of decline" by the time he took office. If you look at the chart (reproduced above) the downward slope is essentially uninterrupted. Half a million manufacturing jobs created During the period Obama chose -- from January 2010 to July 2012 -- manufacturing jobs began to rise again, by 532,000. That’s "over half a million manufacturing jobs," as Obama put it. It’s worth noting that while the reversal has been striking, this rise has still replaced only a fraction of the manufacturing jobs lost during the "decade of decline." The manufacturing jobs gained during the turnaround replaced less than 10 percent of the jobs lost during the decade of decline. Our rating The rise in manufacturing jobs that Obama is referring to may be modest compared to the prior decade’s decline, but he has described the numbers carefully. We rate his statement True.

pomt-08034	"The Democratic majority led the 111th Congress to spend more money in two years than the first 100 congresses before them combined."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/05/kevin-mccarthy/kevin-mccarthy-says-111th-congress-spent-more-mone/	In a recent Q&A feature called, "Ask the Californian," reader Gerald Sutliff wrote the Bakersfield Californian newspaper to ask why his Congressman, Republican Kevin McCarthy, did not cast a vote on several key bills during the busy lame-duck session of the 111th Congress. "One can't help noting that last week's vote recap (How our Lawmakers Voted) shows our congressman (Kevin McCarthy, R-Bakersfield) missing in action," Sutliff wrote. "It's OK with me; he may have had a good reason. However, I really want to know his view on each of the votes he missed. How would he have voted had he been present?" The four bills in question were one to provide assistance to 9/11 responders, one to update food safety laws, one to reauthorize a science education bill known as the America Competes Act and one to temporarily extend government spending. McCarthy's office issued a statement that was published on Jan. 2, 2011. "I was not present for the votes because my son had surgery last week, and I came home to be with him and my family," said McCarthy, who will be the House Majority Whip in the new Congress. "If I had been in D.C., I would have voted against all of the bills mentioned in your reader's letter. While there were a number of positive things in each of the bills, the tipping point was the spending. The Democratic majority led the 111th Congress to spend more money in two years than the first 100 congresses before them combined. Washington has lost touch and spent too much time focusing on the wrong issues. Americans need jobs, not more debt, and next year the new majority will be focused on just that." The portion of McCarthy's comment that caught our eye was where he said that "the Democratic majority led the 111th Congress to spend more money in two years than the first 100 congresses before them combined." The reason? A few months earlier, we gave a Pants on Fire ruling to a very similar statement by Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va. (He and McCarthy are two of the three lawmakers who have labeled themselves the "Young Guns" in the House GOP leadership.) In the earlier comment, during the Oct. 12, 2010, episode of Comedy Central's The Daily Show, Cantor told Jon Stewart that "what you've seen (in Washington) is a crowd that has taken advantage of a crisis back in late '08, early '09 and spent more money than this country has spent in the last 200 years combined, in the two years since." Stewart didn't challenge Cantor's claim, but we did. We found that federal spending in those two years amounted to a little more than $7.2 trillion. We didn't have to add up all 200 years to exceed that amount -- you only had to add together 2006, 2007 and 2008 to reach $8.3 trillion, which exceeded the $7.2 trillion of 2009 and 2010. Cantor was also far off using more lenient calculations. Thus the Pants on Fire rating. When Cantor saw our analysis published by PolitiFact Virginia, he proceeded to write a letter to the editor in which he owned up to misspeaking and that he was referring to accumulated debt instead of spending. So what about McCarthy's statement? It's similar to Cantor's comment to Jon Stewart, but it's not exactly the same. Whereas Cantor used as his comparison point "the last 200 years," McCarthy used "the first 100 congresses." Although his phrasing could be read to mean the 100 congresses prior to the 111th Congress, we're giving him the benefit of the doubt that he meant the first 100 congresses in history. That means counting only from the 1st Congress to the 100th Congress -- a period that ended 22 years ago, in January 1989. But he's wrong by either measure. McCarthy spokeswoman Erica Elliott forwarded us a Dec. 27, 2010, article from the conservative website CSNNews.com that looked at this question. The 111th Congress convened on Jan. 6, 2009, and exited on Dec. 22, 2010, a period in which the gross federal debt increased from $10.6 trillion to $13.9 trillion, a rise of $3.2 trillion. (There's an alternate measure of debt -- public debt -- that doesn't count the money that one part of the government lends to another part of the government, but the difference in the two figures is modest, so for simplicity, we'll stick with gross federal debt here.) Meanwhile, CNSNews tracked down a document showing that the gross federal debt reached $3.22 trillion in September 1990, a date that came during the 101st Congress. Thus the focus on the first 100 Congresses. The bottom line: If McCarthy had referred to debt rather than spending, he would have been correct. But he didn't, which is why the statement published in the Californian is incorrect. In the meantime, we'll add a few broader concerns with the relevance of McCarthy's comparison. • Inflation, economic growth and population. Since a dollar is worth far less today than it was in the early 1800s, you can't genuinely compare dollar amounts across time without making a mathematical adjustment. That's especially true when the time frame of the comparison ends in 1989, leaving off the 22 years most heavily influenced by cumulative inflation. Similarly, from year to year, the economy and population both tend to grow. It's only natural that as the size of the population grows and more money is available to spend, more money will be spent in an absolute sense. • How do you assign responsibility for spending increases? A sizable chunk of current spending was set on its course because of actions taken under President George W. Bush and the Republican Congress (such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit) -- not to mention programs passed under prior GOP presidents and Congresses. This doesn't mean Obama and the Democratic Congress bear no responsibility for the rise in spending. They just don't deserve all the blame. Ultimately, McCarthy's statement in the Californian was slightly less wrong than Cantor's statememt to Jon Stewart, since the "first 100 congresses" formulation is ultimately more supportable than "the last 200 years combined." Still, McCarthy made the same error that Cantor, his fellow Young Gun, did a couple months earlier -- confusing annual spending for accumulated debt. And that's enough to rule McCarthy's statement False.	None	Kevin McCarthy	None	None	None	2011-01-05T10:01:05	2011-01-02	['United_States_Congress', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-09707	"That 3.5 percent (increase in the third quarter GDP) came from two things — government spending on Cash for Clunkers — they just moved fourth-quarter auto sales into the third quarter — and the first-time home buyer thing."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/03/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-said-bump-gdp-due-cash-clunkers-and-/	While many hailed the news that the gross domestic product had increased 3.5 percent in the third quarter as a sign that the recession has ended, political commentator Rush Limbaugh was not one of them. On the Fox News Sunday program on Nov. 1, Limbaugh scoffed at a question about whether President Barack Obama had saved the country from "a financial abyss," as witnessed by reports about the bump in the GDP. "There wasn't any growth in the private sector," Limbaugh said. "That 3.5 percent came from two things — government spending on Cash for Clunkers — they just moved fourth-quarter auto sales into the third quarter — and the first-time home buyer thing." Limbaugh is referring to the Cash for Clunkers program that provided up to $4,500 to consumers to trade in their old cars for new ones, as well as to a government incentive program that provides an $8,000 tax credit to first-time home buyers. There's little debate that the Cash for Clunkers program gave a serious jolt to the car industry in the third quarter and contributed significantly to the GDP bump. In a statement before the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, J. Steven Landefeld, director of the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis, said consumer spending on durable goods — which increased by 22.3 percent — was driven by motor vehicle purchases and that Cash for Clunkers "accounted for most of this increase." But not all of it. Landefeld noted that "real spending on other durable goods, nondurable goods and services also increased in the third quarter," he said. There's no way of untangling exactly how much Cash for Clunkers or home-buying incentives directly affected the GDP, said Eugene Seskin, an economist with the Bureau of Economic Analysis. But statistics on the categories those programs would affect provide strong clues. In a breakdown of the contributors to the 3.5 percent increase in GDP, the Bureau of Economic Analysis attributed 1 percentage point to consumer purchases of motor vehicles and parts. In a broader sense, motor vehicles — including commercial purchase of vehicles and parts (not eligible for Cash for Clunkers) as well as vehicle imports and exports — raised real GDP growth in the third quarter by 1.7 percentage points, Landefeld said. But, he added, "Excluding the effects of motor vehicles, real GDP increased 1.9 percent in the third quarter after decreasing 0.9 percent in the second quarter." In other words, there was a lot more to the bump than just cars. Okay, what about the effect of the government incentives to new home buyers? According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, residential construction rose by 23.4 percent in the third quarter, the first increase in 15 quarters. That translated to 0.53 percentage points of the increase in GDP. But economists say it would be wrong to assign credit for that entirely to government incentives through tax credits to first-time home buyers. First of all, most of the homes purchased through the program were existing homes, not new construction. The new homes figure also includes such things as brokers commissions on sales of homes. So the correlation between that increase and the tax-credit incentives to new home buyers is more tenuous. Still, it appeared to have had some benefit. But for argument's sake, let's say all of the consumer purchases of new cars and parts (1 percentage point) and all of the new home purchases (0.53 percentage points) in the third quarter were tied to the programs Limbaugh mentioned. That still only accounts for less than half of the bump. If Limbaugh's bigger point was that the bump was largely due to government intervention, he's on more solid ground. In fact, it's a talking point from the White House defending the effectiveness of the economic stimulus package championed by the president. The stimulus "contributed between 3 and 4 percentage points to real GDP growth in the third quarter," said Christina Romer, the chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers. "This suggests that in the absence of the Recovery Act, real GDP would have risen little, if at all, this past quarter," said Romer. Josh Bivens, an economist with the nonpartisan Economic Policy Institute, thinks Limbaugh missed the biggest drivers from government intervention: tax cuts, extended unemployment benefits and food stamps, and aid to states from the stimulus. By Bivens' back-of-the-envelope assessment, the stimulus accounted for about 2.5 percentage points of the increase. The truth in Limbaugh's statement, Bivens said, is that government intervention is driving the economy forward right now. In addition to the stimulus, the third quarter saw an increase in direct government spending, mostly on defense (adding 0.5 percentage points to the bump). "If not for the government intervention, the numbers would not be as strong right now," he said. "That's why we did it." Other economists say Limbaugh missed the mark when he began by saying the growth in the GDP was not in the private sector. While the government may have provided incentives with Cash for Clunkers, for example, consumers still bore the majority of the cost of new cars. So while the government may be acting as a catalyst, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, it's still private sector growth. Bottom line, Limbaugh dismissed the growth in the GDP as being simply from Cash for Clunkers and tax credits to first-time home buyers. Economists agree those programs, particularly Cash for Clunkers, contributed significantly to the bump. And it's certainly valid to caution that much, if not all, of the bump can be attributed to government intervention. But Limbaugh oversimplifies things when he dismisses the growth as tied solely to those two programs. By our math, even a generous reading of government data ties less than half of the growth in GDP to sectors of the economy those two programs may have influenced.

This math does not work, it is financially killing our city."	false	/illinois/statements/2018/apr/17/garry-mccarthy/chicago-gun-violence-really-killing-citys-bottom-l/	Garry McCarthy was Chicago Police Superintendent under Mayor Rahm Emanuel until getting fired as controversy engulfed the administration over the investigation into the 2014 videotaped police shooting death of teenager Laquan McDonald. Now McCarthy is trying to mount a comeback as a challenger to Emanuel in next year’s mayoral race, with the veteran cop leveraging his law enforcement bona fides to excoriate his old boss for not doing enough to tamp down on gun violence. After formally declaring his candidacy in March, McCarthy sought to tie gun violence in the city, which has soared in the years since he got the boot, to the difficult state of municipal finances. To that end, McCarthy’s campaign website made sweeping assertions: "Studies show that every murder costs our City a priceless life and approximately $5-8.6 million dollars. Each shooting costs approximately one million dollars.That means the 2016 shooting and murder rate in Chicago cost us about $9.6 BILLION DOLLARS, and that is not even including other crimes like rape, robbery etc.. [sic] However, it is worth noting that the entire City budget for 2018 is $8.6 billion dollars. This math does not work, it is financially killing our city." A lot of numbers are being tossed around in that statement, which the campaign somewhat altered after PolitiFact inquired about it. A McCarthy spokesman said the wording changes resulted from a revamp of the campaign website. But the gist of the claim still resides on the website, and the implication the campaign makes is striking: In dollars and cents alone, gun violence costs Chicago taxpayers more than they spend on everything else the city does. It is a claim that cries out for a closer look. The cost of gun violence in Chicago vs the cost of gun violence to Chicago Pricing the value of a human life or limb may seem a delicate, if not downright insensitive, endeavor. Yet it’s done with frequency. Actuaries apply the science of life expectancy to determine pension and insurance costs. Workers’ compensation experts estimate what an employee would otherwise have been able to earn if not impaired by an accident. Juries in civil lawsuits arising from wrongful death or injury claims are tasked with determining not only the value of a victim’s lost or diminished earning capacity but also compensation for suffering. So we asked McCarthy’s campaign to explain how it came up with the cost figures it cited. A spokesman said the raw material for the calculation largely depended on an analysis conducted by Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, a Maryland-based nonprofit research organization focused on public health issues. McCarthy also referenced Miller’s research into the topic in 2013 while still in charge of the Chicago Police Department to argue that it was cheaper for city taxpayers to pay significant overtime for officers than have to bear the cost of crime that would occur if fewer cops were on patrol. Contacted by Politifact, Miller, an internationally-recognized safety economist, said the McCarthy campaign’s use of his data was badly flawed. "I think they confused cost to the citizens with cost to the government," Miller said in an email exchange. Miller’s research does peg the average cost of an individual murder in the millions of dollars, as McCarthy claimed. But Miller explained that his calculations factored in not just costs borne by government but also by victims along with their relatives and employers. In short, Miller is measuring the social cost of gun violence, not the direct cost to taxpayers. In a follow-up phone interview, Miller said he did attempt to isolate government expenses, but the totals he came up with are far smaller than those seized on by the McCarthy campaign: $450,000 on average for a firearm-related homicide and $53,000 for a shooting-related injury. And those numbers come with a cautionary note. Miller’s yardstick measures costs borne at all levels of government, not just the city. For Chicago specifically, Miller estimated the costs to taxpayers of gun violence in 2012--the last year for which he had city-level data, but a year in which McCarthy still ran the police--at $213 million. And those costs were likewise paid across all levels of government, as well as being spread across multiple jurisdictions, including the city, courts, prosecutors, hospitals and more. Not cheap by any means, but a far cry from the nearly $10 billion figure the McCarthy campaign claims on its website. The difference lies in far more sweeping, yet harder to quantify indirect costs of violence that Miller nonetheless attempted to total. They range from wages a victim otherwise could have earned to workplace disruption and "the financial value of the pain, suffering, and fear that accompany a death or injury," as described in a report Miller published in 2015 with Mother Jones. Miller said the McCarthy campaign was mischaracterizing his findings on its website by suggesting Chicago taxpayers were directly on the hook for millions of dollars every time a murder takes place in the city. "It’s not clearly stating what the numbers say and mean," Miller said of the McCarthy campaign claim. We asked the campaign why it appeared to mix apples and oranges, and a spokesman responded by email with a statement that avoided the question entirely. Our ruling In his attempts to brand Emanuel as a failed mayor whose inability to stamp out crime has led Chicago down the path to financial ruin, McCarthy claimed studies on gun violence support his argument that city taxpayers bear an enormous cost for murders and shootings. Studies show "the 2016 shooting and murder rate in Chicago cost us about $9.6 BILLION DOLLARS" and "the entire City budget for 2018 is $8.6 billion dollars. This math does not work, it is financially killing our city," his campaign website read. But the researcher who produced the findings cited by the McCarthy campaign says it misinterpreted his conclusions, which attempted to put a price tag on the total societal costs of firearm homicides and shootings--not just the still significant, but much smaller, costs to city government. McCarthy’s campaign badly misfires in its claim on the costs of gun violence to Chicago taxpayers. It is undoubtedly both a serious and costly problem, but in misinterpreting the very data it relies on the bolster its case, the campaign’s claim earns a credibility rating of False.

pomt-03373	Says a growing number of extremely premature babies survive into healthy childhood.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/jul/11/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-more-and-more-extremely-premature-/	Gov. Rick Perry spoke up for restricting abortions earlier in pregnancy by saying that extremely premature births increasingly result in healthy children. To Democratic opposition and a sustained uproar in the Texas Senate gallery, a proposal intended to tighten the regulation of abortion in Texas perished at the end of the session that ran through June 25. Perry reacted by calling a fresh special session before telling the National Right to Life Convention in a June 27, 2013, speech: "We will ban abortion after 20 weeks" of pregnancy. "And you think about it," Perry said, "it makes sense considering the growing number of healthy, happy children who are born prematurely at the same early gestation that our laws allow abortion." Current law Texas currently restricts abortions in the third trimester of pregnancies, which starts 26 weeks after a woman’s last menstrual period, as defined in state rules. This yardstick--time since the last period--is also about two weeks longer than the length of a pregnancy, meaning the time after the egg has been fertilized. This distinction bears on the Texas debate because the proposal backed by Republicans including Perry would shorten the period during which most abortions would be permitted by four weeks. So, we took Perry’s speech statement as referring to infants born in those same four weeks, the 20th through 23rd week of pregnancy, though Perry spokesman Rich Parsons said by telephone that this was an injection of context on our part that didn’t accurately reflect the governor’s remark. "That’s a lie," he said. Nationally, very few babies are born in the weeks targeted by the legislation. In 2010, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, less than 1 percent of the nearly 4 million U.S. births occurred before even 28 weeks of gestation. Still, do more and more of such extremely premature infants survive to healthy childhoods, as Perry said? By email, Perry spokesman Josh Havens offered studies as backup for the claim, but also said, "The point the governor is making is that babies born prior to the third trimester can survive outside the womb." That’s so, we learned from research and interviews with experts, though survival rates are low for such babies and whether more survivors reach healthy childhoods is murky. We hunted for relevant research. Governor's backup Havens pointed out an article in the April 2012 issue issue of Obstetrics and Gynecology, titled "Improving Survival of Extremely Preterm Infants Born Between 22 and 25 Weeks of Gestation." The article, based on research led by a University of Iowa physician, reviewed the births of 237 babies born without major congenital anomalies after 22 to 25 weeks of gestation from 2000 through 2009 and concluded that more survived than would have been expected based on predicted survival rates based on outcomes of a national study from 1998 to 2003. The Iowa study said: "These findings reflect improvement in survival" of such babies "whose parents elected aggressive treatment." The study did not look into how the babies fared into childhood. Havens also noted a study described in the May 1, 2013, Journal of the American Medical Association. According to an online summary, researchers in Sweden assessed 456 children born before 27 weeks of gestation from 2004 through 2007 and concluded, after check-ups at about 30 months of life, that about three in four of the survivors had mild or no disabilities, 16 percent had moderate disabilities and 11 percent had severe disabilities. Babies born the earliest were worst off, the summary says. More than half the children born at 23 weeks of gestation or earlier had moderate or severe overall disabilities at 30 months as did 60 percent of those children born at 22 weeks of gestation or earlier. The summary does not say whether the prevalence of disabilities at 30 months was an improvement compared to extremely premature babies born in earlier years. Other analyses At the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, spokeswoman Karen Hunter suggested we seek research insights from the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, which opposes the Texas measure. By email, a college spokesman, Gregory Phillips, pointed out its physician guidelines, issued in September 2002 and reaffirmed in 2012. The guidelines state that survival rates for newborns born at the "threshold of viability," defined as 25 or fewer weeks of gestation, improved in the early 1990s largely thanks to medical steps taken after those births, though extreme preemies still faced long odds. A chart in the guidelines, based on a study of more than 4,600 such babies born in centers around the country in 1995 and 1996, indicates no survivors among a dozen babies born after 21 weeks of gestation; a 21 percent survival rate among babies born after 22 weeks; and a 30 percent survival rate among babies born after 23 weeks. Phillips also suggested we contact the American Academy of Pediatrics, which put us in touch with Kristi Watterberg, a University of New Mexico professor and pediatrician who chairs the academy’s Committee on Fetus and Newborn. By email and telephone, Watterberg agreed that survival rates of extremely premature babies have improved, thanks in large part to post-birth medical interventions and pre-birth steroid treatments, which especially help tiny lungs mature, she said.. However, Watterberg said, it remains questionable whether more extremely premature babies grow into healthy children. "Survival has increased for those babies on the cusp of viability," Watterberg said. "Whether their short- or long-term outcomes have improved is much less clear. We need studies of babies at school age, as adolescents and as adults." Watterberg said the Iowa study offered by Perry’s office included too few babies — only 16 infants were born before 24 weeks of pregnancy — to reach broad conclusions. A study would need to consider a couple hundred like-timed births to begin to support reasonable comparisons and conclusions, she said. "You cannot make any pronouncements based on that," she said. Watterberg said by email: "It's very difficult to get a good handle on long-term outcomes for large populations of extremely preterm infants - there aren't that many at 22 - 23 weeks, they have a high mortality rate, and follow-up studies are limited. There is a wide variability in reported outcomes" as well, she said. Watterberg singled out several other studies and our review of them led us to mention of another: —A study published by BMJ in December 2012 compared short-term survival rates of extremely premature babies born in 2006 to similar babies born in 1995. In 2006, more than 1,100 of about 3,100 such babies survived to leave the hospital, the authors wrote. Still, less than half of the babies born in 2006 before 25 weeks of gestation survived, according to the study, compared to 66 percent or more of babies born at 25 weeks or later. Also, the authors wrote, "the pattern of major neonatal morbidity," meaning major conditions, remained unchanged from 1995. Serious conditions included lung disease, brain injury and retinopathy (a disease that can lead to loss of vision). "These observations reflect an important increase in the number of preterm survivors at risk of later health problems," the authors wrote. A Dec. 3, 2012, press release issued with the BMJ-published study said: "These results suggest that the total number of children in the community with lifelong health problems as a result of extremely preterm birth will rise, and represents an important increase in workload for health, educational, and social services, they conclude." —The same release said another study published by BMJ compared neurological and developmental outcomes at age 3 in babies born before 27 weeks of gestation in 2006 with babies born between 22 and 25 weeks in 1995. For such babies born in 2006, severe disability at age 3 years increased as gestation shortened, from 20 percent of survivors at 26 weeks’ gestation to 45 percent at 23 weeks, according to the release, with the most common impairment being developmental or cognitive function. Between 1995 and 2006, the "proportion of survivors with severe disability at 3 years was unchanged," the press release said. "However, an estimated 11% more babies born between 22 and 25 weeks survived without disability." Fewer of the extremely premature babies had disabilities, but the same proportion had severe impairments in 2006 as in 1995, the release said. The authors also stressed that these findings be interpreted with caution, with additional research about the children as they age being critical before deciding there have been big changes in the frequency of disabilities. —A study posted online in August 2010 in Pediatrics, the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics, reviewed outcomes for more than 9,500 very small infants born from 22 weeks through 28 weeks of gestation from 2003 through 2007. Upshot: More than half of infants born at 24 weeks of gestation or later survived, the study said, though many infants had major conditions as well. "During the 5-year study period," the authors wrote, "there was no substantial improvement in rates of survival to discharge for extremely low gestation infants.... However, each additional week of" gestation age (GA) "at birth had substantial survival advantage; the most marked changes were between GAs of 22 and 25 weeks, with survival rates increasing from 6% to 72%. Furthermore, rates of survival to discharge without major" diseases "increased dramatically between 22 and 25 weeks, with continued steady improvement for each additional week of gestation." — A study published in April 2008 in the New England Journal of Medicine looked at outcome at 18 to 22 months for nearly 4,200 infants born at 22 to 25 weeks’ gestation, with a focus on whether intensive care made a difference. At 18 months, 61 percent had died or had severe impairments, the authors wrote, counting 98 percent of infants born at 22 weeks, 84 percent of infants born at 23 weeks; 57 percent at 24 weeks; and 38 percent at 25 weeks. Federal institute Separately, we reached out to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, which has a website enabling anyone to calculate survival rates of very young babies by inputting the length of pregnancy and other factors. Robert Bock, an institute spokesman, said by email its neonatal researchers consider a study steered by a Brown University pediatrician, Bonnie E. Stephens, to be the best reference on longer-term outcomes for babies born extremely early. The study, published in June 2009 in the journal Pediatric Clinics of North America, states that survival rates of infants born "at the limits of viability," 22 to 25 weeks of gestation, "continued to improve" through the 1990s. However, the study says, such improvements over the previous 20 years "have not been accompanied by proportional reductions" in disabilities among such babies. The study says, in fact, that there is "increasing evidence of adverse outcomes into school age and adolescence," a conclusion the authors trace to about 25 other studies. Our ruling Perry said more and more extremely premature babies grow into healthy childhoods. We found research indicating that more extreme preemies -- some born during the period when abortion is permitted -- make it home from the hospital and live into early childhood. But evidence is lacking to prove the children's long-term health; in fact, we found that many of these children face major health challenges. We rate Perry's statement, which lacked this clarification, as Mostly True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2013-07-11T06:00:00	2013-06-27	['None']

"Obama’s Private ‘security’ Company Sets Up Massive Camps Outside 3 Major Cities," said the headline of an April 14 post on newsfeedusa.us. "Barack Obama has decided to spend his retirement years planning a coup against his own government," the post said. "In the past two weeks, after receiving an executive declaration issued by his own hand before Trump took office, Obama has built a $10 billion military that he calls a ‘security company.’ " It’s unclear what the post meant by saying Obama received "an executive declaration issued by his own hand before Trump took office." But the rest of the post doesn’t add up, either. Newsfeedusa.us claims Obama’s alleged company is called NOS United, with NOS standing for "Novus Ordo Seclorum," or New World Order. (Novus Ordo Seclorum is inscribed in the $1 bill. The U.S. State Department translates the Latin text to "A new order of the ages.") "It’s pretty clear what the agenda is of this traitor we knew was an American-hating globalist all along," the post claimed, adding that along with two islands due east of Virginia in international waters, there also are "massive complexes with billions in equipment and spying technology outside of Washington DC, New York and Los Angeles." The post also claims Obama is holding "secret meetings" with bipartisan officials and diplomats from around the world "in a mansion that is a part of the old Washington tunnel system." That part of the story reminded us of another hoax claiming Obama was trying to take down President Donald Trump by establishing a shadow government outside the White House. That Pants on Fire claim also said Obama held secret meetings with world leaders. We reached out to Newsfeed USA’s Facebook account for evidence backing its claim. A reply said "Google." But there’s no credible information backing Newsfeed USA’s story. If there was any merit to the claim, it would have been in national and international headlines of legitimate news sources.

pomt-14803	Says Thomas Jefferson helped "craft" the Constitution.	false	/virginia/statements/2015/nov/27/ben-carson/carson-falsely-says-thomas-jefferson-helped-craft-/	During a recent TV interview, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson was asked which Founding Father impressed him the most. "I’m particularly impressed with Thomas Jefferson, who seemed to have a very deep insight into the way people would react and tried to craft a constitution in a way that would control people’s natural tendencies and control the natural growth of government," Carson replied during a Nov. 22 broadcast on C-SPAN. Our ears perked up, because Jefferson was an ocean away from Philadelphia during the late spring and summer of 1787 when the Constitutional Convention met at Independence Hall. He was in Paris, serving as minister to France for the Confederation Congress. So did Jefferson really play a role in crafting the U.S. Constitution? Let’s take a look. Although Carson did not acknowledge Jefferson’s absence from the convention in the C-SPAN interview, he did note it in his recently published book "A More Perfect Union," which urges Americans to "reclaim our constitutional liberties." Ying Ma, a spokeswoman for Carson, backed the claim about Jefferson’s role in crafting the Constitution by pointing to a biography of the third president posted on the Library of Congress website. It says, "Although Thomas Jefferson was in France serving as United States minister when the federal constitution was written in 1787, he was able to influence the development of the federal government though his correspondence." We contacted four Jefferson historians, and they all disagreed with Carson’s statement and evidence. When it came to the drafting of the constitution, which was done under a cloak of secrecy, they say Jefferson was in the dark. "Jefferson didn’t know what was going on at all," said Joseph Ellis, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian who wrote "American Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson." Peter Onuf, a retired University of Virginia professor who specialized in Jefferson, wrote in an email, "Jefferson never ‘crafted’ a constitution (federal or state), nor did he have any influence over the secret proceedings at Philadelphia. Technically speaking, Jefferson was not a ‘founder’ at all, having been absent from the founding - but Carson is certainly not alone in according him that status." Jefferson was abroad from August 1784 through November 1789. He maintained steady correspondence with James Madison, who would become known as the "Father of the Constitution." Historians say Jefferson indirectly may have influenced Madison’s political thinking when, in 1785, he shipped to his friend almost 200 books from Paris on government, philosophy, religion and other subjects. Madison delved deeply into the books. But when it came to forming a government, Jefferson and Madison were miles apart in thought and distance. Jefferson opposed the creation of a strong central government; Madison supported it. Shortly after the Constitutional Convention began, Madison sent Jefferson a letter naming the delegates but withholding all other information. "In furnishing you with this list of names, I have exhausted all the means which I can make use of for gratifying your curiosity," Madison wrote in June 1787. "It was thought expedient in order to secure unbiassed (sic) discussion within doors, and to prevent misconceptions and misconstructions without, to establish some rules of caution which will for no short time restrain even a confidential communication of our proceedings." In October 1787 - a month after the convention had agreed on a constitution and adjourned - Madison wrote Jefferson a long letter detailing the accord that was being sent to states for ratification. Jefferson described himself as "neutral" on the constitution, according Dumas Malone’s 1951 book "Jefferson and the Rights of Man." Malone wrote that Jefferson was pleased by the way a bicameral Congress would be set up but, like many anti-federalists, was disappointed the document did not include a bill of rights. By the time Jefferson returned from Europe in 1789, all but one of the states had approved the Constitution - only Rhode Island was holding out - and a new nation had been born. Two months before his landing, Congress had approved the Bill of Rights, which would win the necessary ratification by two-thirds of the states in 1791. Our ruling Carson identified Jefferson as a craftsman of the U.S. Constitution - a frequently made mistake. Jefferson played many leading roles in history, including as author of the Declaration of Independence, president of the United States, and founder of the University of Virginia. But in the production of the Constitution, Jefferson didn’t even make a cameo appearance. He was in France during the entirety of the Constitutional Convention in 1787, shut out from the top-secret deliberations. When he returned to the U.S. in 1789, the Constitution had been ratified, a president was in office, and the 1st Congress was open for business. Historians with whom we spoke say Jefferson, at most, deserves a footnote at the end of the credits for sending books from abroad that may have influenced Madison’s thinking. So we rate Carson’s statement False.	None	Ben Carson	None	None	None	2015-11-27T10:06:25	2015-11-22	['None']

pomt-08702	"My supporters aren't special interest groups in Madison and Milwaukee."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/07/mark-neumann/mark-neumann-says-he-doesnt-receive-support-specia/	In his bid for governor, businessman Mark Neumann badly lags behind rival Republican Scott Walker in fundraising -- that is, if you don’t count the $2.7 million Neumann has lent his own campaign. In most scenarios, that would be considered a negative. But this is politics. In a recent radio spot, Neumann put a positive spin on the fundraising picture. "I didn't run for office for power," the ad says. "I ran because I'm afraid of what's happening in America. That experience taught me how dangerous a permanent class of career politicians can be..." The ad continues: "I've owned a business for 26 years. My family isn't in politics and my supporters aren't special interest groups in Madison and Milwaukee. Now's our chance. This is the election. Let's choose a governor who will fight for Wisconsin's forgotten middle class." We were struck by part of that statement. Is Mark Neumann free of big-city special interest group backing? We’ll define special interests broadly: cash support from political action committees (PACs) and "bundled" donations from "conduit" organizations. Bundling is when a corporation, trade group or political party collects individual donations, pools them and writes one big check in the group’s name to the candidate. In 1992, when Neumann first ran for Congress, he denounced PAC contributions. But he accepted them in subsequent races. He served two terms in the late 1990s, representing a district in southern Wisconsin. This time around, in the gubernatorial race, campaign spokesman Chris Lato said Neumann has not "actively pursued" PAC contributions. But the campaign isn’t turning such money away. Lato noted that in Neumann’s latest six-month finance report, covering the first half of 2010, there were no contributions from PACs. In that period, groups and corporations bundled less than $4,000 in donations from their members or employees for Neumann. If you go back a year -- to the time the campaign began -- the same pattern holds, according to campaign reports filed with the state Government Accountability Board. PAC cash: Neumann in 12 months reported getting not one single cash donation from a PAC, according to a PolitiFact Wisconsin review of state records. (The Wisconsin Dental Association PAC wrote him a $1,000 check, according to that group’s report. But PolitiFact Wisconsin couldn’t find a record of it in Neumann’s report. The campaign erred, Lato said.). Neumann’s statement in the radio ad aims to contrast him with the other two major candidates in the race, Republican Walker and Democrat Tom Barrett. And his rivals clearly have received more from political action committees -- typically labor unions and business interests. Reports show Walker received $190,000 from political action committees in the same 12-month period that Neumann got nothing or close to it. Barrett received far more, almost $500,000. Those are the PAC facts. Conduit cash: Now let's look at those "bundled" conduit donations. Neumann, a developer and homebuilder, has received some conduit money from Madison or Milwaukee-based groups. Neumann’s statewide conduit tally was $12,925 from 78 individual gifts bundled by a small number of conduits. Most of it came from Milwaukee and Madison and just three groups: Wisconsin builders, engineering companies and Realtors, according to our analysis of state records. Walker, meanwhile, took in $311,000 from 1,300 individual gifts bundled by conduits. PolitiFact’s analysis found. His conduit backers included health care companies, utilities, Realtors, law firms, a timber company, grocers, credit unions, chiropractors and builders. And Barrett was between the two: $214,000 from conduits. All Cash: This brings us to the final tally from PACs and conduits. Overall, Neumann has received 0.5 percent of his overall war chest from PACs and conduits, compared with 11.5 percent for Walker. Barrett’s campaign topped both Republicans, getting 22 percent from the special interest donations in the year. So, let’s look at the bottom line. Neumann’s statement says his supporters "aren’t special interest groups in Milwaukee and Madison." When it comes to measuring that support in dollars, Neumann has received some cash from such groups -- but so little it’s negligible, and his major opponents received far more. He may have wanted more himself, but it did not come his way. Thus, we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-05558	"Republicans in Congress refuse to list a single tax loophole they are willing to close."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/05/barack-obama/obama-says-republicans-congress-wont-name-one-tax/	President Barack Obama said a budget proposed by House Republicans lacked "a shred of credibility," especially when it came to tax cuts. Obama said their budget includes $4.6 trillion in lower taxes over the next 10 years, with no way to pay for them. "We’re told that these tax cuts will supposedly be paid for by closing loopholes and eliminating wasteful deductions," Obama said. "But the Republicans in Congress refuse to list a single tax loophole they are willing to close. Not one." We wanted to check Obama’s claim that Republicans in Congress "refuse to list a single tax loophole they are willing to close." But first, a little explanation about the House Republicans’ budget. Its top advocate is Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and chairman of the House Budget Committee. When it comes to taxes, the idea behind the House Republican budget is to keep overall tax revenues about where they would be under current policies. (We use the word "policies" on purpose -- keep in mind that under current law, today’s rates will expire at the end of the year and climb higher in 2013.) The House Republicans envision dramatically different income tax rates, though. Instead of today’s six income tax brackets -- 10, 15, 25, 28, 33 and 35 percent -- they would use just two brackets, 10 percent and 25 percent. Clearly, this would represent a big rate reduction for people in the top brackets. To keep tax revenues from taking a nosedive, House Republicans say they will end current exemptions and deductions, which both they and Obama refer to as "loopholes." In principle, it’s certainly possible to eliminate exemptions and lower tax rates while keeping tax revenues the same. It’s usually called "broadening the base", and it was part of the 2010 Simpson Bowles budget commission that Obama has praised, though he’s stopped short of endorsing the bipartisan commission’s recommendations. The point Obama made, though, was that the House Republicans haven’t said which exemptions they would end. Some of the largest exemptions are the most popular, such as tax exemptions on employer-provided health insurance, home mortgage interest and charitable donations, as well as special lower tax rates for income from investments, such as capital gains and dividends. We found Obama’s charge is largely correct -- the House budget doesn’t specify which exemptions it would end. The website of the House Budget Committee defers the matter to the House Ways and Means Committee, which is traditionally charged with tax legislation. Committee staff pointed us to this statement on the House Budget Committee website: "This budget calls for lowering tax rates and broadening the tax base. All corners of the tax code should be on the table. The House Ways and Means Committee, led by Chairman Dave Camp of Michigan, has held dozens of hearings over the past year examining how best to simplify the tax code while maximizing economic growth." That doesn't entirely let House Republicans off the hook, though. The Tax Policy Center, a respected independent think tank that specializes in analyzing the tax plans of politicians, found that without curtailing exemptions, the overall tax policies in the House Republicans’ budget would add $4.6 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade. "Ryan argues that eliminating or scaling back deductions, credits, and exclusions ought to be part of the GOP fiscal plan. But he won’t say how," said Howard Gleckman, writing for the center’s blog TaxVox. "Cuts in those tax preferences could make a big difference in determining who wins and who loses from the tax portion of his budget. But until House Republicans describe which they’d cut, there is no way to estimate what those base-broadeners would mean." Ryan himself was put on the spot recently by Fox News Sunday’s Chris Wallace. After some back and forth, Ryan suggested that he would favor targeting elimination of exemptions for higher income taxpayers. Here’s the exchange: Wallace: "All right. I understand, this is not your committee, it's the Ways and Means Committee. Can you tell me any (tax exemptions) that you're willing to say, do away with it?" Ryan: "What I would say on doing away with it, is who would we do away with it for. And what we're saying is the people who disproportionately use those, it's the top two tax rate payers use almost of those tax expenditures. We would limit these things to those higher income earners." Wallace: "Even things like the deduction for health insurance and pensions and home mortgage?" Ryan: "Yes, right. Instead of giving these write-offs to the people in the top tax bracket, take those tax shelters away. For every dollar that's parked in the tax shelter is taxed at zero. Take away the tax shelter, subject all of their income to taxation, you get more revenue, and we can lower everybody's tax rate in return. So, we're saying let's limit these kinds of deductions to the higher-income earners so that everybody can enjoy lower, flatter tax rates in return." Our ruling Obama said, "Republicans in Congress refuse to list a single tax loophole they are willing to close." House Republicans have said they want to handle tax changes through the Ways and Means Committee, and the plan’s top proponent, Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, said he would limit deductions and exemptions for people who report higher incomes. But without more details on eliminating exemptions, it’s impossible to know if the tax plan will substantially reduce tax revenues or not. It’s also not possible to know what all the implications are for taxpayers. We rate Obama’s statement True.

pomt-15036	"We have 650 people who move to Texas every day."	true	/texas/statements/2015/oct/01/glenn-hegar/glenn-hegar-says-650-people-giddyap-texas-every-da/	No mistake, Glenn Hegar is bullish on the Texas economy. The Republican state comptroller has launched a 27-city "Good for Texas" tour of the state that got our attention after he told Georgetown residents Texas remains a magnet for people otherwise stuck elsewhere. "We have 650 people who move to Texas every day who want to come here for that economic opportunity," Hegar said Sept. 10, 2015, according to Community Impact News. "That’s about half a million people who are moving to Texas every single year, and there is no better place to see that than in Central Texas and this region. The population increase has been phenomenal." We suspect Hegar's "about half a million" referred to the state's total annual population growth. But was he right about 650 people a day moving to the state? We’ve spotted flaws in Gone-To-Texas claims before. In June 2014, for instance, we pointed out that while 1,000 people a day may have moved to the state from July 2012 through June 2013, net migration — taking into account people who (unfathomably) left Texas — broke out to about 487 people a day, according to U.S. Census Bureau estimates. To our inquiry about Hegar’s figure, Lauren Willis, a spokeswoman for the comptroller’s office, told us by email that he relied on figures provided by IHS Inc., a Colorado-based consulting and information-services company. She also sent along a chart stating that according to IHS and the Census Bureau, Texas grew by 1,230 residents a day in 2014 with net migration, from other states and abroad, accounting for 666 of that average daily increase; Texas births outpacing deaths explained the rest of the growth. We sought elaboration from an IHS economist, Karl Kuykendall, who said the company reached its net migration figures for 2014 by starting from the bureau’s Current Population Survey estimates for net migration into Texas from July 2013 through June 2014, drawing on state population estimates released in December 2014, then reaching a calendar-year 2014 estimation of migration by assuming the state would grow at the same pace through December 2014. Kuykendall also guided us to the bureau’s population estimates of annual net migration to Texas, domestic and international, covering July-through-June periods from 2010-11 through 2013-14. From that, we confirmed the bureau’s latest estimates indicated Texas enjoyed a July 2013-July 2014 net gain of 84,637 residents through international migration and a net gain of 154,467 residents thanks to domestic migration. All told, that breaks out to total net migration to Texas of 655 people a day, very close to the 666 net migration estimated by IHS for all of 2014. Separately, an expert with the San Antonio-based Texas State Data Center, directed by Lloyd Potter, the state demographer, told us it previously calculated the same net migration of 655 people a day. By email, Rafael Emmanuel González said the center reached the figure by pairing data from the bureau’s 2014 Population Estimates of the Components of Population Change and information from the bureau’s 2013 State-to-State Migration Flows. So the best available numbers at the time Hegar spoke support what he said. González noted, though, that the bureau subsequently posted fresh figures based on its one-year American Community Survey perhaps indicating even greater net migration to Texas. The information wouldn’t have been available to Hegar when he spoke. Still, it’s worth mentioning that according to these ACS results, an estimated 538,572 Texas residents reported living in another state the year before and 217,392 had been living abroad. Subtract the 435,107 people estimated to have left Texas for another state in the meantime, and net migration to Texas amounts to 320,857 people--or 879 net new residents a day. That’s probably an overstatement to a degree; the bureau does not try to estimate the number of people who have left any state for another country, Bernstein said. We asked Potter about why migration estimates bounce around. He emailed: "From year to year, migration numbers do fluctuate, sometimes dramatically. Our economy was doing very well in 2013-14, bolstered by oil extraction, but was doing well even without. Next year, I’m anticipating migration will still be high, but we may see some muffling starting to show up with the reductions in extraction. Migration is usually and mostly driven by economic opportunity, thus, as our economy goes, we can expect migration to go." Our ruling Hegar said: "We have 650 people who move to Texas every day." Different government estimates suggest the state has lately been netting 655 or even around 880 new residents a day, depending on the estimate. It’s also worth noting Hegar could float a much bigger number by tallying solely people GTT, but that number would fail to account for people leaving the state. We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. CLARIFICATION, 4:40 p.m., Oct. 2, 2015: We added a clarifying sentence to this story after we recognized, post-publication, that Hegar's figure for people who move to Texas every day did not add up to about half a million new residents a year; we suspect he was referring in his speech to total annual population growth, taking into account Texas births outpacing deaths. This clarification did not affect our rating of his claim.	None	Glenn Hegar	None	None	None	2015-10-01T17:43:17	2015-09-10	['Texas']
pomt-13985	Says the United States has "treaties with apparently 69 countries where we are obligated to defend their borders. And these were treaties that were executive treaties, not authorized by Congress."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/09/gary-johnson/libertarian-candidate-gary-johnson-mischaracterize/	Is the United States really obligated to be the world’s bodyguard? Speaking on Meet the Press on June 5, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson said that the United States is already committed — without congressional approval — to protecting the borders of 69 other countries (about one-third of the world). "We've got treaties with apparently 69 countries where we are obligated to defend their borders. And these were treaties that were executive treaties, not authorized by Congress," Johnson said. Johnson’s claim itself isn’t new. He made the claim on CNN’s New Day on May 31 and Donald Trump tweeted the same claim May 29. Trump has also made the United States’ role protecting other countries a talking point this election, leaving open the possibility of disbanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization if other countries fail to contribute their fair share. We wanted to look closer into Johnson’s claim about the United States’ current obligations to other nations. The statement warrants examination on multiple grounds: 1. The number of countries involved through formal treaties; 2. Whether Congress had a say in the treaties; 3. Are these provisions actually used? We reached out to the Johnson campaign but did not get a response back. United States treaties A paper published by Tufts University professor Michael Beckley in 2015, The Myth of Entangling Alliances, contains Johnson’s 69-country figure. In his analysis, Beckley counts the Organization of American States, NATO and various other treaties as collective defense arrangements. We found that other sources include fewer countries. The State Department only counts 54. We analyzed all of the treaties Beckley cites and compared it to U.S. Department of State records. The Charter of The Organization of American States created the OAS — an organization that aims for regional solidarity in the Americas — and was approved by the Senate in 1951. The OAS Charter treaty pledges the United States to support 33 countries through collective security provisions in Articles 28 and 29, according to Beckley. Those countries include — Antigua & Barbuda, Argentina, the Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Grenada, Guatemala, Guyana, Haití, Honduras, Jamaica, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Perú, St. Kitts & Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent, Suriname, Trinidad & Tobago, Uruguay and Venezuela. Beckley’s analysis also includes 28 countries as part of NATO, which was created by the North Atlantic Treaty and approved by the Senate on July 21, 1949. Article V of the NAT provides for collective defense. In that list, Beckley includes — Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, France, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Turkey, United Kingdom, West Germany and Germany. Those two agreements count for 61 of the 69 countries Johnson cited. Both were approved by the Senate, but more on that later. Next, Beckley cites the Australia, New Zealand, United States Security Treaty of 1951, which was also approved by the Senate on March 20, 1952. That makes countries 62 and 63. Beckley also includes Japan as country 64 through a bilateral U.S.-Japan treaty (approved by the Senate on March 20, 1952), South Korea (65) through a mutual defense treaty (approved by the Senate on January 26, 1954), and the Philippines (66) through a mutual defense treaty (approved by the Senate on March 20, 1952). He also cites a bilateral defense agreement with Pakistan (67) on March 5, 1959. According to Dennis Kux in his book on U.S.-Pakistan relations, this was an "executive agreement" — a different type of treaty not sent to the Senate for approval. Pakistan has since accused the United States of not honoring the agreement, Kux wrote. Israel (68) and Taiwan (69) are also on Beckley’s list. He includes Israel because he claims the United States has a "de facto" agreement to defend it (not a formal treaty). The Taiwan Relations Act, passed by Congress in 1979, requires the United States to provide defense assistance to Taiwan. Adding all of these up gets to the 69 figure Johnson used on Meet The Press. The official Department of State website, however, has a different number of collective defense arrangements — only 54 countries. The State Department excludes West Germany, Pakistan, Israel and Taiwan from Beckley’s list and also adds Thailand due to the Southeast Asia Collective Defense Treaty — which created the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and was approved by the Senate on Feb. 1, 1955. The main difference, however, is that the State Department does not include all the countries in the OAS Charter. Rather, it only includes members of the affiliated Inter-American Treaty of International Assistance (Rio Treaty), a collective defense treaty with fewer members than the OAS Charter. Julian Ku, Maurice A. Deane distinguished professor of constitutional law at Hofstra University, agreed with the State Department’s assessment. Ku did note, however, that these determinations have not been actively discussed since the Cuban Missile Crisis in the 1960s. "The OAS Charter is not what we would call a mutual defense treaty," he said. "It is not a treaty obligation to defend every member of the OAS Charter." Beckley told PolitiFact he used all the OAS countries primarily for methodological reasons. There’s another wrinkle to this count. Some countries the State Department included as part of the Rio Treaty — Bolivia, Ecuador, Nicaragua and Venezuela — have recently denounced the treaty. Cuba has also announced it will not be rejoining the OAS, making its status within the Rio Treaty unclear. Lastly, SEATO — containing Thailand — disbanded in 1977. Add it all up and what do you get? It’s reasonable to say the United States has obligations to defend anywhere from around 48 countries to close to 70. Did Congress have a say? The second part of Johnson’s claim — that all were "executive treaties" without congressional approval — does not stand up to scrutiny. The Senate approved all of the pertinent treaties through its "Advice and Consent" procedure under Article II, section 2 of the Constitution (with the exception of the Pakistan 1959 agreement). Michael Ramsey, an international law professor at the University of San Diego, told PolitiFact that Johnson could be considered "technically correct" because the House of Representatives does not consider the issue. Nonetheless, Ramsey explained, Johnson’s claim is misleading because nothing "improper" was done. "The Constitution expressly provides that treaties are to be approved by two-thirds of the Senate (and not the House)," he wrote. "Thus there is nothing improper occurring here, and it is not the case that these agreements are being done on executive authority alone." Beckley told PolitiFact that many treaties require action consistent with each nation’s constitution, such that Congress would still have a say before an actual intervention. Relevance Johnson’s phrasing of "defend their borders" could be misleading as well, making it seem that the United States has a more general and ongoing policy than it does. Just how strong an "obligation" the United States has is also questionable, experts said. The treaties in question only require other member states to get involved if one country is attacked, which is rare. "Look at those countries. Very few are under threat of attack," wrote Douglas Gibler, a professor of political science at the University of Alabama, in an email. In addition, Beckley noted that the treaties do not require the United States to take immediate action and that the treaties often do not specify what such action would look like. The Rio Treaty, for example, provides "no State shall be required to use armed force without its consent." "The OAS Charter doesn’t say the U.S. has to go in guns blazing to defend its allies to the death everytime someone comes under attack," Beckley said. "The language is super vague with a lot of loopholes in it, so when Johnson says that the U.S. has an ironclad obligation to protect the country that’s more than a bit of a stretch." Ku noted as well that neither the OAS Treaty or the Rio Treaty have been actively invoked since the 1960s. Our ruling Gary Johnson claimed that the United States is obligated to "defend the borders" of 69 countries by treaties, and that Congress did not have a say in the matter. Johnson’s reference to "69 countries" is in the ballpark. However, he fails to include in his statement the nuance regarding how much action the United States would actually be compelled to take under these treaties, according to experts. Johnson is also wrong to say that Congress had not considered any of these treaties, because the Senate considered all but one pursuant to its constitutional powers.

pomt-02247	The insurance risk corridors aren't going broke like Republicans predicted.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/13/james-carville/carville-insurance-risk-corridors-arent-going-brok/	It will be some time before we know how the Affordable Care Act actually works in practice. The initial enrollment period has ended more or less. Now we wait to see how many people pay their premiums, how much the insurance companies pay out in claims and tally what the expansion of Medicaid did for the working poor. Yet partisans on both sides seem unable to resist the temptation to declare success or failure based on what we know today. Democratic strategist James Carville succumbed to excessive exuberance during an exchange on ABC’s This Week with conservative radio show host Laura Ingraham. Carville ribbed Ingraham over the doom and gloom predictions of Republicans. "Y’all said it would collapse," he said. "You said no one would sign up. You said it would cost part-time jobs." And then he added, "You said the risk corridors were going to go broke. None of it has happened. Get over it. It’s working." That last point touches a nerve in certain GOP quarters. Leading voices like Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and Bill Kristol, editor of the conservative Weekly Standard, have been waving a red flag, warning that Obamacare has a built-in bailout for health insurance companies. Part of that alleged bailout comes in the shape of risk corridors. For this fact-check, we’ll assess whether the insurance risk corridors aren't going broke as Republicans predicted. It’s pretty technical and obscure but here’s what the fuss is about. Managing carrier jitters The Affordable Care Act does a complete number on the insurance game as Americans know it, at least in the individual and small group markets. Instead of companies making a profit through selling policies to the healthy and avoiding the ill, the law aims to pull carriers into a world where they insure everyone and compete based on efficiency and value. We’re not saying that will necessarily happen, but that’s the goal. In sickness and health and everything in between, that’s the population the insurers must work with. The problem is, if you are an insurance company, how do you decide how much to charge in such a different landscape? Until you have a few years to see who you’re insuring and how much health care they use, the uncertainty is way beyond your comfort zone. Enter the government and a few tricks to spread both possible losses and windfall profits among insurance companies and between all insurance companies and the government. One of those devices is called risk corridors. Risk corridors are a temporary program that cover the first three years of the health care law -- 2014-16. Here’s how it works. The government sets financial benchmarks for each plan offered on the marketplace. As long as insurers come close to that benchmark, nothing happens. If an insurer overperforms by up to 3 percent, they can keep the extra revenue. If they underperform by up to 3 percent, they are forced to absorb those additional costs. When the gaps get wider, however, money starts changing hands. If insurers beat their benchmark by 3-8 percent, they have to split that extra revenue with the federal government. If insurers beat the mark by more than 8 percent, the government receives 80 percent of that additional money. On the flip side, when insurers fail to meet their benchmarks, the government helps absorb those costs. If insurers underperform by 3-8 percent, the government will cover half the extra cost. The government covers 80 percent of losses bigger than that. A matter of timing As you probably can guess, nothing actually happens until the insurance companies wrap up the year. They have to tally up the premiums they collected and compare those to the claims they paid out. The very earliest they could do that would be January 2015, but they have until the end of July 2015 to submit their data to Washington. Melinda Buntin chairs the Department of Health Policy at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. Buntins said it’s too early to draw any conclusions. "With people just enrolling now, we don’t know how the risk corridors will play out," Buntin said. A Carville assistant told us Carville relied on the latest numbers from the government’s nonpartisan bean counters, the Congressional Budget Office. In February, the CBO predicted that the total package of risk adjustment programs (that includes the corridors and two other programs) will generate revenue for the government. CBO analysts think Washington will gain about $8 billion over the three years the programs are active. However, while those projections undercut the fears expressed by people like Rubio and Kristol, they remain just that -- projections. Carville was drawing real-world conclusions in his remarks. Our ruling Carville said that Republican fears of big payouts under the risk corridors have not come to pass. Carville was claiming victory before any numbers are in. We won’t know for sure whether government gained, lost or broke even with the risk corridors until 2014 is over. The CBO projections suggest little reason for concern. If they had gone the other way, that would undermine Carville’s case, but they are not the final proof. Carville’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-04779	"His new running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a plan that would let Governor Romney pay less than 1 percent in taxes each year."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/aug/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-paul-ryan-tax-plan-would-have-el/	By his own admission, Mitt Romney pays a lower tax rate than many Americans. But, President Barack Obama says Romney’s rate would be far lower under a plan proposed by the presumptive Republican nominee’s new running mate. Obama took aim at Romney and his running mate, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, last week in a speech at Windham High School in New Hampshire. "His new running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a plan that would let Governor Romney pay less than 1 percent in taxes each year," Obama told the cheering crowd during the August 18 speech. "And here’s the kicker, he expects you to pick up the tab." Much has been made of Romney’s taxes in recent months, as the millionaire former Massachusetts governor has declined to release most of his returns. But saying he would pay next to nothing in taxes each year under Ryan’s plan is a new one. We decided to crunch the numbers. Over eight terms in Congress, Ryan has introduced a number of budget plans with a range of tax reforms. So, to figure out which plan the president was referring to, we approached the Obama campaign, which pointed us to Ryan’s first proposal, A Roadmap for America’s Future. Ryan first introduced this plan in 2010, before he became chairman of the House Budget Committee. He proposed at the time to do away with taxes on interest, dividends and long-term capital gains, among other reforms. The plan stalled in committee and never reached the House floor for a vote. And Ryan and other House Republicans moved away from the tenets of the original plan with their later budget proposals, which included taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains. ABC News noted recently that Romney himself criticized a similar proposal during a January debate. The plan, introduced by Republican challenger and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, also proposed to do away with capital gains taxes. "Under that plan, I'd have paid no taxes in the last two years," Romney told Gingrich, according to the debate transcript. But, several major publications, along with Obama, place the number at closer to 1 percent. Both Roll Call and the Atlantic have published stories in recent weeks reporting Ryan’s plan would have left Romney paying a tax rate of 1 percent or less. Each story based its calculations on Romney’s 2010 tax return-- the most recent one released. In his 2010 return, Romney reported $21.6 million in income. But, of that total, none of it came from wages or salary, according to federal tax documents. Instead, most of Romney’s income came from capital gains ($12.5 million), dividends ($4.9 million), and taxable interest ($3.3 million), among other sources that would no longer be taxed under Ryan’s plan. On top of those figures, the Roadmap plan proposed to eliminate the Alternative Minimum Tax, on which Romney paid nearly $233,000 in 2010, and it would have cut the top marginal tax rate from 35 to 25 percent on income over $100,000. This would have reduced the taxes Romney paid that year on his business income, about $594,000, much of which came from book and speaking fees. In his Roll Call story, Steven T. Dennis didn’t identify an exact tax rate, but he reported that these new deductions would amount to 95 percent of Romney’s income that would no longer be taxed under Ryan’s plan. "It's not certain exactly how low Romney's tax bill would go, but his income from other sources amounts to about $1 million," Dennis wrote in the Aug. 11 story. "Romney's total tax bill would have dropped from the $3 million that he paid to a few hundred thousand dollars if Ryan's plan had been in effect." In his Atlantic piece, reporter Matthew O’Brien takes his calculations a step further, totaling the amount Romney would have paid under the Ryan plan at just north of $175,000. That number reflects the elimination of interest, dividends and capital gain taxes, as well as the Alternative Minimum tax, O’Brien wrote in an email to PolitiFact. It considers the lower top marginal rate proposed under the plan, and it maintains the self-employment taxes that Romney paid in 2010, he wrote. "Now, Romney would still owe self-employment taxes on his author and speaking fees, but that only amounts to $29,151," O’Brien wrote in the Atlantic article. "Add it all up, and Romney would have paid $177,650 out of a taxable income of $21,661,344, for a cool effective rate of 0.82 percent." Tax analysts across the country haven’t repeated O’Brien’s math exactly, but, looking at Ryan’s plan, they feel the numbers are right on. "The rough calculation by Matt O’Brien strikes me as reasonable. … The bottom line is that given that we know the vast majority of Gov. Romney’s income falls into the categories of interest, dividends, and capital gains, he would no doubt pay a far lower rate …," said Joseph Rosenberg, a research analyst with the Tax Policy Center, in an email. The policy center is a joint venture between the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. "Very little of (Romney’s) income is from ordinary working or business income," added Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at center. "Given the amount of itemized deductions he had, at least on the 2010 return, that would wipe out close to all of them. … When you’re Mitt Romney, that’s a very good deal." Our ruling: It’s important to note that Ryan’s most recent budget proposal does not eliminate taxes on interest, dividends and long-term capital gains. Obama is correct, however, to suggest that Ryan at one point put forward a plan that would have eliminated them. It’s hard to say how that budget proposal would have affected Romney’s tax rate for "each year." Romney hasn’t released his tax returns before 2010, and his 2011 documents aren’t finalized yet. But, looking at the snapshot of his 2010 return, it’s safe to say his tax rate would have taken a nose dive. More than $20 million of Romney's $21.6 million income that year came from interest, dividends and capital gains -- items that would no longer be taxed under Ryan’s plan. Factor in a reduction in the top marginal tax rate and the elimination of the Alternative Minimum Tax, and Romney’s tax rate would have fallen dramatically, almost surely reaching below 1 percent, according to media reports and tax analyses.

pomt-06184	Richard Cordray’s nomination to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau marks the first time in Senate history "that a political party has blocked a nomination of someone because they didn't like the construction of the agency."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/dec/12/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-says-republicans-refusal-confirm/	The U.S. Senate on Dec. 8 failed to confirm Richard Cordray to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, with Republicans successfully blocking confirmation by using a procedural measure. It wasn’t that the GOP disliked Cordray, Ohio’s attorney general until his election defeat in 2010. Rather, Republican senators said they would not support any nominee to the new agency unless its very structure was changed. They wanted, among other things, a five-member board to oversee the agency rather than a single director. And they wanted Congress to approve the agency’s budget rather than have it set by the Federal Reserve. This would have required changing the 2010 financial reform law, known as Dodd-Frank, that created the agency -- or as U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown put it, it would require a change to the construction of the agency Cordray was nominated to direct. As a date for a vote approached, Brown, an Ohio Democrat, said several times that the Republicans’ refusal was unprecedented. In a Senate Banking subcommittee hearing on Dec. 7, the day before the vote, Brown said, "I probably know Richard Cordray better than any member of the Senate. I knew him when he was a state representative and county treasurer and state treasurer and attorney general and have continued to work with him. And there's no question of his qualification. And some time ago I asked the Senate historian has this ever happened, that a political party has blocked a nomination of someone because they didn't like the construction of the agency? And he said, no, it's never happened." The next day, shortly before the Senate failed to get enough votes to cut off debate and confirm the nominee, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Democrat of Nevada, said the same thing: "This is the first time in Senate history a party has blocked a qualified candidate solely because they disagree with the existence of the agency that's being created by law." This struck PolitiFact Ohio as worth checking, for the current record and as a useful piece of political trivia. We asked Brown’s communications director, Meghan Dubyak, for her boss’s source, and she shared with us language from email that Brown’s chief of staff, Mark Powden, received from Senate Historian Donald A. Ritchie. We followed up by asking Ritchie for the original. Ritchie wrote us back, and his short answer was, "We searched through past cases and could not find anything that fit the current circumstance." Ritchie also provided the email that he exchanged with Brown’s office. It began when Powden contacted the historian and asked if he knew of a similar case of blanket objection to any nominee unless the agency itself was changed. Here is Ritchie’s answer, written on July 25, 2011, to Brown’s top aide: "I’ve looked through our files and contacted the Senate Library, but have not found anything comparable. There were instances in the 19th Century -- during the John Tyler and Andrew Johnson administrations -- when the Senate defeated some of the president's most prominent nominations (including three times rejecting Tyler's nominee for Secretary of the Treasury). Those instances involved major disagreements between Congress and the president over policy (Tyler vetoed the main provisions of the Whig party's agenda, and Johnson and Congress fell out over Reconstruction policy), but they did not involve a blanket blocking of nominees to a particular agency." Ritchie sent that email to Brown’s office at 12:52 p.m. Several hours later, he followed up with another email to Brown’s chief of staff: "Mark, the Senate Library has been hunting for precedents, and found the attached controversy over the Legal Services Corporation in the 1980s that involved a letter signed by a majority of senators against three of the president's nominees. The issue there was whether the nominees would support the spirit of the law, rather than requesting that the law be rewritten, so it's not exactly the same." This was in reference to a period in 1982 when the White House tried to weaken the Legal Services Corporation by nominating board members with conservative views of how far the government should extend its hand. The Legal Services Corporation helps pay for civil lawyers to serve the poor, and President Ronald Reagan and a bipartisan majority in the Senate were at odds over three of Reagan’s most conservative nominees, according to "Congress and the Nation," a historical volume. Jousting over Reagan’s nominees continued for several years, but as Ritchie said, the issue was whether the nominees would support the spirit of the law. To better understand this distinction, it’s important to know that in the case of Cordray, 44 of the Senate’s 46 Republicans made clear in a letter before the Ohioan was even nominated that they would not accept any nominee unless the brand-new agency’s structure was changed. Theirs was a blanket blockade. Was their goal to weaken the agency? Brown and other Democrats say so. That, too, was the goal of Reagan with the Legal Services Corporation. But there are two differences between the Reagan matter and the current case. The Senate in the 1980s was not trying to use the confirmation process to change the architecture of the agency. Rather, Reagan was trying to use his appointments to change how aggressively or weakly the agency did its job. The agency, established in 1974, was already operating. The other difference? Reagan, the president, was the one interested in slowing down the agency. The Senate, on the other hand, wanted the agency to keep operating as usual. Cordray’s case is the opposite. President Barack Obama supported the agency’s creation and wants it to get to work. But under the Dodd-Frank legislation it cannot write and enforce rules affecting payday lenders, private student loan providers, debt collectors, non-bank mortgage servicers or credit agencies until it has a director. Senate Republicans say they will not confirm any director unless the agency’s oversight structure is changed. Lacking a majority, they failed to win those changes in the Dodd-Frank legislation, but they have sufficient numbers under procedural rules to halt confirmations. This isn’t a question of which side is morally or politically correct. But based on the record, including its nuance, we take the Senate historian’s word: Brown was correct when he said this was the first time that a political party has blocked a nomination unless changes were made to an agency. To repeat Ritchie’s words: "We searched through past cases and could not find anything that fit the current circumstance." We rate Brown’s claim True.

pomt-07870	Says he never said he would keep education funding the same.	false	/florida/statements/2011/feb/08/rick-scott/education-cuts-show-rick-scotts-budget/	Gov. Rick Scott unveiled his highly anticipated state budget on Feb. 7, 2011, which, as promised, calls for major reductions to government spending along with tax cuts for property owners and businesses. Scott's two-year spending plan would shrink the overall state budget from $70.3 billion to $65.9 billion in 2011-2012 and to $63.3 billion in 2012-2013. Cuts were expected almost everywhere -- except in the area of education, where Scott has said that funding would remain the same. At least, that's what people thought. Scott's proposed budget for next year includes billions of dollars in education cuts. (The actual cut depends on what education budget figure you consult, but the cut would be between $3.3 billion and $4.8 billion, with per-student funding to decrease by 10 percent.) Some of that loss is offset by having teachers contribute 5 percent to their retirement and by the inclusion of temporary federal education dollars. Still, per-student funding would shrink if Scott's budget is ultimately approved. "I've heard nothing but that education funding wasn't going to be touched," said Florida Education Association spokesman Mark Pudlow. "We all were wondering what kind of alchemy we were going to see. Of course, what we saw was tons of cuts to education." When Scott met with reporters after announcing his budget, he was asked if he had flipped on his campaign rhetoric. "No, it's not going back on anything I promised," Scott said. "What I said throughout the campaign and what I'm saying today -- any money that came out of state general revenue, we're not cutting that. Any money that they relied on federal bailouts, that is different." But that's not what Scott said just four days prior in Tampa. During an announcement where Scott said he would cut local school property taxes, called the required local effort, he was asked specifically about the effect on education funding. Here's the question and answer from Feb. 3, which we just happened to record: Question: You referred to cuts in the RLE (required local effort) property tax. Do you have a plan to make up that revenue or will the schools take that as a loss? Scott: "No, my commitment is to make sure the money that they've received they'll get again. Where I'm getting the savings is, I'm reducing the state government. What I'm trying to do is keep the school budgets the same." School budgets are funded through multiple sources. Local districts contribute property taxes through the required local effort, which is set by the state, and additional optional property taxes, which are set by county school boards. The state contributes general fund revenues through the state sales tax, as well as money from education trust funds. And the federal government contributes as well. The combination produces total school funding. If one part of the funding -- required local effort -- is reduced while the other parts simply stay the same, the result is less school money overall. Speaking in Tampa, Scott made no effort to distinguish or differentiate the funding formula -- all he said is he would keep school budgets the same. We also found references during the campaign when Scott was on the record saying education funding would not be cut as part of his budget. During the primary, Scott said he could offset a reduction in the school property tax through a combination of a larger share of sales taxes and other general revenue, according to the Palm Beach Post. When Scott's primary opponent, Attorney General Bill McCollum, called that plan "unrealistic," Scott said the money for schools could be found by cuts in non-education spending, the Post reported. And then during the general election, Scott again was asked to respond to questions over his education spending plan. According to the Associated Press, a spokeswoman for Alex Sink, Scott's Democratic opponent, called the Scott plan a rip-off of education. Here's how Scott responded in a Sept. 28 story: "We're not slashing the budget, our focus is to spend the dollars well," he said. "We're gonna drive down property tax rates, but we're gonna do that as we figure out how to save money. We're gonna make sure the money is there for education." Again, Scott offered no suggestion he was talking only about general revenue funding. One more thing: In comments after releasing his budget, Scott said he only promised no cuts to general revenue -- but he's actually making a slight cut there as well. Scott's budget includes about a $155 million cut in general revenue funding in 2011-2012. Yes, it's a small cut from a proposed budget of $12.3 billion, but it's a cut nevertheless. At the very least, Scott deliberately and purposely suggested that education funding would be held harmless in his first state budget. He made comments to that effect just days before his budget was released. Yet, when he announced his budget, cuts were included. We rate Scott's claim False.

pomt-12824	Says CNN’s Chris Cuomo "never asked" Sen. Richard Blumenthal about Blumenthal's misstatements on his own service in Vietnam.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/09/donald-trump/trump-wrong-sen-blumenthals-cnn-interview-and-viet/	President Donald Trump lashed out at CNN New Day anchor Chris Cuomo for failing to get tough with Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D- Conn. Cuomo had interviewed Blumenthal after the senator made headlines by saying that Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch had told him he was "disheartened" by the president’s dismissive comments about federal judges. Blumenthal drew Trump’s wrath first. The president tweeted, "Sen.Richard Blumenthal, who never fought in Vietnam when he said for years he had (major lie),now misrepresents what Judge Gorsuch told him?" Cuomo’s turn came next. After he spoke with Blumenthal, Trump tweeted on Feb. 9, 2017, "Chris Cuomo, in his interview with Sen. Blumenthal, never asked him about his long-term lie about his brave "service" in Vietnam. FAKE NEWS!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Actually, Cuomo did ask about that. CNN posted Cuomo’s interview with Blumenthal. Cuomo’s first question was: "What is your response to the president of the United States saying you should not be believed because you misrepresented your military record in the past?" Blumenthal didn’t answer the question. Instead, he repeated his account of what Gorsuch said to him. The interview moved on to details about the Gorsuch nomination. After Trump took his shot at Cuomo, the CNN anchor defended himself on air. "The president, with all due respect, is once again off on the facts," Cuomo said. "He just said, ‘You never asked him about it.’ I did. He ducked it, and that’s okay. Politicians duck things all the time." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com We reached out to the White House for comment and did not hear back. If they do respond, we will update this fact-check. Vietnam legacy Both Blumenthal and Trump avoided serving in Vietnam, but while Trump never claimed to have been there, Blumenthal did. In 2010, the New York Times reported that at a 2008 ceremony for veterans and senior citizens, Blumenthal said, "We have learned something important since the days that I served in Vietnam." In 2003, Blumenthal spoke at a rally supporting troops overseas. "When we returned, we saw nothing like this," he said, a comparison with soldiers who came back from Vietnam. Blumenthal told the New York Times he had "misspoken" about his Vietnam record. In reality, between 1965 and 1970, he received at least five deferments for military service. In 1970, he obtained a slot in the Marine Reserves and was stationed in America. As we’ve reported before, Trump benefited from four student deferments in college and one medical deferment (Trump later said that was for bone spurs in his heels), before being classified 4-F, unfit to serve. Trump played baseball, tennis and squash during his college years. He once said attending a private military-style boarding school gave him "more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military." Our ruling Trump said Cuomo failed to ask Blumenthal about his "long-term lie" about his service in Vietnam. The video record shows that Cuomo asked Blumenthal to respond to the charge that he lacked credibility after misrepresenting his military record. Cuomo might not have mentioned Vietnam, but he certainly brought Blumenthal’s past distortions into the conversation. Cuomo could have pressed Blumenthal with follow-up questions, which he failed to do. But he did ask.

pomt-11246	"You (Evan Jenkins) said your philosophy was ‘progressive mainstream’ back in 2003."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/02/patrick-morrisey/did-evan-jenkins-once-say-his-philosophy-was-progr/	The accusations flew fast and furious in a Fox News-sponsored debate between three Republican Senate contenders in West Virginia. We’re checking several claims from the May 1 debate, which featured former coal CEO Don Blankenship, U.S. Rep. Evan Jenkins, and state Attorney General Patrick Morrisey. Each is running for the nomination to face Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin in the general election. Here, we’ll fact-check one of several assertions Morrisey made about Jenkins’ past Democratic affiliation. As we’ve previously noted, Jenkins was initially registered as a Democrat, then switched to Republican, then back to Democratic when he sought a seat in the West Virginia House of Delegates in 1993. He remained a Democrat until July 2013, when he became a Republican to successfully challenge U.S. Rep. Nick Rahall, D-W.Va. In the debate, Morrisey addressed Jenkins and said, "You said your philosophy was ‘progressive mainstream’ back in 2003." (It’s at about the 5:10 mark here.) We found that Jenkins did use those words, although Morrisey glossed over some context about the comment. Morrisey’s camp pointed us to an Aug. 13, 2003, article in the Herald-Dispatch newspaper of Huntington, W. Va. The article addressed West Virginia’s 2004 gubernatorial election, in which incumbent Democratic Gov. Bob Wise declined to seek another term. Manchin easily won the Democratic primary and the governorship that fall. With the headline, "Some say governor is right not to run," the story quotes Jenkins about the still-developing candidate field for the governorship. At the time, Jenkins was a Democratic state senator. Here’s the relevant part: "This is an opportunity for Democrats, who I hope will put forth a nominee who can chart a course that gets away from the politics of the past and talk about addressing some of our tough economic development challenges," Jenkins said. "I hope the end result is a candidate who will talk about progressive mainstream issues and not talk about coalition building of special interest groups. I think voters in the mainstream are tired of politics of the past and ready for some new, strong leadership." So Jenkins definitely said the words "progressive mainstream." But Morrisey’s characterization of the comments are somewhat off. Jenkins didn’t exactly say the term described his own "own philosophy," as Morrisey charged during the debate. Rather, Jenkins was using the phrase to describe the philosophy a hypothetical gubernatorial candidate might pursue. It’s also worth noting that, unlike today, the term "progressive" was not used as widely as a near-synonym for "liberal" back in 2003. The specific policies that Jenkins mentioned in the 2003 exchange were not ones considered central to the "progressive" agenda today, such as abortion rights and gun control, but rather economic development, which is not an issue with support that’s exclusive to either the left or the right. Indeed, the overall gist of Jenkins’ remarks focuses on ditching the "politics of the past" and not kowtowing to "special interest groups." Our ruling Morrisey said to Jenkins, "You said your philosophy was ‘progressive mainstream’ back in 2003." Jenkins did use those words in an aspirational tone for a 2003 newspaper article. But Jenkins was talking about issues a hypothetical Democratic gubernatorial candidate should run on, not his own political philosophy. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-00492	Says Winston Churchill said, "The fascists of the future will call themselves anti-fascists."	false	/texas/statements/2018/aug/07/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-misquotes-winston-churchill-fascism/	In a wee-hours tweet, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott presented a meme showing celebrated British statesman Winston Churchill saying: "The fascists of the future will call themselves anti-fascists." In his 1:10 a.m. Aug. 7, 2018 tweet, Abbott prefaced his citation of Churchill, who twice served as England’s prime minister: "Some insights are timeless." Why Abbott posted the quotation might be explained by the headline on the meme above the purported Churchill quotation; it says: "Churchill on the left wing." Later the same morning, multiple others--including Wes Wilson of Austin’s KXAN TV news staff--responded on Twitter by asserting that Churchill didn’t make the statement shared by Abbott. Also, within 10 hours of the Abbott tweet's appearance, it was no longer posted. Abbott then told reporters, Patrick Svitek of the Texas Tribune reported, that it was irrelevant to him "who may or may not have said that in the past. I didn’t want to be accused of plagiarism for saying it. If no one else said it, attribute the quote to me because it’s what I believe in." Like other news organizations, meantime, we'd already started to check the accuracy of the quotation. Text down the left side of the Abbott-shared meme mentioned the 9gag.com site, which TechCrunch, a technology news website, described in 2017 as "a Hong Kong-based site that hosts and distributes funny pictures, videos and memes." We visited the site and spotted the same Churchill meme under the headline: "A reference to G20 Thought you might enjoy this quote." We didn’t spot a posting date on the meme. But reader comments below it start from July 10, 2017. Our phone and email inquiries about Abbott’s claim didn’t draw elaboration from Abbott’s campaign spokesman. Experts spot no evidence Churchill made statement Separately by email, the chief curator of the National Churchill Museum in Fulton, Missouri, Timothy Riley, told us that there’s no evidence to suggest Churchill made the quoted statement in over 15 million words that he wrote encompassing his speeches, articles, books and other writings. "Whether he uttered the words in conversation is unknowable, but I am not aware of any of Churchill’s contemporaries who record or recall the statement," Riley wrote. Separately, the research director of a Hillsdale College project that has been publishing Churchill’s papers responded to us by advising that its internal archive folding in Churchill’s writings, speeches and official biography show no sign of Churchill making the Abbott-quoted statement. Soren Geiger said: "I feel confident in saying that Churchill never said the statement." Generally, Geiger said, "if anything sounds witty or edgy, people can quickly believe that Churchill said it." We asked Geiger if Churchill made other comments about future fascists. By email, Geiger also provided a copy of Churchill’s July 27, 1943, speech about World War II and Italy to the House of Commons. In it, Churchill said: "The keystone of the Fascist arch has crumbled, and, without attempting to prophesy, it does not seem unlikely that the entire Fascist edifice will fall to the ground in ruins, if it has not already so fallen. The totalitarian system of a single party, armed with secret police, engrossing to itself practically all the offices, even the humblest, under the Government, with magistrates and courts under the control of the executive, with its whole network of domestic spies and neighbourly informants – that system when applied over a long period of time, leaves the broad masses without any influence upon their country’s destinies and without any independent figures apart from the official classes." Our ruling Abbott said that Churchill said, "The fascists of the future will call themselves anti-fascists." Abbott drew the quotation from a gag website,it appears, and neither he nor the site made available factual backup. Experts on Churchill’s writings and speeches say there’s no evidence Churchill made the statement. We rate Abbott's since-deleted claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-15125	"There has never been a panther attack in the history of Florida."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/sep/08/ron-bergeron/no-human-has-been-attacked-florida-panther-state-h/	A state wildlife official opposed plans to alter protections for the Florida panther, saying there was no pressing reason to fear the big cats. On Sept. 2, 2015, the Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission considered a policy proposal that critics said would have undercut efforts to expand the population. Opponents said the proposal favored ranchers, who have complained about panthers eating livestock and potentially threatening family members. Commissioner "Alligator" Ron Bergeron said he’d never had reason to be afraid of a panther. "I’ve been within three yards of panthers, multiple times," said Bergeron, a Broward County paving contractor who has been a commissioner since 2007. "There has never been a panther attack in the history of Florida." (Watch his comments here, at the 3:10 mark.) The commission voted 4-1 to approve the proposal, with Bergeron casting the lone vote against it. The group agreed to change the plan the next day, adding language Bergeron wanted to clarify the state would continue working with the federal government using "available staff and budgetary resources." The overall proposal still said the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, and not the state, will take the lead on efforts to grow the panther population in central and north Florida. We got to wondering, was he right about the felines never attacking a person? Well, none that anyone can prove. Panther primer Florida panthers are a subspecies of cougar that once roamed across the state. A male panther requires about 200 miles of open territory to thrive, so human expansion and development in Florida devastated the cat population. Since panthers historically prey on white-tailed deer and other animals, livestock often are a substitute. Ranchers would routinely shoot the cats until the animals became protected from hunting in 1958. The federal government declared panthers an endangered species in 1967, and the state did the same in 1973. By then there were as few as 20 to 30 panthers left. They’ve rebounded since then to between 100 and 180, but that doesn’t mean everything is great. A record 30 cats were killed in 2014, most by cars in Collier and Hendry counties. The panthers also had killed a record number of livestock and pets that year. While farm animals fare poorly when panthers are about, the cats usually give humans a wide berth. A Conservation Commission spokeswoman backed up Bergeron, confirming to PolitiFact Florida that in modern times, there had never been a verified panther attack on a human in the state. That’s the wide consensus, and is a part of the agency’s website and literature — even in a handout that says what to do to if a panther attacks. We should note there have been cougar (or puma, or mountain lion, or whatever you want to call them) attacks on people in other parts of the country. For example, a 35-year-old man was killed by a mountain lion while working on his bicycle in a wilderness park in Orange County, Calif., in 2004. The same cat attacked and injured a 30-year-old woman biking in the same area later that day. In 2008, a mountain lion killed a 55-year-old man close to his home near Pinos Altos, N.M. University of Florida wildlife ecology professor Madan Oli had not heard of any panther ever attacking anyone in Florida. "I am not aware of any documented/verified case of a Florida panther attacking humans," Oli said in an email. "I think one can safely say that such an attack has not happened in this century, but I cannot say when the last attack – if it ever happened – took place." The part about verifying an attack is what makes the claim tricky. Even an attack near Lake Kissimmee in 2014 couldn’t be verified, because the alleged victim waited three weeks to report it. Gary Mormino, professor emeritus at the University of South Florida-St. Petersburg Florida Studies program, said word of panther attacks used to routinely fill the newspapers. One particularly harrowing account from 1899 said a man named F.D. Biggs was on a picnic with his wife and 2-year-old when a "big catamount," a common alternative description for panthers, attacked the child. "The cat bit Mr. Smith terribly on the arm, and, fastening its claws in his clothing, tore his coat and shirt almost completely from his body," the article read. Biggs allegedly choked the animal to death and displayed its body in his Thonotosassa store. Mormino’s research showed that accounts of attacks appeared in the media up through the 1960s, in local papers and the New York Times. Whether they are reliable is a different question. "I am struck as to how many late 19th- and early 20th-century century stories involve panther attacks and humans," Mormino told PolitiFact Florida. "And I am sure these figures from the past who claimed to have been attacked by panthers were speaking the truth, for them. As to the scientific truth, I simply do not know and yield to the experts." Our ruling Bergeron said, "There has never been a panther attack in the history of Florida." While that’s the official stance of the state’s fish and wildlife agency, saying "never" is perhaps overstating the case a bit. There historically have been accounts of people tangling with the big cats. But many of those stories come from newspaper articles that date back a century or more. Wildlife experts agree that in modern times, there have been no verified panther attacks on a person in Florida. Bergeron would have been better served if he had used the words "verified panther attack." We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Ron Bergeron	None	None	None	2015-09-08T16:36:27	2015-09-02	['None']

pomt-01970	"Oregon school districts are directing 24 percent of their food budgets to purchase local foods. That’s the highest percentage in the country."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2014/jun/18/oregon-department-agriculture/do-oregon-school-districts-spend-more-local-food-a/	Several themes have converged in recent years to increase attention on local food production: a desire to reduce carbon footprints, to combat childhood obesity and to increase "food security," among others. Flourishing farmers markets around the state -- they’ve grown from a dozen in 1988 to more than 160 -- indicate that Oregon embraces eating food produced close to home. And so does the amount individual districts are spending on local food for school lunches, according to the Oregon Department of Agriculture. The claim: A first-ever national "census" tracking farm-to-school food results revealed a surprising statistic, according to a department news release: "The assessment shows that Oregon school districts are directing 24 percent of their food budgets to purchase local foods," the release said. "That’s the highest percentage in the country. We decided to check. The analysis: We emailed the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Farm-to-School program to get a complete copy of the census, then fielded a call from Deborah Kane, the program’s national director. Kane said she was tapped two years ago to implement a newly created farm-to-school program. The effort, she said, stemmed from the 2010 Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act, which provided a congressional mandate to encourage schools to buy food from local producers and processors. To establish baseline information, questionnaires were sent last spring to the nation’s more than 13,000 public school districts, said Kane, a Portland resident who most recently worked as vice president of food and farms at Ecotrust. About 10,000 districts responded. Kane directed us to Page 20 of the USDA Farm to School Census. Oregon, at 24 percent, ranks first in the "average percent of school food budget spent on local food." Just behind is Utah at 23 percent. Nevada is last, having apparently spent so little that it fell somewhere between zero and 0.9 percent. "Local," by the way, is defined in Oregon as foods grown and/or processed anywhere within the state. Other states have their own definitions, which range from foods grown within 25 miles of a school to foods produced in the region. Additional figures from the census are interesting, as well. In terms of dollars spent on local food by schools, California’s $51.2 million is at the top. Oregon’s $9.5 million is 13th, with Nevada again bringing up the rear. In checking Oregon’s 24 percent figure, however, we spotted a couple of snags. One, of the 197 public school districts in the state, only 123, or about 62.4 percent, chose to respond to the survey. Of those 123 respondents, 82, or about two-thirds, reporting having active farm-to-school programs. The 82 participating districts in Oregon represent about 714 individual schools with an estimated 366,066 students, according to the census. So the information about the amount Oregon districts spend for local food comes from slightly less than 42 percent of the state’s public school districts. Second, all of the data are self-reported. Neither the state Education Department nor the Agriculture Department tracks statewide figures for the amount of money individual districts spend on locally sourced food. The other states also self-reported their data, but with widely varying definitions of what constitutes "local." As a result, what appears in the state Agriculture Department’s news release as an indisputable fact appears far less reliable than stated. Oregon has spent time and money to make the program successful. It’s the only state to create farm-to-school coordinators in both the agriculture and education departments. A pilot program launched in 2011 grants about $1.2 million in every two-year budget cycle to schools to buy local food, and the program provides money to bring farmers into classrooms and to pay for school field trips to farms. But that sheds little light on the total amount Oregon schools spend on local food. The ruling: The Oregon Department of Agriculture, in underscoring the benefits of local food production, put out a news release saying Oregon school districts devote 24 percent of their food budgets to buying local food, the best rate in the nation. The release based its claim on the first USDA Farm to School Census, a collection of self-reported data from 10,000 of the country’s 13,000 public school districts. Among the many pages of information was one showing Oregon at the top in terms of percentages. All of the data, however, are self-reported, and state officials acknowledged that they have no way to verify the numbers. Districts also defined "local" in widely different ways, making comparisons difficult. Further, fewer than half of Oregon public school districts responded to the census, leaving the numbers incomplete. The claim contains elements of accuracy but leaves out important details that could lead to a different conclusion. We rate it Half True.

pomt-01268	"America’s least-trusted news sources are also its most popular."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/06/leonard-pitts-jr/liberal-columnist-says-least-trusted-news-sources-/	Many words have been said and many numbers crunched to explain political polarization in America. One theory is that liberals and conservatives swim in different waters when it comes to news and information. Liberal columnist Leonard Pitts, Jr. offered a new spin on this theme. In a Nov.1 op-ed, Pitt said most of the fault lies on the right end of the spectrum. He blamed conservative hardliners who "are more rabid in support of those who validate their views than the rest of us are in pursuit of simple truth." To prove his point, Pitts cited a recent report from the Pew Research Center that explored the level of trust enjoyed by 36 news sources, ranging from television networks to partisan blogs. Pitts focused his column on two sources, Rush Limbaugh and Fox News. In the Pew study, 39 percent of respondents said they distrusted Limbaugh, and 37 percent voiced the same misgivings about Fox News. Pitts noted that Rush Limbaugh "hosts the number one show on radio and Fox is the highest-rated cable news outlet." His conclusion? "America’s least-trusted news sources are also its most popular." A reader asked us to check that statement and we are happy to oblige. There are two elements to check: Are Limbaugh and Fox News the least-trusted? And are they the most popular with Americans? ‘Least-trusted’ Yes, the Pew survey found that more people distrusted Limbaugh and Fox News than any other outlet. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that the two outlets are the "least-trusted" as Pitts claimed. To find that out, you need to account for the percentage of people who say that they trust Limbaugh and Fox News. For instance, while 39 percent of respondents said they distrusted Limbaugh, 12 percent said they trust him. And for Fox News, more people (44 percent) said they trust the network then said they distrust it (37 percent). Factoring that in, Limbaugh has the biggest trust gap of any of the 36 outlets polled. But Fox News is in the middle of the pack. Here’s the calculation for each outlet in the survey. News Source Pct. Trust Pct. Distrust Net trust CNN 54% 20% +34 ABC 50% 17 +33 NBC 50% 19% +31 CBS 46% 17% +29 BBC 36% 7% +29 PBS 38% 12% +26 Wall Street Journal 31% 10% +21 NPR 29% 9% +20 USA Today 33% 13% +20 New York Times 34% 17% +17 MSNBC 38% 22% +16 Google News 25% 11% +14 Washington Post 27% 14% +13 Economist 12% 2% +10 Fox News 44% 37% +7 New Yorker 14% 10% +4 Yahoo News 20% 16% +4 Blaze 6% 3% +3 Guardian 7% 4% +3 Bloomberg 11% 8% +3 Politico 7% 5% +2 Huffington 18% 17% +1 Slate 4% 3% +1 Mother Jones 6% 5% 1 Breitbart 4% 4% 0 Think Progress 2% 2% 0 Drudge Report 8% 9% -1 Daily Kos 2% 3% -1 Colbert Report 15% 16% -1 Daily Show 16% 18% -2 Ed Schultz 3% 5% -2 BuzzFeed 2% 8% -6 Al Jazeera 9% 16% -7 Hannity 12% 21% -9 Glenn Beck 10% 24% -14 Rush Limbaugh 12% 39% -27 So while it’s largely correct to conclude that Limbaugh’s program is the "least-trusted," the same cannot be as easily said about Fox News. Within cable news, Fox News rates last, but in a broader pool, it fares better. (We noted the Pew findings and called Limbaugh the "least trustworthy" news source in an Oct. 21 article. We did not do the same with Fox News.) ‘Most popular’ As for measuring popularity -- by the number of listeners, viewers or readers -- that can be complicated. For starters, the Pew survey includes newspapers, broadcast TV networks, cable TV networks, websites, radio organizations and individual radio shows. Pitts expanded upon his claim in terms of comparing Limbaugh to other radio programs and Fox News to other cable networks. We think that’s a fair metric. We’ll take Limbaugh first. Rachel Nelson with Premiere Networks, the company that distributes the Rush Limbaugh Show, said it is the No. 1 talk radio program in America. "The Rush Limbaugh Show is heard on nearly 600 stations by up to 20 million people each week and is the highest-rated national radio talk show in America," Nelson said. However, it’s hard to find objective confirmation for the size of the Limbaugh audience. In radio, the Arbitron/Nielsen Audio service is the leading source for independent data. In order to get firm statistics for Limbaugh, one would need to look at how his show performed in all of the markets where stations carry it. That has not been done. The closest approximation to Arbitron ratings comes from Talkers Magazine. In October, the magazine estimated Limbaugh’s audience at 12.5 million or more each week. But as the magazine notes, "these figures are non-scientific projections based upon a significant sample and do not represent exact Nielsen Audio or any other rating service totals." What might compete with Limbaugh? NPR’s Morning Edition. It airs on about 660 stations and according to NPR, in the Spring 2014 survey, 12,267,800 listeners tuned in each week, using Arbitron data. (In the Pew survey, 29 percent of people said they trusted NPR, 9 percent said they distrusted the public radio broadcaster.) Bob Thompson is a professor at Syracuse University’s Newhouse School of Public Communications. Thompson said the Arbitron numbers are themselves estimates based on statistical models. Thompson said that Morning Edition and the Rush Limbaugh Show could have similar-sized audiences. "Those Arbitron numbers put NPR reasonably in the range of 12.5 million people who listen that show," Thompson said. "It’s silly to look at them as exact, but they get us into the neighborhood." In summary, most everyone agrees that Limbaugh is near the top. But a definitive figure of listeners is elusive. On the television side, Pitts’ claim about Fox News popularity is right when compared to other cable news networks. Based on Nielsen data, in 2013, about 1.77 million viewers tuned in Fox News during the prime time hours between 8 and 11 p.m. That is more than the viewers for CNN and MSNBC combined. But we should note that all of the network news programs beat out Fox News many times over. On an average night, 8.4 million viewers chose NBC Nightly News, 7.7 million viewers picked ABC World News, and 6.5 million viewers tuned in CBS Evening News. "Cable news carves up a tiny slice of the population of this country," Thompson said. Our ruling Pitts said America’s least-trusted news sources are also its most popular ones and focused on the Rush Limbaugh Show on radio and Fox News on cable. According to the survey Pitts used, Limbaugh’s program is indeed the least-trusted news source. However, comparing the size of the gap between people who trust to those who distrust a source, Fox News falls in the middle of the pack. In terms of popularity, Fox News clearly is the most popular channel in its genre and the Rush Limbaugh Show is likely the most popular radio talk show (or at least very close to it). Pitts’ assessment also obscures the enormous reach of network television news. The lowest-performing network, CBS, has an audience three times that of Fox News. Pitts makes some valid points but he leaves out information that might lead someone to reach a different conclusion. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-11581	"Rep. Paul Gosar asks Capitol Police to arrest illegal immigrants attending State of the Union."	true	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/01/usa-train-news/rep-paul-gosar-asks-police-arrest-illegal-immigran/	A Republican representative from Arizona contacted law enforcement in response to reports that Democrats planned to bring Dreamers, immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children, to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union. "Rep. Paul Gosar asks Capitol Police to arrest illegal immigrants attending State of the Union," stated the Jan. 30 headline on USA Trainnews, a right-leaning website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. However, we found that the article correctly cites Gosar’s efforts to summon law enforcement to arrest Dreamers. The fate of Dreamers, which played a role in the January federal government shutdown, appears uncertain. In September, Trump announced that he was ending Obama’s program that temporarily deferred deportation for certain illegal immigrants, prompting talks about how to come up with a permanent solution. A White House framework would offer a path to citizenship over 12 years in exchange for $25 billion for the border wall and other improvements, but members of both parties have raised objections. Gosar, who was first elected to his Arizona district in 2010, received an A+ from NumbersUSA, a group that advocates for lower levels of immigration. Gosar posted a few tweets from his U.S. House account at 1:33 p.m. Jan. 30, hours before Trump’s State of the Union address: "Today, Congressman Paul Gosar contacted the U.S. Capitol Police, as well as Attorney General Jeff Sessions, asking they consider checking identification of all attending the State of the Union address and arresting any illegal aliens in attendance. "Additionally, Congressman Gosar asked that they arrest those using fraudulent social security numbers and identification to pass through security. "Of all the places where the Rule of Law needs to be enforced, it should be in the hallowed halls of Congress. Any illegal aliens attempting to go through security, under any pretext of invitation or otherwise, should be arrested and deported." Gosar’s tweet drew criticism from members on both sides of the aisle on twitter. U.S. Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., fired back at Gosar: "Oh my goodness, Rep. Gosar. Dreamers don't pose a threat to us,'' she tweeted. "This is so drastic and cruel. Dios mío." A spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., said that Ryan clearly does not agree" with Gosar's suggestion. Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin tweeted: "How many Republican members of the House and Senate will condemn this attempt to punish Dreamers who were brought to this country as kids?" Gosar’s chief of staff Tom Van Flein told PolitiFact that Gosar spoke on the phone with the Capitol Police chief, but he didn’t know how the police ultimately responded to Gosar’s request. We sent an email and left messages for spokespersons for the Capitol Police and the Justice Department and did not get a reply. USA Trainnews wrote that "Rep. Paul Gosar asks Capitol Police to arrest illegal immigrants attending State of the Union." Gosar tweeted on Jan. 30 that he contacted police and Attorney General Jeff Sessions asking that they arrest any illegal immigrants attending the State of the Union. We rate this claim True.

pomt-12550	Says Jon Ossoff wants to "allow illegal immigration."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2017/apr/17/donald-trump/trump-makes-false-claim-about-jon-ossoffs-immigrat/	A day before a special election in Georgia to replace former U.S. Rep. Tom Price, President Donald Trump went on Twitter to criticize the top Democratic contender. "The super Liberal Democrat in the Georgia Congressioal (sic) race tomorrow wants to protect criminals, allow illegal immigration and raise taxes!" Trump tweeted April 17. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Eighteen candidates from all parties are seeking Atlanta’s 6th Congressional District seat, which Republicans have held for decades and is now up for grabs after Price joined the Trump administration as secretary of Health and Human Services. While Trump did not explicitly name Jon Ossoff in his tweet, the 30-year-old Democrat has emerged as the leading contender in the closely-watched race. In his tweet, Trump inaccurately characterized Ossoff’s immigration stance. The candidate has spoken in favor of securing the U.S. borders. The White House did not provide comment. Ossoff dismissed Trump’s tweet. "While I’m glad the president is interested in the race, he is misinformed," Ossoff said in a statement. At an April 9 candidate forum, Ossoff spoke in favor of securing the borders. He did, however, have harsh words for Trump’s immigration promise to deport all undocumented immigrants. "The notion that we are going to massively deport more than 11 million people is absurd. There is no way a program like that could be implemented constitutionally, in a way that is fiscally responsible or in a way that is humane," Ossoff said. "The only real solution is comprehensive immigration reform that secures our borders and provides a path to legal status for non-felons who are here without proper documentation." That message is also delivered in a civil rights and liberties section on his campaign website. "America needs a strong border policy that protects American citizens and American jobs," the section said. "We should welcome those strivers who, like our own forebears, seek the opportunity to work hard, play by the rules, and build better lives in America." Ossoff also scoffed at another idea Trump floated during the presidential campaign. Ossoff’s campaign website says he believes "it’s unconstitutional to ban anyone from entering our country on religious grounds." Trump’s executive orders to temporarily stop the entry of individuals from certain countries have been criticized by immigrant advocates and Democrats as a "Muslim ban." (Those orders have been halted by courts.) NumbersUSA, an advocacy group that promotes reduced immigration, rates candidates on a wide range of issues, such as their position on amnesty, ending birthright citizenship and border security. On whether Ossoff is on the side to secure the border, NumbersUSA gave Ossoff a "Yes" rating. NumbersUSA said it bases its ratings on responses to its survey or on candidate statements on campaign websites and in news reports. Trump’s tweet called out Ossoff for wanting to "protect criminals" and "raise taxes." But those characterizations also misrepresent the facts. Ossoff’s campaign website said he would work to empower law enforcement with tools and resources needed to bring down organized criminals, but would also seek to reduce mass incarceration of nonviolent offenders. Ossoff also said he would work to "reduce the tax burden on small businesses and simplify small business tax filing." Our ruling In a tweet alluding to Ossoff, Trump tweeted that Ossoff wants to "allow illegal immigration." Trump’s vague attack mischaracterizes Ossoff’s stance. Unlike Trump’s plan, Ossoff’s approach to immigration includes a path to citizenship or legal status for immigrants here without permission. Ossoff has also criticized Trump’s one-time promise to deport all immigrants in the country illegally as not feasible. Trump neglects that Ossoff supports strong border security — to prevent illegal immigration. We rate Trump’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-06207	"Some billionaires have a tax rate as low as 1 percent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/08/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-some-billionaires-have-tax-rate-/	On Dec. 6, 2011, President Barack Obama gave a speech at Osawatomie High School in Osawatomie, Kan., the site of an address by Theodore Roosevelt just over a century earlier. In it, Obama sought to warn Americans about the perils of economic inequality. Here’s what he said: "Today, the wealthiest Americans are paying the lowest taxes in over half a century. This isn’t like in the early ‘50s, when the top tax rate was over 90 percent. This isn’t even like the early ‘80s, when the top tax rate was about 70 percent. Under President Clinton, the top rate was only about 39 percent," he said. "Today, thanks to loopholes and shelters, a quarter of all millionaires now pay lower tax rates than millions of you, millions of middle-class families. Some billionaires have a tax rate as low as 1 percent. One percent." Several readers urged us to check Obama’s claim that "some billionaires have a tax rate as low as 1 percent." Before we can begin answering this question, we’ll need to define "billionaire." It means someone whose wealth is worth $1 billion or more. In 2010, there were slightly more than 400 billionaires in the U.S., according to the Forbes 400 list of wealthiest Americans. Fewer Americans have income of more than $1 billion. Every year, the Internal Revenue Service releases aggregated income and tax data on the 400 filers who had the highest incomes that year. In the most recently released data, covering 2008, to be included required an adjusted gross income of least $110 million. A back-of-the-envelope estimate suggests that somewhere between zero and 100 people had an income of at least $1 billion in 2008. So the first thing to point out is that we are talking about a very small pool of people. And one of the consequences of having a very small pool of people to study is that data is scarce. This is especially true given that privacy rules carefully shield income and tax data for individuals from public scrutiny. "I don't know of any data that address the question," said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. But we gave it our best shot. When it comes to individuals with wealth of $1 billion or more, you really can’t draw any conclusions at all. Any estimate of how much a Forbes 400 member pays in taxes is pure speculation. And while there’s undoubtedly some overlap between the Forbes and IRS lists, they're not a match. So we’re left with the IRS list. (And we're assuming that the White House was not sifting through the IRS data behind the list, since doing so would be illegal.) But the list doesn't really back up Obama’s point. • As we indicated, inclusion on the IRS 400 list doesn’t mean you are a billionaire. It means you had an adjusted gross income of least $110 million. The actual number of billionaires on the list is unknowable. It's not possible to say with certainty even how many of them had income of $1 billion or more or how many might have incomes of less than $1 billion but wealth that would put them in the billionaires' club. • The IRS data hints at -- but doesn’t confirm -- that some of the 400 tax filers had effective tax rates of 1 percent. (An effective tax rate is not the official tax rate on the books but rather your tax bill measured as a percentage of your total income before deductions, exclusions, exemptions and credits.) The IRS offers a breakdown of what the 400 top earners paid in effective tax rates: 0 percent to 10 percent: 30 filers 10 percent to 15 percent: 101 filers 15 percent to 20 percent: 112 filers 20 percent to 25 percent: 52 filers 25 percent to 30 percent: 46 filers 30 percent to 35 percent: 59 filers So 30 of the top 400 filers paid an effective tax rate of between zero and 10 percent. How many of those paid 1 percent? We have no way of knowing. If the percentages are distributed roughly equally across the range provided, it would mean three to five tax filers paid an effective tax rate of 1 percent or less. But it could easily be zero filers paying that little. We simply don’t know -- and we also have no idea whether these filers are actually billionaires. We also tried to extrapolate by looking at a different data set, from Williams’ group. The Tax Policy Center tracks which Americans have zero liability for the federal individual income tax. It found that of 433,000 tax filers with incomes of at least $1 million, 7,000 of those -- or 1.6 percent -- paid no federal income tax. But this data doesn’t help much, either. First, the cutoff is $1 million in income; the data are silent on how many of those people have $1 billion in wealth. And second, this only covers the federal income tax; the 7,000 people in question might be liable for enough other kinds of federal taxes to rise above a 1 percent effective tax rate. The Washington Post Fact Checker, Glenn Kessler, reported that the White House offered as backup "a clip of a conversation on Bloomberg TV, in which correspondent Gigi Stone made this assertion during a discussion about the tax strategies that the very wealthy use to avoid paying taxes. The TV clip was promoted by the left-leaning website Think Progress. Stone quoted froma Bloomberg News article last month that reported on such tax strategies, which mostly involve complicated ways to defer paying capital gains taxes. But the article never made the 1 percent claim. It also noted that the IRS had gotten more hostile to such transactions in recent years." We watched the clip and read the article and agree with the Fact Checker that the material isn’t strong enough to support Obama’s claim. Stone cited the now-famous example of billionaire Warren Buffett paying a lower effective tax rate, 17 percent, than his secretary. "The real figure for billionaires," she continued, "is often a lot smaller than that. Sometimes they even have a tax rate as low as 1 percent. That’s because they derive the bulk of their income from stock appreciation, and they use complicated strategies -- some of them -- to make sure that some of those gains don’t get classified as taxable income." Stone cited the IRS 400 study in her report, and she has a point that tax rates for those very rich filers "is often a lot smaller" than Buffett’s 17 percent rate. At least 131 of the 400 had a lower rate than Buffett, according to the IRS. Her next comment -- "sometimes they even have a tax rate as low as 1 percent" -- is less certain. Finally, we were unable to get any additional backup from the White House for the figure Obama used. Our ruling Stone’s remark that "sometimes (billionaires) even have a tax rate as low as 1 percent" may be an acceptable shorthand for cable television chatter, but as a linchpin statistic in a major policy address by the president, the claim falls short. The best publicly available data, the IRS 400, suggests that it’s possible that some billionaires pay an effective tax rate of 1 percent or less. But this data doesn’t confirm it. In addition, the IRS 400 is made up primarily of people with less than $1 billion in annual income, and provides no information about whether a tax filer on the list has $1 billion in wealth. Despite this, Obama made it sound like a certainty that "some billionaires have a tax rate as low as 1 percent." He would have been on safe ground if he’d noted that more than half the filers on the IRS 400 list had an effective tax rate of 20 percent or less. Obama did not have to gild the lily with a statistic this weak. If he wasn’t able to back it up with hard statistics, he shouldn't have said it. Because of that same uncertainty, we can't rule out that there isn't a billionaire out there who has a tax rate as low as 1 percent, but we haven't been able to find any evidence that there is. If the White House or anyone else produces evidence that it's true, we'd be open to changing our ruling, but based on what we know, we rule it Mostly False.

pomt-02804	"Only 25 percent of what people buy is subject to Rhode Island’s sales tax."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/dec/01/joseph-henchman/tax-foundation-official-says-only-25-percent-what-/	Rhode Island’s 7-percent sales tax is the second-highest rate in the nation. Whether it should stay that way, be reduced or even abolished, is being examined by the Special Joint Legislative Commission to Study the Sales Tax Repeal Act of 2013. During the commission’s most recent hearing, on Nov.19, it heard testimony from Joseph D. Henchman, vice president of the Washington D.C.-based Tax Foundation. Among other things, he said part of the reason Rhode Island’s sales tax rate is so high is because it taxes so little. "Only 25 percent of what people buy is subject to Rhode Island’s sales tax," Henchman said. "Only Illinois, Massachusetts, and New Jersey have narrower sales taxes. You are exempting 75 percent of the economy from the sales tax already and imposing a higher rate on the rest that you do tax." Is Rhode Island’s sales tax really as narrow as Henchman says? Like most state sales taxes, Rhode Island’s is limited to the sale of so-called tangible goods, not services, such as lawn-mowing or legal fees. It is further diminished by about 83 categories of exempted items such as food, most clothing, medicines, and, more recently, art works and wine. Henchman told us he got Rhode Island’s 25 percent figure from analysis done by John L. Mikesell, chancellor’s professor of public and environmental affairs at the Indiana University. Mikesell is considered one of the nation’s experts on state taxation policies. Henchman said the figure came from a statistic Mikesell calls "breadth of base," which estimates how much of a state’s commerce is subject to its sales tax. Mikesell starts by taking a state’s total sales tax revenue and determining how much in retail sales was needed to produce that amount, a figure he calls the "implied retail sales tax base." He then expresses that base as a percentage of the state’s total personal income, the amount of money residents in the state have to spend. In 2011, Rhode Island’s 7-percent sales tax raised $824 million, which, by Mikesell’s calculation, required $11 billion in taxable sales. Its total personal income that year was about $44 billion, according to the state Department of Labor and Training. The $11-billion figure is 25 percent of $44 billion, and that’s the 25-percent figure that Henchman cited. But there’s a problem. Mikesell is measuring the percent of a state’s total personal income that is captured by its sales tax. Henchman was talking about the percent of a state’s total personal spending that is taxed, a very different amount. To get that figure, you’d have to know the total amount of retail sales in the state. Coming up with that number is next to impossible because the state doesn’t track sales it doesn’t tax, said Paul Dion, chief of revenue analysis for the Rhode Island Department of Revenue. "I can’t even tell you what our retail tax base is," Dion said. "We’d have to extrapolate that." In 2012, the Connecticut Office of Legislative Research was looking at that state’s sales tax rate and it used Mikesell’s percentage also, but it made the point that Mikesell’s comparison was to income, not sales. "In other words, 26.19 percent of Connecticut personal income is spent on goods and services subject to the sales tax," the report said. When we got back to Henchman, he said Mikesell’s personal income figure provides a uniform number that allows state-by-state comparisons. Dion agreed, and said when he heard Henchman’s statement, that’s how he understood it. Our ruling Joseph Henchman of the Tax Foundation said: "Only 25 percent of what people buy is subject to Rhode Island’s sales tax." But the figure he cited actually referred to personal income, not what people buy. In fact, no one knows what percentage of everything that Rhode Islanders buy is subject to the sales tax because no one calculates total spending. Dion might have understood what Henchman meant, but we have to go by what he said. We rule his statement False. Correction: In the initial version of this item, Joseph Henchman was incorrectly identified as John Henchman in the Source List.

pomt-12842	"We've dropped from a top 10 state in elementary reading to 30th in the nation" under State Schools Superintendent Tony Evers’ watch.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/06/john-humphries/schools-candidate-john-humphries-says-tony-evers-o/	In his bid for state school superintendent, John Humphries is trying to use incumbent Superintendent Tony Evers’ long tenure against him. "It's time for Tony Evers for State Superintendent to be held accountable for statewide outcomes," Humphries posted Jan. 12, 2017 on Facebook. "We've dropped from a top 10 state in elementary reading to 30th in the nation under his watch while other states have made substantial gains." Humphries, a consultant with the Dodgeville School District, is in a three-way primary battle with Evers and retired Beloit Superintendent Lowell Holtz. The primary election is Feb. 21, 2017. To back up his claim, Humphries’ campaign pointed to an analysis by the Wisconsin Reading Coalition, a grassroots group of educational advocates that wants changes in reading instruction. The group has endorsed Humphries and believes Evers has not pushed education schools to use new methods for instructing teachers how to teach reading, said Steven Dykstra, a psychologist who co-founded the coalition. The coalition published a historical look at Wisconsin’s reading ranks based on annual results from the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), which bills itself as the "largest nationally representative and continuing assessment of what America's students know." The ranking The NAEP test, taken by a small sample of students, is the best source to analyze Humphries’ claim, though it is not without drawbacks. Let’s take a look at the 4th-grade scores, the only elementary-school grade that NAEP tests. NAEP publishes two types of rankings. One simply orders states by their average reading scores. But because those scores often are too closely bunched to be significant, NAEP also reports how many states have statistically higher or lower scores. Here’s the history on Wisconsin’s rankings, using both methods: 1998: 6th by raw order; 1 state significantly higher 2003: 22nd, 8 states significantly higher 2005: 24th, 11 states 2007: 25th, 8 states 2009: 30th, 19 states 2011: 25th, 15 states 2013: 31st, 15 states 2015: 25th, 12 states So by the cruder measure, the raw ranking, Wisconsin was a top-10 state. The most recent year showed a ranking of 25th -- not the 30th Humphries claimed. But its ranking has been as low as 31st on 4th-grade reading during Evers time as superintendent. (Wisconsin’s scores were stagnant while the national average increased). On Evers’ watch? So the history helps Humphries’ case, but did that decline come, as Humphries claimed, under Evers’ watch? Only if you define Evers’ "watch" as dating to 2001, when he was appointed deputy superintendent of public instruction under newly-elected State Superintendent Elizabeth Burmaster. Evers took control of the agency after he won the spring 2009 election. At that point, Wisconsin’s reading rank already had fallen to 30th, with 19 states significantly ahead. That gives a different perspective on Evers’ record. Comparing the first test in Evers’ time atop the agency to the most recent, the ranking improved from 30th to 25th, and from 19 states significantly better to 12 states. Two final notes before we grade this. The picture for Wisconsin is somewhat brighter using the second, more statistically precise ranking method published by NAEP. In 1998, Wisconsin was sixth in raw order, but only one state was "significantly higher." In the most recent three tests, Wisconsin’s rank in raw order was 25th to 31st, but only 12-15 states were "significantly higher." The state Department of Public Instruction, the agency Evers heads, has used both measurements in its public statements on NAEP over the years. Finally, Wisconsin looks better on 8th-grade reading, where it ranks 9th. But Humphries’ claim focused on referenced elementary school, generally considered Kindergarten-5th grade. Our rating Humphries said Wisconsin has "dropped from a top 10 state in elementary reading to 30th in the nation" under Evers. The drop is real, by an oft-cited ranking from a credible source, but the latest rank is 25th, not 30th. And Facebook readers who aren’t deeply familiar with Evers' career might assume from Humphries claim that the decline happened while Evers was state superintendent. Evers was a top staffer for much of that time, but most of the decline came before he took over. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-14268	Mexico receives "approximately $24 billion a year in remittances from Mexican nationals working in the United States. The majority of that amount comes from illegal aliens."	half-true	/arizona/statements/2016/apr/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-claims-most-wire-transfers-mexico-are/	Donald Trump’s new plan to get Mexico to pay for a wall along the Southern border is drawing comments from all sides. Former Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer said if the plan works, it’s "fantastic." President Barack Obama, on the other hand, called it "half-baked." The plan, released on April 5, 2016, reads as a series of hypotheticals. Trump claims barring undocumented immigrants from sending wire transfers would entice Mexico to pay for the wall. "They (Mexico) receive approximately $24 billion a year in remittances from Mexican nationals working in the United States. The majority of that amount comes from illegal aliens," Trump said. In turn, Trump argues that he would not let the wire transfer ban go into effect if Mexico contributes "the funds needed to the United States to pay for the wall." We were curious as to whether most Mexican wire transfers, using services such as Western Union, come from undocumented immigrants. Hard to tell We did not hear back from Trump’s press office but readily found data on remittances -- or how much money is transferred from the United States to Mexico. According to Bank of Mexico, there was $24.77 billion in remittances to Mexico in 2015. So Trump’s first claim checks out, but the second part is not that simple. "We don’t know of any estimate by any organization or researcher of what share of remittance senders are unauthorized immigrants – or indeed are immigrants of any legal status," said Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokeswoman at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute. "Keep in mind that some number of U.S. born who are of Mexican heritage might also still send remittances." San Diego State University economics professor Catalina Amuedo-Dorantes worked on a paper on remittances published in the 2005 Economic Review. The paper estimates that 75 percent of undocumented Mexican immigrants have the probability to remit money. It also notes that these immigrants send almost $439 a month on average to Mexico. The Pew Research Center estimates that there are 5.6 million undocumented Mexican immigrants living in the United States as of 2014. Using these three numbers, Alfredo Cuecuecha Mendoza, an economic expert and president of El Colegio de Tlaxcala, A.C. in Mexico, estimates that 48 percent of remittances are sent by undocumented Mexican immigrants. Overall, Pew estimates that there are 11.3 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. Amuedo-Dorantes said undocumented immigrants are more likely to remit money than documented immigrants, who are often settled with their family in the United States. "That said, it is also the case that legal migrants have better paying jobs and, in absolute terms, are able to remit more than the undocumented. So I am not sure his (Trump’s ) statement is correct," she said. Manuel Orozco, a remittance expert at Washington D.C. think tank Inter-American Dialogue, said it is "not possible" to say how much of the billions Mexico receives from remittances come from undocumented immigrants. "Sounds like a guess to me," said Roy Germano, a remittance expert and international relations professor at New York University. Our ruling Trump said, "they (Mexico) receive approximately $24 billion a year in remittances from Mexican nationals working in the United States. The majority of that amount comes from illegal aliens." The number is right, but saying the majority of that money comes from undocumented immigrants is a pure guess. One estimate, based on data more than a decade old, could associate 48 percent of remittances with undocumented Mexican immigrants. But that’s a stretch at best -- and it’s still not the majority -- as Trump claims. Experts we spoke with said there is no way to track undocumented remittance senders. All in all, we rate Trump’s claim Half True.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-04-08T12:00:00	2016-04-05	['United_States', 'Mexico']
pomt-01511	Says Sen. Mark Begich is ineffective because he has only "passed one bill, the naming of a building."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/22/dan-sullivan/senate-candidate-dan-sullivan-says-sen-mark-begich/	Dan Sullivan, the Republican Senate candidate in Alaska, is charging that his opponent, Sen. Mark Begich, is an ineffective lawmaker compared to other Alaska senators. According to a recent Sullivan campaign mailer, Begich -- who has been in office since 2009 -- has passed zero pieces of legislation during his first term. The Sullivan campaign reinforced this line of attack in a Facebook meme that said Begich has passed one bill, and all it did was name a building. This meme compared Begich’s record to that of other Alaska senators, saying that Begich’s predecessor, the late Republican Sen. Ted Stevens, passed 13 bills during his first term in the chamber, and that current Sen. Lisa Murkowski, also a Republican, passed five during her first term. We wondered: Did only one of Begich's bills pass during his first term? And is that the only way to measure his effectiveness as a legislator? We searched the Congressional Quarterly congressional database and found that since becoming a senator in 2009, Sen. Begich has only sponsored one bill that was eventually enacted, and that bill was to name an Alaska courthouse. So Sullivan has a point. But it’s a point that should be taken with a grain of salt. First, the claim has quickly become outdated. Last week -- after the mailer and meme first appeared -- the Senate and House passed a Begich-sponsored bill to increase veterans’ disability compensation that President Barack Obama is expected to sign into law. Second, counting the number of passed bills sponsored by a lawmaker is not the only -- or even the best -- way to gauge their effectiveness. In reality, there are many ways for a member of Congress to get desired legislation to the president’s desk beyond being the bill’s chief sponsor, said Norman Ornstein, a congressional expert at the American Enterprise Institute. "There are some lawmakers who sponsor or cosponsor a lot of bills, but it doesn't reflect much of anything," he said, adding that the name on a bill that passes may be more of a reflection of who chaired the committee of jurisdiction rather than the member who actually drove the bill. Begich has co-sponsored 37 bills that became law. For seven of these laws, he was one of five or fewer co-sponsors, meaning he likely would have had tangible influence over the bill. And on three of these, Begich was the sole cosponsor of bills put forward by Murkowski, his fellow Alaska senator. All three dealt with Alaska-specific issues, such as Denali National Park. Meanwhile, a lawmaker’s name doesn’t have to be on a bill to accomplish legislative goals. Here are a few examples for Begich: • The Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2012 included a provision authored by Begich that explored the possibility of a deep-water port in the Arctic. Begich didn’t sponsor or co-sponsor that bill, which originated in the House, but he did sponsor the corresponding Senate version. • In a previous fact-check, we found that Begich had played a key role in getting Washington to open up the Arctic Ocean to oil drilling for the first time in decades. A lawyer involved with the efforts told PolitiFact at the time that Begich’s "biggest influence has been picking up the phone or having those people into his office or in hearings and saying ‘Dammit, we need to get this done.’ " • In 2012, Alaska Native tribal health programs signed an agreement with the Department of Veterans’ Affairs that allowed Alaska Native veterans to receive medical care in tribal areas, rather than having to travel to Anchorage or Seattle. The Alaska Army National Guard and the Southeast Alaska Regional Health Consortium both said Begich supported that effort. • In the 2009 economic stimulus package, Begich fought for funds that benefited Alaska military bases and that helped build a hospital in Nome, Alaska, McClatchy reported. Additionally, Begich heads the Senate’s Democratic Steering and Outreach Committee, which has responsibilities beyond passing legislation, including improving the party’s relationship with traditionally Republican constituencies, according to his profile in Congressional Quarterly. So simply looking at the number of Begich-sponsored bills signed into law doesn’t give a full sense of his activities in the Senate. It’s also worth remembering that partisan gridlock has meant that a historically low number of bills are passing these days, meaning fewer opportunities for Begich -- or anyone else -- to get their names on a signed bill. As of July, about 800 bills have become law since Begich took office in 2009, according to compiled GovTrack data. If every member of Congress were to pass the same number of bills, that would break down to about 1.5 bills per person over the 5.5-year period. It was much different in Stevens’ first term, which ran from 1969 to 1974. Congress passed nearly 800 bills between 1973 and 1974 alone. (We don’t have data back further than that.) That breaks down to about 1.5 bills per person in just two years. Our ruling Sullivan said Begich is ineffective because he has passed only "one bill, the naming of a building." Technically, Sullivan has a point -- at the time Sullivan’s post went up, Begich had only sponsored one bill that was eventually enacted, and it named a courthouse. Another Begich-sponsored bill concerning veterans’ issues subsequently passed both the House and Senate. However, this is an oversimplification, since Begich has had success pushing a legislative agenda in ways that don’t end up with his name on an enacted bill. Notably, Begich has been one of a small number of co-sponsors on bills that have passed, and legislative language he sponsored has ended up enacted in bills with someone else’s name on it. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Dan Sullivan	None	None	None	2014-09-22T12:24:03	2014-09-17	['Mark_Begich']

pomt-10014	"The 1908 Model T earned better gas mileage than a typical SUV sold in 2008."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/mar/19/barack-obama/model-t-better-mileage-SUVs/	President Barack Obama lamented the nation's dependence on foreign oil when visiting an electric car testing center in California on March 19, 2009. "The problem is that, for decades, we have avoided doing what must be done as a nation to turn challenge into opportunity," Obama said. "As a consequence, we import more oil today than we did on 9/11. The 1908 Model T earned better gas mileage than a typical SUV sold in 2008. And even as our economy has been transformed by new forms of technology, our electric grid looks largely the same as it did half a century ago." We've written about Obama's positions on imported oil and the electric grid before. But the Model T gets better mileage than an SUV? Really? To answer this question, we first wanted to look at the mileage for "a typical SUV sold in 2008." There are many ways to slice and dice fuel efficiency numbers, and looking up the mileage for your own particular vehicle is far easier than deciding on mileage for a "typical SUV." But the Environmental Protection Agency found that light trucks — the class of vehicle to which SUVs belong — averaged 18.1 miles per gallon for model year 2008. The most efficient SUVs do much better than that — a Jeep Compass gets 23 mpg in the city and 28 on the highway — but Obama said "typical." To find out what a Model T averaged, we consulted Bob Casey, author of The Model T: A Centennial History , and the curator of transportation at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Mich. (The museum is named for Ford but independent of the Ford Motor Co.) He said the best estimate for a Model T's mileage is 20 miles per gallon, though it might be able to get 25 under the right conditions. So technically Obama is right. But his implication is that we haven't gotten more fuel efficient in 100 years. And that's a reach. Let's look at the differences between today's SUVs and the Model T of 1908. To start with, Casey said, Model Ts reached top speeds of only 40 miles an hour. They guzzled motor oil, about a quart a month. The original tops were made of canvas, and they had no heating or cooling systems. They also had none of the safety features of modern cars: no bumpers, no air bags, no seat belts, no antilock breaks. The cars had large, skinny wheels to more easily clear the obstacles on rocky, rutted roads. Corner them too fast and they could tip over. And if you crashed, the windshield would usually shatter into sharp, jagged pieces that could slice you to ribbons. "The government would not allow anyone to sell Model Ts today because they're so unsafe," Casey said. "It's a car that no one would use on a regular basis today. It's not a fair comparison." We agree that the two cars are totally different. But Obama was careful in the way he phrased his statement: "The 1908 Model T earned better gas mileage than a typical SUV sold in 2008." As long as you don't consider any factors other than mileage, he's right. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2009-03-19T13:50:57	2009-03-19	['None']
pomt-11068	"Busted: Obama is holding secret meetings to overtake the White House"	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2018/jun/21/blog-posting/-website-falsely-claims-obama-was-bust/	A recent clickbait headline claimed former President Barack Obama was caught holding private meetings in an effort to retake the White House. The headline spins the narrative in a way that could mislead readers. "Busted: Obama is holding secret meetings to overtake the White House," said a June 11, 2018, headline from Redstate Watcher, a conservative website that seeks "to forward the Trump agenda," according to the about section on its Facebook page. The same story appeared on several other conservative blog sites. Obama trying to take over the White House? It's not like that, based on what's been reported. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) "Obama is continuing to break former president protocol by trying to infiltrate current administration," the story said, citing a report from the Washington Examiner detailing Obama’s private, one-on-one meetings with prospective Democratic presidential candidates. The story said Obama was eager to play a role in advising leading Democrats and shaping the party’s future. The story said he has insisted that 2020 hopefuls continue framing discussions around the special counsel’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election because it "sticks with voters in the long run." We decided to take a look at the story and see how its claim checked out. We found that its contents can be traced back to a June 11, 2018, report from Politico. (The Washington Examiner story cited Politico as its source). But the few discrepancies between the original Politico report and the post from Redstate Watcher cast a misleading light on the latter’s narrative. For one, the Politico report said of the Russia investigations: "Many of the conversations have circled around Obama holding forth about how much Democrats should be heading into the midterms talking about the investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election versus focusing on kitchen table issues … Think about what’s going to stick in the long term." The Politico story also said nothing about Obama breaking any formal or informal protocol for past presidents or attempting to "infiltrate" President Donald Trump’s administration. We searched Google and Nexis and could not find any credible reports saying that. Redstate Watcher responded to a Facebook message by noting that the story featured "a clickbait title" and criticizing readers and fact-checkers who "pick and choose which words you feel like taking literally and which words you take figuratively." Obama did arrange multiple private meetings with potential Democratic presidential candidates. But the former president was never "busted" for working in secret to "infiltrate" and "overtake" the Trump White House. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-02237	Says Charlie Crist "implemented Jeb Bush’s A+ Plan."	true	/florida/statements/2014/apr/15/progressive-choice/charlie-crist-implemented-jeb-bushs-plan-group-say/	Gov. Rick Scott isn’t the only one attacking presumptive gubernatorial rival Charlie Crist. An outside group called Progressive Choice Florida has taken a few shots as well -- although there’s some question as to which side the group is on. In a flier that appeared in Florida mailboxes around March 30, the group attacks Crist’s history as a GOP member, saying "Conservative Republican Charlie Crist is no friend of progressive Democrats." It then lists several examples: "Charlie Crist’s record proves he is … -- Pro-life -- NRA A+ rated -- ‘Chain Gang Charlie’ -- Implemented Jeb Bush’s A+ Plan -- Signed petition banning gay marriage" Interesting to note is the mystery over exactly who funds Progressive Choice, the Florida chapter’s parent organization. It claims on a bare bones website that the larger group is "a diverse coalition of fair-minded, forward-thinking individuals and organizations advocating for leadership that stands firm on progressive principles and genuinely reflects the interests of all progressives across the nation." The site also lists the group as "a 501(c)(4) social welfare advocacy organization." There has been some speculation that Progressive Choice is a GOP front funded to draw Democratic voters away from Crist, particularly in the upcoming primary against Nan Rich. The group is not yet listed with the Federal Election Commission or the Florida Division of Elections, so contributions so far are untraceable. The mailer lists a Washington P.O. box and says the mailers were sent from Orlando. We’ve dealt with some of those claims before, but the part about Bush’s education plan gave us pause. Then we remembered that before he was governor, Crist was education commissioner. We dug into the archives to find out the whole story. The A+ Plan Bush floated the idea of overhauling Florida education standards during his 1998 campaign, crafting a plan with then-Education Commissioner Frank Brogan, who was his running mate. The plan suggested expanding the use of the Florida Comprehensive Achievement Test, which at the time was new and administered to fourth-, eighth- and 10th-graders. Student test performance (along with attendance and violence rates, and graduation rates at high schools) would be used to give schools a letter grade of A, B, C, D or F. The proposal rewarded with monetary bonuses schools that earned an A, or improved their grade in a year. Failing schools had two years to improve or would be turned over to the state. The state could then change school staff and implement changes as it saw fit. Students at F schools could transfer to private schools with taxpayer-funded vouchers. Critics were especially vocal about the vouchers, saying it would take much-needed funding away from public schools. The use of standardized test scores also was controversial. Bush was elected and announced his A+ Plan for Education his first month in office. This version required annual FCAT testing for grades 3 through 10 each year, with a passing grade required for promotion. The grading and voucher components remained, with higher school grades resulting in more funding. The Republican-controlled Legislature approved the plan in 1999. Enter Education Commissioner Crist. Crist won a statewide election for the post after Tom Gallagher, who became commissioner in 1999, resigned to run for U.S. Senate in 2000. Crist took office in 2001 and served until 2003, when the elected Cabinet post changed to an appointed position under a new law. One of Crist’s duties was to follow the education agenda set by Bush and the Legislature before Crist took office. His campaign acknowledged that Crist put Bush’s plan into action. "Charlie was education commissioner from 2001-2003, so of course he would be responsible for implementing A+," campaign spokesman Steve Geller told PolitiFact Florida in an email. "A+ was passed by the Florida Legislature ... and any education commissioner would have had to implement these plans." But did he support the plan he was putting into effect? Progressive Choice certainly thinks so. Jamie Fontaine-Gansell, a Progressive Choice spokeswoman, cited a 2000 Orlando Sentinel voter’s guide article in which candidate Crist said, "I am an ardent supporter of Gov. Jeb Bush's A+ plan, which provides for an even balance of testing and accountability and has proven to improve performance in our public schools." Then-Attorney General Crist tripped over standardized testing while running for governor in 2006, most notably being ridiculed for telling the Palm Beach Post he didn’t know what time of year the FCAT was administered to students, or even what a passing score was. He also waffled on strict education standards. ''I think it's important, as we make these decisions regarding education, we're willing to be flexible,'' he told the Miami Herald in 2006. "I'm willing to be flexible as it relates to the timing (of the FCAT), as it relates to the subject matter, as it relates to how students are prepared for the test. But I think it's important to test." During his current run for governor, Crist said he supported new Common Core standards and focusing on teacher support, spending most of his time bashing Scott’s early record of cutting school funding after Crist left office in 2011. Standardized testing hasn’t been a major talking point, but he hasn’t specifically opposed it, either. Meanwhile, Florida still embraces testing and its grading program, though it is considering new programs and testing regimes. Current Education Commissioner Pam Stewart this year suggested simplifying the process, focusing on new math and language arts parameters, and a new standardized test already being adopted. Stewart in February proposed a system based on a combination of test scores, grade level performance, graduation rates and college credit or industry certifications. She also wanted to get rid of monetary bonuses and penalties. It’s currently on the agenda in Tallahassee. Our ruling Progressive Choice Florida said Crist "implemented Jeb Bush’s A+ Plan." Since Crist was education commissioner after the plan was passed by the Legislature, that’s to be expected. When we went back to see if Crist approved of the plan’s details, he said he did.

pomt-09760	"The truth is any oil that would be drilled could be sent to any other country in the world, reducing our use of foreign oil not by one single drop."	half-true	/florida/statements/2009/oct/05/bill-nelson/Bill-Nelson-says-offshore-oil-drilling-in-the-Gulf/	The whole fervor behind "Drill, baby drill!" was to reduce America’s dependence on foreign oil, right? We thought so, too. So listen to this: U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, the Florida Democrat opposing drilling closer to Florida's shoreline, says increased drilling in the Gulf of Mexico might not help America at all. "Supporters of opening up the eastern gulf say that we need to do it to help get America off foreign oil," Nelson said on the Senate floor in June. "Tell me then why isn't there a clause in the drilling amendment that was passed specifying that all oil and natural gas that would be produced in the eastern gulf … stay in the United States for domestic consumption? "But no, that's not there. Because the truth is any oil that would be drilled could be sent to any other country in the world, reducing our use of foreign oil not by one single drop." Naturally, we wondered if Nelson's claim about oil drilling in the gulf is true. His comments refer to the massive energy bill sitting in the U.S. Senate. The bill, officially called the American Clean Energy Leadership Act of 2009, would allow oil drilling within 45 miles of the Florida coastline and closer in areas near the Panhandle. We examined the 532-page bill to see what would become of that newfound oil and found no restrictions on where it ends up. We confirmed that with David Marks, press assistant at the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. "There are no restrictions in the bill," he said. While the bill contains no limits on where the oil can flow, there have been limits placed on American oil previously. During the 1973 Arab oil embargo, Congress authorized the construction of a Trans-Alaska Pipeline System to funnel oil from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez, Alaska. But the approval came with a restriction: Alaska oil could not be exported. The ban remained in place until 1996, according to the Energy Information Administration, an arm of the U.S. Department of Energy. So without a ban, the crude oil collected in the eastern Gulf of Mexico could indeed be shipped anywhere. Would it though? The answer is most likely not. Currently, almost all of the crude oil pumped in the western Gulf of Mexico is transported via a 10,000-mile pipeline network to U.S. shores. That crude oil is then mixed with imported crude oil and refined at onshore facilities into gasoline, jet fuel and kerosene. Some of the oil even becomes asphalt. Paul Hess, an analyst at the Energy Information Administration, said "very little" gulf crude oil is exported, if any. "It's a very small amount," Hess said. "We don't track that level of detail." Offshore oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico produced about 1.17 million barrels of crude oil a day in 2008. In 2006, for instance, the EIA recorded crude oil exports in its gulf coast region — which is made up of more than just the Gulf of Mexico — at 1,000 barrels of crude oil a day. In 2008, there were no recorded exports. Mickey Driver, a spokesman with Chevron, said that all of his company's 200,000 barrels a day of gulf oil is shipped via pipeline to the United States, where it is consumed. "It would make no economic sense and it would absolutely make no process sense to do anything else," Driver said. In other words, why pay to ship gulf crude around the world when an oil-hungry U.S. market is right there waiting to pay for it? The United States already has to import about two-thirds of the crude oil it uses. It should be noted that a Brazilian company, Petrobras, is in the process of building a type of offshore refinery that would process crude oil offshore rather than build a pipeline to the Louisiana coast. That refined oil then would be moved by tanker ship. Petrobras America spokesman Ciro Ribeiro said the offshore processing facility will be up and running in 2010. "The destination should be the domestic market," Ribeiro said. "Any port in the Gulf of Mexico." Nelson is right when he says that "oil that would be drilled could be sent to any other country in the world," because the federal legislation doesn’t now include any limits. But he doesn't offer the broader context. History shows that most domestic crude oil is used domestically. On the whole, we rate Nelson's claim Half True.

pomt-02768	"Obamacare is going to increase the divorce rate."	false	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/11/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-says-obamacare-will-cause-increase-d/	If you think divorce is prevalent now, just wait. Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh says marriage in the United States is poised to crumble for a whole new reason. Yes, the culprit is Obamacare. The point came up as Limbaugh chatted with a caller from Jacksonville, Fla., on his Dec. 6, 2013, talk show. Jim the caller: "Greetings, Rush. My concern is about unintended social consequences of the Obama No Care Act. Think about it. There's supplements for having a lower income. ... Will there be an incentive not to be married or to get divorced? You'll get incentives on the Obamacare side." Limbaugh: "You know, you are very shrewd, Jim, because there is a story we had, it might have been late last week, that people are divorcing in order to afford Obamacare. It is busting up families. Obamacare is going to increase the divorce rate." We decided to fact-check Limbaugh’s claim that "Obamacare is going to increase the divorce rate." A month-old anecdote The news story Limbaugh referenced was about a New York couple considering a divorce so they could qualify for subsidies individually to offset the cost of health care under the new law. The story did not address Limbaugh’s claim that the health care law will increase the country’s divorce rate, leading us to wonder if there is credible research to support his assertion. The early verdict: Experts say there is no evidence or research that suggests the health care law will grow the divorce rate. But the law does contain a "marriage penalty," which essentially means unmarried couples could pay less for health insurance because they have separate, smaller incomes than married couples whose combined income exceeds the cut-off for federal financial assistance. And at least one couple considered divorce to avoid increased health care costs. Emphasis on "considered." The Atlantic spotlighted one married couple to illustrate the "marriage penalty" disparity, and a CBS affiliate in New York picked up the story the next day. Writer Nona Willis Aronowitz told the magazine she got married in 2009 so her freelance filmmaker-husband Aaron Cassara could receive health insurance through her employer. But her job ended when her employer laid off her editorial division. The layoff left her with a COBRA plan that was more expensive but allowed her to maintain temporary health coverage at a group rate. Faced with a Jan. 1 end date for that coverage, which did not extend to her husband because it cost too much, she checked out her options on the New York health insurance exchange set up under the health care law. She and her husband earned more than 400 percent of the 2012 federal poverty level, or $62,040 for a family of two, which made them ineligible for premium assistance. Under the law, people whose family income is between 100 and 400 percent of federal poverty are eligible for premium support. However, had they not been married and sought health insurance on their own, their individual incomes would have qualified for them for subsidies because they would have been under the cut-off income for one person, or $45,980. "In our case, it would be worth it," Aronowitz said of getting divorced to CBS2. "In other people’s cases, where marriage is really, really important to them and they had a big wedding and it was this sacred experience, I think it would be a really tough decision for them." We reached out to Aronowitz to find out what’s happened in the month since word of her story broke. Aronowitz told PunditFact she recently obtained a full-time job and can now afford health insurance for her and her husband in 2014 on the state exchange. The couple, therefore, is not seeking a divorce. Broader impact? The health care law is not the first government program to have a "marriage tax" issue. It also comes up under current U.S. income tax law and for programs such as food stamps, temporary cash assistance and others. Whenever eligibility for a program depends on a sliding-scale subsidy based on income and family size, there is the potential for "encouraging" couples to marry or not marry, said Gail Wilensky, director of Medicaid and Medicare under President George H.W. Bush. Teasing out the effect of the Affordable Care Act marriage penalty on divorce rates would not be easy. "My guess is that at the most, this kind of effect is more annoying than impactful. You would have to be pretty indifferent as to whether you married or didn’t marry to have tax or subsidy consequences determine your decision," Wilensky said. "But small is not the same as none." In the case of health insurance, marriage actually also brings benefits. Married couples have more access to insurance, as many large employers offer family plans that extend to an employee’s married spouse and dependents. That’s why Aronowitz said she and her husband got married in the first place. According to an October 2013 report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, the percentage of uninsured married adults is about 15 percent of the population, compared to 33 percent for single adults living together. Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said married couples are most affected by the "marriage penalty" when two things happen: Neither person is eligible for affordable health insurance under an employer's plan, and the couple is eligible for a more sizable government insurance subsidy as two unmarried adults rather than as a married couple. But the law also contains some "marriage bonuses," similar to U.S. tax law, he said. Some companies will feel compelled to offer health insurance to their employees so they do not face tax penalties. Many will offer family insurance plans, which would be enticing for the married spouse of an employee, Burtless said. "I’m sure we’ll hear anecdotes over the next few months and years, and I’m sure some of the anecdotes will be described in occasional press stories," Burtless said. "But it will be many years, if ever, before a careful examination of the evidence shows whether the ‘marriage penalty’ in the ACA has a bigger impact discouraging marriage or encouraging divorce than the ‘marriage bonus’ in the ACA has in encouraging marriage or discouraging divorce." Limbaugh’s statement is "pure conjecture" at this point, said Andrew Cherlin, a professor of public policy and sociology at Johns Hopkins University. "It could also have a positive effect on marriage, as it lowers health insurance premiums for low-income couples (who have a higher divorce rate) and as it makes people healthier, which could increase their earnings," Cherlin said. "We don't know what the balance will be." Divorce statistics are a whole other matter. The country does not keep comprehensive data. One measure is the rate of divorce per 1,000 population. The divorce rate was 3.6 divorces per 1,000 population in 2011, according to rough numbers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. However, those CDC statistics are imperfect because several states do not report divorce and annulment data to the feds, including the most populous state of California. Divorce has been on the decline since 1980, said Brad Wilcox, director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia. Marriage has become more selective, and more couples are living together without getting married. Couples who are better educated and more affluent are more likely to get married and are less likely to divorce, he said. "So if Obamacare exacts a major marriage penalty on couples, it may increase divorce at the margins," he said. The oft-repeated stat that 50 percent of marriages end in divorce is essentially true for the overall population, but the odds decline when factors such as college education, religious affiliation, home life and marrying at a later age are considered, according to a 2012 report by the National Marriage Project and the Center for Marriage and Families at the Institute for American Values. An October 2013 report by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics found the likelihood of a marriage ending in divorce a bit lower, between 40-45 percent. We emailed Limbaugh's show but did not hear back. Our ruling Limbaugh said, "Obamacare is going to increase the divorce rate." There is concern about a "marriage penalty," which exists for other federal programs with sliding income eligibility scales, with the Affordable Care Act, and there is anecdotal evidence that at least one couple considered divorce to avoid it. (The postscript: She got a new full-time job and can afford insurance on the exchange, so they’re still married.) But there is no research that suggests this will substantially affect the country’s divorce rate, which is a little hard to measure in the first place. Experts said the effect may be marginal, as no one has done the research to nail down reasonable expectations. We rate this False.

pomt-00547	"Our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don't believe the 5.6. Don't believe it."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/16/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-real-unemployment-rate-18-20-per/	Don’t trust government unemployment statistics, Donald Trump said during his presidential campaign announcement speech. "Our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent," Trump said. "Don't believe the 5.6. Don't believe it." We’ve previously debunked the notion that the government somehow cooks the books when it calculates the unemployment rate. But is there a legitimate statistic that reaches as high as 18 to 20 percent? (Trump's staff did not return inquiries from PolitiFact.) As it happens, there are measures of unemployment beyond the familiar unemployment rate (which, we’ll note, is actually 5.5 percent, not 5.6 percent as Trump said). However, none of the more expansive measures comes close to the level Trump suggests. The most expansive statistic calculated by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, called the U-6 rate, is sometimes offered as a more "complete" picture of joblessness. It doesn’t just include those BLS officially considers "unemployed" but also those working part time for economic reasons as well as those who are "marginally attached" to the work force, meaning they want to work but have not looked for work recently enough to count as being actively in the labor force. Currently, the U-6 rate of "labor underutilization" is 10.8 percent. That’s higher than the more familiar 5.5 percent unemployment rate, but it’s also well below the 18 to 20 percent Trump claimed. So is there another credible way to calculate it? Maybe. One could assemble a more expansive measurement of under-employment than U-6 -- one that ropes in even more Americans whose job outlook has been affected by the weak post-recession labor markets. For instance, U-6 doesn’t count recent graduates who never entered the labor market in the first place because they feared there would be no jobs for them, and it doesn’t count people who chose to take care of their kids full-time, went back to school or retired early to avoid having to compete for a job. Pinpointing the size of this group is not possible given the type of data BLS collects, but we can at least calculate something approximating an upper limit. To do this, we can use data that shows the number of people 16 and over who are "not in the labor force" -- that is, those who are neither working nor looking for work. If you take the number of people in this category at the beginning of President Barack Obama’s term and compare it to the number today, it gives a sense of how many people have shied away from the workforce in the wake of the last recession. In January 2009, there were 80.5 million Americans 16 and over who were not in the labor force. Today, that number is slightly below 93 million. So the number not in the labor force has increased by about 12.5 million. If you factor this number into the U-6 calculation (and subtract the "marginally attached" category to avoid double counting) you get a back-of-the-envelope rate of 16 percent. But even this is almost certainly too high, since that would assume that every one of those 12.5 million Americans staying out of the workforce in the Obama years has done so because of the poor job market. In reality, we’re in the midst of the first big wave of Baby Boom retirements, so a share of those 12.5 million likely reflect this historically large pool of retirees. For the sake of argument, let’s assume that half the additional increase in people out of the labor force comes from the Baby Boom retirement surge. That would mean the "new" unemployment rate -- perhaps we can call this new statistic "U-7" -- is about 13 percent. Other guesstimates would produce slightly higher or lower percentages, but the important thing is that the numbers in this range are well short of the 18 to 20 percent Trump mentioned. Getting the number up to 18 or 20 percent would probably require roping into the count people who are high-school and college students and people who are happily retired -- that is, people who technically aren’t working, but who have no reason to be. And that’s a bridge too far. "A candidate for president should know the definition of unemployment," said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist. Our ruling Trump said, "Our real unemployment is anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don't believe the 5.6. Don't believe it." Setting aside his paranoia about the federal government cooking the books, Trump is off-base even if you give him the maximum benefit of the doubt. The highest official government statistic for under-employment is 10.8 percent -- roughly half as high as Trump says. And if you make a quick and dirty attempt to expand the scope of this measurement to include other Americans left uncounted in the standard statistics, there’s no plausible way to get it past 16 percent -- and even that’s stretching it. That’s well below the range Trump cited, so we rate the claim False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-06-16T18:40:36	2015-06-16	['None']
pomt-06882	"Our government has spent $2.6 million to teach Chinese prostitutes how to drink responsibly."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/29/judson-phillips/founder-tea-party-nation-claims-us-government-has-/	America has a spending crisis, not a debt crisis, Judson Phillips, founder and chief executive of Tea Party Nation, argued in an opinion piece published by the Washington Post on July 27, 2011. He called the federal government bloated and lambasted legislators for funding too many wasteful programs. And then he offered a few examples. "Americans rightly think there is something wrong when our government has spent $2.6 million to teach Chinese prostitutes how to drink responsibly," Phillips wrote. We fact-checked a similar claim during the midterm elections. The claim was that members of Congress voted for the project as part of the stimulus. Actually, the project was not part of the stimulus, and members of Congress had no way of knowing research funding would go to study prostitutes. Because of these other distortions -- that the op-ed doesn't make -- we gave the 2010 claim a Pants on Fire. But there's not nothing here. In November 2008, the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health awarded a 5-year, $2.6 million grant to Wayne State University in Detroit to allow Dr. Xiaoming Li, professor and director of the university's Prevention Research Center, to "establish and evaluate whether an alcohol and HIV intervention center can assist in reducing the spread of HIV/AIDS among sex workers in China," according to a university press release announcing the grant. According to the release, "The findings could have ramifications for at-risk populations throughout the world." The research will take place specifically in Guangxi, China, where the sex trade is prevalent and the rate of HIV is ranked third among the country's provinces, the release states. A spokesman for the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism of the National Institutes of Health told us the ad distorted the aim of the project. The grant "was not awarded for that purpose," John Bowersox told us via e-mail back in November 2010. "Rather, the researchers will use the grant to develop, implement and evaluate an alcohol use and HIV risk reduction intervention program among female sex workers in China. This is in line with previous studies showing that social norms and institutional policy in commercial sex venues greatly influence alcohol use and sexual behavior among the sex workers in those venues. Studies such as these are needed to translate and adapt interventions that have proven to be effective in the U.S. to other settings and to learn from other conditions and cultures to inform our understanding of the causes, consequences and differences in HIV-related risks, morbidity and mortality in diverse populations. Preventing HIV infection is NIH’s highest priority for HIV-related research. We need to explore a range of research avenues in vulnerable populations around the world to learn the best ways to control the transmission of HIV." Bowersox noted that the grant went through the NIH's two-tier review process, "which includes a scientific and technical review as well as consideration by an Advisory Council that includes public representatives. The Council makes recommendations based on alignment of the grant application with the research priorities of the NIH." The grant first came into the national discussion after CNSNews.com (The Right News. Right Now) ran a story under the headline, "U.S. Will Pay $2.6 Million to Train Chinese Prostitutes to Drink Responsibly on the Job." In an interview with CNSNews.com, Professor Li said, "The purpose of the project is to try and develop an intervention program targeting HIV risk and alcohol use. So basically, it’s an alcohol and HIV risk reduction intervention project." "We want to get some understanding of the fundamental role of alcohol use and HIV risk," Li told CNSNews.com. "We use the population in China as our targeted population to look at the basic issues. I think the findings will benefit the American people, too." The CNSNews story ran on May 11, 2009. That was about the time that a lot of Republican members of Congress were putting out lists of stimulus projects they said were wasteful or unrelated to job creation. But, as the CNSNews.com story noted, the grant for the project was awarded in November 2008. That's pre-stimulus. It's also pre-Obama administration. But Phillips did not refer to the spending as a stimulus program. Nor did Phillips assign responsibility for funding it to any particular party (though earlier in the article, he referred to the "Obama-Pelosi-Reid axis of fiscal evil"). However, Phillips does distort the purpose of the grant. And while some may question the actual purpose of the grant, it was awarded by the National Institutes for Health based on its own internal review process and was determined to be within the institution's mission and priorities. There is an alcohol intervention aspect to the project, but the larger purpose is HIV study and prevention. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-10380	We're borrowing money from China and Saudi Arabia "to finance this war" in Iraq.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/20/barack-obama/other-countries-too/	The presidential candidates are fond of talking about how we like to borrow from Peter to pay Paul, and how bad this is. ( Read our story on this phenomenon here .) "We took out a credit card from the bank of China and the bank of Saudi in the name of our kids, borrowing money to finance this war," Obama said on the campaign trail in May 2008. "You're going to be paying them interest for generations to come -- that makes us weaker." Obama's correct in his implication that the U.S. is borrowing money to fund the war, because the U.S. government is running budget deficits, meaning the government is spending more money than it brings in through taxes and fees. Of course, the government cannot just print extra paper money when it needs to spend or it would devalue U.S. currency. Instead, it issues, or more precisely sells, U.S. Treasury securities, which are simply IOUs that guarantee repayment with interest. Many U.S. citizens buy them, often in the form of U.S. bonds, but so do many foreign countries, who see them as a safe, stable investment. The number one holder of U.S. Treasury securities among foreign countries isn't China or Saudi Arabia. It's actually Japan. China is number two, the United Kingdom is number three, and a group of oil-producing countries (which includes Saudi Arabia) is number four. So, here's the problem with Obama's argument. And with McCain's. And with Clinton's, while we're at it. All have made similar statements. The bonds the government sells are not program-specific so there is no direct relationship between the holder of bonds and any particular expense of the U.S. government. Obama could have easily said that Japan or the United Kingdom is lending us money to pay for the war, and that would have been just as true as what he did say. So Obama is correct in his point that the government is spending borrowed money, and that some of our lenders include China and Saudi Arabia. But the lenders also include countries that we think of as friends and allies. By naming only lending nations that might alarm voters, Obama is distorting the picture somewhat. So for this reason, we find his statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-06-20T00:00:00	2008-05-13	['Saudi_Arabia', 'China', 'Iraq']
pomt-05626	"Nearly 45 percent of the women who receive health screenings through (the Women’s Health Program) do so at a Planned Parenthood health center."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/mar/24/elliott-naishtat/democratic-legislators-say-nearly-45-women-who-get/	Speaking out against the exclusion of Planned Parenthood clinics from a Texas family planning program for low-income women, five Democratic legislators aired a statistic indicating that the group is a crucial provider. "Nearly 45 percent of the women who receive health screenings through this program do so at a Planned Parenthood health center," said a commentary in the March 6, 2012, Austin American-Statesman by Austin state Reps. Elliott Naishtat, Dawnna Dukes, Eddie Rodriguez, Mark Strama and Donna Howard. We looked into that figure amid debate over the state’s decision, which led the Obama administration to set in motion a phased-in cutoff of about $30 million in annual federal funds for the Texas Medicaid Women’s Health Program, which has served tens of thousands of women a year since its launch in 2007. To participate in the program, providers may not perform elective abortions. Since the program’s start, dozens of Planned Parenthood health centers in Texas have qualified because they don’t provide abortions and are legally separated from Planned Parenthood clinics that do. That is changing, however. The Texas health and human services commissioner signed a rule in February 2012 barring entities affiliated with abortion providers from the program, which had the effect of disqualifying Planned Parenthood health centers that do not provide abortions. In response, the Obama administration declined to renew the program, arguing that Texas’ new rule violates federal law by restricting women’s abilities to choose their own caregivers. Perry has pledged to continue the program with state money — and without Planned Parenthood. Under the program, participating women may receive health screenings, including a Pap smear, during the one family planning exam per fiscal year that the program covers. Examples of other screenings, related to family planning, that women can get during their visit: breast exam, pregnancy test, routine urinalysis, as well as testing for diabetes, sexually transmitted diseases and high blood pressure. Screenings are not covered outside of the annual exam. The program also pays for birth control such as pills and condoms. Naishtat aide Nancy Walker told us by email that the "nearly 45 percent" figure came from "multiple sources," including the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. She said the agency told her that in fiscal 2010, about 46 percent of clients in the state’s Women’s Health Program had received services from Planned Parenthood — which, we noticed, is a wider description than the legislators’ reference solely to "health screenings." Commission spokeswoman Stephanie Goodman told us that the state has not compiled data on where women in the program receive health screenings. Asked about the figure that Naishtat’s aide cited from the commission, Goodman told us that the figure is based on a data analysis for fiscal 2010 — Sept. 1, 2009, through Aug. 31, 2010 — showing that of the 106,711 women who were served by the program, 49,162 received a service from a Planned Parenthood clinic. That’s 46.1 percent. We wondered, though, if it’s correct to assume that all women in the program received health screenings, as the Democrats’ article suggests. Goodman speculated that it might be, pointing out that all women in the program are entitled to an annual exam with health screenings. Also, the Democrats’ article leaves the impression that the referenced women solely depended on Planned Parenthood clinics for their screenings. That might not be so. According to the commission’s figures, 27,256 of the 49,162 Women’s Health Program clients who were served by Planned Parenthood in fiscal 2010 also received a Women’s Health Program service from a provider not linked to Planned Parenthood. In a previous fact-check, we laid out a couple of possible explanations for those women being served by both Planned Parenthood and another type of provider. For one, some portion of the 27,256 women may have had their exams and screenings at a Planned Parenthood clinic and then any tests processed at an outside lab. In those cases — and the state couldn’t tell us how many of them there were — the only "services" that a woman would have received from a non-Planned Parenthood provider was lab testing. These women would not affect the Democrats’ statistic, since they received their screenings at Planned Parenthood. But under the program, it’s also possible for women to switch providers during the year and receive another exam and screenings. So some portion of the 27,256 women may have received screenings from both a Planned Parenthood and a non-Planned Parenthood provider during fiscal 2010. And if the number were large enough, the percentage of women in the program who received their screenings exclusively from a Planned Parenthood clinic would be smaller than 46 percent. Goodman told us the state has not teased out the detailed data that would settle this issue. Our ruling The Democratic legislators wrote that nearly 45 percent of women who received health screenings through the targeted family-planning program in fiscal 2010 had them at Planned Parenthood clinics. That could be so, but we identified a couple of unsettled hitches. According to the state, 46 percent of the cited program’s clients went to a Planned Parenthood clinic, but the state has no breakdown of the number of women who were screened overall, which is what the Democrats focused on. Also, the Democrats’ statement implies that 46 percent of women rely on Planned Parenthood exclusively for screenings, but some women included in the 46 percent could have had screenings at a different kind of clinic, though (again) such details are not available. We rate the claim Half True.	None	Elliott Naishtat	None	None	None	2012-03-24T18:54:43	2012-03-05	['None']

pomt-10439	"Clinton aides admit it (a gas tax holiday) won't do much for you – but would help her politically."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/07/barack-obama/aides-said-"even-if"-it-doesnt-work/	An ad for Sen. Barack Obama attacks Sen. Hillary Clinton on her gas tax holiday proposal: "More 'low road' attacks from Hillary Clinton…Now she's pushing a 'bogus' gas tax gimmick…Experts say it'll just 'boost oil industry profits' ….they'll 'simply raise prices and pocket… the difference.' Clinton aides admit it won't do much for you – but would help her politically. So here's the choice…Clinton gimmicks that help big oil…or Barack Obama… a real energy plan and a $1,000 middle class tax cut to help families truly pay the bills." On the stump, Obama has echoed the same point. "In a moment of candor, her advisors actually admitted that it wouldn't have much of an effect on gas prices," Obama said. Clinton aides said their own boss' plan won't work? That's a pretty big act of political self-sabotage on the part of those Clinton aides -- if it's true. The Obama campaign pointed to a quote in an April 30, 2008, report by Perry Bacon Jr. of the Washington Post . The report appeared on its campaign blog The Trail . The story highlights Clinton's growing confidence in the days before the North Carolina and Indiana primaries -- confidence that proved misplaced as Clinton lost North Carolina and won Indiana by two points. The story describes campaign strategies, the controversy over Obama's former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah Wright, and the gas tax holiday. Here's the single sentence about what her aides said about the gas tax: "Clinton aides think that even if the measure is a limited way to reduce gas prices, it allows the candidate to bash oil companies and cast her opponent against an idea that has political appeal." That doesn't sound like an admission from Clinton aides that the gas tax holiday won't work. Note the words "even if" -- it sounds more like a response to critics who say it won't work. (And there are many critics who say it won't work; see our previous story on gas taxes here .) Clinton's aides seem to be saying that even if the critics are right, the gas tax holiday still has political benefits for Clinton. But it doesn't say that the aides themselves believe that to be the case. Granted, this is a close reading of one sentence that hinges on the key words "even if." Nevertheless, the Obama campaign ad and Obama himself seem to be puffing up the sentence to say more than it actually says. Do Clinton aides think that the gas tax won't work? Certainly it's possible, but the Washington Post story doesn't answer that question. The sentence is a paraphrase of an anonymous source, which makes it impossible to find out what the aides really think. Obama says that Clinton aides admit the plan won't do much good. We find the aides say that it's a plan that has political benefits, whether it works or not. There's a gap between those two statements. We rate Obama's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05173	Say Portland Public Schools' central administration makes up less than 4 percent of the staff.	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2012/jun/15/portland-public-schools/portland-public-schools-administration-top-heavy/	Portland Public Schools, like most of Oregon’s school districts, is struggling to keep class sizes down and school years full even as budget conditions force reductions. In a recent opinion piece printed in The Oregonian, one parent advocate suggested the district try harder to consolidate schools before asking voters to approve a bond. "Cut bureaucracy," wrote Lainie Block Wilker. "Media reports confirm PPS' top-heavy bureaucracy. KPMG's audit recommended reducing management layers." This didn’t sit so well with some school board members, who promptly responded with their own opinion piece, also printed by The Oregonian. (Five others also signed onto this commentary.) "Wilker claims that PPS administration is "top-heavy," wrote members Ruth Adkins and Trudy Sargent. "The 14-year-old KPMG audit she cites actually commended the district for ‘maintaining a lean administrative staff that accounts for 8 percent of PPS' total staff.’ Since then, central administration has been reduced by one-half and is now less than 4 percent of PPS's staff. Next year's budget further reduces central staff by 10 percent. Central administrative costs are not a reason to oppose the bond." As reporters, we’re always a little suspicious when it comes to bureaucratic management, so we decided to check out the claim that central administration is "less than 4 percent of PPS’s staff." First, we went back to the audit that got flagged in both commentaries. The "Comprehensive Performance Audit of the Portland Public Schools" was published Sept. 3, 1998, by auditing firm KPMG. The audit points out several shortcomings of the district -- but the size of the administration is certainly not one. In one section, as the two board members point out, the audit commends the district for "maintaining a lean administrative staff that accounts for 8% of PPS’ total staff." That’s not to say the audit didn’t find some places for further reductions. Auditors identified various areas where management could be shaved, but time and time again it confirms that the number of management layers and the ratio of managers to non-managers met industry "best practices." The auditors, unfortunately, did not clarify what they meant by "administrative staff." We called the auditing firm, but they weren’t able to track down anybody familiar enough with the 14-year-old audit to give us definitions. Our next stop was Portland Public Schools spokesman Matt Shelby, who outlined the staff breakdown for this year and next. The Oregon Department of Education asks school districts to classify spending under four specific categories: direct classroom, classroom support, building support and central support. Currently, there are about 152 full-time-equivalent positions in central support at Portland Public Schools. This category, according to the state’s definition, includes "executive administration, business and fiscal services, personnel services, retirement incentives, and public information." That means it covers the superintendent’s office, as well as the legal, finance, insurance and human relation divisions -- among others. All told, there are some 4,048 budgeted FTE positions, which means that the board members were right -- central support makes up just under 4 percent of the total PPS staffing. That said, even though it’s a rigidly managed state definition, central support doesn’t cover all the positions that your average Oregonian might call "administrative." Building support, for example, which has 596 budget positions, includes IT, security, utilities, purchasing, warehouse and others. Direct classroom and classroom support make up the majority of staffing, more than 80 percent, including teachers, curriculum services, social work services, athletics and others. All this is to say, yes, "central support" -- which is the word the school board members used in their commentary -- is less than 4 percent of the PPS staff. But that definition covers a very specific sort of employee and not necessarily every employee that somebody on the outside might consider "administrative." Now, for that last bit. Is central support really getting cut by 10 percent next year? At first blush, no. There are 152 positions budgeted this year and 146 budgeted for the next. That’s a 4 percent decline. We checked in with Robb Cowie, the district’s chief spokesman, who pointed out that central support is really losing 15 positions when you consider that eight translation service positions are moving from other areas to central support. If you ignore that transfer, the board members are right about the 10 percent reduction. Is Portland Public Schools "top-heavy" as one parent advocate described it? That’s really not for us to say. What we can say, however, is that central support -- as the state defines it -- accounts for 4 percent of the budgeted positions at Portland Public Schools. We can also say that central support will see a 10 percent reduction in its current FTE positions next year. Technically, then, the board members are right on all counts. However, there’s some important context in the fact that central support is a bureaucratic term that doesn’t necessarily reflect the full scope of administrative employees working for Portland Public Schools. We rate this claim Mostly True -- it’s accurate, but it requires some clarification.	None	Portland Public Schools	None	None	None	2012-06-15T15:35:31	2012-06-11	['None']

pomt-10715	"Murder went up" when Romney was governor. "Robbery went up. Violent crimes went up."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/26/rudy-giuliani/murders-went-up-but-all-violence-declined/	We evaluated Rudy Giuliani's attack on Mitt Romney by looking at the FBI's uniform crime statistics. Romney became governor in January 2003 and left office in January 2007. Comparing the numbers between 2002 and 2006, we can calculate how crime rates changed in Massachusetts during the Romney administration. To count violent crime, the FBI includes murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault. In 2002, that number was 31,137 in Massachusetts. In 2006, it was 28,775. That means violent crime declined 7.6 percent, just like Romney claims. Giuliani is wrong on this point. But let's take a closer look at murders and robberies. Murders went up from 173 in 2002 to 186 in 2006, for an increase of 7.5 percent. The murder rate — the number of people murdered per 100,000 people — moved up from 2.7 to 2.9. Robberies increased more than murders. Robberies in Massachusetts increased from 7,169 to 8,047, a jump of 12.2 percent. The robbery rate increased from 111.5 to 125. So what made the violent crime rate go down if murders and robberies went up? The biggest category decline under Romney was aggravated assault, which declined from 22,018 to 18,800, a drop of 14.6 percent. Given these numbers, Giuliani is right when he says murders and robberies went up, but wrong when he says violent crime went up. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-08715	"Since being elected, (Tom Barrett) has dumped 8.2 billion gallons of raw sewage into Lake Michigan."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/sep/03/scott-walker/scott-walker-blames-tom-barrett-dumping-sewage-lak/	Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker is raising a stink over sewage. It’s a tempting target, especially when torrential rains July 22 and July 23 forced the dumping of untreated sewage into Lake Michigan and thousands of homes were hit with flooded basements. Walker, a Republican candidate for governor, is blaming his opponent, Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat, for dumping the sewage -- not only for the July overflows, but for releases going back to 2004, when Barrett was first elected. On at least two occasions, Walker campaign manager Keith Gilkes blamed Barrett for the recent mess and previous overflows. On Aug. 5, Gilkes made the charge during a visit to the city by Lisa Jackson, head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. On Aug. 11, he made the same charge after local communities complained about a large water rate increase being proposed by Barrett’s Milwaukee Water Works. With summer winding down, it’s a topic fresh in many people’s minds: torrents of water running through streets, the giant sinkhole on E. North Ave. that swallowed a Cadillac Escalade and the mounds of water-soaked junk carted from homes in the aftermath. Five to eight inches of rain fell July 22 and July 23, according to the National Weather Service. Officially, 5.61 inches fell at Mitchell International Airport, the second highest daily rainfall on record for Milwaukee. With so much rain, Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District reported it couldn’t treat 2.1 billion gallons of sewage and storm water, which ended up going in the lake. MMSD has done that every year, to varying degrees depending on the weather: When the deep tunnels run out of room and the sewage treatment plants on Jones Island and South Shore can’t keep up, the district shuts off access to the tunnels and sends untreated sewage into the lake. The overflows present environmental problems for the lake, but without them, sewage is more apt to back up into people’s basements. By law, the district is required to report the releases to the state Department of Natural Resources. Going back to when Barrett was first elected mayor, and highlighting a campaign promise made in 2004, the Walker campaign said the sewage dumps are Barrett’s fault. "Since being elected, he has dumped 8.2 billion gallons of raw sewage into Lake Michigan," Gilkes said. That’s a lot of flushing, so we decided to look into the claims. First the number. The Walker organization used media reports from the overflows going back to 2004 and tallied up what went untreated. We found Walker low-balled it. Had his campaign staff checked with MMSD - the totals are on the district’s website -- his people would have found that overflows actually totaled 10.4 billion gallons since 2004. Walker undershot the mark by 21percent. Walker spokeswoman Jill Bader said her staff assumed news reports, including figures from Milwaukee Journal Sentinel stories, were comprehensive. But by using different news accounts from different sources to tally up the figures, their number was off. For instance, in 2007, the Walker campaign didn’t use news reports from the Journal Sentinel at all, and in so doing missed nearly 400 million gallons of overflows. After being contacted by PolitiFact Wisconsin, she said the campaign staff had recently come across the district’s higher figures. Now, the discharges themselves. Is it raw sewage? That term sounds like it’s all coming from toilets. Actually, an estimated 95 percent is rainwater and runoff. Still, it’s untreated and therefore can be considered "raw." Finally, what about Barrett’s role in all of this? In a literal sense, he doesn’t have a hand in it. The city doesn’t operate Jones Island or the South Shore plant. The July decision to shut the gates to the deep tunnel system and start overflows was made by Kevin Shafer, MMSD’s executive director, in concert with his staff and Veolia Water North America, which operates the district’s waste water treatment system. Shafer said he made his first decision at about 6 p.m. on July 22 for the combined sewer system covering portions of Milwaukee and Shorewood and again at 1 a.m. the next day for the separated sewer system. It’s the same procedure for all overflows. "There is no contact with elected officials," Shafer said. "It’s purely an operational/technical decision that I make." But Barrett bears some responsibility. During his first campaign for mayor in 2004, Barrett was highly critical of MMSD and he vowed to fix the problem by demanding that the agency stop dumping raw sewage. "The Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District must clean up its act," Barrett said during the campaign. A Barrett radio ad lamented that MMSD the previous summer had "dumped 90,000 gallons of raw sewage into Lincoln Creek," which ultimately flows into the lake, and cited this as an example of the "outrageous failures of the district." As mayor, Barrett controls seven out of the 11 members of the MMSD board. He has the ability through his appointments to influence policy and procedures. The district plans to spend $1 billion by the end of the year to create new capacity and make other improvements to reduce overflows under a 2002 court-approved agreement between the DNR and MMSD. The new 27th Street tunnel project added 27 million gallons of capacity. A 7.1 mile long tunnel on the northwest side added 89 millions gallons of capacity. The entire storage system can store 521 million gallons until MMSD can process it. That means to handle the 2.1 billion gallons of overflow from the July storm, MMSD would need a system that is about four times larger. On the 27th Street tunnel project, the district said it spent $3 for every gallon of capacity. So if that cost held true, the price tag for an expansion able to handle 2.1 billion gallons would be about $6 billion. James Fratrick, a watershed specialist for the DNR, said that MMSD will never completely stop untreated waste from being released into Lake Michigan, and its state permit allows some emergency dumping to occur because zero discharge is not practical or required under federal law. "With rainfall events like this, it’s not economically feasible," Fratrick said. So there is some truth to Walker’s statement in that Barrett pledged he would stop the flows during the campaign and can influence the policies and procedures through his appointments to the board. But it’s an exaggeration to say that Barrett himself dumped the raw sewage into the lake after the extraordinary rainfall. We find the claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-12042	"Muslims’ disturbing plan comes out after grocery stores go bare to prepare for Irma."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/sep/12/freedom-daily/freedom-daily-misleads-about-potential-food-poison/	A misleading headline from a website called Freedom Daily suggests that reports of potential food poisoning at grocery stores emerged after people stocked up in preparation for Hurricane Irma. "BREAKING: Muslims’ Disturbing Plan Comes Out After Grocery Stores Go Bare To Prepare For Irma," said the headline of an undated post on Freedomdaily.com Like a lot of fake news, the headline is extremely misleading while the text of the story itself is more accurate. The article summarizes and adds its own commentary to reports from the media and other sources about the Islamic State’s poisoning of prisoners and about the group’s followers potential to also poison Western grocery stores. In its About Us page, Freedom Daily said they "post and decipher content to a level that is consistent with a common sense approach and falls in line with the ideals of American liberty and freedom." Its Facebook page said the website "gives Americans the real news as it unfolds with a conservative opinion." In its story, the website doesn’t make any claims about active plots discovered against American supermarkets. "Multiple outlets have reported that ISIS is utilizing social media to instruct members to poison food in supermarkets. It may or may not happen, but the thought of it occurring on a widespread attack on groceries could be terrorizing," said the post about the grocery stores. "People could even entertain the thought of an ISIS attack before a hurricane in which the food is all poisoned and people falter in the midst of a category 4 storm before the storm even hits them. Of course, this is not something that has happened, but a mere idea or spectacle that theorists could allege." SITE Intelligence Group reported on Sept. 3 that potential terrorists were advised to inject food sold at markets with cyanide poison. SITE said that message was distributed Sept. 3 on a pro-Islamic State channel on the social media platform Telegram and that it was part of a series of information promoting "lone-wolf jihad in Western countries." Freedom Daily linked to a Sept. 6 story on The Federalist Papers Project based on SITE’s report. Newsweek also published a story Sept. 7 headlined, "ISIS supporters call for poisoning of food in grocery stores across U.S. and Europe." But neither of them say the information came after people emptied shelves at stores as they prepared for Hurricane Irma’s path across the Caribbean and Florida. Freedom Daily’s story uses a photo of a woman in a blue blouse pushing a shopping cart past empty shelves in a grocery store. That photo was shot on Sept. 5 at a Publix supermarket in Palm Beach Gardens, Fla. by the Palm Beach Post — two days after SITE’s report came out. The Miami Herald and several other outlets also reported on Sept. 5 about empty shelves at stores as Floridians prepared for Hurricane Irma. The New York Times on Sept. 4 also noted there were bare water shelves in Puerto Rico as they also braced for the storm. Freedom Daily’s story itself contains true information, but the headline ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-15283	"I deployed the Texas National Guard" to the Texas-Mexico border. "And the policy worked; apprehensions at the border declined 74 percent."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/jul/26/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-74-percent-drop-border-apprehensio/	While declaring for president, Republican Rick Perry criticized President Barack Obama’s attitude toward securing the U.S.-Mexico border and suggested that in contrast, he’d shown he could slow illegal crossings of the Rio Grande. The former Texas governor, standing next to a plane like the one he flew as a young Air Force captain, said in his June 2015 speech: "When there was a crisis at our border last year, and the president refused my invitation to see that challenge that we faced, I told him, ‘Mr. President, if you do not secure this border, Texas will.’" "And because of that threat … posed by drug cartels … and transnational gangs," Perry continued, "I deployed the Texas National Guard. And the policy worked. Apprehensions at the border declined 74 percent. If you elect me your president, I will secure that border." Operation Strong Safety Perry was referring to Operation Strong Safety, the effort he launched on June 23, 2014, to place state troopers and, later, Texas National Guard troops along a portion of the 1,250-mile Texas part of the international border. Supporting the U.S. Border Patrol, the reinforcements were sent to secure the border by monitoring it. The Texas surge, so to speak, remained in place after Perry yielded the governorship to Greg Abbott in January 2015. When Perry acted, thousands of unaccompanied children, mostly from Central America, had lately been detained on the Texas side of the border. In the peak month, June 2014, the Border Patrol collected 10,622 unaccompanied children near the border, most of them in its more than 120-mile North-to-South Rio Grande Valley sector, which stretches west from Brownsville at the southern tip of the state to Falcon Village, 50 miles southeast of Laredo. Past Perry claims about the border have tickled the Truth-O-Meter. In June 2014, Perry said on the "Fox & Friends" program that the southern border was seeing a record number of non-Mexican apprehensions. True, we found. And in August 2014, Perry declared that record numbers of apprehensions were people from Pakistan, Afghanistan or Syria, places, he said, with "substantial terrorist ties." Pants on Fire! We found no evidence of record numbers of individuals from these countries crossing the Texas-Mexico border. For this fact check, we were curious about the described plummet in apprehensions and if that decrease showed the Texas surge worked. We dug into apprehension counts and hunted possible explanations. But first, it’s worth noting the U.S. government has struggled to define best indicators of the southern border’s security. Border security index announced, not completed A February 2015 report from the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonpartisan Washington, D.C.-based think tank, said the best metric to judge the security of any border is "the number of successful unauthorized border-crossings," but admitted that it was impossible to pinpoint such a figure given that "by definition, they are undetected." A few years earlier, in 2010, the U.S. Border Patrol and Department of Homeland Security launched a project comprehensive border security metric. Later, the Border Patrol’s 2012 strategic report said the indicator, known as the Border Conditions Index, was still under development, but it would combine "important indicators of activity between the ports of entry; indicators of the amount, nature and flow of traffic at the ports of entry; and quality of life indicators in border communities." (The Border Patrol defines a "Port of Entry" as a location where officers are assigned to enforce the nation’s immigration laws.) In 2013, though, the government dropped the index project, according to a March 2013 New York Times news story, after more than two years of work did not give them a viable measurement because, as Border Patrol representative Mark Borkowski then told a congressional subcommittee, the index "would only show trends" but would not act as the end-all, be-all border security metric Congress had asked for. Omar Zamora, a Border Patrol spokesman based in the Rio Grande Valley sector, told us by phone that when the agency is judging the security of the border, officials first look at border apprehension and drug smuggling statistics, then take into account "bigger picture" figures like the economic health and crime rate of border towns versus comparable areas elsewhere in the state. Zamora said he personally hadn’t heard of the Border Conditions Index. Perry’s backup information Asked to elaborate on Perry’s 74-percent statement, his campaign spokeswoman, Lucy Nashed, said he relied on a report by the Texas Department of Public Safety showing apprehensions in the Border Patrol’s Rio Grande Valley sector during the Texas operation. By email, Nashed provided a fact-sheet of the report. Nashed, asked to elaborate, said the 74 percent figure aired by Perry reflected the difference in apprehensions the first week of the state operation to the last week Perry was in office, the week of Jan. 18, 2015. That week, there were 1,561 people apprehended, according to a chart on the fact sheet, 76 percent fewer than the 6,606 apprehensions in the week of June 22, 2014, when the operation started. Nashed said: "There’s actually a larger than 74 percent decrease in apprehensions, but it’s near enough that we feel saying 74 percent is still appropriate." SOURCE: Chart, "USBP Apprehension Trends in OSS Area of Responsibility (AOR) Zones," Texas Department of Public Safety, March 30, 2015 (received by email from Lucy Nashed, Rick Pery campaign, June 15, 2015) Broadly, the chart shows ups and (mostly) downs in weekly apprehensions in the sector of individuals attempting to enter Texas illegally from late June 2014 through Feb. 14, 2015. Summer Blackwell, a DPS spokeswoman, told us the chart was the latest available data at the time Perry announced for president. According to the chart, in the week of June 22-28, 2014, the start of Operation Strong Safety, the Border Patrol apprehended 6,606 individuals in the sector. But in the operation’s second week, the chart shows, apprehensions plummeted by more than a 1,000, a 22 percent decrease. In the operation’s sixth week, apprehensions were down 56 percent compared to the 6,606 apprehensions the first week, according to the chart. Apprehensions dropped, by varying degrees, every week until the week of Sept. 7, 2014, when apprehensions inched up from 1,976 to 1,997. From that week, apprehensions rose and fell within a limited range; from the first week of September to the last week of November, weekly apprehensions were never greater than 1,997 or less than 1,521. December 2014 and January 2015 brought the lowest weekly totals with the week including New Year’s Day showing the chart’s lowest total for the year, with 826 individuals apprehended. Past changes in apprehensions from summer to winter As we studied Perry’s claim, we wondered briefly about previous years. For instance, are there invariably fewer apprehensions in January compared to the previous June? Mostly so, at least in recent years. Per apprehension tallies for the sector, posted online by the Border Patrol, in four of the five pre-surge years, apprehensions in January ran at least 14 percent behind apprehensions the previous June. Outlier: Apprehensions in January 2012 outpaced apprehensions in June 2011 by 2 percent. On average, January apprehensions from 2010 through 2015 were down 52 percent from apprehensions the previous June. Then again, June 2014 was a watershed month for apprehensions. The 38,446 apprehensions exceeded the sector’s average for the five previous Junes by 30,349, or 375 percent. According to agency figures, the June 2014 tally was the highest monthly total of apprehensions for any border sector since 2008. Decreases after June 2014 There’s also no doubt apprehensions sunk in the months after Texas acted. According to Border Patrol figures, through the operation’s first seven months, there were 10,414 apprehensions a month. On average, then, apprehensions in each of the months were down 73 percent from June’s total of 38,446 -- the highest monthly total of any border sector since 2008. And did state law enforcement conclude the operation was successful due to the 74 percent difference cited by Perry? To that query, spokesmen gave nonspecific replies. By email, DPS spokesman Tom Vinger said: "It is clear that the surge operation directed by the Texas leadership to institute 24/7 saturation patrols on the Rio Grande River, the ground and in the air had a significant impact on the Mexican cartels’ ability to conduct successful smuggling operations along the border in the area of operation." To our queries, DPS didn’t provide data on the operation’s effects on smuggling. Previously, the Austin American-Statesman said in a May 2015 news story that according to records, the DPS had been involved in less than 10 percent of Rio Grande Valley drug seizures tallied by the federal government since the state operation began. At the time, Vinger responded that stressing contributions by any one agency to the overall successes wasn’t logical--akin to "trying to determine if a basketball team won a game by asking the point guard how many points he scored." At different times in 2014-15, the DPS described reductions in apprehensions as a key indicator of law enforcement success--and not much of one. In July 2014, DPS Director Steve McCraw told a Texas House committee a decline in border apprehensions would be "the best indicator across the board" to qualify the operation as a success. Yet in April 2015, the agency wrote legislators to play down declines in apprehensions. The letter from Robert Bodisch, a deputy director, warned lawmakers of "inaccurate and grossly misleading conclusions" in an expected American-Statesman news story on the border surge. The letter said "drug seizures and apprehensions are not a reliable means of accessing the level of security at the border." (See the May 4, 2015, news story, a look into how best to measure the operation’s success, here.) At the time, Bodisch wrote that there’s one way to measure the level of security of the border: "The only way to accurately assess the true level of security between the Ports of Entry is to be able to detect ALL smuggling events and determine whether each smuggling event was interdicted. Until you can detect and interdict all smuggling events between the Ports of Entry, the border will remain unsecured, regardless of the amount of drugs seized and people arrested." For our part, we also reached the Texas National Guard’s public affairs office. By email, an unnamed contact said by email that its 1,000 troops "amplified the visible presence on the ground and along the river to detect and prevent criminals from infiltrating the Texas-Mexico border and helping to ensure the safety of our fellow Texans." Separately, the Border Patrol’s Zamora declined to comment on the impact of the Texas surge on apprehensions, calling our question "too politically charged." Other analyses Seeking other looks into Perry’s 74 percent declaration, we spotted a February 2015 report by the left-leaning Washington Office on Latin America, an advocacy group focused on humanitarian missions in Central and South America. From October 2013 through September 2014, its report said, the Border Patrol reported its officers apprehended 49,959 unaccompanied children entering the Rio Grande Valley sector. From October 2014 through June 2015, the report said, far fewer minors — some 13,249 — were similarly apprehended, a decline of more than 25,000, or 59 percent. The report said the primary reason for the reduced apprehensions was, starting in July 2014, a crackdown by Mexico’s government on Central American immigrants. The references specifically to Perry surge were minimal, only mentioning the National Guard and DPS reinforcements that were sent to the border in the "Border Security in the Rio Grande Valley" subsection. The report, citing interviews with immigration experts from the Mexican government, said Mexico, acting at U.S. officials’ urging, "curtailed migrants’ longstanding use of cargo trains to travel north from points near the Guatemalan border and stepping up deportations of apprehended Central Americans." In May 2015, Factcheck.org, part of the University of Pennsylvania's Annenberg Center on Public Policy, similarly noted the Mexican government’s increased attention to Central Americans, citing an April 2015 news article in The Arizona Republic that quoted Border Patrol Chief Michael Fisher telling a Senate committee that the Border Patrol didn’t expect to see another surge in children crossing from Mexico because of the Mexican government’s crackdown. According to a report by the Mexican government footnoted in the Washington Office on Latin America report, there was a spike in Central Americans deported from Mexico in 2014 that coincided with the decrease in border apprehensions in the Rio Grande Valley. Specifically, the report by Mexico’s Instituto Nacional de Migración 2014 report, released in January 2015, said 67,097 individuals from the three Central American countries with the highest immigration totals -- Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador -- were deported in 2014 after that June, when the Texas operation took effect. In all of 2013, Mexico’s report said, 77,896 individuals from the aforementioned three Central American countries were deported by the Mexican government. To our inquiry, Tony Payan, director of the Mexico Center at Rice University’s Baker Institute of Public Policy, told us by email: "Establishing a real cause-effect on Texas' efforts to secure the border is frankly very hard, but I am inclined to say that they really add very little to the enormous federal government efforts in progress well before Texas intervened." In June 2014, according to the federal government, 115 Border Patrol officers were transferred to the Rio Grande Valley sector from other places. Later that month, the Department of Homeland Security announced the deployment of 150 additional Border Patrol agents to the sector. In July 2014, in addition, the Border Patrol announced an ad campaign in Central America, called the Danger Awareness Campaign, to warn potential immigrants about the dangers of crossing the Texas-Mexico border illegally. Our ruling Perry said: "I deployed the Texas National Guard" to the Texas-Mexico border. "And the policy worked; apprehensions at the border declined 74 percent." His statistic holds up, but Perry didn’t provide nor did we find proof the decrease resulted from the Texas surge. To be specific, Border Patrol apprehensions in the targeted part of the border region declined more than 70 percent through the second half of 2014. Unproven, however, is why that happened--and Perry’s statement crediting the Texas deployment ignored potentially substantive factors such as the Border Patrol staffing up, Mexico cracking down and, perhaps, a typical summer-to-winter flux. Proving the "policy worked" also is hindered by a lack of consensus on how to measure border security. This weakness similarly would apply, say, if President Barack Obama said the drop in apprehensions showed administration policies worked. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-05191	"Giving the facts: 73,000 jobs created ... since '11. Do you know how many direct jobs in the auto industry? 1,800."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/jun/13/john-kasich/john-kasich-downplays-role-auto-bailouts-ohios-eco/	President Barack Obama and Ohio Gov. John Kasich share a common desire: they both think they can lay claim to Ohio’s gradually improving economic condition. But on this issue Kasich isn’t much in the sharing mood. Obama, a Democrat, is seeking re-election and likely will need to win Ohio in November to return to the White House. Kasich, a Republican, is backing GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Obama’s surrogates credit the president’s orchestrating of the automobile industry bailout in 2009 with helping to retain tens-of-thousands of Ohio jobs. But Kasich recently downplayed the role the $24.9 billion government boost for General Motors and Chrysler has played in Ohio to this point. During an appearance on NBC’s "Meet the Press," Kasich was asked why he wasn’t giving Obama’s bailout of the industry more credit for the job growth in Ohio. "Giving the facts: 73,000 jobs created ... since '11," he responded to host David Gregory. "Do you know how many direct jobs in the auto industry? 1,800." Kasich praised the resurgent strength of the auto industry in Ohio, but his intent was clear: diminish the role that job sector has had in Ohio under his administration by declaring that less than 2.5 percent of all jobs created here in the last 17 months were jobs in automobile manufacturing. He followed up by noting that the biggest areas of job growth are in business and financial services and medical fields. "See, what we have done in Ohio is we've diversified the economy so that we have multiple ways to grow jobs," he said. The auto industry is important to Ohio. The Center for Automotive Research ranks the state No. 2 for auto industry workers. So PolitiFact Ohio took a look at the governor’s claim. To PolitiFact Ohio, words matter. And the governor chose his words for this claim very carefully. Two key words in his statement are "created" (as opposed to "created or retained"), and "direct" as in jobs directly tied to making vehicles. That second distinction would exclude indirect jobs, such as those at restaurants and other businesses that benefit because of nearby automobile plants. This is an important distinction because Democrats regularly cite figures from a Center for Automotive Research report that claims in 2010 Ohio had just over 848,000 jobs tied to the automobile industry, of which about 150,000 are characterized as direct jobs. Many of those were jobs that were retained thanks to the automobile bailout even though Ohio, like other auto industry states, lost thousand of jobs in 2008 and 2009 which precipitated the bailout. Democrats have hailed the president for saving the industry and framed the conversation in terms of jobs saved and gradually returning. But Kasich was more restrictive in his phrasing, speaking only of direct jobs created. (That’s a departure from his the phrase "created and retained" that he often uses when talking about jobs in Ohio.) PolitiFact Ohio checked with Kasich’s staff about his claim. They cited figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. BLS counts motor vehicle manufacturing, motor vehicle parts manufacturing, and motor vehicle body and trailer manufacturing as direct jobs, according to BLS economist Parker Harvey. The BLS data shows Kasich’s stat was high. Between January 2011 and April 2012, Ohio had a net increase of 900 vehicle manufacturing jobs and net decrease of 200 parts manufacturing jobs for a total of 700 direct jobs. Also, through the third-quarter of 2011, the most recent figures available, Ohio was up about 400 body and trailer manufacturing jobs, according to BLS statistics. Add those together and you are still below 1,800. But the timeframe Kasich used is an issue in itself. In talking about Ohio jobs created by the auto bailout the governor only used job figures that covered his time in office. Kasich took office in January 2011. But the first federal aid to the automakers was made in 2008 while Republican President George W. Bush was still in office. It continued in early 2009 under Obama. Take any monthly snapshot you want in 2009 and compare it to when Kasich took office and you will see a significant net gain in vehicle manufacturing jobs. For example, in June 2009 Ohio had dropped to just 14,200 vehicle manufacturing jobs, down from 23,800 jobs just one year earlier. By the time Kasich took office that number had climbed back up to 19,200. That 5,000-job increase occurred after the auto bailouts, but isn’t reflected in the governor’s tally. And keep in mind, more jobs are coming to Ohio as the Chrysler and General Motors continued to rebound with the help of the bailout money. Chrysler is expected to add 1,100 more jobs by late summer or early fall to a plant in Toledo and GM recently announced that 100 temporary jobs at its plant in Lordstown will soon become permanent, full-time positions. Kasich’s claim is accurate. We’ll overlook that his 1,800 jobs figure is high since the BLS tally ultimately supports his point -- that job creation in Ohio’s economy is more diverse than just auto industry. But there’s additional information needed for clarification. By limiting the job creation numbers to just the time he has been in office, Kasich’s claim undersells the overall job growth that has occurred since the federal government rescued the auto industry. And his claim limited his figures to "direct" jobs that were "created." That does not reflect benefits to other businesses as a result of resurgence of auto employment or consider jobs that may have been retained. On the Truth-O-Meter, Kasich’s claim rates Mostly True.

pomt-00394	Says Andrew Gillum has a "far left socialist platform."	false	/florida/statements/2018/sep/06/ron-desantis/no-floridas-andrew-gillum-not-socialist/	In the race for Florida governor, Republican Ron DeSantis is trying to paint Democrat Andrew Gillum as so far out of the mainstream that Gillum "wants to turn Florida into Venezuela," a reference to the failing socialist country. "The last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda with huge tax increases and bankrupting the state," DeSantis said on Fox News. DeSantis’ comments were more controversial because of his use of the phrase "monkey this up" (Gillum is African-American). DeSantis said his comments had nothing to do with race. "It had to do with his far-left socialist platform," DeSantis said in a subsequent interview on Laura Ingraham’s radio show. So, is Gillum’s platform far-left socialist? While there is a level of subjectivity in describing a politician’s political views, we can measure just how far left or out of the mainstream Gillum is. Gillum’s beliefs The DeSantis campaign said "Gillum’s socialism" includes his support for Medicare for All, which would provide health care to everyone. (A governor can’t change federal health care policy, but Gillum says he will champion it.) Gillum also proposed increasing the state corporate tax rate from 5.5 percent to 7.75 percent and the minimum wage from $8.25 to $15 an hour. DeSantis also points to Gillum’s endorsement by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has called himself a socialist or a democratic socialist. (Gillum endorsed Hillary Clinton over Sanders in the 2016 presidential primary.) Gillum was asked during a 2018 primary forum if he is a socialist or a capitalist. "I am a Democrat and an individual in this state who believes that we've had a rough ride these last several years," Gillum said. "People are working, many of them harder than ever, and still can't bring down a wage where they can make ends meet." For Floridians who are struggling, he said, "these labels mean nothing." After he won the primary, MSNBC’s Chuck Todd asked Gillum if he is a socialist. This time, he rejected the socialist label outright. "No, I’m a Democrat. I ran as a Democrat, I am a Democrat. And, frankly, the values that I hold, I think, are consistent with the values of the Democratic Party. In fact, I think they are the values shared by the majority of Floridians." So what is socialism? The narrowest definition of socialism involves a state owning all businesses, with a ban on private economic activity above some level, said Daniel Shaviro, a tax law professor at New York University law school. But when Sanders uses the term, he is referring to the generous social insurance programs available not only in the Scandinavian countries but also France and Germany, along with high tax rates if needed. "But note that U.S. tax rates in the early 1960s exceeded 90 percent," Shaviro said. "Were we a ‘socialist’ country then? At the time, only the John Birch Society — not even Barry Goldwater — was saying so." We sent experts on political philosophy a list of Gillum’s policy positions. Experts generally told us that it’s misleading to state that Gillum has a "socialist platform" — he hasn’t advocated that the government control all forms of enterprise. If we examine socialism on a continuum, experts said some of Gillum’s policies are further from socialism and some are closer to it. Peter Dreier, a political science professor at Occidental College, said that for decades Republicans have used the "socialist" label to attack Democrats over policies including the New Deal in the 1930s and the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s. Many of the ideas that were once considered "socialist" — such as the minimum wage, women’s right to vote, and Social Security — are now mainstream. Back in the 1960s, when President Lyndon Johnson proposed Medicare, some Republican opponents called it "socialist." But now Americans overwhelmingly support Medicare. In Florida, about one in five people are on Medicare, among the highest rates in the country. Medicare for All would essentially expand an existing program, and some polls show a majority of Americans support Medicare for All. "Gillum is definitely not a socialist," Dreier said. "He is a mainstream liberal Democrat." Mac Stipanovich, a Florida Republican strategist and critic of President Donald Trump, said in an op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times that what Gillum wants is an expansion of Medicare, minimum wage and public education. But the programs themselves are broadly supported. "If supporting these socialist programs makes one a socialist, then Gillum is indeed a socialist, as is certainly almost every elected official in Florida, Democrats or Republicans," Stipanovich wrote. "A phone booth could not be filled with politicians of any stripe who oppose Medicare, any minimum wage at all, and public schools." Antony Davies, an economics professor at Duquesne University, said that Medicare fits the common definition of socialism because it is a program by which the government forces one group of people (wage earners) to pay for health insurance, and forces another group (retirees) to consume health insurance. "Thus, Medicare for All will have the government exerting even more control over people than it does under Medicare," he said. Measuring Gillum’s policies on a socialism spectrum So, broadly speaking, Gillum’s position of expanding health care access is rooted in the mainstream rather than the far left. So where might his positions shift toward something approximating socialism? Raising the corporate rate is closer to socialism, in the sense that you could say a 0 percent rate is the most "capitalistic" and a 100 percent rate the most "socialistic," Shaviro said. One could make a similar argument about the minimum wage too, but the minimum wage was far higher, relative to inflation, for most of the post-World War II period than it is now. And a majority of Americans have supported increasing the minimum wage. "The real point is that almost no one favors an absolutely pure market system with no government taxation or regulation, and no one in U.S. politics supports going 100 percent the other way, so we’re all just debating mixed systems and it’s not a matter of ‘socialists’ vs. ‘pro-capitalists.’" Eduardo A. Gamarra, a political science professor at Florida International University, said the comment by DeSantis that Gillum wants to turn Florida into Venezuela is "ludicrous." Venezuela has devolved because it mismanaged its oil resources. Florida has a more diversified economy that doesn’t rely on one product. "I don’t think Gillum is talking about nationalizing industries and taking over hotels," Gamarra said. "That’s just not going to happen." Our ruling DeSantis said Gillum has a "far left socialist platform." The reality is Gillum’s platform resembles the policies being promoted by many Democrats. And his positions of expanding access to Medicare and raising the minimum wage have significant public support. Gillum isn’t on the fringes of the political spectrum and certainly proposes nothing approaching turning "Florida into Venezuela," which would mean the state taking over privately held businesses and large portions of the economy.

pomt-10416	"Ten years ago, John McCain offered a bill that said he would ban a candidate from paying registered lobbyists."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/23/barack-obama/mccain-proposed-bill-that-didnt-pass/	Special interests and lobbyists are perennial topics for political campaigns, and Sen. Barack Obama has made them a repeated target in his attacks on Sen. John McCain. "Ten years ago, John McCain offered a bill that said he would ban a candidate from paying registered lobbyists," Obama said. "He did this because he said that having lobbyists on your campaign was a conflict of interest. This is what he said 10 years ago. Well, I'll tell you John McCain then would be pretty disappointed with John McCain now, because he hired some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington to run his campaign. And when he was called on it, his top lobbyist had the nerve to say that the American people won't care about this." (We checked the statement about McCain hiring "some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington to run his campaign" and ruled it True. Also, we ruled it True that McCain's top lobbyist did have "the nerve to say that the American people won't care about this.") We delved into legislative history and found that McCain did introduce a bill, in 1996 and again in 1997, to ban lobbyists from being paid by political campaigns. The Lobbying Conflict of Interest Elimination Act said that "a candidate and the candidate's authorized committees shall not make disbursements for any services rendered by any individual during any period if such individual was required to register for such period as a lobbyist." McCain made remarks recorded in the Congressional Record about the bill on Jan. 22, 1997: "Registered lobbyists who work for campaigns as fundraisers clearly represent a conflict of interest. When a campaign employs an individual who also lobbies that member, the perception of undue and unfair influence is raised. This legislation would stop such practices." The bill never made it out of committee. It was part of a flurry of campaign finance reform legislation proposed in the aftermath of the 1996 campaign for president, during which Bill Clinton raised large amounts of "soft money," the unregulated gifts to political parties from individuals, corporations and unions. At least 57 pieces of legislation were filed in the spring of 1997, according to news reports from the time. One of those pieces of legislation included comprehensive reform banning soft money, sponsored by McCain and Sen. Russ Feingold, a Democrat from Wisconsin. The McCain-Feingold bill didn't succeed that year, but in 2002 it did pass and was signed into law by President Bush as the Bipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act. Though considered landmark legislation, it did not address lobbyists working for campaigns. Obama's description of McCain's legislation from a decade ago is accurate. We rule his statement True.

pomt-06143	"[E]xcise tax increases drive commerce across state lines."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/dec/21/grover-norquist/letter-warns-deal-taxes/	Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal received a letter on Dec. 12 that likely gained the attention of his staff. The author was Grover Norquist, the president of the Washington-based Americans for Tax Reform, best known for the pledge he asks political candidates to sign vowing to oppose and vote against tax increases. Nearly one-half of the members of Congress, including nine from Georgia, have signed the pledge. During his successful 2010 campaign, Deal promised ATR that he would oppose and veto all tax increases as governor. Norquist, you see, has some pull. His letter to the governor urged Georgia lawmakers considering a tax overhaul next year to pass legislation that is revenue-neutral. Norquist also warned officials here to stay away from tax increases in other areas. A portion of one sentence caught our attention. "Last year’s target was tobacco; this year may be a repeat, or we may hear proposals for excise tax increases on alcohol or sweetened beverages," Norquist wrote. "Whatever the case may be, targeted excise tax increases drive commerce across state lines and hurt small businesses’ bottom lines." The question for us: Do excise tax increases, as Norquist wrote, "drive commerce across state lines"? Excise taxes are placed on items such as cigarettes and alcohol. Most excise taxes are on cigarettes. Georgia, like most Southern states, has among the lowest excise taxes on cigarettes (37 cents a pack) in the nation. One news report earlier this said state Senate leaders are considering raising the cigarette tax by $1 a pack. The Americans for Tax Reform staff argued its case that Norquist is right, pointing to the results of excise tax increases in three places, Chicago, Washington, D.C., and South Carolina. Here’s a closer look: Chicago ATR told us that Chicagoans flocked to neighboring Indiana when Cook County, which encompasses the Windy City, raised its cigarette tax by $1 in 2006. After the 2006 changes in Cook County, Chicagoans paid among the highest prices for cigarettes in the country. A team of University of Illinois-Chicago researchers found in a sample survey of discarded cigarette packs that 75 percent of them came from outside Cook County, The Huffington Post reported. The taxes on a pack of cigarettes in Chicago in 2007 was $4.05. The taxes were $1.37 outside city limits. Washington, D.C. ATR says Washington saw an 11 percent net decline in cigarette tax revenue after it raised the cigarette tax by 50 cents, to $2.50 a pack in 2009. Cigarette taxes in the nation’s capital were already higher than most states before 2009. In Virginia, the taxes for a pack of smokes is 30 cents, nearly the lowest in the nation. Missouri has the lowest cigarette taxes, 17 cents a pack, according to the Campaign for Tobacco-free Kids. City officials still expected to bank $30 million from the increase, although it was less than their initial projection of about $45 million. South Carolina Georgia saw a net increase in cigarette sales of nearly 1.3 million packs in the six months after South Carolina raised its excise tax rate in July 2010, ATR says. Cigarette tax revenue did decline slightly in South Carolina in the first 12 months since its increase, records show. South Carolina previously had the lowest cigarette tax in the nation, at 7 cents a pack. It’s now 57 cents a pack. Many smokers in the Palmetto State were not happy with the changes. Matthew Farrelly, whose research on cigarette excise taxes has been used by others, said some people will travel across state lines to buy cigarettes once excise taxes are raised. Other smokers will buy by the carton or choose a lesser brand to save money, he said. Farrelly contends it’s "bogus" for anyone to say large numbers of smokers will rush to another state to buy cigarettes once an increase takes effect because few Americans live near a border. He also noted the states that raise their excise taxes eventually make a profit. "On net, increases in taxes on cigarettes lead to revenue all the time," said Farrelly, senior director, RTI International Public Healthy Policy Research Program, headquartered near Raleigh, N.C. Our conclusion: Norquist has a good argument for his basic point, based on the research we’ve seen and people we’ve interviewed. The difference in taxes between some places, however, is so large ($2.20 a pack between Washington, D.C., and Virginia) that it adds some important context to this argument. With that additional bit of information, we rate Norquist’s claim as Mostly True.	None	Grover Norquist	None	None	None	2011-12-21T06:00:00	2011-12-12	['None']

pomt-10163	Says that under his tax plan, seniors making less than $50,000 per year won't pay any income taxes.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/30/barack-obama/seniors-get-a-special-break/	In a new 2-minute TV ad, Barack Obama explains his economic plans and contrasts them with John McCain's. In two other Truth-O-Meter rulings, we examined Obama's claims about his plans for small businesses and the middle class. Here, we'll address his plan for senior citizens. He says in the ad that "seniors making less than $50,000, who are struggling with the rising costs of food and drugs on fixed incomes, won’t pay income taxes at all." That is correct. Obama's tax plan specifies that he would "eliminate all income taxation of seniors making less than $50,000 per year." The campaign estimates it will cut taxes an average of $1,400 for 7-million seniors. It's worth noting that Obama's proposal has been criticized on several fronts. Some economists have questioned whether it's a wise policy because seniors already receive favorable tax treatment. The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan tax research group, said Obama's plan would create inequity by eliminating taxes for senior citizens who earn a modest income but continuing to tax younger workers earning the same amount. Also, it would help seniors who are currently paying income taxes but provide no benefit for those too poor to owe any tax. Still, Obama accurately describes his plan in the ad.

pomt-12826	In the United States, "we tax our exports and don't tax our imports."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/feb/09/paul-ryan/does-united-states-tax-exports-not-imports/	A couple of weeks after former Fox News Channel talk show host Greta Van Susteren started a program on MSNBC, the Appleton, Wis. native welcomed U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan to discuss what changes could be expected under President Donald Trump. When Van Susteren asked Ryan in the Jan. 25, 2017 interview about the "tax code" (which Ryan has errantly claimed hasn’t been updated in 30 years), the Janesville, Wis., Republican emphasized the need to reduce business tax rates (which Trump has accurately characterized as high). Then Ryan said: "Oh, and by the way, here's what the rest of the world does that we don't do: They take the tax off of their exports and place a tax on their imports. We do the opposite. We tax our exports and don't tax our imports. So, we're putting ourselves -- we’re basically double taxing made-in-America products." Does the United States tax exports but not tax imports? Both parts of the speaker’s claim, said Joel Trachtman, professor of international law at the Fletcher School at Tufts University in Massachusetts, are "in principle true, but there’s a lot of important exceptions." The backdrop Taxes on imports and exports are important given that Trump has been highly critical of America’s trade policies. Three days after his inauguration, he signed a presidential memorandum officially directing the United States to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the biggest trade deal struck in two decades. That earned him a Promise Kept on PolitiFact National’s Trump-O-Meter. Now to the first part of Ryan’s two-part claim. ‘We tax our exports’ There is no excise tax or tariff applied by the United States on goods sold to foreign customers. But Ryan’s point is that U.S. businesses pay income taxes on their worldwide income -- that is, from exports as well as goods sold within the United States. It’s worth noting, though, that multinational companies are often able to reduce or delay their payment of U.S. taxes on export-based income. And U.S. exporters also enjoy subsidies and other assistance from some 20 federal agencies. So, the first part of the statement is mostly on target. We ‘don’t tax our imports’ Ryan’s point here is that a foreign company that sells goods from abroad into the United States does not pay any U.S. income taxes unless it has subsidiaries based in the United States or branches in the United States. For example, Toyota USA pays income taxes on cars made in Japan that it buys and resells to U.S. consumers. But his statement ignores the existence of tariffs -- another form of tax that is imposed on many goods as they come into the United States. On average, the tariff imposed at the border is 1.5 percent, according to a March 2016 report from the U.S. International Trade Commission. (Tariffs are aimed at making American companies more competitive with their foreign counterparts, but consumer costs in the United States almost certainly would rise if tariffs are increased. Trump has promised to raise tariffs on "any country that devalues their currency to take unfair advantage of the United States.") Ryan’s office acknowledged to us that tariffs are another form of tax, but pointed out that he had been asked about the tax code, which is administered by the Internal Revenue Service rather than the U.S. Customs and Border Protection. So, the second part of the claim is misleading in that there are no direct taxes on imports, but there are tariffs. Our rating Ryan said: In the United States, "we tax our exports and don't tax our imports." On the export side, the United States doesn’t have an excise tax or tariffs on goods sold to foreign customers. But U.S. businesses do pay income taxes on their exports -- though multinational companies have the means to mitigate those taxes. On the import side, foreign companies don’t pay income taxes on goods they sell to the United States, but tariffs -- another form of tax -- are imposed on many imported goods.

pomt-12493	The estimated price of President Trump’s border wall is the same as the cost of "one and a half aircraft carriers."	true	/california/statements/2017/apr/28/scott-peters/would-trumps-border-wall-cost-same-one-and-half-us/	The debate over President Trump’s proposed border wall intensified this week, with opponents saying the barrier would be ineffective and a costly mistake. Building "a big, beautiful wall" on the Southern border was Trump’s signature promise during his campaign, winning him support from advocates for hard-line immigration reform. But when Trump initially demanded funding for the wall be included in a stop-gap budget measure needed to avoid a government shutdown, opponents in Congress balked. Rep. Scott Peters, D-San Diego, said the billions needed to build the wall should be used elsewhere. Peters went on to make an eye-opening claim about what money for the wall could fund instead: "We’ve checked in with The Navy; if we don’t pass the 2017 budget, they’re talking here about five ships that won’t be available to sail just out of the Western region — and 15 worldwide...the money for the wall? That’s, by the way, (the cost of) one and a half aircraft carriers," Peters was quoted as saying on April 24, 2017 in a Politico news article. We know cost estimates for the wall are high. But would the price really equate to "one and a half aircraft carriers"? We set sail on a fact check. Paying for a "big, beautiful wall" The U.S. border with Mexico is nearly 2,000 miles long. It already includes about 650 miles of fencing constructed under previous administrations. Trump has said the wall doesn’t need to span the entire border, adding in a television interview that "We don’t need 2,000 (miles), we need 1,000 because we have natural barriers." During his campaign, Trump initially said he could build a wall for $4 billion and later estimated $6 billion to $7 billion. In April 2017, he put it at $10 billion or less. The Associated Press reported in March that the Trump Administration wants to build a 30-foot-high border wall that "looks good from the north side and is difficult to climb or cut through," according to a pair of contract notices posted to a government website. A drone's view of the US-Mexico border fence as seen from Nogales, Mexico, Sunday, April 2, 2017. (Brian Skoloff / AP) Cost estimates for the wall vary greatly. Here are some relevant estimates, as chronicled by news publication Quartz. In July 2016, Bernstein Research, a firm that analyzes material costs, put the price tag at $15 billion to $25 billion, for a wall that stretches 1,000 miles and is 40 feet high, which was Trump’s initial desired height. In January 2017, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the wall would be $12 billion to $15 billion. In February 2017, a leaked report from the Department of Homeland Security put it much higher, at $21.6 billion. In April 2017, the Democratic staff of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee said in a report that costs could soar to nearly $70 billion — not including the significant costs and legal resources required for land acquisition. Peters’ spokesman Jacob Peters said the congressman used the $21.6 billion estimate because it "comes from the internal report done by the Department of Homeland Security." "This estimate falls somewhere in the middle of the range of cost estimates," the spokesman added. "Because this report was commissioned by (Department of Homeland Security) Secretary Kelly, and is based on the Trump administration’s own planning process to build walls and fences to cover almost the entirety of the border that is not already fenced, it is the best current estimate for what President Trump is likely to ask Congress to appropriate to build his border wall." We also used the $21.6 billion as our estimate. Aircraft carrier cost Finding the cost of the latest U.S. aircraft carrier is a bit easier. Peters’ spokesman pointed to a Congressional Research Service report from April 2017 that places the cost of each new "Navy Ford Class Aircraft Carrier" at approximately $12.9 billion. That’s up from the $8.5 billion cost of carriers in the Navy’s most-recent Nimitz class, according to a Navy fact sheet. The first carrier in the new class, the USS Gerald R. Ford, is expected to be commissioned later in 2017. It’s been described as "the most expensive and most advanced warship ever built." Still, when we do the math, it appears Peters slightly underestimated his comparison: Building a $21.6 billion border wall would cost about 1.67 times the price of these new warships. We asked Lynn Reaser, chief economist at Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego to examine the cost figures. Reaser told us the number "does appear to check out." Our ruling Democratic Congressman Scott Peters recently claimed the estimated price of President Trump’s border wall is the same as the cost of "one and a half aircraft carriers." Peters used a $21.6 billion estimate, citing a leaked report from the Trump Administration’s Department of Homeland Security. That figure is within the $15 billion to $25 billion range produced by a private research firm. Peters referenced the $12.9 billion price tag on the Navy’s newest class of aircraft carriers from a Congressional Research Service report. At this early stage, no one knows how much Trump’s wall will really cost. Partisan sources have it all over the map. And delays and cost-overruns are common for large government projects: Just take a look at California’s massive high-speed rail initiative. But Peters selected what appears to be the best initial estimate from Trump’s own homeland security analysts. If anything, Peters slightly underestimates the 1.67 aircraft carriers the U.S. could build for the cost of Trump’s border wall. We rate Congressman Peters' claim True.

pomt-01393	The U.S. Supreme Court struck down Wisconsin's photo ID election law	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/14/debbie-wasserman-schultz/wasserman-schultz-says-states-id-law-struck-down/	Separate judicial rulings in Wisconsin and Texas on Oct. 9, 2014 gave cheer to opponents of state laws requiring voters to show photo ID at the polls. Here’s part of what the Democratic National Committee chairwoman, U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, had to say in a statement: "With less than ten days before early voting starts in Texas and Wisconsin, I am pleased with the judicial decisions yesterday striking down burdensome photo ID laws in those states." Did the brief Supreme Court order "strike down" the Wisconsin statute? The DNC leader was in a minority in using that terminology, we found in reviewing media reports and reactions from legal and political observers. But the New York Times’ headline on its story may have influenced some -- and in fact a DNC spokesman pointed it out to us in providing backup for Wasserman Schultz’s claim. "Courts Strike Down Voter ID laws in Wisconsin and Texas," the paper’s online headline declared Oct. 9, 2014. The story beneath that headline, though, used "struck down" only when referring to the Texas ruling. Here’s what it said about Wisconsin: "The Supreme Court on Thursday evening stopped officials in Wisconsin from requiring voters there to provide photo identification before casting their ballots in the coming election." There’s a significant difference between the rulings in the two states. In Texas, a federal district court judge -- the lowest level in the federal system -- found that state’s ID law unconstitutional, writing that it intentionally discriminates against black and Hispanic voters. The Wisconsin case is much further along: The action Wasserman Schultz reacted to was from the U.S. Supreme Court. In April 2014, Federal District Court Judge Lynn Adelman "struck down" Wisconsin’s law, but the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals found it sound and cleared the way for its use in the Nov. 4, 2014 election. Several groups then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. The high court in its Oct. 9 action did not take up the merits of the Wisconsin law’s constitutionality or even decide whether to take the case at all. Instead, without comment from the majority in the 6-3 decision, it temporarily blocked the implementation of the law, perhaps in response to plaintiffs’ claims that it was too close to the Nov. 4, 2014 election to be properly implemented. Underscoring the limited and temporary nature of the ruling, two justices who supported upholding Indiana’s voter ID law in a 2008 ruling -- Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Anthony Kennedy -- voted in the Wisconsin case to block the law for now. Most media outlets, legal observers and participants in the case used terms like "blocked" or "stayed" to describe the impact of the Wisconsin ruling. The DNC told us there’s only a semantic difference between "struck down" and "blocked." We heard otherwise. "It’s not accurate to say it was ‘struck down,’ but it’s understandable" given the New York Times headline and other media coverage, said Daniel P. Tokaji, an Ohio State University law professor and expert on election law. Non-lawyers especially can be forgiven for using the term, he said. "The Supreme Court did not ‘strike down’ the voter ID law," Wisconsin Department of Justice spokeswoman Dana Brueck told us. "It vacated the Seventh Circuit’s September 12th order staying the District Court’s injunction." She added: "The September 12th order from the Seventh Circuit permitted Wisconsin to enforce the voter ID law in November. The Supreme Court did not take any action whatsoever as to the merits of the voter ID law." Wisconsin Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen is exploring ways to reinstate the law before the November election. We asked a lawyer for one of the groups that sought the stay to weigh in on this. Larry Dupuis, legal director for the American Civil Liberties Union of Wisconsin Foundation, said he wouldn’t use "struck down." But he added that there is no technical legal definition of "struck down, "so I suppose someone could say the law was ‘struck down’ temporarily or for the November election." The DNC told us Wasserman Schultz’s statement was "consistent with news accounts and had one goal: to communicate clearly to voters that the United State Supreme Court’s action meant that the Wisconsin photo ID law would not be applicable in this year’s election." We tackled a somewhat similar claim when Gov. Scott Walker said the John Doe investigation into his campaign finances had been "resolved" after two judges ruled it was "over." We rated that claim False, since it was not final and more court action lay ahead. Indeed, the federal appeals court overturned the lower-court decision and sent it back to a Wisconsin court, where an earlier action halting it remains under appeal. Our rating Wasserman Schultz said the Supreme Court struck down Wisconsin's photo ID election law. The high court temporarily halted the law from going into effect but did not take any action on the viability of the law itself. The ultimate fate of the law is yet to be determined. We rate her claim False.	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2014-10-14T05:00:00	2014-10-10	['Wisconsin']
pomt-05849	"We aren't the only state cutting back on public television."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/feb/14/richard-licht/rhode-island-director-administration-richard-licht/	The prospect of clipping the wings of Big Bird came up Feb. 5 when Richard Licht, Governor Chafee’s director of administration, made an appearance on ABC6’s "On the Record with Buddy Cianci." The host, former Providence Mayor Vincent "Buddy" Cianci was grilling Licht on Chafee’s proposal to eliminate funding for Channel 36, now known as Rhode Island PBS, the state’s only public television station. Chafee's proposed budget, crafted to close a projected shortfall of $120 million to $125 million, would cut off funding to the station after Dec. 31, 2012. CIANCI: "What have you got against 'Sesame Street'?" LICHT: "I love Sesame Street. I have grandchildren and I always watched it with all four of my children. Tough times make for tough choices." CIANCI: "But 'Sesame Street'? My God." LICHT: "Hopefully, Channel 36 will be aggressive, go out and find some good charitable sponsors to help support this." CIANCI (facetiously): "Especially in this economy, they're going to just fork over $800,000." LICHT: "We aren't the only state cutting back on public television. It's not anything that we're happy about and, again, that's something that might be reversed [if better higher revenue estimates come in], but the facts are, tough times, tough choices." We were interested in whether Licht was correct that other states are cutting back on public television and, if so, how many. We called the governor's office to ask for Licht's source. Meanwhile, we talked to David Piccerelli, president of Rhode Island PBS. "The proposal is to fund us through December 31 of 2012 and then shut off funding altogether," he said. In the current fiscal year, the state contributes $922,000 to RIPBS's total budget of $2.9 million. That's 31 percent. Another 27 percent comes from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which helps fund stations throughout the United States. (The CPB itself has been repeatedly threatened with the cutoff of federal funds by conservatives.) The remaining 42 percent comes from fundraising. Piccerelli said about 85 cents out of every dollar raised is from individual donors. Corporate support accounts for no more than 15 cents, down from close to 30 cents on the dollar around 2004-2005, before the Rhode Island economy took a faceplant. Piccerelli said some states HAVE been cutting back their support; Chafee's office sent us information confirming that. Last June, New Hampshire Public Television eliminated 20 full-time workers and cut staff salaries by as much as 10 percent after it lost $2.7 million in state funding, or about 30 percent of its budget. At the same time, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, backed by the state legislature, eliminated funding for New Jersey public television, which resulted in the 40-year-old New Jersey Network being taken over by WNET in New York and NJN's nine radio licenses being sold to stations in New York and Philadelphia. Stacey Karp, director of communications for the Association of Public Television Stations, said four other states -- Florida, Missouri, Pennsylvania and South Carolina -- have also eliminated funding. For details, she sent us to Skip Hinton, president of the National Educational Telecommunications Association, a professional association that represents stations in every state. He told us that 38 states were providing direct support to public broadcasting in 2007. It's now down to 32. Of the 32, "most have seen pretty significant reductions in state funding over the last four years," he said. At least one state -- Illinois -- increased its contribution to public television, boosting funding by 16 percent last year, following cuts in previous years. Our ruling Richard Licht, Chafee's director of administration, said, "We aren't the only state cutting back on public television." Turns out, he’s right. Five states have eliminated funding and others have cut their contributions. We rate his statement True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-06486	Says Rick Perry increased spending in Texas by more than 50 percent.	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/oct/14/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-says-texas-spending-increased-mor/	When the Bloomberg/Washington Post debate on economic topics gave GOP hopefuls the chance to question another candidate directly, U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota turned to Rick Perry. She declared that after Perry backed Al Gore for president as Ronald Reagan’s presidency came to its close, he "went on to increase spending in Texas by over 50 percent" as governor. Bachmann incorrectly said Perry was Gore’s campaign co-chair, which we’ve covered in another fact check. Her reference to state spending on the Texas governor's watch also covered familiar turf. In an online ad we spotted last month, the pro-Bachmann Keep Conservatives United super PAC said Perry had "doubled state spending in a decade." We found that to be Mostly False. Not that spending didn’t increase. In August 2010, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill White cited state budget figures to show that overall state spending had increased 79 percent with Perry as governor, from nearly $101.8 billion in 2000-01 to almost $182.2 billion in 2010-11. At the time we took up the pro-Bachmann group’s claim, an updated spending tabulation indicated the increase had been 86 percent. However, we recognized that this percentage was both unadjusted for inflation and population increases and that it reflected spending from all sources, including federal aid. Taking into account inflation and population growth, the increase was 21 percent over the period. And budgeted expenditures drawing on state general revenue -- the kind most swayed by a governor -- increased 44 percent without adjustments, but decreased 6 percent once inflation and population growth are weighed. We did not hear back from Bachmann on the basis of her debate claim. Our sense is that Bachmann’s assessment of "over 50 percent" misstates overall spending on Perry’s watch, especially because it doesn’t appear to include any accounting for the state’s growth or inflation. The claim also overstates the raw increase in general-revenue spending, the kind that Perry had the most control over. We rate her statement Half True.

pomt-01386	Four million women have fallen into poverty in the last six years.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/oct/15/david-perdue/perdue-claim-mark/	A key strategy for Republicans running in this year’s midterm elections has been to slam their Democratic opponents as surrogates of President Barack Obama. It’s a tactic that GOP nominee David Perdue has employed repeatedly in Georgia’s closely watched U.S Senate race, including last week when he and Democratic opponent Michelle Nunn shared the debate stage in Perry. When asked about his stance on minimum wage and how to create jobs, Perdue told a huge and at times raucous crowd that Nunn was trying to "tear down" his business career to detract from her support of Obama. "She supports the economic policies of this administration, one that put 4 million women in poverty in six years," Perdue said. Other Republicans have made similar claims this year as both parties vie for the female vote and control of the U.S. Senate. We decided to pull out the Truth-O-Meter to check: Have 4 million women really fallen into poverty in the last six years? We began by asking Perdue’s camp for its evidence. Spokesman Derrick Dickey said Perdue’s comments relied, in part, on an August 2014 post on the Georgia Federation of Republican Women’s website. The post stated that nearly 4 million women had fallen into poverty since Obama was elected in 2008. The campaign also was drawing on similar public comments by U.S. Sens. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas, though both McConnell and Cruz used slightly smaller estimates of 3.7 million, Dickey said. We reached out to the staff of both senators and heard back immediately from Don Stewart from McConnell’s office. Stewart pointed us to data from the U.S. Census Bureau (table 7) showing that there were 22.131 million females living below the poverty line in 2008, the year President Obama was elected, and 25.840 million in poverty in 2012. That is an increase of 3.7 million (over five years, not six as Perdue said). But that data counts all females -- including children -- which is not what most people think of or how Merriam-Webster defines women. Among women 18 and over - the ones in those jobs Perdue was discussing in the debate - the poverty rate went up by 2.8 million between 2008 and 2013, according to Census figures. Looking at the data starting in 2009, when Obama took office and could affect policy, the increase drops to 1.5 million, Census data show. Two facts missing from those numbers further complicate the data, according to William Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution. One: the number of all women increased in those periods due to population growth. That "accounts for most of the increase in poverty in women over either the 2008-2013 or 2009-2013," Frey said. Two: The Great Recession ticked up the poverty rate for everyone, not just women, between 2010 and 2012. Last year, the poverty rate went down overall for the first time since 2006, before Obama took office. For working-age women, those between 18 and 64, there was a rise in the poverty among adult women of about 991,000 between 2009 and 2013. The Census Bureau calls those figures "statistically insignificant." So where does this leave us? Perdue last week said Michelle Nunn "supports the economic policies of this administration, one that put 4 million women in poverty in six years." He bases it, in part, on U.S. Census Bureau data first collected in 2008, when Obama wasn’t even in office. The Census Bureau data shows 3.7 million more females in poverty in 2012 than in 2008. But when you talk just about women -- adult females over 18 -- the increase is 2.8 million. That’s far too big an increase but also far too far from 4 million to be called accurate. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	David Perdue	None	None	None	2014-10-15T00:00:00	2014-10-07	['None']
pomt-09405	"For years now, we have spent more money than we have taken in."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/mar/21/annise-parker/annise-parker-says-years-houston-has-been-spending/	With the city of Houston running short about $11 million to fund its budget this year and projecting a revenue shortfall of $100 million for next year — Houston's first-year mayor, Annise Parker, recently floated the possibility of furloughs and layoffs for city employees. "For years now (in Houston), we have spent more money than we have taken in," Parker said March 10, according to a news article in The Houston Chronicle. "You can't spend more than you earn. It is a very unbusinesslike approach to running things." The Bayou City running in the red for years? We wondered if Parker, who was Houston's controller before she took office in January, has that right — especially because her predecessor as mayor, Bill White, touted his financial acumen while winning the 2010 Democratic nomination for governor. Janice Evans, Parker's director of communications, told us: "The city has offset revenue shortfalls in recent years by drawing down the (general) fund balance, which was built up in good times so that it would be available during leaner times." She was referring to the city's practice of socking away enough money so that the fund balance at the end of each fiscal year is equal to 7.5 percent of expenditures before debt service — essentially a savings account, which was built up over eight consecutive years. Michelle Mitchell, the city's finance director, said that starting in fiscal year 2009 — July 1, 2008 through June 30, 2009 — revenue coming into the general fund has fallen short of expenditures. The general fund, which is the government's largest kitty, helps supports most basic services including health and human services, the police force and the fire department. "General revenues such as property tax, sales tax, came in lower than expenditures," Mitchell acknowledged in an e-mail. But she cautioned that "there are other sources of funds that have to be looked at for the whole picture. These include funds such as sale of assets, proceeds from bonds, transfers from other fund sources, etc. With all revenues being considered, then the city did not outspend (its) revenues (prior to fiscal year 2009)." Judy Gray Johnson, who served as Houston's finance director from 2004-2008, agreed with Mitchell's summary. "If you have higher fund balances at the end of the year than you had at the beginning of the year, than you couldn't have spent more than you took in," Johnson said. When White became mayor in 2004, the undesignated fund balance — money saved — was $83 million. The city last added to the fund in fiscal year 2008 which ended June 30 of that year. At that time the balance was about $287.2 million, according to the city's annual audited financial reports. In fiscal year 2009, there wasn't any extra cash to add to the general fund kitty. In fact, Houston's charter requires the city to keep a balanced budget, and for the past two years, the city has relied in part on reserve funds to satisfy the requirement. The city drew $26 million from the undesignated fund in fiscal 2009, lowering the balance to $261.1 million by June, 2009. Mitchell has projected the balance will drop to about $166 million by June 30 this year. Summing up: Houston took in more money than it spent for most of White's six-year tenure as mayor, and socked some of it away. Since fiscal 2009, the city has been drawing on those reserve funds, ending each year with less than it started. So far, it has drawn $56 million from the fund. Parker is correct that the city has spent more than it's taken in for years, though her time reference works only because the city's fiscal year always includes portions of two calendar years — in this case, 2008 and 2009. Put another way, the city has taken in less than it’s spent for about a year and a half, which includes one complete fiscal year and part of the current one. We rate Parker's statement as Half True.

pomt-13033	"Texans pay the sixth-highest property tax in the nation."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/dec/01/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-mostly-right-texans-pay-nations-sixth-/	After Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick saluted legislation potentially giving voters more sway over local property taxes, we wondered afresh about how Texas ranks nationally in terms of property tax burden. Patrick, talking up a proposal hatched by fellow Republicans led by Houston state Sen. Paul Bettencourt, said in a Nov. 29, 2016, press release: "Texans pay the sixth-highest property tax in the nation, and Texans have told us loud and clear that common-sense property tax reform legislation is long overdue." In January 2016, we found Mostly True the same claim by a Bexar County legislative aspirant. The business-oriented Tax Foundation, a national group, drew on 2013 Census Bureau data to map the average amount of residential property tax paid as a percentage of home value state by state. By that metric, the Texas rate of 1.9 percent proved higher than the rates in 44 states; it was topped by the rates for Wisconsin, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Illinois and No. 1 New Jersey at 2.38 percent. Still, we noted, property taxes in Texas are levied locally in Texas, resulting in ample differences in the burden depending on where taxpayers live. Rankings yet to be updated Not a lot has changed since we reached that conclusion. For starters, the rankings — showing Texas with the sixth highest "mean effective property tax rate on owner-occupied housing" — haven’t been updated, the foundation’s Jared Walczak said to our inquiry. Yet, Walczak also told us by email, "this does not make Texas a high-tax state. Texas has chosen to rely more heavily on property taxes, and less heavily on other taxes, than many peer states, foregoing some altogether. The state's tax structure is an important part of its economic success, and it is inevitable that, when a state foregoes an individual income tax, some other tax will be somewhat higher than it might otherwise have been." In fact, the foundation has previously reported that in 2012 Texas ranked 46th in state-local taxes per resident. Why property taxes can be high Property taxes might be higher here because unlike most states, Texas levies no state income tax. Notably too, unlike in some states, Texas’ property tax rates are set locally, not by the state, according to the Texas state comptroller, with government units spending the revenue to provide local services including schools, streets and roads, police and fire protection and many others. Moreover, the state lacks the constitutional authority to levy a property tax, as the Texas Legislative Council noted in a 2002 overview of local taxes statewide. Generally under the current system, a county appraisal district does an annual property valuation, then each area city, county, school and special district (like hospital and road districts) sets the respective tax rate necessary to raise the money needed to fund the related adopted budget. And according to Census data, property taxes in 2013, the latest year of available data, were the source of 81.6 percent of local tax revenue in Texas (the national average for this figure was 46.7 percent). Updated information is to be posted Dec. 9, 2016, bureau spokesman Sean Patrick told us by email. Regional differences When we looked into this topic before, advocates including Dick Lavine of the liberal-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities and Dale Craymer of the business-backed Texas Taxpayers and Research Association suggested we consider a comparison study by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy showing that property owners in the biggest cities of Texas, especially Houston and San Antonio, had some of the highest property taxes in 2014 compared with large cities in other states. That remained so the next year, according to a June 2016 institute study indicating, for instance, that El Paso homeowners in 2015 ranked No. 3 among the country’s 50 most populous cities in homestead property taxes on a $150,000 property or $300,000 property. Among the 50 cities, homestead taxes in large Texas cities including Austin, Dallas and San Antonio ranked No. 5 (Fort Worth) to No. 13 (Houston), according to the report. The disparity between property taxes by county comes through in real-dollar terms, although measures of taxes in terms of dollars paid can be distorted by the difference in home prices from county to county. A Tax Foundation map shows in real dollars just how much property taxes vary from county to county based on IRS data reflecting the amount of real estate taxes deducted from federal taxes. In 2013, Texas counties with residents paying the most were Travis ($7,553), Kendall ($6,916) and Fort Bend ($6,813), while those paying the least are Dickens ($1,325), Stonewall ($1,425) and Hudspeth ($1,450). Another factor to think about when considering the property tax burden for the average Texan is the rate of home ownership. The Tax Foundation map showing Texas tied for sixth-highest in property taxes considered the percentage of home value that’s paid in property taxes on owner-occupied housing. In 2015, 61.1 percent of Texas housing was owner-occupied, tying the state with Oregon for the nation’s sixth-lowest rate, according to the Census Bureau. Our ruling Patrick said: "Texans pay the sixth-highest property tax in the nation." While it may be true that on average, Texas property taxes are the sixth-highest in the nation, the actual taxpayer burden on residents can vary greatly by locality, making the average less representative. We rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-06020	Freshman Rep. Bob Gibbs "is spending his one year anniversary on vacation — only working 6 days in all of January."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2012/jan/16/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-says-bob-gibbs-vacationing-congress-all-six-d/	Working hard, or hardly working? That question has been asked about Congress since at least the middle of the 20th century, when Congress adopted a three-day work week (making Monday and Friday travel days) and longer sessions. Congressional leaders keep fiddling with the calendar. Their scheduling practices, as noted by their own Congressional Research Service, have been criticized frequently for leading to "compressed workweeks, protracted daily sessions, conflicts between floor and committee work, pressure on family life, and inefficient use of time generally." The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect Democrats to the House of Representatives, raised scheduling as an issue in a news release aimed at Rep. Bob Gibbs, a Republican from the 18th District in east-central Ohio. The release marked the first anniversary of Gibbs' swearing-in. Identical releases targeted at least seven other first-term Republicans. "With so much work to do to get the economy back on track and Americans back to work," it said, "Gibbs is spending his one year anniversary on vacation — only working 6 days in all of January." PolitiFact Ohio is quite familiar with the six-day workweek. The six-day month was something new. We asked the DCCC for verification. They referred us to the official House calendar released last month by GOP Majority Leader Eric Cantor. It shows the House scheduled to be in session on six days in January: the 17th, 18th, 23rd, 24th, 25th and 31st. "Our release highlights that the primary role of a member of Congress is to serve in Congress," DCCC press secretary Haley Morris said. "When folks run for office, they run to go to Washington to enact policy and vote. Under GOP majority, the House and Congressman Gibbs are spending most of their time this month on recess." We called Gibbs' office and asked how he has been spending his recess time. Spokeswoman Catherine Gatewood made the most of the opportunity. "Bob has been spending time with constituents to listen to their concerns, meeting with business leaders to find out how we can best turn this economy around, and engaging with public officials to learn more about how the federal government helps or hinders their work locally," she said. "The House of Representatives is often referred to as 'the People's House,' and that only remains true if the people get a voice. "Bob Gibbs believes that best way to represent his constituents is to hear directly from them, and the best way to do that is to be out and active in the district." In fact, "travel days" and "home district periods" are facts of congressional life, whether the district time is used for constituent services, meetings or fundraising. Recesses are called "work breaks" rather than vacations. "To be sure, few members will head to the beach," The Christian Science Monitor noted last fall. "Between fundraisers, town-hall meetings, and constituent services, they tend to work at least as hard out of session as they do in it." Committees can meet and hold hearings during a recess. And Gibbs’ congressional offices in Washington and in his Ohio district remain staffed and open, even if the House is not in session. Cantor drew criticism for setting a light, 109-day calendar for 2012. But the scheduled 123-day calendar for 2011 became 175 days in session, according to figures the Office of the House Clerk provided. The 104-day calendar that a Democratic majority set for 2008 -- another election year -- became 119 days. House sessions have averaged 135 days since 2000. PolitiFact won't take sides on the question of whether Congress should meet more or less frequently or has it just right. But we think the DCCC's claim that House members are on vacation on days when no session is scheduled ignores the realities of what makes up a representative’s job. Subcommittee meetings and fact-finding hearings? They don’t count. Solving problems raised by constituents? Doesn’t count either. Nor does time spent meeting in the district with the people they are supposed to represent. And it’s important to remember, too, that the legislative calendar isn’t set by the individual members. The calendar for all is set by Cantor and congressional leadership. That means that the gauge the DCCC has applied here would support making the same claim about just six working days in January for every Democratic member, too, from minority leader Nancy Pelosi to Democratic National Committee chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz. Somehow we doubt they are making those claims. When a claim is not accurate, it earns a rating of False. But when the statement also makes a ridiculous claim, as this one does, it’s time to turn up the heat on the Truth-O-Meter: Pants on Fire.

pomt-08627	Says the Austin chapter of the League of Women Voters has no Republicans among elected officers or on its debate committee.	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/sep/20/steve-munisteri/steve-munisteri-republican-party-chair-says-austin/	Urging two GOP candidates for the State Board of Education not to join a televised debate being organized by the Austin area's chapter of the League of Women Voters, the chairman of the Republican Party of Texas said Aug. 31 that the group's officers and debate committee members had voted in multiple Democratic primaries. "How can the Austin chapter of the LWV claim to be non-partisan when there are no Republicans among their elected officers or on their debate committee?" Chairman Steve Munisteri said. In this article, we aren't testing the GOP's contention the Austin chapter can't be considered non-partisan because of its leaders' personal voting histories. Dem are fighting words and the fight's not here. But we wondered if Munisteri accurately tweaked an absence of Republicans among the leaguers whose chapter is affiliated with the long-established national group that trumpets a non-partisan interest in encouraging voter education and participation. Notably, this isn't our first foray into checking personal voting histories to gauge individuals' partisan leans. In May, we found False a claim that out of 50 registered voters in the history department at the University of Texas, one is a Republican. By our count, of 48 history department faculty members registered to vote in Travis County, five had participated in Republican primaries, four of them voting in this year's GOP primary. Also of significance: Voting in a Republican or Democratic primary doesn't always mean a person sees himself as belonging to that party — never mind the bulk of voters who abstain from primaries and whose political affiliations, if any, aren't reflected in voting records. Unlike in some other states, Texas voters don't register their party affiliation. Any registered voter can vote in any primary (though they can't switch to the other party's runoffs). Per the Texas GOP's claim about the Austin chapter of the League of Women Voters, the party's supporting press release provides primary voting histories for 13 league activists. From 2004 through 2010, the party says, these individuals voted 45 out of 52 times in Democratic primaries; in seven instances, the selected members did not vote in a primary. And among the 13, the party says, there was no instance of anyone voting in a Republican primary. We asked the GOP for its research and learned that it checked Travis County records for the voting histories of 24 chapter activists. According to the GOP's summary of that research, the 24 activists (counting the 13 highlighted by Munisteri) voted 66 times in Democratic primaries from 2004 through 2010 and four times in Republican primaries. More than 20 times, the GOP says, the activists did not vote in any primary. Munisteri agreed in an interview with us that primary participation doesn't always prove party affiliation. That said, Munisteri said, "if somebody has never voted in the Republican primary and in the last four Democratic primaries they have voted in all four Democratic primaries, they are a Democrat." With help from Frances McIntyre, the chapter's president, we realized that Munisteri's statement--that no elected board members or debate committee members are Republicans--centers on 11 individuals, six identified as "elected officers" on the chapter's website and five McIntyre confirmed to us as its debate committee members; she said a sixth committee member was overlooked. Among the 11, the GOP summary says, six voted in all four Democratic primaries since 2004, four voted in three out of four Democratic primaries, one voted in two of the party's primaries--and none voted in a Republican primary. We asked Munisteri if it's possible that some Republican-leaning voters participate in Travis County's Democratic primaries to have sway over who fills local elected posts, which are most often won by Democrats. Munisteri replied: "I don’t believe that any committed Republican votes four out of the last four times in the Democratic primary." He added that none of the league activists singled out in the GOP's sally "has denied they are Democrats." Powerful case? So it seems, especially after Abbie Tobias, a Travis County superviser of voter registration, confirmed the voting histories of 17 of 24 individuals in the GOP's review, except that two of the 17 (including a debate committee member) voted in the 2008 Democratic primary (the GOP had said both did not vote in that year's primaries). One person the party says voted in the 2010 Republican primary has no record of voting in the past four primaries, Tobias determined. She wasn't able to gauge the voting histories for the other voters because their names were too common in the database or were missing altogether. For her part, McIntyre told us she's always been a Democrat. However, she said, "a lot of my friends have voted in various primaries, or in the general election they vote with the Libertarians." Regardless of personal primary histories, she said, the league is resolutely non-partisan; she passed along the chapter's nonpartisan "policy statement," which says board members "shall refrain from conspicuous partisan political activities." She said the chapter has 285 members. After we informed McIntyre that the GOP's original research covered 13 additional league activists, she noted that six of those 13 are elected board members--equivalent in status to elected officers except they serve one-year rather than two-year terms. A wrinkle: The GOP's research says two of the six board members voted in this year's GOP primary and one of the pair, Lenora DuBose, also voted in the 2004 Republican primary. We called DuBose, who oversees the league's voter guide. She confirmed her voting history and said she considers herself a Republican. Separately, our search of campaign finance filings at the Texas Ethics Commission indicated that DuBose has made donations to the campaigns of Victor Carrillo, a Republican on the Texas Railroad Commission. (The other board member the GOP found to have voted in the 2010 Republican primary declined to comment.) Next, we asked the Republican Party why Munisteri disregarded DuBose's vote history. Spokesman Chris Elam noted via e-mail that the chapter's website separates out its "elected officers" whose voting histories support Munisteri's statement. Other board members are listed as "directors." McIntyre conceded in an e-mail that a visitor to the site could be confused about which individuals were elected to the board, but she said who gets elected to what is clear in a "workbook" sent to members before the chapter's board elections. All in all, Elam said, the Austin chapter has no Republicans among its elected officers while among their directors, they have one. How does Munisteri's statement come out? His claim--"there are no Republicans among their elected officers or on their debate committee"--is staked to the not-always-so premise that primary voting patterns prove one's partisan lean. Still, the verifiable vote histories of the 11 people cherry-picked in the statement seem to demonstrate common Democratic inclinations. That said, it appears that two elected board members voted in this year's Republican primary including DuBose, who told us she considers herself a Republican. Her voting history alone--which the party had in hand before Munisteri made his statement--weakens the claim that no Republicans guide the chapter. We rate Munisteri's statement Half True.

pomt-14253	"Poll after poll after poll shows me beating Hillary."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/11/ted-cruz/national-surveys-show-ted-cruz-isnt-beating-hillar/	A key selling point for Republican presidential candidates is that they're the one who can beat Democrat Hillary Clinton in November. With the New York primary coming up on Tuesday, April 19, that was part of the pitch Ted Cruz made when interviewed on CNN by Dana Bash. The Texas senator said five of the 17 original Republican candidates now support him, along with other prominent Republicans, "and what we are seeing, that's the unity it's going take to win the nomination. It's also the unity it's going to take to beat Hillary Clinton. And my focus is on beating Hillary Clinton, and poll after poll after poll shows Donald losing badly to Hillary. And poll after poll after poll shows me beating Hillary." That's a lot of polls. We just looked at how Trump does against Clinton after conservative commentator Glenn Beck said on the April 10 edition of Meet the Press that polls show "Hillary Clinton wins every time with Donald Trump." We rated that statement True. For this check, we wondered if Cruz was accurately portraying his standing in the national surveys. We went back to RealClearPolitics.com and found that the Texas senator is off. Of the nine surveys released in the last month, Cruz beats Clinton in only one — a Fox News poll where Cruz scores 3 percentage points higher than Clinton. The two were tied in the latest McClatchy/Marist poll and in a CNN/ORC poll. The margins of error were +/- 3 percentage points. In the other six polls, Clinton beat Cruz. In four of those surveys, Clinton's margin exceeded the margin of error. Cruz was looking stronger against Clinton in February, where he tied or beat Clinton in five of six surveys. But in only one of those polls was Cruz's margin greater than the margin of error. If you use the most recent results from the various polling organizations since Feb. 4, Cruz wins in two, ties in two and loses in seven. We contacted Cruz's spokeswoman to ask about the results but didn't hear back. So when Cruz says he beats Clinton in poll after poll after poll, he's short a poll or two. We rate his claim Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/f0083e82-0e00-42ed-9446-ae107d0b4c17	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2016-04-11T16:30:36	2016-04-07	['None']
pomt-10202	"When George Bush said we shouldn't investigate why the government's response to Hurricane Katrina was so incompetent, John McCain stood with him."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/15/joe-biden/mccain-supported-republican-backed-investigation/	In a speech hammering the theme that Sen. John McCain would not offer much change from the last eight years under President George W. Bush, Sen. Joe Biden hit on what many consider a low point of the Bush presidency: the federal government's slow response to Hurricane Katrina. "When George Bush said we shouldn't investigate why the government's response to Hurricane Katrina was so incompetent, John McCain stood with him," Biden said in a speech in St. Clair Shores, Mich., on Sept. 15, 2008. It's true that McCain joined other Republicans in the Senate to fend off Democratic efforts led by Sen. Hillary Clinton to create an independent commission to examine the federal, state and local response to Hurricane Katrina. On Sept. 14, 2005, McCain and 53 other Senate Republicans rejected an effort by Clinton to establish the commission by attaching an amendment to a spending bill. Republicans said the move violated Senate rules by attempting to legislate policy via a spending bill. Less than five months later, on Feb. 2, 2006, McCain joined with 52 Senate Republicans in a vote to kill a Clinton effort to attach a similar amendment to a tax bill. Both votes came down entirely along partisan lines. And they came at a time of particularly bitter recriminations over the federal response to Hurricane Katrina, while the White House was refusing to release certain documents or to make senior officials available for sworn testimony before Congress, citing the confidentiality of executive branch communications. But it's misleading to suggest that McCain opposed all efforts to investigate the government's response to Katrina. Republicans in the GOP-controlled Senate threw their support behind a probe by the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, which looked into the federal role in hurricane preparedness and its response. Republican leaders expressed faith in the bipartisan investigation and derided Democratic efforts to charter an independent commission to conduct a parallel inquiry. An aide to then-Majority Leader Bill Frist, R-Tenn., called amendments to establish an independent Katrina commission "taxpayer-funded flatulence that would just waste time and money to distract from the inquiry already well under way in the Senate." And Republicans did offer to create a bipartisan congressional committee consisting of senators and representatives to examine the hurricane response. But Democrats took a pass, saying it wouldn't be truly bipartisan because as minority party they wouldn't have subpoena power. Biden is correct that McCain did not support the Democratic plan to create an independent commission to investigate the government's response to Katrina. But McCain didn't oppose all investigation. He supported the Homeland Security investigation. It may not have been the kind of investigation the Democrats wanted. It may not have had the independence Democrats wanted. But it was an investigation. And so we rate Biden's statement Half True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2008-09-15T00:00:00	2008-09-15	['John_McCain', 'George_W._Bush', 'Hurricane_Katrina']

pomt-02578	Women "make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jan/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-state-union-says-women-make-77-cents-/	During his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama made a claim about pay for women in today’s economy. "You know, today, women make up about half our workforce, but they still make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns," Obama said. "That is wrong, and in 2014, it's an embarrassment. Women deserve equal pay for equal work." It was not the first time Obama (or other Democrats) have offered the 77-cent data point -- not by a long shot. A search on the White House website calls up literally dozens of examples of policy papers, blog posts and speeches in which the president cited the 77-cent statistic. He used it in a proclamation for National Equal Pay Day (July 20, 2010), in remarks at a White House forum on women and the economy (April 6, 2012), in a conference call with reporters (June 4, 2012), and remarks on the 50th anniversary of the Equal Pay Act (June 10, 2013), just to cite a few. Before we get into the statistics, we need to explain how we’re approaching this claim in this fact-check. We’ve heard the 77-cent statistic used a lot of different ways, and small changes in wording make a big difference in determining whether it’s accurate or not. The less accurate version -- once offered by Obama himself -- states that women make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns for the same work, or in the same job. As we’ll explain below, the data doesn’t show that. By contrast, the more accurate version simply states that women make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns, period. That is more accurate (though not without some caveats, also listed below). We struggled a bit with how to classify the claim Obama made in the State of the Union, since his phrasing was somewhat ambiguous. He used the more accurate formulation, but he then followed up two sentences later by saying, "Women deserve equal pay for equal work." Did Obama’s "equal pay for equal work" line suggest that he believes the 77-cent pay differential refers to statistical comparisons of "equal work"? Or was this sentence simply a philosophical statement that was distinct from the statistical claim? Ultimately, we decided that Obama’s statement that "women deserve equal pay for equal work" was aspirational rather than a part of his statistical claim, so we’re judging him on his claim that women "make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns." Here’s a rundown of what we’ve found in the past, updated for the most recent data. Ratios vary depending on the methodology The basic federal data comes from two agencies -- the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. But the two agencies’ numbers don’t exactly agree. The Census Bureau, which tracks annual wages, found women who worked full-time, year-round in 2012 made 77 cents for every dollar men earned across the country -- a percentage in line with what it’s been for the last few years. This comparison includes all male and female workers regardless of occupation. Meanwhile, the Bureau of Labor Statistics uses a different measures to analyze the pay gap, including weekly wages. BLS found that women who worked full time in wage and salary jobs had median usual weekly earnings of $669 in 2012, which was 82 percent of men’s median weekly earnings. This, too, was in line with the ratio in recent years. What’s the difference? Unlike the measure of annual wages by the Census Bureau, the weekly wage analysis does not account for people who are self-employed. It does include people left out of the year-round wage measure, such as some teachers, construction workers and seasonal workers. Another measure -- hourly rates -- shows a smaller degree of pay disparity. According to BLS data, women were paid 86 percent of the median hourly wages of men in 2012. This evaluation accounts for part-time (fewer than 35 hours) workers, which are more often women and are paid less than their salaried counterparts. Women paid by the hour made median hourly earnings of $11.99, compared to $13.88 for men. However, this figure excludes salaried workers -- another reason why the statistics differ. Heidi Hartmann, president of the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, told PolitiFact in 2012 that the measure of annual wages is preferable, since it doesn’t exclude salaried workers. "It’s the one that goes back the furthest in time," she said. "It’s the one that is most traditional." But some researchers, such as the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, prefer working with hourly wages, arguing "an incomplete picture" is cast with weekly earnings because women work fewer hours than men, "which would make a gap in weekly earnings between the two groups substantial even if their hourly wages are the same." In other words, there’s a range of professional opinion on what the data shows. Differences in jobs held It’s important to point out a few additional caveats. First, there’s a significant variation in wage gaps from occupation to occupation. The Institute for Women’s Policy research looked at pay parity for the top 20 occupations for women in 2011 using median weekly earnings. The center found the pay gap varied depending on the sector, though women lag in nearly every category. Nurses (96 cents for every dollar) and cashiers (90 cents) were closer than most; accountants (77 cents) and financial advisers (66 cents) were more divergent than most. Second, it’s important to note that the existence of a pay gap doesn’t necessarily mean that the gap is caused by individual employer-level discrimination. Rather, some portion is likely the result of broader demographic patterns. For instance, men and women historically enter certain fields more than others -- a phenomenon known as "occupational segregation." Women more often choose to be receptionists, nurses and teachers, while men pursue paths as truck drivers, managers and computer software engineers, according to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research. When data from all these fields is combined together, as in the Census and BLS studies, the gap is at least partially explained by the predominance of women in lower-paying fields, rather than women necessarily being paid less for the same job than men are. In addition, women disproportionately obtain degrees that lead to lower-paying jobs than men, and they take more time off from work for pregnancy and child care, according to a 2009 analysis by the nonpartisan CONSAD Research Corp. in Pittsburgh. Despite the growth in fathers’ role in child care, the child-care burden shouldered by women tends to restrict their career options and hours worked. While such patterns raise important policy questions, they don’t necessarily point to discrimination per se. So how much of a role does discrimination play? Hartmann attributed anywhere from one-quarter to one-third of the gap to direct discrimination by the employer. A U.S. Labor Department blog post put it a bit higher -- around 40 percent. The CONSAD paper suggested that when you control for every factor but discrimination, the gap shrunk to between 93 cents and 95 cents -- not zero, but significantly smaller than the 77-cent figure Obama used. When we checked with the White House, a spokesman acknowledged that there is more than one way to calculate the gender pay gap, and that discrimination isn’t the only factor causing the gap. But the spokesman added that it would be wrong to ignore how discrimination and differences in workplace flexibility impact occupational choice. Our ruling Obama said women "make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns." It's worth noting that the entire 77-cent gap is not necessarily due to discrimination -- a conclusion some listeners might have drawn when hearing Obama mention "equal pay for equal work" shortly after citing the 77-cent figure. And there are alternative calculations that show a smaller overall gap. Still, the 77-cent ratio is a credible figure from a credible agency. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-11107	"Flip Flop! After opposing term limits for decades, Adam Putnam adopts Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis’ position."	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/jun/08/florida-democratic-party/did-adam-putnam-adopt-donald-trump-and-ron-desanti/	Republican governor candidate Adam Putnam has been a politician for over half of his life, providing opponents a long history of stances to chew on. "Flip Flop! After opposing term limits for decades, Adam Putnam adopts Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis’ position," read the subject line of a Florida Democratic Party news release. Putnam’s flip-flop, according to the Florida Democrats, came June 6 when he weighed in on term limits for school board members. "If term limits are good enough for the governor and the Legislature, they're good enough for school boards," Putnam said via email to the Tampa Bay Times. Term limits have been an issue in Florida for quite some time. Voters in November will decide whether to approve a constitutional amendment establishing eight-year term limits on school board members, among other things. The proposal closely mirrors the 1992 measure that established eight-year caps on members of Florida’s Legislature. Congressional term limits are also a priority of the man Putnam is looking to replace, Gov. Rick Scott. For this reason, we wanted to see if the claim had any credence. Did Putnam really change a longtime stance opposing term limits to one that lines up with DeSantis and Trump? While there is some truth to this claim, the link to Trump is largely irrelevant. Trump’s position on term limits is mainly about Congress, not school boards and state legislatures. Putnam on term limits over the years Putnam served in the U.S. House for 10 years before he started the first of two terms as agriculture commissioner in 2011. He also was a member of the Florida House from 1996 to 2000. The issue of term limits has come up several times over his political tenure. The Democrats latched onto several instances of Putnam discussing why, at the federal level, he did not support a limit on terms. When Putnam was first elected to the U.S. House in 2000, he hinted that voters should control the term lengths of lawmakers. "I have always believed that voters are the ultimate term limit implementers," Putnam said Nov. 25, 2000, according to the Associated Press. "The voters are pretty effective at giving those two-year job evaluations." He turned down signing a term-limit pledge in Congress as a candidate in 2000. And he voted against term limits as a citizen, he said, when they were on the referendum in the state of Florida in 1992. (He was 18 at the time.) "I believe term limits are implemented every two years by the voting public for the House of Representatives," Putnam said in a 2001 appearance on CNN. "I voted against them when they were on the referendum in the state of Florida. And so, therefore, I did not take the pledge." And finally, as agriculture commissioner in 2012, Putnam suggested that the eight-year term limit on state lawmakers impedes their ability to do their job. "The eight-year (term limit) time frame virtually guarantees the likelihood of someone spending more than one term as a committee chair is almost nil because it suggests you are ineffective," Putnam said in a Tampa Bay Times column. Did he flip to a position of DeSantis, Trump? The Democrats started to shout "flip-flop" after a comment by Putnam on June 4, 2018. Putnam said he supports term limits on school board members, telling the Tampa Bay Times that "if term limits are good enough for the governor and the legislature, they're good enough for school boards." That position is consistent with his primary opponent, DeSantis, who recently penned an op-ed for the U.S. Term Limits website in support of Florida’s Amendment 8 requiring school board term limits. "No elected office, whether federal or local, is ever better off when run by career politicians," DeSantis wrote. "That’s why I support eight-year term limits for all school board member." The connection to Trump is more tenuous. As a presidential candidate, Trump promised to enact a constitutional amendment that would extend term limits to all members of Congress (which is Stalled on our Trump-O-Meter). "If I’m elected president, I will push for a constitutional amendment to impose term limits on all members of Congress," Trump said at a rally in Colorado Springs, Colo. "Right? They’ve been talking about that for years." Trump’s 100-day action plan also detailed his term-limit plans for Congress. But Trump has not specifically come out in support of school board term limits, in Florida or elsewhere, as Putnam did. To back up the Trump connection, Florida Democratic Party spokesman Kevin Donohoe pointed to an alleged remark from a 2016 rally in South Carolina to suggest Trump’s comments throughout the 2016 campaign were broad enough to make the argument he supports term limits for "any politician." "Under my proposal, there will never be a 'next campaign' for any politician in America ever again," a Newsmax article quoted Trump as saying. We checked the Lexis Nexis and CQ databases for evidence of Trump’s remark, as well as Factba.se, which compiles everything the president has ever publicly said or tweeted. As it turns out, Trump didn’t really say that. The quote came from a 2016 column on The Blaze by Wayne Allyn Root, who urged Trump to brand himself the "Term Limits President." "Here is the speech Donald should give this week in South Carolina," Root wrote, before adding the quote that was shared on Newsmax. Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party said, "Flip-flop: After opposing term limits for decades, Adam Putnam adopts Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis’ position." The Democrats are conflating Putnam’s general position against term limits for members of Congress and state government with a recent ballot initiative on school boards. They have a point that Putnam has long been skeptical of term limits, declining pledges to support them, criticizing them as impeding sound governance, and voting against them in 1992 as a young adult. Putnam’s most recent comments in support of term limits for school board members do suggest a change in tone, and they are in line with his opponent, DeSantis. However, Trump’s position on term limits is a red herring in this case. Trump has promised to enact congressional term limits, but has not specifically come out in support of term limits for school board members. A piece of evidence the Democrats provided relies on a suggested speech for Trump, and is not a stated philosophy. For a claim that is partially accurate but omits critical context, we rate it Half True.

pomt-02491	"Seventy percent of all uninsured live in households in which at least one person is working."	true	/virginia/statements/2014/feb/17/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-70-percent-medically-uninsured-live/	Gov. Terry McAuliffe is urging the General Assembly to expand Virginia’s Medicaid program, in part, because it would help the working poor. "Seventy percent of all uninsured live in households in which at least one person is working," he said last month in an address to the legislature. When we asked where the figure came from, McAuliffe spokesman Brian Coy sent us a presentation used by the Virginia Health Care Foundation, a non-profit organization seeking to increase access to health care for the uninsured. The percentage was computed in 2011 by the Urban Institute, a research organization. There’s a slight caveat McAuliffe did not explain. The 70 percent figure applies to people up to the age 64, as most people older than that are part of Medicare and, therefore, insured. The analysis divided workers into two categories: Those working more than 35 hours per week were deemed full-time; while those working 35 hours or less per week were deemed part-time. Of the uninsured living in Virginia: 40.7 percent lived in a family with one full-time worker 23.7 percent lived in a family with only part-time workers 5.9 percent lived in a family with two full-time workers 28.6 percent live in a family with no workers 1.1 percent are children not living with adults. That adds up to 70.3 percent of uninsured Virginians living in a household where at least one person is working. For perspective, roughly 1 million Virginians are uninsured -- about 12 percent of the population. Our ruling McAuliffe said 70 percent of medically uninsured Virginians live in households where at least one person works. His figure is backed by research from the Urban Institute and we were unable to find any contradictory study. So we rate McAuliffe’s claim True.

pomt-14917	Electric car sales in Georgia have dropped dramatically since a $5,000 tax credit was eliminated and a $200 annual registration fee was imposed July 1.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/nov/02/don-francis/electric-car-sales-hit-brakes-tax-credit-axed-and-/	The Georgia General Assembly earlier this year pulled the plug on one of the nation’s most generous state tax credits for electric cars. At the same time, state lawmakers voted to impose a $200 annual registration fee on owners of some plug-in hybrids and all zero-emissions vehicles to make up for the gas taxes those motorists don’t pay and to help fund a backlog of road projects. Both changes took effect July 1, and already, preliminary numbers show sales of the Nissan Leaf and other electric cars are plummeting, Don Francis, coordinator of the Clean Cities-Georgia Coalition, said in an interview published Oct. 28 at Watchdog.org. New electric car registrations in Georgia fell 89 percent from 1,338 in June, the last month that the tax credit was available, to 148 in August, Francis said. Sound surprising? Maybe not. True? PolitiFact decided to dig deeper. First, we’ll provide some background. Georgia started providing a tax credit for electric car purchases in 1998. Initially, businesses and individuals were offered a tax credit up to $1,500 as incentive to buy alternative-fuel vehicles. Two years later, the credit was upped to $2,500 for all low-emission vehicles, and in 2001, it was doubled to $5,000 for zero-emission vehicles. By comparison, Louisiana and Maryland offer a credit up to $3,000, and Utah gives up to $1,500. All three states limit the tax credit to vehicle purchases. Georgia’s $5,000 credit meant huge savings for state residents who wanted to buy or even lease an electric car -- especially when coupled with a federal tax credit that could be as much as $7,500, depending on the capacity of the vehicle’s battery. Those who wanted to get rid of the tax credit said that the double tax credits were excessive and allowing Atlanta yuppies to lease electric cars, including the $30,000 Leaf, for as little as $100 a month. Supporters said the tax credit made Georgia one of the top states for electric cars, a positive step especially in metro Atlanta where air pollution from auto emissions has been a persistent problem. Statewide, electric car ownership has jumped dramatically just in the past couple of years.. According to the state Revenue Department, 1,743 electric cars were riding the roads of Georgia in 2012. By 2014, that number had soared to 15,729, or an increase of 802 percent, with two-thirds of them parking outside homes in metro Atlanta’s four biggest counties -- Fulton (4,288), Cobb (2,397), Gwinnett (2,087) and DeKalb (2,067). Proposals to eliminate the tax credit went nowhere in 2013 and 2014. But in this year’s legislative session, when raising $1 billion for transportation projects was a priority, budget analysts said cutting the tax credit for electric cars would bring in $66 million by 2016 and nearly $190 million by 2020. Supporters of the tax credit touted a private study that said, without the tax credit, Georgia’s economy would lose $252 million in the next 16 years. What the numbers say We began our fact check by contacting Francis, who opposed abolishing the state tax credit during this year’s General Assembly session. Francis shared with PolitiFact a spreadsheet that he developed based on motor vehicle data he obtained from a national automotive information company. The data showed a spike in Georgia’s electric car sales in the months between when lawmakers voted to kill the tax credit and when it officially expired July 1. Sales declined sharply in July, going from 1,338 in June to 776, and fell even more, to 149, in August, the last month for which data are available, Francis said. "When you were selling an average of just over 1,000 (cars) a month and then it goes to 150 a month, you have to say: ‘What changed?’" Francis said. "Two things changed: The tax credit went away, and the $200 fee was added." We contacted officials at IHS Automotive, the company where Francis received the data used in the spreadsheet, and asked it to review the accuracy of his information. Michelle Culver, senior manager for corporate communications at IHS, said via an email that "we did a spot check on this, and it is our data and accurate." We also decided to find out what the Georgia Department of Revenue, the agency in charge of vehicle registrations in the state, was seeing. William Gaston, the department’s spokesman, sent us data on new car sales, rather than new car registrations. The reason, he said, was an owner could register a vehicle after July 1 but have purchased it before the deadline and thus qualify for the tax credit. Revenue Department numbers and Francis’ data brought us to the same conclusion -- sales of electric cars have done a nosedive. Specifically, Georgians purchased 5,434 zero-emissions vehicles -- or an average of 905 a month -- from Jan. 1 to June 30 of this year, when the $5,000 tax credit was available. Between July 1 and Sept. 30 -- when the state tax credit was no longer available -- 439 electric cars were sold, or about 149 per month. Our ruling: Don Francis, coordinator of the Clean Cities-Georgia Coalition, said electric car sales in Georgia have dropped dramatically since a $5,000 tax credit was eliminated and a $200 annual registration fee was imposed July 1. That statement is backed up by data available so far on new car registrations and new car sales. Keep in mind that car sales spiked as people rushed to buy before the credit expired July 1, and that makes the post-July 1 drop in sales look that much more shocking. Whether that trend holds remains to be seen. But everything we found so far indicates Francis is on the money. We therefore rate his statement as True.

pomt-14708	A Trump television ad shows Mexicans swarming over "our southern border."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/04/donald-trump/donald-trumps-first-tv-ad-shows-migrants-southern-/	In a new television ad -- his campaign’s first -- Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump shows footage of dozens of people swarming over a border fence. But the footage isn’t as it seems. About halfway through the ad, a narrator says of Trump, "He'll stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border that Mexico will pay for." Video footage shows dozens of people streaming across the border, as if they were ants fleeing an anthill. The clear suggestion is that the footage is of the "southern border" between the United States and Mexico. But it’s not -- it’s 5,000 miles away, in a small Spanish enclave on the mainland of Morocco. PolitiFact was able to trace the footage back to the Italian television network RepubblicaTV. On May 3, 2014, the network posted footage of migrants crossing the border into Melilla, one of two enclaves on the Moroccan coast that are held by Spain. Migrants who cross the border there are essentially entering territory held by a European Union nation, even though they are still on the African continent. (It can also be seen posted by a YouTube user here.) The RepubblicaTV video is time-stamped May 1, 2014. According to the description posted by the network (and using Google Translate) the video was released by the Interior Ministry in Madrid, showing an "onslaught of hundreds of migrants to the wall that separates the Spanish enclave of Melilla from Morocco. About 800 tried to cross the border on May 1st. Those who failed to escape the control of the Civil Guard were hanging on the barriers for six hours before being rejected." The 2014 RepubblicaTV video resurfaced a year later, in a July 2015 YouTube post titled, "1,000s of immigrants try to cross the border at once." It makes no reference to the location. By the time the footage made it into Trump’s ad, both RepubblicaTV’s logo and the 2014 time stamp were no longer visible. Regardless of Trump’s imagery, the Pew Research Center noted last month that "for the first time since the 1940s, more immigrants from Mexico are leaving the U.S. than coming into the country. The shift is due to several reasons, including slow economic recovery after the Great Recession that may have made the U.S. less attractive, as well as stricter enforcement of U.S. immigration laws, particularly at the border." Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said she did not know the source of the video included in the ad and that she doesn't speak for the video production company. Our ruling Trump’s television ad purports to show Mexicans swarming over "our southern border." However, the footage used to support this point actually shows African migrants streaming over a border fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Melilla, more than 5,000 miles away.

pomt-12835	Says President Donald Trump’s "executive order leads to capture of ISIS leader, Rasheed Muhammad."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/07/blog-posting/trumps-executive-order-did-not-lead-isis-leaders-a/	A fabricated news story claiming Donald Trump’s controversial executive order on immigration led to the arrest of a suspected terrorist doesn’t pass inspection. "Executive order leads to capture of ISIS leader, Rasheed Muhammad," reads the headline on a Jan. 31, 2017, story at USAPoliticsZone.com. The post was flagged by Facebook as part of the website’s efforts to identify potentially contrived news stories. The story is false, however, and appears to have originated on a website chock full of fabricated content. Trump’s Jan. 27 order barred citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Somalia, Sudan and Libya from entering the United States for 90 days. It also puts Syrian refugee admissions on hold indefinitely. The order drew protests at airports nationwide. Trump fired acting Attorney General Sally Yates on Jan. 30 for refusing to enforce the order. The action is currently on a nationwide temporary restraining order pending judicial review. You can review some key issues about the order in this explainer. The next day, the website Times.com.mx posted the story that a suspected terrorist named Rasheen Muhammad had been arrested at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. It included a photo of a handcuffed man flanked by men in FBI windbreakers. The story said stricter screening procedures in place because of the order were to credit, and said Yates apologized via Snapchat for being wrong. The story also quoted FBI Director James Comey as saying details would not be released as the agency investigates. None of these things happened. There was no arrest of any person named Rasheen Muhammad at JFK, terrorist or otherwise. The only Rasheen Muhammad we could find in a news search during the proper time frame was a 19-year-old gang member in Chicago being held in Cook County Jail on Feb. 4 for a juvenile warrant. Yates, who had said she was not sure Trump’s order was legal, also did not apologize for refusing to enforce it. There are no reports of such an apology, whether on Snapchat or otherwise. Comey also did not address the arrest, seeing as how the arrest never happened. Times.com.mx is another website that attempts to imitate legitimate news outlets with fake stories to lure readers. USAPoliticsZone.com and several other sites copied the story verbatim. None of the photographs are of someone named Rasheen Muhammad. Anyone with eyes can see that the three photos are actually of different people: One photo, which also ran on Times.com.mx, is of Najibullah Zazi, an Afghanistan-born Denver man arrested in September 2009 for ties to an al-Qaida plot to commit suicide bombings on the New York subway. USAPoliticsZone.com also added this image, which is of Sajmir Alimehmeti. The Bronx, N.Y., man was arrested in May 2016 on charges of providing material support to a terrorist organization for failed attempts to join or aid ISIS. Finally, USAPoliticsZone.com included this image, a still from a video of Abu Mohammad al-Adnani, who really was an ISIS leader. Al-Adnani, considered the official spokesman for the Islamic State, was reportedly killed while fighting in Syria last fall.

pomt-05210	Says combined inflation and unemployment rates in October 2011 were the highest since Ronald Reagan succeeded Jimmy Carter.	false	/texas/statements/2012/jun/08/wes-riddle/wes-riddle-says-misery-index-higher-october-2011-a/	Wes Riddle, who seeks to represent a new congressional district twisting from western Hays and Travis counties north to a sliver of Tarrant County, fired up a crowd last year by suggesting President Barack Obama was making history in a crummy way. Riddle, a retired Army lieutenant colonel now poised for a July 31, 2012, runoff with former Texas Secretary of State Roger Williams for the Republican nomination in the district, spoke at the Oct. 22, 2011, Austin Lone Star LiberTEA Fest rally, according to a DVD distributed by his campaign. "Ronald Reagan said that status quo is Latin, Latin for the mess we're in," he said. "And folks, we are in a heck of a status quo, let me tell you. How is that hope and change going for you? Are you better off than you were three years ago?" A moment later, Riddle added: "The misery index is the highest that it's been since Ronald Reagan took over from Jimmy Carter." Memorably, Reagan cited the "misery index" -- meaning the nation’s combined inflation and unemployment rates -- as an indicator that Carter merited replacement; voters agreed. We looked into whether Riddle was right that as of October 2011, the misery index was higher than at any time since Reagan became president. Online, we found a website showing the misery index for every month since January 1948. Economist Arthur Okun, an adviser to President Lyndon Johnson, devised the index. "A combination of rising inflation and more people out of work implies a deterioration in economic performance and a rise in the misery index," the site says. In a June 3, 2011, article, our friends at FactCheck.org pointed out that the index hit monthly highs of 13.63 under President Truman in January 1948; 17.01 in President Nixon's last full month in office, July 1974; 19.9 under President Ford in January 1975; and a record 21.98 under President Carter in June 1980. When Reagan won election, inflation was the prime mover of the index, though unemployment has been dominant lately. In April 2012, for instance, the index was 10.4, based on 8.1 percent unemployment and the inflation rate of 2.3. That was down from the highest index on Obama’s watch, 12.87 in August and September 2011, according to the index website. We checked Riddle’s claim against the index site, learning that he did not account for the misery index in the early part of Reagan’s presidency. The site, registered to NPA Services, Inc., in Richmond Hill, New York, says it collects unemployment rates from the U.S. Department of Labor and inflation rates from InflationData.com. By email, the site’s webmaster, John Naudus, told us he maintains the site in his spare time. We spot-checked annual unemployment and inflation figures for the decades at issue. Naudus’s site aligns with the unemployment rates on the labor department’s site and annual inflation figures on inflationdata.com. According to the misery index site, the index in Carter’s last year as president, 1980, was 20.76. In every subsequent year through 2011, the index was less than that. With Obama as president, the index increased from 8.94 in 2009 to 12.11 in 2011, according to the misery index site. However, that was not the highest index since Reagan succeeded Carter. According to the site, the index was higher than Obama’s one-year high of 12.11 each of the first three years of Reagan’s presidency: 17.97 in 1981, 15.87 in 1982 and 12.82 in 1983. For greater precision, we looked at the index month by month. This enabled us to compare the index in October 2011, when Riddle spoke, to the index for every previous month starting with Reagan’s presidency. The October 2011 misery index was 12.43, based on the 8.9 percent unemployment rate plus the month’s 3.53 percent inflation, according to the site. And does that 12.43 misery index outpace any such index since Reagan succeeded Carter? Hardly. According to the site, the index was higher in a couple of earlier months of Obama’s term and barely higher, at 12.60, in November 1990, when George H.W. Bush was president. Arguably, these instances are close enough for comfort. Still, Reagan experienced higher misery indexes at the start of his presidency. The index exceeded 14 for Reagan’s first 25 months as president, according to the index site, and remained greater than 13 from February through May 1983. By email, Brad Heritage of Riddle’s campaign sent a statement from Riddle saying the government changed how it calculates inflation and unemployment after 1980 and as a result, the index is lower of late than it would have been before the changes. A Bureau of Labor Statistics economist, Jacqueline Midkiff, told us the bureau does not agree that methodology changes weaken or invalidate unemployment rate/inflation rate comparisons across decades. She pointed out an August 2008 bureau article on inflation-rate myths and a 1994 bureau paper including information on comparing jobless rates over time. Our ruling When Riddle spoke, the U.S. misery index was 12.43 -- higher than the index over much of the previous 30 years. Riddle said, though, that the index was the highest it had been since Reagan succeeded Carter. That's not correct. The index was higher for nearly 30 months of Reagan’s presidency. His statement fails to account for the index’s full history. We rate his claim as False.	None	Wes Riddle	None	None	None	2012-06-08T16:45:42	2011-10-22	['Jimmy_Carter', 'Ronald_Reagan']
pomt-00269	Says Rep. Kyrsten Sinema supported a bill that is "essentially encouraging child trafficking."	false	/arizona/statements/2018/oct/02/martha-mcsally/did-kyrsten-sinema-support-bill-encouraging-child-/	The federal government’s separation of children from their parents as they arrived at the southwest border is pivotal in Arizona’s Senate race. Republican U.S. Rep. Martha McSally said in a Sept. 16 Fox News interview that her party was working on a bill to enforce the laws and keep families together. She claimed that her Democratic opponent in the Senate race, U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, in contrast supported a bill that encouraged child trafficking. "My opponent and every Democrat got on a bill that essentially says if you cross the border illegally, and you have a kid with you and you commit a crime, another crime within 100 miles of the border, you can’t be arrested," McSally said. "This is essentially encouraging child trafficking and that’s what my opponent supported." McSally’s campaign told us she’s referring to the Keep Families Together Act, co-sponsored by nearly all Democrats, including Sinema. Did the Sinema-backed bill enable or encourage child trafficking? Not according to several immigration experts and researchers who study human trafficking. They said the bill is about keeping families together and that it includes safeguards against trafficking. Background on Keep Families Together Act U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler, D-N.Y., introduced the Keep Families Together Act in June amid calls for President Donald Trump’s administration to end a policy leading to the separation of immigrant families. Nadler’s proposal would prohibit the Department of Homeland Security, Justice Department, and Health and Human Services from removing a child (under 18 years old and without permanent immigration status) from his or her parent or legal guardian, at or near the port of entry, or within 100 miles of the U.S. border. However, the bill lays out several circumstances in which border officials can separate children. A child could be removed if: • the child is a victim of trafficking or is at significant risk of becoming a victim of trafficking; • there is a strong likelihood that the adult is not the parent or legal guardian of the child; and • the child is in danger of abuse or neglect at the hands of the parent or legal guardian, or is a danger to themselves or others. If a child is removed, an independent child welfare expert licensed by the state or county where the separation happened has to authorize it within 48 hours. If not authorized, families are reunited. (Experts said child welfare is regulated by states.) The bill also gives state courts and state or county child welfare agencies their own authority to separate a child from a parent or legal guardian, if it’s in the child’s best interest. McSally said that the proposal prevented the arrest of people who came with children and committed "another crime within 100 miles of the border." But the bill doesn’t say that. The bill says asylum seekers may not be prosecuted for immigration law violations until their asylum application is adjudicated. Under current law, asylum seekers must be in the United States to request the protection. They can apply for it even if they entered the country illegally. Nadler’s measure calls for periodic reports on separations. The reports would need to include whether an adult was charged with a crime, the type of crime, whether that charge was prosecuted and the outcome. Sinema’s campaign said the bill would keep families together while removing them from potential trafficking situations. The bill is unlikely to pass so long as Republicans control the U.S. House. Experts disagree with McSally’s assessment The bill diminishes federal enforcement and empowers "state government determinations that would likely happen well after the point of apprehension and detention on a federal level," said Torunn Sinclair, a spokeswoman for McSally’s campaign. Sinclair also argued that the bill incentivizes traffickers to claim children as their own. While it may not be easy to determine in some cases whether an adult is the parent of a child, border officials who come in contact with them are trained to figure that out, said David Kyle, associate professor of sociology at University of California-Davis. The onus remains on parents to prove a relationship, Kyle said. "No matter how the law is written, law enforcement officials have laws they can invoke if there is a suspicion that the child is not with their legal guardian or parent," Kyle said. "I don't think anything in the bill would undercut those laws and clearly supports exceptions based on those suspicions." The part of the bill saying an "independent child welfare expert" has to authorize separations within 48 hours raises questions regarding the practical implementation of the bill, Kyle said. Still, "on the face of it, I don't see the bill facilitating child trafficking," Kyle said. Dominique Roe-Sepowitz, an associate professor and director of the Office of Sex Trafficking Intervention Research at Arizona State University, also doesn't see the bill as encouraging child trafficking. "This is much less to do with sexual exploitation and more to do with separating families," she said. Our ruling McSally said Sinema supported a bill that encourages child trafficking. Sinema co-sponsored a bill to limit the separation of immigrant families arriving at U.S. borders. McSally’s team said the bill reduces federal authority and incentivizes traffickers to claim children as their own. However, the bill says a child can be separated if federal immigration officials believe that the child is being trafficked or faces that risk. Separation can also take place if there’s a strong likelihood that a child and adult are not related. Under the bill, a state or county child welfare expert has to authorize a separation within 48 hours. It also gives state courts and agencies their own ability to separate a child from an adult, especially if the child’s safety is at risk. Immigration and human trafficking researchers disagree with McSally’s assessment of the bill. We rate McSally’s statement False.

pomt-01206	"The conviction rate is almost exactly the same" for whites and blacks who commit murder.	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/nov/26/rudy-giuliani/giuliani-black-and-white-people-charged-murder-are/	In the run-up to a grand jury’s decision not to indict Ferguson, Mo., police officer Darren Wilson in the shooting death of African-American teenager Michael Brown, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani stirred controversy with a number of comments about race, crime and law enforcement. Following his appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press on Nov. 23, 2014, Giuliani faced backlash for questioning why the same Americans protesting Brown's fatal shooting are not voicing similar outrage about black-on-black crime. The following day -- hours before the grand jury decision was announced -- Giuliani stood by his argument during an appearance on Fox and Friends. He reiterated that the vast majority of black murder victims are killed by other black people, not by white police officers. (We rated this Mostly True, noting that the same pattern of intraracial homicide holds for for all races, not just for African-Americans.) Giuliani also sought to counter the perception that white people don’t go to jail for killing black people. "And the idea that whites do not go to jail for killing blacks," he said. "First of all, only about 3 percent of whites kill blacks. They go to jail at approximately the same percentage as blacks go to jail. The conviction rate is almost exactly the same. The difference is, it’s a very rare exception when a white kills a black." His claim about even conviction rates surprised us, given the widespread perception that black Americans are disadvantaged in the criminal justice system. So we decided to take a closer look at Giuliani’s claim that "the conviction rate is almost exactly the same" for whites and blacks who commit murder. Sentencing statistics Giuliani’s comment in whole is fragmented and difficult to parse, and he didn’t get back to us with further explanation. That being said, we scoured available data that might shed light on his claim about conviction rates. We couldn’t find a single report detailing the nationwide percentage of people who are charged with homicide and are ultimately convicted -- let alone a racial breakdown for that question. The most recent and comprehensive report we could find comes from the the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics. The report, published in 2009, looks at 2006 data on felony sentences in state courts, where the vast majority of murder cases are tried. It found that of all people convicted of murder or non-negligent manslaughter in 2006, 46 percent were white, and 51 percent were black. But this is not too helpful for checking Giuliani’s claim. For starters, this data does not separate out people who identify as Hispanic or Latino. And this finding means that African-Americans account for a grossly disproportionate percentage of murder convictions, since whites and Hispanics currently make up about 80 percent of the nation’s population, compared to just 13 percent for blacks. That undercuts Giuliani’s underlying premise of minimizing racial disparities in jurisprudence. We also found a 2013 Bureau of Justice Statistics report that looked at felony defendants -- that is, people who are charged but not yet convicted -- in the 75 largest counties in the United States in 2009. That report showed that African-Americans also make up a disproportionate number of murder defendants. Of all people charged with murder, 12 percent were white, 30 percent were Hispanic, and 57 percent were black. Either way, these statistics don’t back up Giuliani’s claim, because they do not show the likelihood that someone of either race will be convicted if they are charged with murder. We also reached out to criminal justice experts, and they weren’t familiar with a statistic that matched the specific claim. The big picture It’s important to remember a few bits of context. The conviction rate for homicide represents only a sliver of criminal justice cases and are not necessarily representative of the deep disparity between black and white defendants. For example, the Justice Department has estimated that one in three black males will go to prison at some point in their lifetime, compared to 1 in 17 for a white male. And out of all 1.5 million sentenced prisoners in the United States in 2013, black people made up the largest racial demographic, at about 36 percent -- well above their share of the population as a whole. "I do not know why (Giuliani) would limit his comments to murder," said Delores Jones-Brown, a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. "When all offenses are taken into consideration, especially drug crimes, the black incarceration rate is substantially higher than that of whites." Nearly half of all people charged with felonies in 2009 were non-Hispanic blacks. They made up more than half of all people charged with murder, robbery, drug trafficking and weapons-related offenses. And Nazgol Ghandnoosh, a researcher at the Sentencing Project, an advocacy group, pointed us to several additional studies that show racial disparities, such as a 1998 study that found that offenders who are young, black, and male are subject to the harshest sentences, after controlling for factors such as the nature of the crime. Our ruling Giuliani said, "the conviction rate is almost exactly the same" for whites and blacks who commit murder. We couldn't find any statistical evidence to support Giuliani’s claim, and experts said they weren't aware of any, either. We found some related data, but that data only serves to highlight some of the racial disproportion in the justice system. And when you take a step back, Giuliani’s comment -- even if supported by statistical evidence -- would amount to cherry-picking data to shed the most benign light on racial disparities of the American justice system. Jurisprudence in general does not reflect this pattern. Without statistical data to back up his claim, we rate it False. Update, Nov. 26, 2014, 2:00 p.m.: Soon after we published this item, the Bureau of Justice Statistics officially confirmed to PolitiFact that they do not have nationally representative data on conviction rates by race.

pomt-13730	Says when an interviewer asked Donald Trump if he treats women with respect, Trump replied, "I can't say that."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/27/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-video-says-donald-trump-admitted-h/	Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been repeatedly attacked by his opponents for his sometimes-derogatory statements about women. At the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, delegates saw a video where some of those comments were repeated, but one caught our eye. At the end of the 30-second video a voice says, "So you treat women with respect." The video shifts to a younger Trump saying sheepishly, "I can't say that either" and offering a half-laugh. The clip is so short, we wondered if it was an accurate representation of the interview. We emailed the Democratic National Committee about its source. They couldn't immediately provide it but, meanwhile, we found it thanks to The Washington Post Fact-Checker examination of two pro-Clinton ads in June. The video shown at the Democratic convention was originally an ad released by the Hillary Clinton campaign. The source of the quote comes from a 39-minute interview with Howard Stern conducted in 1993 on the E! cable channel. Stern is not shown in the clip, although some might recognize his voice. The shock-jock is known for getting his guests to say outrageous things. The interview was conducted after a New York magazine article on Trump said, "His contempt for beautiful women who liked to be abused is boundless." The article characterized his philosophy as, "You have to treat them like s---," a characterization by author Julie Baumgold, not a direct quote from Trump himself. In the interview, Stern asks Trump about the quote. "No, I never said that," Trump responds."But it was attributed to me." After some chatter by Stern, Trump again denies saying it. "I see," says Stern. "So you treat women with respect." Trump smiles. "Ahhhh. I can't say that either," he says with a chortle. "Alright, good," says Stern. "Somewhere in between." Then Trump adds, "I treat women with great respect," his tone sounding more serious this time, but it's not completely clear because the camera, at this point, is on Stern instead of Trump. Stern then insists, with the help of a chart, that Trump rank his wife and girlfriends. When we asked the Clinton campaign if Trump's comment was taken out of context, deputy communications director Christina Reynolds responded with an emailed statement that "in a conversation about whether he respects (women), his first inclination is to say that he 'can't say.' That statement, coming during an exchange about previous disrespectful comments about women, speaks volumes and is perfectly in context with his lifelong record." Our ruling Hillary Clinton, in a campaign ad shown at the Democratic convention, said that when an interviewer asked Donald Trump if he treats women with respect, Trump replied, "I can't say that." The four-second clip has not been doctored. But this is an example of where context can be crucial. It omits the fact that Stern is the interviewer. The opening question of whether Trump said he treats women like feces, Trump's denial, Stern's assessment that it's "somewhere in between" and Trump's subsequent response that "I treat women with great respect" are all missing. Because so much is ignored in this brief clip— information that could give a different impression — we rate the claim Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9e51f9c5-2a3d-4dd0-a2c3-6d8f7edac738	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-07-27T00:21:39	2016-07-26	['Donald_Trump']
pomt-03281	"For several days in July of 2012, Greenland surface ice cover melted more than at any time in 30 years of satellite observation. During that month, an estimated 97% of the ice sheet thawed."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/aug/05/brian-schatz/hawaii-senator-says-97-percent-greenlands-ice-shee/	Everybody's looking for evidence that pollution, particularly the carbon dioxide released into the air, is (or is not, depending on your point of view) altering Earth's climate. On July 24, U.S. Sen. Brian Schatz, a Democrat from Hawaii, whose state stands to face some serious consequences if warmer temperatures cause sea levels to rise and storms to become stronger, was on the floor of the Senate speaking about an event in July 2012 that produced a dramatic change in the massive ice sheet covering Greenland. Because of global warming, "glaciers continue to retreat. The Greenland ice sheet provides a stark example of the rapid recession of the world's ice," Schatz said. "For several days in July of 2012, Greenland surface ice cover melted more than at any time in 30 years of satellite observation. During that month, an estimated 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed." Ninety-seven percent? One way to read that is that only 3 percent of Greenland's ice sheet remained. That would be A LOT of melting, especially for a mass of ice that is, over large stretches, a mile or two thick. Losing that much arctic ice would have a HUGE impact. Not only would sea level rise by roughly 20 feet, the ice would no longer be reflecting sunlight back into space, warming the planet even faster. We contacted Schatz's office, which directed us to two sources. The first was a web page from the National Snow & Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado, Boulder, which tracks melting on a daily basis. It says, "Greenland’s surface melting in 2012 was intense, far in excess of any earlier year in the satellite record since 1979. In July 2012, a very unusual weather event occurred. For a few days, 97% of the entire ice sheet indicated surface melting." The estimate comes from satellite measurements. We also found a NASA web page that reported that in July 2012, "an estimated 97 percent of the ice sheet surface had thawed by July 12." So the key word in each case is "surface." The melting the satellites tracked was at and near the surface, often to a depth of no more than an inch. The ice sheet itself never thawed, or came close to thawing. Dorothy Hall, a senior scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, whose examination of the event is to be published in Geophysical Research Letters, said unusually warm temperatures that month did produce some unusual melting, but it didn't wipe out most of the ice sheet. "Sen. Schatz's statement is very misleading," she said in an email, noting that her estimate of surface melt is even higher. "The correct statement would be that approximately 99% of the surface of the Greenland ice sheet experienced some melt during a two-day period in July of 2012. In fact most of the ice sheet surface re-froze within hours or days of the big melt event." Hall said that the last time that much surface ice temporarily melted was about a century ago. "If that begins to happen more frequently, that is a red flag," she said. At the highest elevations, "the surface will only melt a few centimeters for a few minutes or hours, so none of that liquid water can run off and contribute to sea level rise," she said in an interview. The thaw was deeper and more extensive at lower altitudes, producing some ponds and runoff, but even in those cases, much of the water re-froze, although quite a bit made its way to the ocean to contribute to sea level rise. How much of the ice sheet was actually lost? Satellite data show that Greenland lost about 325 billion metric tons of ice that month, enough to raise sea level by nearly a millimeter. That's a lot. Typically, 340 billion metric tons are lost in a full year, according to climate researcher Jason Box of the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland. However, the amount of ice lost was only about 0.01 percent of the nearly 3 million billion tons of ice locked in the sheet. When we asked Schatz's office if the senator misspoke, spokeswoman Xochitl Hinojosa stood by his comment. "The senator said that 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed . . . which means to become soft, and does not mean vanish. He also specifically said 'for several days in July of 2012,' so that it would be clear that he was not implying that the ice vanished forever. To suggest that the senator said it disappeared is inaccurate." Thomas Mote, a geographer at the University of Georgia, says it's a "common mistake" to confuse the thawing of the surface ice with the thawing of the ice sheet. "Certainly we did not lose 97 percent of the ice. Sea levels would quickly go up 20 feet," he said. "We would notice that pretty quickly." Our ruling Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz said: "For several days in July of 2012, Greenland surface ice cover melted more than at any time in 30 years of satellite observation. During that month, an estimated 97 percent of the ice sheet thawed." His first sentence is correct. Because he also prefaced his comment by asserting that "glaciers continue to retreat" and the ice sheet "provides a stark example of the rapid recession of the world's ice," his contention that "97 percent of the ice sheet thawed," could easily be misinterpreted as referring to the whole ice sheet. Because parts of the statement are accurate but the wording of the second sentence leaves out an important detail, we rate it Half True.

pomt-13771	"In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/jul/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-was-secretary-is/	Donald Trump told the audience of the Republican National Convention that ISIS wasn’t an issue before Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state. "In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map," he said July 21. "Libya was stable. Egypt was peaceful. Iraq was seeing, really a big big reduction in violence. Iran was being choked by sanctions. Syria was somewhat under control. After four years of Hillary Clinton, what do we have? ISIS has spread across the region, and the entire world." Trump made a similar claim pointing the finger at Clinton for the creation of ISIS in an interview that aired on 60 Minutes Sunday, a day before the convention began. While the name ISIS (or Islamic State or Daesh, etc.) is relatively new, the leaders and founders have origins that pre-date Clinton’s time as the chief diplomat of the United States. "There were evolutions that took place with some of the name changes," Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, previously told PolitiFact. (He has testified before Congress multiple times and works for a foundation focused on foreign policy and security.) The roots of what today is the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, trace back to 2004, when longtime Sunni extremist Abu Mus‘ab al-Zarqawi established al-Qaida in Iraq, according to the National Counterterrorism Center. After a U.S. airstrike killed al-Zarqawi in 2006, the group became the Islamic State of Iraq. In 2013, the group was referred to as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham and then just the Islamic State in 2014, Brian Fishman, a counterterrorism expert at the New America Foundation, has told PolitiFact. "Al-Sham just refers to the Levant and reflects the group's increased focus on Syria," he said. "It reflects a geographic shift rather than change in political focus. It's the same group throughout." Given the timing, Democrats are prone to blame President George W. Bush for the creation of ISIS, because al-Qaida flourished after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Republicans seize on different moments. President Barack Obama’s decision to leave Iraq after 2011 contributed to a security vacuum that gave ISIS the chance to put down roots there, said Michael O’Hanlon, a security expert at the Brookings Institution, a centrist-to-liberal group. (O’Hanlon is one of hundreds of voluntary advisers to the Clinton campaign but has a minor role.) You could say the blame touches both Bush, for creating a strong space for al-Qaida in Mesopotamia, and Obama, for giving the group a chance to regroup. Trump is implying that Clinton’s actions had something to do with the birth of ISIS. Experts said his evidence is thin. For the earlier fact-check, Trump’s campaign singled out Clinton’s vote as a senator to authorize force in Iraq in 2002. She later said she regretted that vote. Republicans have blamed Obama for not keeping 10,000 troops in place in Iraq, which they say could have deterred the opening for ISIS. However, Obama inherited a timeline to exit Iraq from Bush, and there was no agreement to leave a large force behind. Trump’s campaign also highlighted Clinton’s support of regime change in Syria (which didn’t work out) and Libya. The overthrow of Libyan dictator Muammar Gaddafi contributed to giving ISIS an opening, said Christopher Preble, a defense expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. "Clinton's enthusiasm for regime change in Libya in 2011, which Obama endorsed, resulted in the collapse of order there, which ISIS and others have exploited," he said. "That is a fair criticism, in my opinion." But experts said Clinton isn’t individually responsible for the group, even if various factors gave ISIS the room to grow in power. The sources of ISIS are complex and interconnected, said John Pike, an expert on defense and director of GlobalSecurity.org, a website that provides information on defense. "She may ‘share some of the blame,’ but there is more than enough share to go around," Pike said. "She was in no sense the singular author of the thing." Our ruling Trump said, "In 2009, pre-Hillary, ISIS was not even on the map." The terrorist group known as ISIS was, in fact, on the map five years before Clinton became secretary of state. It was operating under a different name. There were several factors that allowed ISIS to gain strength, including the intervention in Libya, an Obama decision that she supported, and the Iraq invasion, which she voted for as a U.S. senator. But Trump misleads when he pins the rise of ISIS solely on Clinton.

pomt-07299	Promotes a chart saying that Barack Obama has "increased the debt" by 16 percent, compared to George W. Bush, who increased it by 115 percent.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/19/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-posts-questionable-chart-debt-accumul/	A reader recently pointed us to a post on the website of MoveOn.org, a liberal group. The post features a bar graph titled, "Who Increased the Debt?" that offers figures for the past five presidents: Ronald Reagan: Up 189 percent George H.W. Bush: Up 55 percent Bill Clinton: Up 37 percent George W. Bush: Up 115 percent Barack Obama: Up 16 percent We can see why a liberal group would tout such numbers, since -- if accurate -- they offer powerful counterevidence to the claims by conservatives that President Barack Obama has been a spendthrift who’s set the nation on an unsustainable fiscal path. But the reader who sent it to us was surprised to see the debt increase under Obama was so small. So we decided to check the numbers. The chart actually comes from a Flickr page belonging to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who posted it on May 5, 2011. Specifically, the chart tracks "percent increase in public debt" for the five presidents during the following time periods -- January 1981 to January 1989 (Reagan), January 1989 to January 1993 (George H.W. Bush), January 1993 to January 2001 (Clinton), January 2001 to January 2009 (George W. Bush), and January 2009 to April 2011 (Obama). We checked with Pelosi’s office to see what data they used to assemble the chart. They referred us to the U.S. Treasury’s "Debt to the Penny Calculator." First, we should note that we interpreted the caption in Pelosi’s chart that reads "percent increase in public debt" to mean public debt, not gross federal debt. Public debt is debt held by the public, whereas gross federal debt includes both publicly held debt and debt held by the government, such as money in the Social Security trust fund. Despite what the chart’s label suggested, the data we received from Pelosi’s office made clear that they had been using the gross federal debt number. So we’ll start with that figure. We can quickly dispense with the figures for Reagan and George H.W. Bush. The "Debt to the Penny" calculator doesn’t go back further than 1993, but we were able to estimate the figures for debt under Reagan and the elder Bush by using data from the Office of Management and Budget. OMB’s numbers are calculated somewhat differently than Treasury’s, but the percentage increases were close enough to what the chart said that we’re not going to quibble over them. OMB has debt under Reagan increasing by 186 percent (the chart had said 189 percent) and by 54 percent under George H.W. Bush (compared to the 55 percent in the chart). Instead, we’ll focus on the numbers for Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama. From the online calculator, we requested the daily debt totals since 1993 and picked out the ones closest to the inauguration dates of those three presidents, as well as the end of the month of April 2011. Here’s what we came with for gross federal debt: January 20, 1993 (end of George H.W. Bush and beginning of Clinton): $4.188 trillion January 19, 2001 (end of Clinton and beginning of George W. Bush): $5.728 trillion January 20, 2009 (end of George W. Bush and beginning of Obama): $10.627 trillion April 29, 2011 (closing date of the chart): $14.288 trillion This allows us to determine how much the debt rose under each president: Under Clinton: Increase of $1.54 trillion, or 37 percent Under George W. Bush: Increase of $4.899 trillion, or 86 percent Under Obama: Increase of $3.661 trillion, or 34 percent So we can dispense with Clinton -- in the chart, his figure is correct. But the chart is significantly off for both Bush and Obama. We found Bush to have an 86 percent increase, not 115 percent as the chart said. And we found the debt under Obama to be up by 34 percent, more than double the 16 percent cited in the chart. We quickly discovered the source of the discrepancy: Whoever put the chart together used the date for Jan. 20, 2010 -- which is exactly one year to the day after Obama was sworn in -- rather than his actual inauguration date. We know this because Treasury says the debt for Jan. 20, 2010, was $12.327 trillion, which is the exact number cited on the supporting document that Pelosi’s office gave us. However this error happened, it effectively took one year of rapidly escalating debt out of Obama’s column and put it into Bush’s, significantly skewing the numbers. Using the corrected figures does mean that, superficially at least, Democrats have a point. The debt did still increase more, on a percentage basis, under Bush than it did under Obama. But other problems with the chart and its methodology undercut even this conclusion. • Time ranges: Bush served a full eight-year term, while Obama had served just 27 months by the time the chart was compiled. If the Obama figure were to be scaled out to a full eight-year period, he’d have a debt increase of 121 percent rather than 34 percent, making his increase greater than Bush’s. To be fair, that would be a simplistic exercise -- but no less misleading than the chart. • Public debt vs. gross debt: Not only did the chart say it was using one statistic and then use another, it also cherry-picked the one that showed the comparison in a more favorable light. According to OMB statistics, public debt rose by 70 percent under Bush, 16 percentage points more slowly than gross federal debt did. And according to the Treasury, the public debt rose by 53 percent under Obama, compared with the 34 percent rise in gross federal debt. Those numbers would have shown the two presidents much closer in their debt creation records -- and that’s without even adjusting for the vastly different lengths of time in office. • Debt vs. debt as a percentage of GDP: Some economists will tell you that it’s not the size of the debt per se, but rather the size of the debt relative to the nation’s gross domestic product. This helps minimize the complicating effect of economic cycles and inflation. So how do those numbers stack up? Using OMB statistics, here’s what we came up with, using public debt figures not adjusted for the president’s time in office: Reagan: Up 14.9 percentage points George H.W. Bush: Up 7.1 percentage points Clinton: Down 13.4 percentage points George W. Bush: Up 5.6 percentage points Obama: Up 21.9 percentage points (through December 2010 only) So by this measurement -- potentially a more important one -- Obama is the undisputed debt king of the last five presidents, rather than the guy who added a piddling amount to the debt, as Pelosi’s chart suggested. Of course, all this goes to show that statistics can be used -- and misused -- to bolster almost any argument. After we presented our research to Pelosi's office, a spokesman acknowledged that the office had erred in assembling and posting the chart and that it was in the process of reposting it. The updated version – which corrects the mathematical error but not what we consider to be the three additional design flaws – can be found here. That's a step in the right direction, but it doesn't change our rating since it only occurred as a result of our fact-checking. We find so much wrong with this chart that we don’t think it contains any significant approximation of the truth. It made a major calculation error that dramatically skewed the debt increase away from Obama and toward George W. Bush. It glossed over significant variations in time served in office. It cherry-picked the measurement that was favorable to its cause. And it is contradicted by statistics for GDP-adjusted debt, which show Obama to be the most, rather than the least, debt-creating president of the last five. None of this suggests that Obama can’t turn things around as the economy improves (and Democrats can also take some solace in the fact that Bill Clinton did remarkably well in all of our measurements). But in communicating which administrations contributed the most to growth of the debt, this chart is a failure. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-09640	President Obama has "the worst ratings of any president at the end of his first year."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/dec/17/karl-rove/rove-says-obamas-approval-ratings-after-year-are-w/	It's no secret that President Barack Obama has had a rough first year in office. His approval ratings in the major polls hover just below 50 percent -- a decline from earlier levels that has cheered Republicans and conservative commentators. In a Dec. 16, 2009, Wall Street Journal column, Karl Rove -- the mastermind of George W. Bush's two election victories -- riffed off the grade of a "solid B+" that Obama gave himself in a Dec. 13 interview with Oprah Winfrey. In a column headlined, "The President Is No B+," Rove wrote that "Barack Obama has won a place in history with the worst ratings of any president at the end of his first year: 49 percent approve and 46 percent disapprove of his job performance in the latest USA Today/Gallup Poll." We'll begin by clarifying a few points. First, we should note that Rove was guilty of rhetorical excess when he said that Obama's numbers are the worst of "any president" at this point. Gallup's historical data -- the longest-running of the major polling firms -- dates back to Harry Truman, who was the first president whose entire tenure was polled in a fashion that modern experts would consider scientific. So Rove should have argued that Obama's numbers were the worst of any post-World War II president at this point in his term. Second, Rove misspoke when he referred to measuring Obama's ratings at the end of his first year. By definition, those numbers won't be available until late January. But in assessing his statement, we've sidestepped that problem by asking Gallup to provide us the approval ratings for December of the first year in office of the postwar presidents, so that the ratings for each can be compared more directly with the figures we have for Obama. Third, not all postwar presidents came to office equally. Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, both Bushes and Bill Clinton were all elected, so their presidencies all started at the usual time of the year. By contrast, Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford assumed office after the death or resignation of their predecessor. Johnson's approval ratings roughly a year after taking office were around 70 percent, while Truman and Ford were both around 40 percent at that point in their tenure -- a level lower than Obama's today. But because the comparison isn't exact, independent analysts advised us to exclude Truman, Johnson and Ford from our analysis. So, here are Gallup's December approval and disapproval ratings for all elected presidents since World War II. (For Clinton and George W. Bush, Gallup polled on presidential approval twice a month rather than once a month as previously, so the numbers below reflect an average of the two December scores for those presidents.) • Eisenhower, 69-22 • Kennedy, 77-11 • Nixon, 59-23 • Carter, 57-27 • Reagan, 49-41 • George H.W. Bush, 71-20 • Clinton, 53-39 • George W. Bush, 86-11 • Obama, 49-46 Compared to these predecessors, Obama's numbers are indeed the weakest -- but he's tied with Reagan in that unflattering achievement. The similarities between the approval-rating paths of Obama and Reagan are actually quite striking, wrote Charles Franklin, a University of Wisconsin political scientist, in a recent post at the Web site Pollster.com. "Both replaced deeply unpopular predecessors," Franklin wrote. "Both enjoyed significant gains for their party in both houses of Congress. Both faced 'worst since the Depression' economic circumstances. And each in his own very different ways attempted to reshape government in the early months in office." It's worth adding a few words of caution about this kind of comparison. Ratings after one year don't necessarily correlate with ratings throughout one's term. For instance, in December 2001, George W. Bush's 86 percent approval rating was largely due to a wave of support after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Bush wound up his second term in the low 30s. Still, if you're making the comparison -- and political observers have been doing precisely these sorts of comparisons for years -- Rove's statement holds up fairly well. Yes, Rove spoke too loosely when he said that Obama's numbers were the worst of any president's, and he failed to mention equally bad ratings for Reagan, a conservative icon whose politics were more in tune with Rove's than Obama. But with the exception of Reagan, every other elected president had clearly higher approval ratings at this point in his tenure than Obama has. So we rate Rove's statement Mostly True.

pomt-14674	"In Houston, Texas, today, there are no homeless veterans."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2016/jan/15/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-there-are-no-homeless-veterans-houst/	At a campaign stop in West Palm Beach on Dec. 28, 2015, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush answered questions about immigration, gun control and his candidacy for president. After his speech to an audience of Florida Republicans at the Forum Club of Palm Beaches, Bush was asked, "If elected president, what would you and your administration do to improve veterans’ medical benefits?" Bush said he would institute career civil service reform at the Veterans Administration, lead the VA to focus on "being world class for a few selected unique challenges veterans face" rather than providing all services, and give veterans more choices on where to go for their health care. Then, Bush brought up his childhood home, Houston. "Can I make another point? I want to tout something," he told the crowd. "Three months ago I was in Houston, Texas, and a guy who I met woke up one day and he said, ‘I do not want to see a homeless veteran on the streets of Houston.’ He’s a successful guy – he had the resources to draw people towards this cause. "And in Houston, Texas, today, there are no homeless veterans," Bush said. This program, Bush said, was an example of the effectiveness of "bottom-up government." "They didn’t wait for a federal government to create a program," he said of Houston. "They didn’t wait for Washington to do anything. They said, ‘This is the definition of who we are.’" Houston was hardly alone in confronting homelessness among veterans. In 2009, as part of a broader initiative on homelessness, President Barack Obama announced a plan to end veteran homelessness nationwide by 2015 -- a goal that wasn’t entirely fulfilled, according to a June 2015 Houston Chronicle news story. So, did Houston wipe out homelessness among veterans, even if the country didn’t? Bush made us wonder. Effectively ending veteran homelessness Although the federal government began its initiative on veteran homelessness in 2009, Houston didn’t begin its push in earnest until June 2012 with "Housing Houston’s Heroes," a program with the initial goal to house 100 homeless veterans in 100 days, according to staff in the Mayor’s Office for Homeless Initiatives. Communities around the country tally their homeless populations with a "point-in-time count" each January. In January 2012, five months before it began targeting veteran homelessness, Houston counted 7,187 homeless residents, including 1,162 veterans. In January 2015, the city counted 4,609 homeless residents, including 563 veterans. The city has housed many of those veterans in the months since, but does not have a more recent count, according to the Mayor’s Office for Homeless Initiatives. In January 2015, according to the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, an estimated 47,725 veterans nationwide were homeless, down 36 percent since 2010, shortly after Obama declared the federal initiative. "Veterans experience homelessness for many of the same reasons that non-veterans do," the council says, but exposure to combat and repeated deployments as well as high rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, brain injury and sexual trauma among veterans can make homelessness more likely. Generally, the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness defines ending homelessness as having "a systematic response in place that ensures homelessness is prevented whenever possible, or if it can’t be prevented, it is a rare, brief and non-recurring experience." A Bush campaign spokeswoman, Allie Brandenburger, when asked the basis of Bush’s Houston claim, pointed us to news and advocacy articles including a list posted Dec. 7, 2015 by U.S. Uncut, a liberal advocacy group, naming Houston as one of seven cities and states that as of December 2015 were housing their chronically homeless veterans. The list was based on news reports and press releases from cities around the country on their work on homeless initiatives. Bush’s camp didn’t answer our questions about Bush’s broader anecdote--particularly who he was singling out as the hero in his description of a "successful guy" who used his influence to stamp out homelessness for Houston’s veterans. When we inquired, Carl Salazar, director of Houston’s Office of Veterans Affairs, by phone said Bush’s story sounded "fictional." Salazar said Houston’s work on veteran homelessness brought together nonprofit groups as well as city, county, state and federal officials. Brandenburger’s reply also noted December 2015 articles from the Christian Science Monitor, the Huffington Post and the Philadelphia Citizen that mentioned Houston as one of a handful of cities, including New Orleans, Salt Lake City, Philadelphia and Phoenix, that effectively had ended veterans’ homelessness. Houston actions For Houston, at least, reports of an end to veterans’ homelessness appear to have been based on then-Houston Mayor Annise Parker announcing in a June 2015 press release: "The Houston region has come together as a team to transform our homeless response system to effectively end veteran homelessness." The city celebrated the achievement at the time at a press conference where Parker was joined by three Cabinet secretaries who praised Houston’s work. We wondered about the details. According to staff at the Mayor’s Office for Homeless Initiatives, the mayor’s mention of effectively ending veteran homelessness means the city had corralled the resources to house and prevent homelessness for veterans in need. The program is focused on "permanent supportive housing," which uses grant funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to provide rental assistance for apartment units, according to Sean Quitzau, an assistant in the Mayor’s Office for Homeless Initiatives. The initiative works with the landlords who oversee these rental units, and allocates its resources to apartments, rather than shelters. As of November 2015, the Houston program, renamed "The Way Home," had housed 4,114 veterans since 2012, Quitzau said. (Quitzau first checked with Mandy Chapman Semple, the special assistant to the mayor for homeless initiatives, who leads that office.) Houston, the fourth-largest city in the country, has the second-largest veteran population, with 300,000 veterans living there, the city said in its release. The initiative on veteran homelessness was a partnership between 35 local agencies. ‘No homeless veterans’ Houston officials agreed that "effectively" ending veteran homelessness by having the resources to house any veteran who needs assistance doesn’t mean that there are no homeless veterans in Houston. Salazar, in the city’s Office of Veterans Affairs, confirmed that when we asked about Bush’s comments. "It’s true there are not that many homeless veterans on the streets of Houston," Salazar said by phone. "While it’s nice Jeb Bush touted all the work we’re still doing in Houston, it’s not true there are no homeless veterans here. There are definitely homeless veterans. It’s a moving target." The Mayor’s Office for Homeless Initiatives, which tracks such statistics, couldn’t offer an exact number for how many veterans remain homeless. The office did say that 900 Houston veterans experience housing instability every year and 50 veterans at any given time are moving through the city’s system on their way to being housed. Veterans who remain on the street, Salazar said, generally are there for up to three reasons: -- Some choose to stay on their own, usually because they have lived in shelters before and do not like the structure of those environments, or object to assisted living they are required to have there. -- Some don’t qualify for services because of prior offenses or records as sex offenders, usually for offenses that occurred after they completed military service. For the homeless with histories as sex offenders, even if they do qualify for services, it can be hard to get a landlord’s approval to be placed in an apartment complex. And veterans who were discharged from the military with bad conduct may not qualify for some of the VA services available, though a bad conduct discharge generally will not disqualify a veteran from all services for the homeless. -- And some who fall into homelessness for the first time, rather than being chronically homeless, aren’t aware of the resources available and fall through the cracks. Our ruling Bush said that "In Houston, Texas today, there are no homeless veterans." Houston is one of a handful of cities nationwide that have "effectively" ended veteran homelessness by revamping their resources and systems to handle all veterans who seek support. The city’s success in that regard has been measured by benchmarks set by national and local initiatives on homelessness. Being equipped to provide housing for all homeless veterans doesn’t mean that every veteran is housed. Some remain homeless in Houston, whether by choice, a lack of awareness of housing resources or eligibility. We rate Bush's statement Mostly False. Mostly False: The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-10158	Palin supports "aerial hunting of wolves and other wildlife."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/01/defenders-wildlife-action-fund-defenders-wildlife-/palin-supports-aerial-shooting-for-a-reason/	Produced by the political arm of the Defenders of Wildlife Action, a new television ad takes aim at Sarah Palin’s position on wildlife issues. The minute-long video starts by juxtaposing Palin’s darkened picture with majestic images of a bear and a wolf, while an announcer talks about her support for an aerial predator-control program. "The more voters learn about Sarah Palin, the less there is to like. As Alaska governor, Sarah Palin actively promotes the brutal and unethical aerial hunting of wolves and other wildlife," the narrator says. "Using a low-flying plane, they kill in winter, when there is no way to escape. Riddled with gunshots, biting at their backs in agony, they die a brutal death. And Palin even encouraged the cruelty by proposing a $150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf. And then introduced a bill to make the killing easier," the narrator says. "Do we really want a vice president who champions such savagery?" The ad shows grisly video footage: low-flying aircraft with gunners leaning out the door shooting wolves and bears from the air. The plane later lands and the shooter finalizes the kill. In one picture, a wolf’s carcass hangs from one of the plane’s wing braces. For this item, we'll focus on the claim that Palin promotes "aerial hunting of wolves and other wildlife." Palin’s record on the issue is actually quite clear. As a candidate, and as governor, the Republican has endorsed wildlife management practices that include the controversial use of airplanes to thin out predator populations. But in Alaska, frontier politics look different than they do in the Lower 48. Alaska has vast populations of wolves, bears, caribou and moose, and sportsmen who hunt and sometimes live off those species. “If I am elected, I don’t want you to be surprised that I am a proponent of predator control in order to build those populations of moose and caribou,” Palin said, according to news reports from a gubernatorial debate in 2006. Alaska state officials take issue with the use of the phrase “aerial hunting,” preferring “aerial shooting.” “The predator-control program that we do — that isn’t hunting and we never claimed it is,” said Tim Barry, spokesman for the Alaska Department of Fish & Game. “It deliberately gives hunters an unfair advantage. That’s what we want.” It’s tougher to assess the ad’s subjective assessment that such practices are “brutal and unethical,” though many wildlife groups would agree. Defenders of Wildlife has filed lawsuits challenging Alaska’s wildlife management practices. President Rodger Schlickeisen said his group takes the view that any killing of animals, outside of a biological emergency, is unwarranted. In September 2007, more than 120 scientists signed a letter to Palin that questioned the biological basis for the state’s intensive predator management. Aerial hunting has been banned since 1972 in every state but Alaska, which gets around the federal law by claiming that predator population control is more important. The ad is missing an important note of context. Unlike other areas around the United States where wolf populations are smaller, Alaska officials count between 7,000 and 11,000 in the state. Wolf populations are managed in five parts of the state as part of a program that began in 2003 under former Gov. Frank Murkowski. In 2007, Palin’s administration proposed enhancements to encourage hunters to kill more wolves when it became clear that not enough wolves were being taken out of the population to meet the state’s goal for the year. Palin’s office announced a plan to pay hunters $150 for each wolf killed with the money to be paid when hunters turned in the left foreleg of dead wolves to state biologists. The program was axed by a judge who ruled it an improper bounty on wildlife. “I have said many times that my administration is committed to management of game for abundance, and to a proactive, science-based predator management program where appropriate,” the governor said in a news release at the time. We find her actions are adequate to support the statement that she promotes aerial shooting. But the environmental group’s categorization of the program is debatable and not putting it within the context of a state predator management program is a bit misleading. We find the claim is True.

pomt-07960	George Allen voted for budgets that increased the national debt by $16,400 for every second he served in the U.S. Senate.	true	/virginia/statements/2011/jan/23/jamie-radtke/jamie-radtke-says-debt-grew-16000-every-second-geo/	Jamie Radtke was not being kind when she said Americans are indebted for George Allen’s former service in the U.S. Senate. Radtke, a Tea Party organizer, is the first announced candidate in an expected large GOP primary field for the U.S. Senate next year. Allen, a fellow Republican, is signalling he’s on the verge of declaring he will seek to regain the seat he held for one term before losing to Democrat Jim Webb in 2006. Radtke fired a warning shot at Allen along with a challenge to meet monthly across Virginia and debate "the serious problems facing America." "For example, during Sen. Allen’s six years in office, he voted for budgets adding $3.1 trillion to the national debt -- that’s $16,400 for every second Sen. Allen was in office," Radtke said in a Jan. 17 news release. That’s the price of a brand new, four-door Chevy Cobalt for ever second Allen was in the Senate 2001 and 2007, according to a Google search. We revved our engines to see if Radtke is right. Chuck Hansen, a spokesman for Radtke, said they based their calculation on the national debt growth between the last day of 2001 and the final day of 2007. That was a mistake. The federal fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 through Sept. 30. The first spending votes Allen cast in the Senate were for the budget that began Oct. 1, 2001 -- some three months before Radtke started counting. And the last spending votes Allen cast were for the budget that started Oct. 1, 2006 -- five weeks before his defeat -- and ended Sept. 30, 2007. That’s some three months before Radtke stopped counting. So our period runs from Oct. 1, 2001 to Sept. 30, 2007. Next, we visited a U.S. Department of Treasury website to determine the national debt on each date. Rounding off, it started at $5.806 trillion and ended at $9.008 trillion. That means federal budgets passed during Allen’s term increased debt by $3.202 trillion. Did the former Senator approve all of it? Congress does not hold simple up or down votes on the federal budget. Instead, it votes on a series of appropriations for various department. We turned to THOMAS, a Library of Congress web site that records the action on Capitol Hill. We found Allen supported each of about four dozen appropriation bills that came to Senate floor during his term. So we made no deductions from the $3.202 trillion increase in debt. Allen served 2,193 days in the Senate -- from Jan. 3, 2001 to Jan. 4, 2007. That’s 189,475,200 seconds. He voted for budgets that increased the debt by $16,896.68 per second. That’s almost $497 a second more than Radtke credited to Allen. So we’ve added a kickin’ stereo to the basic features of our Chevy Cobalt. But before you get angry at Allen, consider this: The debt has risen by $54,684.24 a second since he left office. And Webb has voted "yea" on each 27 appropriations bills that helped get it there. In case you’re wondering, we have now upgraded to a brand new, fully-loaded Lincoln Navigator every second. We’re talking about a luxury SUV with leather seats, parking sensors, GPS, rain-detecting wipers and sound that will make you think you’re in Carnegie Hall. Only problem is it gets 14 miles a gallon, so it will cost us down the road. Let’s review Radtke said the Allen voted for budgets that increased the debt by $16,400 every second he was in the Senate. Her formula was a bit flawed; the actual figure is $16,896.68 a second. We find it hard to penalize Radtke for a slight mistake she made in her opponent’s favor. So we rate her statement True.

pomt-13641	In the 2012 election, there were more votes cast than registered voters in St. Lucie County, and Palm Beach County had 141 percent turnout.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2016/aug/09/viral-image/viral-image-about-voter-fraud-completely-baseless/	As Donald Trump muses about a "rigged" system that could cost him the presidential election, a debunked post detailing rampant voter fraud in 2012 is making a comeback. The image, which provides a list of seven examples of voter fraud in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania, has been posted on several news outlets and forums (including Right Wing News, USA Carry and Conservative Stronghold) and has been shared thousands of times. The image was also shared in January 2013 on email, according to Snopes and FactCheck.org. For this fact-check we’ll look at the claims about St. Lucie and Palm Beach counties in Florida. Spoiler: Both are wrong. One statistic represents a misunderstanding of how votes are cast in Florida, and another is completely made up. St. Lucie County The post says, "In St. Lucie County, FL, there were 175,574 registered voters but 247,713 votes were cast." This allegation confuses votes with cards. St. Lucie County had a ballot with two pages, meaning voters who completed both pages cast two cards. According to St. Lucie County’s 2012 general election results, the number of cards cast in the 2012 general election was 247,383. Gertrude Walker, the county’s supervisor of elections, told us whoever made the image overlooked a disclaimer on the website at the time that explained how a two-page ballot differs from a vote. (It isn’t there anymore, but we can confirm it using the Wayback Machine.) The disclaimer said: "Turnout percentages will show over 100% due to a two-page ballot. The tabulation system (GEMS) provides voter turnout as equal to the total cards cast in the election divided by the number of registered voters. Also note that some voters chose not to return by mail the second card containing the amendments." The same page where the person took the number of cards cast also contains the number of votes cast. It shows that 123,301 votes were cast in the presidential election out of 175,554 registered voters. So the voter turnout for the presidential election was about 70 percent. Palm Beach County The post moves farther down the state to Palm Beach County, where there was a "141% voter turnout" in 2012. This claim is baseless, and there is no support for the 141 percent. County data for the 2012 general election shows there were 605,268 votes cast out of 870,182 registered voters. So, Palm Beach County had almost 70 percent voter turnout. Our ruling The post makes two claims about voting in Florida counties during the 2012 presidential election. Both are wrong. The figures cited about St. Lucie County mix up the number of votes cast with the number of cards cast. The Palm Beach County claim uses an erroneous percentage, with no real source.

pomt-04052	The federal government owns 30 percent of the land in the 50 states, or about 650 million acres.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/28/jd-van-brink/claim-about-federal-land-holdings-holds/	While the national attention at the end of 2012 focused on the various tax twists and turns of the fiscal cliff, the local conversation included its own tax talk. During a tea party meeting in Marietta last month, Georgia Tea Party Chairman J. D. Van Brink spent part of his speech denouncing property taxes. Most local governments have long depended on this type of tax to fund their budgets, provide services to residents and stock reserves. But Van Brink, like many other political leaders and conservative commentators, says property taxes are subjective and discriminatory against property owners. He went on to discuss what he called other government infringements on private property rights, including eminent domain. "Who owns your land if government can control what you can and cannot do on your land? And who owns your land if it can be taxed away from you? Who would want to buy your land once the government has decreed that it cannot be used for commercial purposes?" Van Brink said. He also said the federal government owns 30 percent of the land in the 50 states, or about 650 million acres. The property tax/property infringement debate is intriguing, but what raised our Truth-O-Meter’s antennae was Van Brink’s comments about federally owned land. Does the government really own this much of the country’s land? If so, where, and what is it used for? The federal government has owned land throughout the country’s history. From the Louisiana Purchase to the wide-open areas of the West, the government has held the title. Van Brink said his information on the federally owned acres comes directly from the government, specifically the Department of the Interior. Numbers used to describe anything dealing with the federal government are sometimes incorrect and difficult to track. But, taking slight rounding into account, an overview of federal land ownership by the Congressional Research Service published in February 2012 supports Van Brink’s statement. The CRS is a an agency within the Library of Congress whose staff of lawyers, scientists and researchers provides nonpartisan research to Congress. The CRS overview states that the federal government owns and manages roughly 635 million to 640 million acres of land, which is the latest data available. The majority of this land (about 609 million acres) is managed by four agencies: the National Park Service, the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Forest Service. Most of the land is in the West and Alaska. Nineteen million additional acres in military bases and training ranges are owned and managed by the Department of Defense. The Congressional Research Service overview notes that the total amount of federal land in the country is not definitively known. The acreage estimates used in the report presume that the federal agencies have reasonably accurate data on land under their jurisdiction. The CRS overview also includes detailed federally owned acreage information for each state. Of the country’s total land base of 2.27 billion acres, the roughly 635 million to 640 million acres is about 28 percent of the total, within the truthful range for Van Brink’s 30 percent figure. "I was trying to solve some problems, and with the federal government owning land, it is land that could be used for productive use," Van Brink told us. "The selling of that land could be used to pay down the national debt." Van Brink’s land-sale idea is not new. In 2011, U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, introduced a bill to begin selling federally owned land in 10 Western states, including Arizona, Colorado, Montana and Wyoming. The Disposal of Excess Federal Lands Act of 2011 would have required the secretary of the interior to direct the sale of 3.3 million acres of land, including some forested land. The bill was not enacted and died. Georgia tea party leader J.D. Van Brink said the federal government owns 30 percent of the land in the 50 states, or about 650 million acres. Based on research from a nonpartisan congressional research think tank, Van Brink’s data is close to the published figures. The only difference is minor rounding. We rated the claim Mostly True.

pomt-06330	"Over half of the people who would be taxed under (a millionaire surtax) are, in fact, small businesspeople."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/10/john-boehner/boehner-equates-taxing-millionaires-hurting-small-/	Will increasing taxes on millionaires squelch job creation? That’s the assertion behind Republican House Speaker John Boehner’s remarks on ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour, criticizing President Barack Obama’s jobs bill. The bill, which so far has been stymied in Congress, calls for a 5.6 percent surtax on incomes greater than $1 million to pay for tax cuts for workers, infrastructure spending, hiring incentives and cash for local governments to keep teachers and police from being laid off. Republicans oppose the so-called millionaires' tax because they say it will discourage investment and expansion by business owners who are best positioned to create new jobs. But the idea is popular with the public, a point raised by Amanpour in her Nov. 6, 2011, interview with Boehner. "Now, you obviously disagree with the idea of paying for this with extra taxes," Amanpour said. "Some 75 percent of Americans agree with an increase in tax on millionaires as a way to pay for these jobs provisions. Do you not feel that by opposing it you're basically out of step with the American people on this issue?" "Well," Boehner responded, "over half of the people who would be taxed under this plan are, in fact, small businesspeople. And as a result, you're going to basically increase taxes on the very people that we're hoping will reinvest in our economy and create jobs. That's the real crux of the problem." We see this argument raised regularly, so we decided to look further. Who are the small businesspeople? To determine the accuracy of Boehner’s statement, we first needed to define a small business owner. To be clear, we’re not talking about large companies that pay corporate taxes. We’re talking about individuals who have some amount of business income that they are able to account for on their personal tax returns. Still, defining a small business owner is no simple task. "A person who gets paid to give a speech shows up along with the owner of a small manufacturing plant, the guy who runs a pizza place, a lawyer in solo practice, a small investment firm and so forth," said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. "Some of them are what we think of as small businesses that might grow and hire more workers while others are not...Tax returns lack the information needed to sort out the different types of small businesses." For one thing, they don’t distinguish if a business has any employees. The Tax Policy Center did glean some valuable insights from tax return data, though, namely by calculating how many people in different income categories get various percentages of their income from businesses. The information, contained in this chart, shows that among people with income over $1 million, about 60 percent of them get more than 10 percent of their income from businesses. But just 37 percent get more than a quarter of their income from those sources and only 29 percent get half or more. "Are people who get relatively little income from business really small businessmen?" Williams asked. These millionaires are more likely earning the bulk of their income through wages or capital gains, he said. What’s a small business? The Office of Tax Analysis at the U.S. Treasury Department recognized the vacuum in the debate over taxing small businesses without a clear definition of a small business. In an August analysis, the authors acknowledge that defining a small business is a matter of setting some subjective parameters. The ones they set include a limit of $10 million in income or deductions to be counted as "small" and a minimum labor deduction of $10,000 to distinguish businesses that don’t have any employees. Other tests they applied excluded businesses on the very low end of the scale, such as those with $4,600 or less net annual income. Not surprisingly, by narrowing the definition, far fewer tax filers qualified as small businesses. The authors found that: • one-fifth of small businesses are employers, using their definition. • slightly more than half of small businesses reported total income of less than $50,000, and half of those businesses reported a tax loss for the year. • only 0.5 percent of small businesses reported a profit in excess of $1 million. For those businesses, investment and rental income comprised roughly half of their reported income. The study paints a clearer picture of what many of us think of as a small business -- a bagel shop or dry cleaner -- that has several employees, earns a modest income for its owner and yields profits of much less than $1 million. Other evidence Boehner’s spokesman acknowledged the speaker could have worded his statement better. Then he referred us to a 2010 report by the Joint Committee on Taxation that examined Obama’s previous proposals to raise income taxes on high earners. The top two income brackets would have seen a bump from 33 percent and 35 percent to 36 and 39.6 percent, respectively if the proposals had been adopted. That report said "50 percent of the approximately $1 trillion of aggregate net positive business income will be reported on returns that have a marginal rate of 36 or 39.6 percent." But half the income being taxed at that rate is not the same as half the earners being taxed at that rate. Furthermore, the report said, that $1 trillion income figure does not imply "that all of the income is from entities that might be considered ‘small.’ For example, in 2005, 12,862 S corporations and 6,658 partnerships had receipts of more than $50 million." We know of few bagel shops and dry cleaners with revenues anywhere near $50 million. Our ruling Boehner said, "Over half of the people who would be taxed under this plan are, in fact, small businesspeople." Boehner is wrong on two points -- the "half" and the "small businesspeople." Of the business income reported on tax returns, half of it would have been taxed at the top two rates, the Joint Committee on Taxation found. But that doesn’t mean half of the earners are paying those rates. And it’s incorrect to call small business owners and millionaires who would see a tax increase one and the same. The Joint Committee as well as the Tax Policy Center have given credible evidence that for top earners who report business income, it is often just a fraction of their total income. They are not the folks operating small manufacturing plants or neighborhood pizza parlors. In fact, only 0.5 percent of small businesses make that kind of money. More often, small businesses are small in every sense -- most have incomes of less than $50,000 and almost all have profits of less than $1 million -- and they wouldn’t be affected by the millionaires tax.

pomt-01966	"$3 billion over the next five years will be taken out of our public schools and be put into vouchers."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/jun/19/nan-rich/vouchers-take-3-billion-out-public-schools-nan-ric/	While Gov. Rick Scott has portrayed himself as a champion of public education spending, he has overseen an expansion of a voucher program that hurts public schools, says former state Sen. Nan Rich, D-Weston. And she also hurls some blame at Scott’s predecessors, including her Democratic rival Charlie Crist. "The education reform that started under Jeb Bush, it continued under Charlie Crist and now has gone to a new level with Rick Scott. That includes a bill that just passed the last day of this session -- a bad day for public education, folks -- $3 billion over the next five years will be taken out of our public schools and be put into vouchers," Rich said on May 10 in remarks to the Orange County Voters League. (Rejoice Magazine posted video of her remarks online.) We decided to fact-check Rich’s claim that $3 billion from public schools will go to vouchers during the next five years. Bill expanded eligibility for tax credits this session Rich called it a voucher progam; it actually works through a tax credit. Regardless of the specifics, opponents say it sends funding to private -- mostly religious -- schools and undermines the public school system. Supporters say that the money provides poor children, including many minorities, a deserved escape from underperforming public schools. Here’s how it works: In 2001 under Gov. Jeb Bush, the state established the Florida Tax Credit Scholarship Program to give scholarships to poor children to attend private schools. The program provides dollar-for-dollar income tax credits for corporations that give money to organizations that give the scholarships. (Both Scott and Crist, the Democratic primary frontrunner, are supporters of the program.) About 60,000 students have scholarships for the 2013-14 school year, and the maximum amount per student is $4,880. During the session, Republican lawmakers proposed allowing more children to get the scholarships. A watered-down version of the bill, Senate 850, passed on May 2, the last day of session. (It passed the Senate 29-11 and the House 70-44, largely along party lines with many Democrats voting against it.) Lawmakers expanded eligibility by allowing a family of four earning up to $62,010 a year to receive a partial scholarship. The previous limit was about $44,000. Scott has until June 28, 2014, to sign the law. A spokesman for Scott wouldn’t indicate if he will sign it, but Scott has generally been supportive of school choice. Do tax credits take money out of public schools? Rich arrived at the $3 billion figure by pointing to a chart from Fund Education Now, a group that opposes the tax credits. The chart shows that before this session, the tax credit program was on a path to add up to about $2.9 billion over the next five years. Though the chart doesn’t reflect the bill that ultimately passed, the program could add up to that amount over five years. But does that money get taken out of our public schools, as Rich suggests? Rich and other tax credit opponents argue that if Florida had no such tax credit program, those revenues would go into the state’s general fund, which pays for education and other services. "It’s money that could be, should be, by all rights put into the general fund and could be used to invest in public schools," said Kathleen Oropeza, co-founder of Fund Education Now. "They are diverting it." Not so, say supporters of tax credits -- for two reasons: • If the tax credit program didn’t exist, the money would go toward state general revenues. There is no evidence that the Legislature would then decide to direct those dollars to public schools. (State economist Amy Baker backs up that point in an email to PolitiFact Florida: "These numbers refer only to the revenue side of the state’s fiscal picture and don’t reflect what the Legislature may or may not spend" for public schools.) • Tax credits can save the state money because a single voucher is less expensive than what the state spends per child in public schools. "State education spending for students who receive scholarships is reduced by more than the amount of revenue lost," states a 2008 study by Florida’s Office of Program Policy Analysis and Government Accountability. The study noted that it is difficult to pinpoint the precise savings but estimated that in 2007-08, for every dollar lost in corporate income tax revenue, taxpayers saved $1.49 in state education funding. A later update estimated that the state saved about $36 million in 2008-09. We sent a summary of the arguments to two education professors who are experts on tax credits: David Figlio at Northwestern University and Kevin Welner at the University of Colorado. Both said it’s not as simple as Rich declared. "The answer to this is a little bit complicated. It is definitely true that, overall, taxpayers save money with this program, at least under the scenario that has been operating to date. The tax credits that the state provides are considerably smaller per student than the public obligation would be to these students were they attending public schools," Figlio told PolitiFact Florida. However, it’s hard to pinpoint the amount of savings because some students would have attended private schools anyway. Now that the raised the income eligibility limits opens up the program to more families, it’s likely that more will get scholarships that would have found a way to pay for private school regardless. Welner told PolitiFact Florida that "there clearly is an attempt here to shift resources from public to private schools." However, the $3 billion figure is just half the ledger. Our ruling Rich said that "$3 billion over the next five years will be taken out of our public schools and be put into vouchers." There's not $3 billion in funding that's being removed from a public schools budget and put into a voucher program budget. Instead, Rich was referring to the state’s Tax Credit Scholarship Program, which gives corporations tax credits when they give money to allow poor students to attend private schools. Based on the program’s size, it’s possible that it could fund a voucher program in the ballpark of $3 billion over the next five years. But there’s no guarantee that money would otherwise have gone to public schools. And, private school vouchers tend to cost less than what it costs to educate a child in public schools, which complicates how much money taxpayers would pay if the children in private schools instead went to public schools. That’s even more true now that the state raised the income eligibility requirements this year. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Nan Rich	None	None	None	2014-06-19T14:17:52	2014-05-10	['None']

pomt-11975	"The soda tax can make a difference by reducing consumption of unhealthy soda pop and sugary beverages."	mostly true	/illinois/statements/2017/oct/02/michael-bloomberg/cook-county-soda-tax-should-make-dent-consumption/	Is Cook County’s new sweetened drink tax about public health or about money? Cook County Board President Toni Preckwinkle, the architect of the tax, has said she rejects the premise of that question. "In my view, this isn’t a vote to repeal or keep a revenue source we already approved," Preckwinkle told the City Club of Chicago on Sept. 13. "It’s about whether or not we want Cook County to be healthier, safer and more efficient or if we are willing to go backwards and let Cook County become sicker, less safe and less efficient." Voting to repeal the tax, as may happen at the Cook County Board’s Oct. 11 meeting, would be voting "to fire frontline health care providers: doctors, nurses and other medical professionals who help serve our most vulnerable patients," Preckwinkle said. In an Aug. 22 interview on "Chicago Tonight," Preckwinkle had offered another defense. "Our Cook County hospital system spends $200 million a year or more treating sugar consumption related diseases," she said, noting also that 87 percent of county government’s budget goes into health care. "Obesity, heart disease, diabetes, tooth decay. That’s a tremendous burden on our health care system. And we are facing a public health care crisis in this country related to sugar consumption." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com As public fury has raged over the penny-an-ounce tax, Preckwinkle has scrupulously avoided discussing the issue on either its health or fiscal aspects alone. Enter Michael Bloomberg. The billionaire former New York mayor and unabashed supporter of measures to limit sweetened drink consumption has become a major defender of the Cook County tax and the county officials who voted for it. He’s spent more than $5 million on ads touting the health benefits of the tax and funded a website, cookcountyhealthykids.org, that makes a claim county officials have avoided. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com "The soda tax can make a difference by reducing consumption of unhealthy soda pop and sugary beverages that contribute to diabetes, obesity, heart disease and other serious medical conditions," the site says. Does adding a penny per ounce to the cost of sweetened drinks cause a decrease in their consumption? As debate rages over the soda tax, we decided to check. Scarce research When Cook County began collecting its tax on Aug. 2, it became only the sixth jurisdiction in the United States to collect an excise tax on sweetened drinks and only the second to include artificially sweetened drinks. Two more cities, San Francisco and Seattle, have soda taxes scheduled to begin Jan. 1, 2018. The first excise tax on sugar-sweetened soft drinks went into effect in Berkeley, Calif., on March 1, 2015. Governments have long levied so-called "sin taxes" on certain commodities, products and activities, ostensibly to offset their social costs while also raking in new revenue. Taxes on sweetened drinks are the latest effort by health advocates like Bloomberg to bring them into the "sin tax" category for their role in America’s obesity problem. But soft drink consumption is deeply entrenched in American culture, and the soft drink industry and many consumers have yet to accept the "sin" label for this tax. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Given the recent nature of soda taxes, there’s not a deep reservoir of academic research on their effects. And we should note here that the soft drink industry rejects the basic premise of Bloomberg’s statement -- that any reduction in an individual’s soft drink consumption is a step toward better health. A study published in April by the Oakland Calif.-based Public Health Institute and the University of North Carolina found that sales of taxed beverages dropped 9.6 percent in the first year while sales of untaxed drinks rose 3.5 percent. But the researchers noted that Berkeley is not a typical test market because it consumed only 34 percent of the national average for sugar-sweetened beverages. "Population-based findings on (sugar-sweetened beverage) consumption were not definitive, and consumption should be further evaluated in more typical communities and with larger samples," the authors wrote. A study published in September 2016 in the American Journal of Public Health found that sugar-sweetened drink consumption in Berkeley decreased by 21 percent. That study was limited to low-income neighborhoods. The Public Health Institute study, like studies planned for Cook County and Oakland, Calif., was funded in part by Michael Bloomberg’s Bloomberg Philanthropies. This gets into what has been a thorny issue in the broader debate over the health implications of sweetened drinks, in which researchers have found that studies funded by the soda industry consistently find minimal adverse effects from sweetened drink consumption while independent studies consistently find the opposite. Bloomberg’s involvement in this early research may invite criticism from opponents of the taxes. Mexico, which instituted a 10 percent tax on soda in 2014, saw soda purchases decline steadily through the year, according to a study in the British Medical Journal. Sales declined by 6 percent early in the year and continued to decline to 12 percent by year’s end. That study also was funded partly by Bloomberg. A study published in November 2016 in the journal PLOS Medicine used the Mexican sales declines recorded in the British study and projected reduced soda consumption due to the tax "will likely prevent approximately 189,300 new cases of type 2 diabetes, 20,400 incident strokes and heart attacks, and 18,900 deaths over 10 years among adults 35–94 years of age." Researchers used the Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model, which has been used since the 1980s to estimate health benefits in the U.S., to create the report’s 10-year projection. In another modeling study, Harvard researchers projected that a penny-per-ounce nationwide tax on sugar-sweetened drinks in the U.S. "could substantially reduce (obesity) and healthcare expenditures and increase healthy life expectancy." Closer to home Less than two months into the Cook County tax, evidence of its effect on sweetened drink consumption is largely anecdotal but appears to support Bloomberg’s claim. "We have received reports from retailers in Cook County of lost sales between mid-40 percent near the border and teens near city center. Likewise, there are reports of significant increases in sales in collar counties that are very close to matching," Rob Karr, president of the Illinois Retail Merchants Association said in an email. "It is VERY difficult to get retailers to openly share such information as it is highly proprietary. They are scared to death of conclusions that competitors or others may draw with such data given the extraordinarily competitive nature and extremely narrow margins in grocery." Can the Tax, a group that opposes the tax, said in August that the tax had an immediate effect on sales, especially at stores near the Cook County border. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com Sales data during the beverage tax’s first weekend provided by three retailers for 21 total Cook County stores is alarming. Every store reported a decline in sales of at least 6 percent and as much as 39 percent," said an Aug. 17 press release. "Further, declines in beverage sales for stores near the Cook County border were among the highest reported amid concerns of mass consumer flight to Indiana and the collar counties as residents try to avoid paying the tax." For retailers, the decline is bad news. For supporters like Bloomberg, it’s a credible signal of less consumption. Unknown, however, is to what extent sales lost in Cook County are replaced by purchases in either the collar counties or in Indiana. The Philadelphia story If there’s a case study for Cook County’s sweetened drink tax, it might be Philadelphia. The city council there approved a 1.5-cent-per-ounce sweetened drink tax that went into effect on Jan. 1, 2017, with proceeds earmarked for pre-K education, parks and libraries. In its first six months, the tax generated $39.3 million -- short of both the original $42.6 million projection and a revised estimate of $39.7 million. A study there in August by the Florida marketing firm Catalina said sales had dropped 55 percent since the tax, while sales of carbonated soft drinks outside city limits had increased 38 percent. But city officials say the study is flawed because it looked only at retail sales, which account for less than half of total sales, and because the tax could not have generated $39.3 million if all sales had dropped 55 percent. Our ruling Bloomberg said Cook County’s sweetened beverage tax can bring health benefits by "reducing consumption of unhealthy soda pop and sugary beverages." Cook County is only the sixth jurisdiction in the U.S. to enact a sweetened drink tax since Berkeley, Calif., enacted the first one in March 2015. That means there’s been very little formal research on their effects, which makes proving or disproving Bloomberg’s claim difficult. Academic research in Berkeley and on Mexico’s soda tax has shown declines in sales, however. Anecdotal evidence from tax opponents in Illinois appears to show the same here, as does a recent marketing report in Philadelphia. Studies using modeling schemes to project health outcomes based on reduced consumption also tilt in Bloomberg’s favor. Cook County’s soda tax may not survive long enough to become part of the extended field study needed to judge the health effects of similar efforts nationwide. But there’s enough evidence out there to rate Bloomberg’s statement Mostly True. See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com	None	Michael Bloomberg	None	None	None	2017-10-02T09:29:02	2017-09-18	['None']
pomt-02528	"Americans work way more than an average of industrialized countries around the world."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/09/keith-ellison/keith-ellison-says-americans-work-way-more-others/	A recent Congressional Budget Office report is the latest spark in the Affordable Care Act debate. Conservatives on ABC’s This Week roundtable criticized President Barack Obama’s signature health care law for its predicted effect on the economy. As we’ve previously noted, the nonpartisan report shows that health care reform may reduce the total number of hours worked by 1.5 to 2 percent from 2017 to 2024 -- the equivalent of about 2 million jobs. Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., pushed back against the Obamacare critics, arguing that a little less time in the office might not be such a bad thing. "We're going to have parents being able to come home, working reasonable hours. People are going to be able to retire," he said. "People might be able to actually cook dinner rather than have to order out and get some takeout. I mean, the fact is, is that if Americans can have more choices to open up a new business they've been wanting to start, this is a good thing. You know, if you look at international comparisons country by country, Americans work way more than an average of industrialized countries around the world." PolitiFact wondered how other developed nations stack up to the United States in terms of hours worked. We fact-checked a similar claim from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., back in 2011 and rated it False, but Ellison’s take is more nuanced. Ellison’s spokesman pointed us to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. They track the average annual number of hours worked for 34 countries, which include many of the most developed nations as well as developing economies. Experts confirmed OECD is a good resource for this information. This report, last updated in November 2013, shows by country the average number of hours an employee works per year. Across all OECD countries (except for Israel, which they didn’t provide data for), the average number of hours an employee works per year is 1,715. The United States does come in above that mean, at 1,790 hours worked per year. That’s 10th among OECD countries. It’s a far cry from No. 1 Mexico at 2,226 hours or No. 2 South Korea at 2,163. On the other end of the spectrum, the Netherlands recorded just 1,384 hours annually. The U.S. average of 1,790 hours is 75 hours higher than the OECD average. That translates to about 1.5 hours more per week. So Ellison’s claim that we work "way more" is misleading, considering that’s just 4.4 percent more time spent at work, on average. Our ruling Ellison said that an average U.S. employee works "way more than the average industrialized countries around the world." The data shows that U.S. workers spend about 1,790 hours per year on the clock, which is above an average of developed countries at 1,715 hours. So he’s right that Americans work a lot, but we’ll dock Ellison a notch on our Truth-O-Meter for exaggerating the difference. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-07277	"To give a sense of how families are struggling, a record four out of every 10 school kids in Ohio now qualifies for subsidized lunch."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/may/24/amy-hanauer/policy-matters-ohios-amy-hanauer-says-four-every-1/	Whether overhauling Ohio’s collective bargaining law or proposing dramatic budget cuts, Republican Gov. John Kasich’s agenda has drawn thousands of protesters to the Statehouse this year. Amy Hanauer of the liberal think tank Policy Matters Ohio delivered a speech at the Statehouse on May 5 – the day the GOP-controlled Ohio House of Representatives passed the budget – that focused on the working class and the government policies that have damaged it. "To give a sense of how families are struggling, a record four out of every 10 school kids in Ohio now qualifies for subsidized lunch," said Hanauer, executive director of Policy Matters Ohio. The statistic is effective because it’s easy to understand. Free or reduced-price school lunches are directly linked to poverty, and 40 percent seems like a high number of Ohio students who qualify for the subsidy. PolitiFact Ohio decided to look into Hanauer’s claim to see if she has her facts straight. Before we were able to reach Hanauer, Internet research produced news reports from this year about subsidized lunch statistics in Ohio. A story The Columbus Dispatch published February 13, citing statistics from the Ohio Department of Education, reported that four out of 10 Ohio students receive free or reduced-price lunch through a federal program for low-income students. We called the Department of Education for the statistics used in the story. A department spokesman handed over data it received from the National School Lunch Program, which is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The National School Lunch Program provides cash subsidies to public and private schools across the country to serve free and reduced-price lunches to eligible children. The data, collected in October and released in February, shows 825,469 Ohio students received free or reduced-priced lunch out of 1,876,355 students who attend Ohio schools participating in the National School Lunch Program. Of those students participating in the program, 716,084 receive free lunch and 109,385 received reduced-price lunch. Based on those numbers, about 44 percent of students at Ohio schools participating in the federal subsidized lunch program qualify for the benefit – exceeding the four-in-10 ratio Hanauer cited. But are there Ohio schools that don’t participate in the federal subsidized lunch program? If so, the overall percentage of Ohio students getting free or reduced-priced lunch could drop below 40 percent. We checked back with the Department of Education to get the total number of students in the state. There are about 2,042,538 students in Ohio, according to the department. So we plugged the new total into our calculation (825,469 students getting subsidized lunch divided by 2.04 million kids) and the result was 40.4 percent – equal to a 4-to-10 ratio. So Hanauer was correct in citing the ratio of Ohio kids getting a subsidized lunch. She also called the statistic a record. How does that stack up? Similar data from the Department of Education was readily available dating back to 2002. Since 2002, the highest percentage of students receiving subsidized lunch was, in fact, in 2010. In 2009, which saw the second-highest participation, 42 percent of students at schools participating in the federal program received subsidized lunch (compared to 44 percent in 2010). Hanauer’s speech was spot-on about the ratio of kids receiving subsidized lunch. As for calling the ratio a record, neither the Department of Education nor the USDA provided data that showed a higher percentage in the past. We rate the statement True.

pomt-12893	"Some countries are contributing (peacekeeping) troops because they're making money off of them."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2017/jan/24/nikki-haley/un-peacekeeping-money-maker/	U.S. senators asked South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley about U.N. peacekeeping missions during her confirmation hearing to be America’s ambassador to the United Nations. They were especially concerned about the war-torn nation of South Sudan, but Haley tackled peacekeeping more broadly. Haley said there were red flags. "It's been devastating to see the exploitation, the fraud, abuse that's happening," Haley said Jan. 18. "We have to acknowledge that some countries are contributing troops because they're making money off of them. So if they are not willing to make sure that they are punishing the violators, then we actually need to pull that country's troops out, because they're harming the peace process." Haley was referring to cases where peacekeeping troops sexually abused the very people they were sent to protect. The most recent case involved soldiers from France, Chad and Equatorial Guinea. But it was her assertion about countries making money off of peacekeeping that caught our eye. We took a closer look. The experts we reached agreed that yes, there is a financial incentive for certain nations. On the other hand, there was equally broad agreement that money isn’t the only factor. A little background on peacekeeping Under the banner of the United Nations, countries provide troops and equipment to troubled corners of the world to help them bridge the gap between conflict and stability. Right now, the U.N. has 16 operations, and nine of them are in Africa. Between troops, police and military observers, about 100,000 personnel make up the global peacekeeping force at a cost of about $1.9 billion for the year. Who sends the most troops? Ethiopia (8,165), Pakistan (6,774), India (6,752), Bangladesh (5,635) and Rwanda (5,125). Those five countries provide nearly a third of all peacekeepers. Why they send troops Money is a factor. Brett Schaefer, a Heritage Foundation analyst, told us the countries with the largest participation tend to be middle- or lower-income nations. "Their payments to troops are low, and the amount they get from the U.N. is generally above that," Schaefer said. But he noted that gaining field experience, training and international prestige are powerful drivers too. Paul Williams at George Washington University also said the money should be put into perspective: "It is very rarely, if ever the case, that this is the sole factor behind a state's decision to contribute troops." For Bruce Jones at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based academic center, India proves that point. "It’s one of the most important contributors to U.N. peacekeeping," Jones said. "But it no longer makes money from peacekeeping. It now loses money, but it's still doing it. So that should tell us something." If there’s a red flag to be waved with the U.N.’s African peacekeeping missions, it might have more to do with complex regional politics. Dyan Mazurana, a professor of international affairs at Tufts University, said some countries sending troops have a clear self-interest in the fate of their neighboring states. "They are often playing a blurry role of peacekeepers, peace enforcement and being parties to the conflict, such as supporting various armed parties, selling weapons or extracting and profiting from natural resources," Mazurana said. None of the experts we reached found any connection between sexual assault and the payments to countries for the troops they send. They gave the U.N. credit for acting more swiftly to crack down on abuse, but they also said continued pressure is needed to ensure that the perpetrators actually face punishment. We reached Haley’s office but never received any comment on her statement. Our ruling Haley said that "some countries" contribute peacekeeping troops because they make money off the U.N. payments. Every expert we reached agreed that for some nations, the financial payoff is a factor. However, they all said that money was not the sole driver, and that countries gained military training and experience from the role they played. Haley offered an accurate but limited comment on peacekeeping troops. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-09582	"PWNED: House GOP Dominates Twitter, YouTube, Social Media in Congress."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/25/john-boehner/boehner-claims-house-republicans-dominate-twitter-/	Quick quiz of your online fluency: Do you know what PWNED means? We'll admit we had to Google it. In Internet geek, it's trash talk that means you "owned" your opponent. Here it is in a recent press release from House Republican Leader John Boehner: "PWNED: House GOP Dominates Twitter, YouTube, Social Media in Congress." The release said, "The conventional wisdom is being turned upside down as House Republicans demonstrate an unmatched ability to connect with the American people on the Internet’s most popular communities. Once considered the party of online innovation, new research and a host of media reports show that Democrats are largely ignoring some of the most popular social media communities on the Web." Indeed, there's been a widespread perception that Democrats had the lead. During the presidential campaign, the Washington Post dubbed Barack Obama "the king of social networking." By nearly every social networking measure -- Facebook, MySpace, YouTube and Twitter -- Obama's engagement and influence dwarfed the McCain campaign. Obama's text messaging became a powerful grass-roots tool for getting out his message and raising money. The Obama campaign even mocked Sen. John McCain for his inability to navigate the Internet and ran an ad linking him to a record player and a Rubik's Cube. We decided to fact-check Boehner's boast about Republican domination of social media in Congress. First stop: Twitter. Earlier this month, Mark Senak, senior vice president and partner at Fleishman-Hillard, a public relations firm in Washington, D.C., issued a report titled "Twongress: The Power of Twitter in Congress" in which he analyzed the Twitter use of all members of Congress. The findings surprised him. In Congress, he found, there are 132 members using Twitter actively: 89 Republicans and 43 Democrats. It breaks down like this: In the Senate, there are 14 Republicans using Twitter compared to 11 Democrats; and in the House, there are 75 Republicans using Twitter (42.13 percent of the Republican caucus) and 32 Democrats (12.45 percent of the Democratic caucus). And the GOP leads in tweet production: "Republicans send out more tweets and have the attention of many more people than do the Democrats," the report says. The disparity in Twitter usage was most pronounced in the House. In the House, only one Democrat ranks in the top 10 in terms of the number of followers; and only two are in the top 20. Not only do more House Republicans actively use Twitter, they have many more followers and send out far more Twitter messages, 29,162 tweets compared to 5,503 for their Democratic counterparts, according to the report, which tallied their messages through the end of 2009. The power of Twitter, however, is not just in the number of followers you have and how many messages you send out a day. The idea is to get people on your followers list to "re-tweet" -- pass on -- your message, potentially exposing your message to an exponentially larger group. So analysts also look at your "influence" and "clout," which factors in how often people "re-tweet" and cite your messages. And by that measure, House Republicans are far outpacing Democrats. Measured by the sheer number of followers, Boehner leads the Republicans in the House with 18,800; followed by Minority Whip Eric Cantor, R-Va., with 16,500. But it was Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Fla., who led House Republicans in "clout" and "influence" because she is re-tweeted so often. And for the record, the supposedly out-of-touch McCain beats everyone in Congress for total followers, with nearly 1.6 million. "When I first saw the results, I was surprised," Senak told PolitiFact. "That was a counterintuitive finding after the Obama campaign. But when when I thought about it, the party that is not in power always has had to be more aggressive in using communication tools to get their message." So Round 1, Twitter, to House Republicans. What about YouTube? On Jan. 21, 2010, YouTube's CitizenTube posted a year-end wrap-up that showed 89 percent of Republicans and 74 percent of Democrats in Congress have started YouTube channels to engage their constituents. More importantly, people are watching the Republican channels much more often. According to the report, eight of the top 10 most-viewed and most-subscribed YouTube channels in Congress are from the GOP, though Democrats took two of the top three spots. The top 4, in order, are Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and Boehner. A tracking of YouTube views by industry analyst TubeMogul shows that with few exceptions, Republican videos consistently drew more clicks than those from Democrats. None of the videos have gone viral, said David Burch of TubeMogul, and no one is getting huge viewership. "Obama spoiled us in terms of what 'a lot' means," during the campaign, he said. Obama remains on the cutting edge. On Jan. 25, 2010, the administration rolled out a new White House iPhone app which will allow users to watch White House live-streaming video. Still, in Congress, the GOP is ahead. Round 2, YouTube, to Republicans. And lastly, Facebook, the favorite of former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. Palin's Facebook page has more than 1.2 million fans. No one in the House has that kind of reach. And we couldn't find any comprehensive analysis of engagement on FaceBook by members of Congress. But as of Jan. 22, 2010, Boehner had 31,757 fans of his page, compared to 8,745 for Pelosi. Boehner's director of new media, Nick Schaper, said House Republicans are building an important lead in social media. "We're pretty proud of that," he said. For many Republicans, the Obama campaign was a real eye-opener to the power of social media tools. And so Republican leaders made a conscious effort to ramp up their involvement. In weekly meetings, members of the Republican conference routinely discuss their social media successes and talk about how best to use various tools. Engagement in new social media just makes sense, Schaper said. It's easy to use, but it takes commitment. Boehner typically tweets about 5 to 10 times a day. "The more active you are, the more followers you get," Schaper explained. "Everyone on the press team considers Twitter an important part of the process. We make it a focus, not a secondary kind of thing." It's a great resource to reach people with your message, he said. Boehner might only have about 19,000 followers on Twitter, but if enough people re-tweet some of his messages, he can reach a couple hundred thousand people in just a couple hours. But while House Republicans may rightly crow about deeper engagement in social media than their Democratic counterparts, Senak, the author of the study, says neither side is doing particularly well compared to other large institutions. Both parties have a minority of members engaged in Twitter. And neither side has fully embraced the give-and-take of Twitter. Most members have elected to follow very few other people and rarely "re-tweet." In other words, he said, they are mostly using Twitter as a soapbox. "Both sides have room for a tremendous amount of improvement," Senak said. But the bottom line is that Boehner is correct when he boasts that the House GOP dominates the Democrats on Twitter, YouTube and other social media in Congress. Still, we had to ask, is Boehner really so plugged-in that he knows what PWNED means? Schaper artfully sidestepped the question and said, "He surprises me every time I talk about it (social media). I think people would be surprised." On this claim, Boehner earns a True.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2010-01-25T18:50:42	2010-01-22	['Social_media', 'YouTube']

pomt-13541	Says Hillary Clinton "is the one that labeled African-American youth as ‘superpredators.’"	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/28/reince-priebus/did-hillary-clinton-call-african-american-youth-su/	In response to Donald Trump calling Hillary Clinton a "bigot" this week, GOP chairman Reince Priebus reminded people that Hillary Clinton once referred to African-American youth as "superpredators." Priebus took a swing at Hillary Clinton’s past, telling NBC’s Meet the Press host Chuck Todd that her actions say a lot about her, adding "she’s the one that labeled African-American youth as ‘superpredators’." Trump, who is looking to increase his appeal among African-American voters, made the same "superpredator" claim days earlier on Twitter. It didn’t take long to find what Trump and Priebus were referencing, but for this fact-check, we wanted to take a close look at the full context of Clinton’s remark. ‘Superpredators’ in context The "superpredators" line comes from a 1996 speech in New Hampshire, where Clinton spoke in support of the 1994 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, which her husband, Bill Clinton, had signed in to law. "We’re making some progress," Clinton said. "Much of it is related to the initiative called ‘community policing.’ Because we have finally gotten more police officers on the street. That was one of the goals that the president had when he pushed the crime bill that was passed in 1994." Provisions of the act included a ban on some assault weapons, more funding for community policing and an expansion of the death penalty. The legislation, which was championed by Bill Clinton as a way to reduce the number of African-Americans being killed in drug-related incidents, has drawn criticism in recent years for sending disproportionate numbers of African-Americans to prison. The "superpredator" remark, which Priebus and Trump referenced, was in the same speech a few lines later. "But we also have to have an organized effort against gangs," Hillary Clinton said in a C-SPAN video clip. "Just as in a previous generation we had an organized effort against the mob. We need to take these people on. They are often connected to big drug cartels, they are not just gangs of kids anymore. They are often the kinds of kids that are called superpredators — no conscience, no empathy. We can talk about why they ended up that way, but first, we have to bring them to heel." The full context of this incident does link children and superpredators, but nowhere in the speech does she directly label African-American youth this way. However, backlash from this speech has followed Clinton into this year’s election. Two Black Lives Matter activists confronted Clinton at a private fundraiser in February, telling the candidate she owes black people an apology. One day after this confrontation, Clinton released a statement to the Washington Post’s Jonathan Capehart, expressing regret for her word choice. "Looking back, I shouldn't have used those words, and I wouldn't use them today," she said. Later in the election cycle, former Democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders, also criticized her language at a debate in Brooklyn. When Sanders was asked by debate moderator why he called out Bill Clinton out for his defense of Clinton’s use of the term "superpredator," Sanders responded, "Because it was a racist term, and everyone knew it was a racist term." Our ruling Priebus said Hillary Clinton is "the the one that labeled African-American youth as superpredators." Clinton — in the midst of championing her husband’s 1994 crime legislation — did use the term "superpredator" when referring to "gangs of kids." She did not specifically label superpredators as African-American, but the context of her speech and her subsequent apology decades later suggests it was a reasonable inference. Priebus’ claim is accurate, but needs some clarification, so for that reason we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-10115	"The centerpiece of Senator McCain's education policy is to increase the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/16/barack-obama/centerpiece-more-like-a-side-dish/	Sen. Barack Obama mocked his rival's education policy during the final presidential debate, saying Sen. John McCain planned to help a couple thousand students in Washington, D.C., and more or less ignore the rest of the country. His attack came late in the debate, as the candidates sparred over how to improve schools. Here's the exchange in context: "I'm sure you're aware, Senator Obama, of the program in the Washington, D.C., school system where vouchers are provided," McCain said in the Oct. 15, 2008, debate. "There's a certain number, I think it's a thousand and some and some 9,000 parents asked to be eligible for that...They wanted to choose the school that they thought was best for their children...That was vouchers, Senator Obama. And I'm frankly surprised you didn't pay more attention to that example." Obama countered: "Even if Senator McCain were to say that vouchers were the way to go — I disagree with him on this, because the data doesn't show that it actually solves the problem — the centerpiece of Senator McCain's education policy is to increase the voucher program in D.C. by 2,000 slots. That leaves all of you who live in the other 50 states without an education reform policy from Senator McCain." The senators were referring to the four-year-old D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, under which 1,903 children from low-income families have received up to $7,500 a year for tuition to private schools. Republicans in Congress – who believe in improving public schools through competition by providing vouchers parents can use to pay for private-school tuition – created the program in 2004. It's true that McCain is a strong advocate of the D.C. program. On his campaign Web site, he lists 13 items under the heading, "John McCain's Education Policy," including: "John McCain Will Expand The D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program." He devotes 87 words to the subject, while the average item receives 67 words. "In our nation's capital, we have seen the dramatic benefits of giving parents control of money and choices," the site says. "The Opportunity Scholarship program serves more than 1,900 students from families with an average income of $23,000 a year. More than 7,000 more families have applied for that program. The budget for the Opportunity Scholarships is currently $13 million. John McCain believes that this extremely successful program should expand to at least $20 million benefiting nearly a thousand more families." Obama actually overstated the number of slots McCain would add to the program. But more importantly, there's no indication that plan is the "centerpiece" of McCain's education policy. True, there are just two items to which McCain's education page devotes more words. But three of the items outline different ways McCain would, as the site puts it, "Ensure that our children have quality teachers," an effort that would be national in scope. He would devote 5 percent of certain federal funds (Title II funds) to recruit teachers who graduated in the top quarter of their class, set aside 60 percent of those funds as bonuses for high-performing teachers, and use 35 percent of the funds for teacher development. It was clear to us that McCain's plan to use — or continue using — Title II funds to improve teaching is the centerpiece of his education policy, even before McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said this in an e-mail: "The focus of our plan is the reform of...Title 1 and 2 funding – which is in excess of 16 billion dollars...Moreover, we have higher ed and early ed policy which have nothing to do with the DC opportunity scholarship expansion." We agree. On this one, Obama gets an F for False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-10-16T00:00:00	2008-10-15	['Washington,_D.C.', 'John_McCain']

pomt-11540	"There are more immigrants in our country right now than any other time."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2018/feb/13/tucker-carlson/tucker-carlsons-claims-more-immigrants-now-united-/	Fox News’ Tucker Carlson shared on Twitter a key detail of the immigration debate: how many immigrants are in the United States. "There are more immigrants in our country right now than any other time. Is the country more united? Stronger? Just the opposite & everyone knows it. Maybe that's bc our elites welcome immigrants by telling them how flawed America is and how bigoted its native population #Tucker," tweeted Carlson, host of Tucker Carlson Tonight on Feb. 8. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We wondered about the first part of Carlson’s tweet: Does the United States have more immigrants now than ever before? Carlson linked us to reports from the Center for Immigration Studies and Pew Research Center on the growing foreign-born population in the United States, which is now at a record high. It’s also worth noting, however, that the immigrant share of the total U.S. population was its highest in 1890. Background on the foreign-born population The U.S. Census Bureau in 1850 began asking people where they born. Large-scale immigration from Europe contributed to an increase of the foreign-born population in the United States from 1850 (2.2 million) to 1930 (14.2 million). "The late 19th and early 20th century was a time of high immigration (relative to total population) because we had a growing economy (industrialization and urbanization)," said Mae M. Ngai, a professor of Asian American studies and history at Columbia University. Nonpartisan think tank the Migration Policy Institute said restrictive immigration laws in the 1920s, the Great Depression and World War II then reduced the number of new arrivals. The number of immigrants dropped to 9.6 million by 1970, but has continued to grow since then. Today, the majority of the foreign-born population is from Latin America and Asia, according to the Census bureau. Carlson pointed us to a May 2017 post from the nonpartisan Pew Research Center that said the U.S. foreign-born population reached a record 43.2 million in 2015. "Since 1965, when U.S. immigration laws replaced a national quota system, the number of immigrants living in the U.S. has more than quadrupled," Pew Research Center reported. Carlson also noted that the Center for Immigration Studies in October 2017 said the U.S. immigrant population hit a record 43.7 million in July 2016. (The center, which favors low levels of immigration, analyzed data from the Census’ 2016 American Community Survey. It said the total number of immigrants was likely 45.6 million because some immigrants are missed by the survey.) So the number of immigrants in the United States is the highest it’s ever been. But it’s worth mentioning that 1890 holds the record for the highest percentage of immigrants as a share of the population. The total U.S. population in 1890 was about 63 million, and immigrants accounted for an estimated 14.8 percent. The total population in 2016 was about 323 million, which means about 13.5 percent were immigrants. Through a spokeswoman, Carlson said he never claimed immigrants were at the highest level as a proportion of population. An absolute number has no meaning by itself, "because it would mean something totally different in a country of 100 million, 200 million, 300 million or for that matter, 1 billion," said Ngai, the Columbia University professor. Susan Martin, professor emerita of international migration at Georgetown University, said absolute numbers and proportion can help understand the scale and impact of immigration. "Absolute numbers are important because each person presents needs and opportunities; proportion is equally important because impacts vary depending on whether the needs of a larger or smaller share of the population must be addressed," Martin said. Overall, immigrants’ distribution across the country, how long they’ve been here (on average), their educational levels and and other socio-economic characteristics are also important, Martin said. Our ruling Carlson tweeted, "There are more immigrants in our country right now than any other time." The number of immigrants in the United States is the highest it’s ever been: about 43.7 million. The number of immigrants in the United States has been increasing since 1970, according to the Census bureau. Carlson pointed to the absolute numbers as backup for his claim. But it’s worth noting that immigrants as a share of the population reached its peak in 1890, at 14.8 percent. In 2016, immigrants accounted for 13.5 percent of the population. Carlson’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-04065	Says Chris Christie’s plan "to kick-start our economy" is to propose an "income tax cut that disproportionately benefits the wealthy, and...he's still proposing it."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jan/24/barbara-buono/barbara-buono-claims-chris-christie-still-proposin/	Looking to unseat Gov. Chris Christie this year, Democratic state Sen. Barbara Buono has tried to portray the Republican governor as being steadfastly committed to an income tax cut that disproportionately benefits the wealthy. But for the second time in less than five months, the truth has stood in Buono’s way. Buono, the only Democrat to enter the gubernatorial race so far, repeated a claim about Christie’s tax cut plan during a video interview posted Jan. 13 on bluejersey.com, a left-leaning blog. The governor’s plan "to kick-start our economy" is to propose an "income tax cut that disproportionately benefits the wealthy, and...he's still proposing it," said Buono (D-Middlesex) Buono received a False for claiming in late August that Christie was demanding "an immediate tax cut that would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest." By repeating a line we’ve already debunked, the senator’s latest claim is outrageously wrong. Let’s review our findings: Christie initially proposed in January 2012 to cut income tax rates by 10 percent across-the-board over three years. Under that proposal, higher-income taxpayers, who pay more in income taxes, would have benefited more than lower-income taxpayers. But the governor has since backed off that plan and endorsed a proposal to cut income taxes only for New Jerseyans below a certain income level and based on their annual property tax bills. The governor unveiled that proposal on July 2, when he conditionally vetoed a bill that would have raised the income tax rate on taxable income exceeding $1 million. Christie suggested turning that legislation into a tax cut plan based on a proposal made by Senate President Stephen Sweeney, a Democrat. Under Christie’s latest proposal, homeowners with taxable income of $400,000 or less would receive an income tax credit based on their property tax bills. The credit would be phased in over four years and ultimately reach 10 percent of the first $10,000 in property taxes paid. The proposal would not disproportionately benefit the wealthy, since homeowners earning more than $400,000 would be ineligible and the amount of the tax credit would be based on property tax bills, not income levels. In a news release from the governor’s office on Jan. 13 -- the same day as Buono’s interview -- the Christie administration affirmed its support for that tax cut proposal. According to the release, Christie "has proposed a bipartisan compromise" under which "New Jersey taxpayers will be able to claim an income tax credit of up to 10 percent of their property tax bill." To support Buono’s latest claim, her chief of staff, Christina Zuk, pointed to lines in two news articles, including this sentence from a Jan. 13 Star-Ledger story: "Christie also renewed his commitment for a 10 percent income-tax cut that he could not get last year." But immediately following that sentence is this quote from Christie: "All those things are good, and the tax cut proposed (last year) by Senator Sweeney is good." The second news article, published Jan. 13 on NorthJersey.com, only states that Christie "is still pushing for an income tax cut." The governor’s latest proposal is an income tax cut, but not in the way suggested by Buono. In response to our findings, Zuk said in an e-mail: "There are numerous news reports from the past few weeks that indicate that Governor Christie has not abandoned his misguided plan for an across-the-board income tax cut, one that independent experts say would disproportionately benefit the wealthiest in our state." Our ruling In a recent interview, Buono claimed that Christie’s plan "to kick-start our economy" is to propose an "income tax cut that disproportionately benefits the wealthy, and...he's still proposing it." But the governor has backed off such a plan and endorsed a proposal similar to one put forth by the Senate Democrats. Under that proposal, an income tax credit would be limited to taxpayers below a certain income level and based on their property tax bills. Buono received a False for making a similar claim in August, but we obviously need to add a little sizzle to get our point across. Pants on Fire! To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-14291	"Evidence shows Zika virus turns fetus brains to liquid."	pants on fire!	/global-news/statements/2016/apr/04/blog-posting/website-stirs-zika-fears-false-claim-about-liquefi/	A claim moving on the Web paints a horrific image of how the Zika virus can damage a fetus. "Evidence Shows Zika Virus Turns Fetus Brains to Liquid" blared the headline on the website Weekly Observer, which is based in England. At least two other websites ran similar stories April 3 and 4, 2016. The claim is completely wrong, and has the barest connection to any actual research. Seeing as it showed up in quick succession in Australia and the United Kingdom, we thought we should move quickly to squash it. The Weekly Observer piece has the gloss of authentic reporting. A recent study published by the New England Journal of Medicine shows that the Zika virus kills developing fetal brain cells. According to the doctors, the study was performed on a woman who got infected by the virus while she was 3 months pregnant. Her fetus was monitored through blood tests and MRIs, and the doctors watched as the baby’s brain was basically liquefied within 9 weeks. The woman underwent an abortion at 21 weeks. The Australia Network website was equally somber. In a (sic) recent research published in the New England Journal of Medicine, the researchers tracked the development of a foetus whose mother contracted the virus on a trip to Central America, when she was 3 months pregnant. The blood tests and the magnetic resonance images showed that the virus was slowly turning the baby’s brain into liquid over a course of nine weeks. At 21 weeks the woman aborted the foetus. The New England Journal of Medicine did publish an article on March 30, 2016, about a 33-year-old Finnish woman who was with her husband in Mexico, Guatemala, and Belize in November 2015 when she was 11 weeks pregnant. Ultrasound examinations up until the 17th week of the pregnancy showed no abnormalities. That changed by the 19th week. Basic structures in the cranium were not as they should be. That combined with proof that the mother was infected with the Zika virus and a more detailed view using MRI led the parents to terminate the pregnancy at 21 weeks. An autopsy found Zika virus in the fetal brain tissue. Areas of the brain had dead cells and some that had begun to break down. But did the researchers say that the brain had been liquefied? "This is absolutely NOT what we said," wrote Adre du Plessis, one of the lead authors and director of the Fetal Medicine Institute at the Children’s National Health System in Washington, D.C. A second author, Rita Drigger, a professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, called the description a "false interpretation" of the case. A third author, Olli Vapalahti at the Department of Virology at the University of Helsinki, Finland, told us some reporter might have misunderstood him during an interview. "I may have tried to explain -- perhaps in too simple terms -- that there was thinning of the cortex and enlargement of the ventricles in the brain, meaning that some of the brain tissue had been replaced by cerebrospinal fluid," Vapalahti said. "I can now see that this has emerged to some hype message which certainly I have not intended to deliver." In other words, it wasn’t that brain tissue was turned to liquid. Rather, space where brain cells would normally be found contained fluid instead. In a conference call with reporters on March 30, du Plessis said the main point of the article was to caution doctors and parents that an extremely small head might not be the sole indicator of brain damage associated with the Zika virus. In this case, the brain was small but the head was still within the normal range. "What this says is that the current criteria may be falsely reassuring," du Plessis said. Further, while the presence of the Zika virus in fetal brain tissue strongly indicated that the virus caused the harm, the researchers stopped short of saying this case proved a causal connection. Several news organizations, including the Washington Post, NBC News and Reuters, reported the story accurately. We reached out to the Weekly Observer and so far have not heard back. Our ruling The Weekly Observer and other websites said that researchers had found that the Zika virus turned a fetal brain into liquid. The Observer referred to a study in the New England Journal of Medicine. The three lead researchers for that study declared the Observer's version was wholly inaccurate. They found signs of dead brain cells and cerebrospinal fluid where it shouldn’t be. They never said that the virus liquefied brain cells. We rate this claim Pants on Fire. Update (April 5, 2016): After we published, we heard from the staff of the Weekly Observer. Elise Bou Malham, chief content officer, emailed us, apologized for the mistake and explained that she had first seen the article on another website. "In no way was it meant to 'stir fears' or promote any false claims," Malham said. "We assure you the article was deleted as soon as we received your email. I offer my sincere apologies on behalf of the entire editorial team." While the article was not deleted, it was eventually updated. The new version reads. "Claims about Zika Virus Turning Fetus Brains to ‘Liquid’ Completely FALSE" It then explains its original error. "Earlier this week, The Weekly Observer aggregated an article from various sources online, saying that Zika Virus is responsible for turning Fetus brain into liquid. "The original article on Uproxx.com ‘New Data Shows That The Zika Virus Can Turn Fetal Brain Into Liquid’, as well as several others, turned out to contain false claims as the study was misinterpreted by various sources."

pomt-10574	"(John McCain) was even mentioned as a running mate with John Kerry."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/04/citizens-united-political-victory-fund/thats-the-ticket/	Republicans have often questioned Sen. John McCain's conservative stripes, and the idea that he was a potential running mate for Democrat John Kerry in 2004 stokes their suspicions even more. The advocacy group Citizens United Political Victory Fund is currently on the attack, launching an ad that at first appears to be aimed at Hillary Clinton. "One candidate voted against the Bush tax cuts, both times. ... And was even mentioned as a running mate with John Kerry." A photo of Clinton slides over to reveal McCain; the narrator says, "Hillary Clinton? No. John McCain." We checked the claim on McCain's votes here. As for the charge that McCain was mentioned as a running mate with Democratic nominee John Kerry in 2004? That's true. There are many, many references in the media to the idea that McCain was possible for the No. 2 spot on the Democratic ticket. Here are just a few: • In March 2004, reports about the offer prompted Good Morning America host Charles Gibson to ask McCain about it in an interview on the show. McCain answered: "John Kerry is a very close friend of mine. We've been friends for years. Obviously, I would entertain it. But there's, I see no scenario, no scenario, no scenario where I, I foresee no scenario where that would happen." • After Kerry picked John Edwards as his running mate in July 2004, the Washington Post reported that Kerry initiated phone calls to McCain about a possible crossover ticket, "but McCain made clear he was not interested." • A February 2007 article in Vanity Fair magazine titled "Prisoner of Conscience" says: "Kerry felt close enough to McCain at the time to make multiple and serious inquiries about McCain's interest in running for vice president on a national-unity ticket (and McCain basked in the courtship, even if he knew nothing could ever come of it). • And, in an April 2007 interview with the Web site myDD.com (Direct Democracy for People-Powered Politics), Kerry says McCain's people approached him about being on the Democratic ticket. Responding to suggestions that McCain had approached prominent Democrats about switching parties, Kerry says: "It doesn't surprise me completely because his people similarly approached me to engage in a discussion about his potentially being on the ticket as vice president. So his people were active — let's put it that way." We're not saying McCain gave the idea much thought or even that he was offered the job, but it's clear he "was mentioned as a running mate with John Kerry." We rule this statement True.

pomt-14777	"Last year, I stopped an Obamacare bailout and saved taxpayers $2.5 billion."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/dec/07/marco-rubio/rubio-says-he-prevented-25-billion-obamacare-bailo/	Presidential hopeful Marco Rubio is taking credit for potentially sounding the death knell for Obamacare, claiming legislation he introduced eventually prevented Washington from giving billions of tax dollars to insurance companies. "Last year, I stopped an Obamacare bailout and saved taxpayers $2.5 billion," Rubio said in a Dec. 1, 2015, tweet. It linked to a Fox News story giving Rubio credit for dealing a blow to President Barack Obama’s signature health care legislation. Declaring he saved heaps of tax money and prevented a government bailout linked to a divisive law is a campaign coup for Rubio, who has risen to second among GOP candidates in the latest national Quinnipiac poll. But can he truly claim he kept billions from being used for a so-called bailout? Risk corridors rundown To set the table, we need to take a deep breath and go over a provision of the Affordable Care Act known as "risk corridors." The ACA upended the traditional health insurance model of selling mostly to healthy people, mandating that insurers must provide policies to everyone, regardless of health or pre-existing conditions. That presented a problem for the companies, which didn’t know how much they would need to charge in premiums in order to cover their expenses for all the new policies. To help companies stay solvent as they adjusted their rates to proper levels, the law provided a three-year period in which the government would spread the risk among all insurers in ACA marketplaces. This program, set to last between 2014-16, is known as risk corridors. If some insurers are successful in setting their marketplace rates properly and make more than a certain amount, Washington gets some of that extra money, referred to as user fees. Companies that don’t do well have a portion of their losses covered by the government. Rubio has opposed the risk corridors since 2013, introducing legislation in the Senate to repeal the program. His bill didn’t go anywhere, but Rubio continued to speak out against the provision, referring to the program as a "bailout" for unsuccessful insurance companies. But is it really a bailout? Several experts told us no, stressing that a bailout usually refers to a program used to save a company after the fact, not a mechanism in place to deal with a problem that everyone assumes could occur. The risk corridors program was modeled after a successful plan through Medicare Part D prescription drug coverage set up during George W. Bush’s presidency. The Part D program is a bit different than the ACA’s version, but it was still designed to spread risk among insurers. "Then, no one called it a bailout, when a new private insurance market was being created for Medicare drug benefits," said Mark Hall, a law and public health professor at Wake Forest University. But the problem with Obamacare’s risk corridors is really about how it’s funded. And that’s the heart of Rubio’s claim of saving taxpayer money. Funding fight The ACA did not specify where it was getting the money to cover any risk corridor payments. To get around this, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said they would keep the program budget-neutral by making payments strictly from the user fees successful insurers sent to the government. Rubio’s concern has been that CMS promised in 2013 that "regardless of the balance of payments and receipts" in the program, insurers who said they needed money would get it. His point is that if there wasn’t enough money to cover the payments, the Obama administration would ask Congress for money. But CMS said in April 2014 that it didn’t plan to ask Congress for an appropriation. If they didn’t take in enough money the first year, they would make it up in later years, when marketplaces hopefully stabilized enough to cover losses. To make sure CMS didn’t ask for cash, Rubio wanted to cut off other sources of funding that could be used to pay off those companies. He urged then-Speaker of the House John Boehner in October 2014 to block potential appropriations for risk corridor payments. When Congress passed a spending bill in December 2014, it included a sentence, or a "rider" in legislative speak, that said the CMS’ parent agency, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, could not move money around in its budget to pay extra risk corridor expenses. Other legislators have credited Rubio with inspiring this language. Rubio has since reintroduced his bill to repeal risk corridors. Everyone had to wait until insurance companies turned in their results to see how the risk corridors were working. The first year didn’t go as well as CMS and the Obama administration had hoped. In October 2015, CMS announced the risk corridors program took in $362 million for 2014, while less successful insurers asked for a total of $2.87 billion. That left a $2.5 billion shortfall CMS can’t pay. CMS said it would pay out 12.6 percent of claims from 2014 this year, leading some insurers to leave the marketplaces or even collapse altogether. Rubio now is on the campaign trail trumpeting the move as potentially being "a big part of ending Obamacare for good." Some legal observers, however, doubt whether Rubio’s efforts had any long-term effects. "All the rider did is say, ‘If you’re going to go scrape the couch cushions for money to pay for this, don’t,’ " Nicholas Bagley, a University of Michigan law professor, told PolitiFact Florida. "The Rubio rider is preventing the administration from coming up with a workaround to a problem the law already had." There are still two years left in the risk corridors program, which the Congressional Budget Office said will likely eventually break even. If the program is in the red after 2016, CMS will either have to somehow find the money or ask Congress to decide whether to approve cash to pay the bill. Otherwise insurers could potentially sue to get what the law says they’re owed. "What he did is throw a wrench in the process," Bagley said of Rubio, who is trying to include the same kind of roadblock in the current spending bill. The deadline for that bill is Dec. 11. "It’s perfectly reasonable to assume those insurance companies are going to eventually want the money that was promised to them." Our ruling Rubio said, "Last year, I stopped an Obamacare bailout and saved taxpayers $2.5 billion." He’s referring to a provision in the Affordable Care Act called risk corridors, which faced a $2.5 billion shortfall for 2014. Rubio, whose efforts to repeal risk corridors have so far failed, helped persuade Congress last year to prevent Health and Human Services from being able to cover the difference with money from its own budget. But experts said calling the program a bailout is not accurate. They also noted CMS has said they want the risk corridors to pay for themselves through fees from insurers. Most importantly, experts also said Rubio did not necessarily save that money in the long run. His best argument is he temporarily limited one way CMS could have tried to pay for insurance companies' losses. The program has two more years to cover its expenses. If any bills are due after that time, CMS or Congress will have to find a way to pay them because they are obligated to do so. Rubio oversimplified a complex process that is still largely unresolved.

pomt-05864	Says that as Wisconsin governor he "never raised taxes."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/feb/10/tommy-thompson/gop-senate-candidate-tommy-thompson-says-tax-cutti/	When it comes to reciting the tax cutting he did as Wisconsin’s governor, Tommy Thompson can riff as well as any politician. The Republican U.S. Senate candidate launched into his litany with reporters after giving a speech at the Milwaukee Press Club on Jan. 23, 2012. John Mercure, host of the afternoon news show on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee, noted that some Republicans prefer a more conservative nominee in 2012 and asked Thompson if he is conservative enough. Thompson said yes. Mercure then asked: "What do you say to those critics that say that you're not?" Cue the riff. "Ninety-one times I cut taxes; 91 times," Thompson replied. "Three times, income taxes. Eliminated the inheritance taxes, eliminated the gift taxes. Gave the people of this state $2.1 billion in property tax (relief) -- and never raised taxes. If you want a conservative, follow me." We’ve rated Mostly True Thompson’s claim that Wisconsin’s overall tax burden went down while he served as governor from 1987 to 2001. As we said in that item, tax burden is a broad measure: "Tax burden" takes those total collections -- including property, income, sales, corporate and other taxes -- and divides them into all personal income earned in the state. It does not reflect what every individual experienced; it’s a composite measure of the composite statewide tax bite, or burden. The "burden" measurement is considered the gold standard for measuring tax impact. But in saying he never raised any taxes, Thompson raised the bar awfully high, so we decided to take a look. Darrin Schmitz, Thompson’s campaign spokesman, told us Thompson "was referring to Wisconsin’s general taxes: income, sales, property and corporate taxes." But that’s an attempt to lower the bar. Thompson did not qualify the statement when he made it. In fact, he listed a variety of taxes. With a little research we found examples of taxes Thompson raised -- including some of the ones his campaign mentioned as not being raised. General taxes: The 1995-1997 state budget contained $63 million in tax increases -- including boosts in the general tax increases Thompson cited, according to the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the neutral scorekeeper that tallies tax hikes and tax cuts. The budget projected an increase of $17.5 million in sales tax revenue over the two-year period by eliminating an exemption for certain office equipment. And eliminating an exemption for certain health care providers raised corporate income taxes by a projected $900,000. (That budget also raised fees by $120 million over two years.) The 1997-1999 budget contained $125 million in tax increases, the fiscal bureau said. That included an increase of $36 million in sales tax revenue over two years by imposing a "use tax" on catalog sales. Cigarettes: The cigarette tax was 25 cents per pack when Thompson took office. It was raised four times during his tenure and was 59 cents when he left to join President George W. Bush’s administration. (The tax is now $2.52.) Gasoline: The gas tax rose to 18 cents per gallon shortly after Thompson took office, based on a law adopted before he took office, and rose by more than 8 cents to 26.4 cents before he left. (It’s now 30.9 cents.) Twelve of the 14 gas-tax increases under Thompson were automatic annual adjustments, which occurred because of the previous law. But Thompson did not take action to stop the automatic increases and two of the increases -- which totaled 3 of the 8 cents -- were raised by budgets adopted during his tenure. That’s not an exhaustive list, but it provides enough for the claim at hand. Our rating Thompson stated flatly that as governor, he "never raised taxes."

pomt-08178	"[Georgia] Republicans have mismanaged unemployment benefits."	false	/georgia/statements/2010/nov/30/democratic-party-georgia-georgia/state-republicans-blame-unemployment-benefit-gap/	When Channel 2 Action News recently reported that the state of Georgia has borrowed several hundred million dollars to pay unemployment benefits, state Democratic Party leaders knew who to blame. "[Georgia] Republicans have mismanaged unemployment benefits and now might have to cut them or hike taxes on small businesses," the party wrote in a Nov. 18 message on its Facebook page. Some intrepid AJC PolitiFact Georgia readers (disgruntled Democratic politicos, party officials say) alerted us to the posting and asked us to investigate. The claim took us by surprise since the man in charge of unemployment benefits, Georgia Labor Commissioner Michael Thurmond, is a Democrat. One of those critics, Andre Walker, objected to the Democratic Party's claim on his website, Georgia Unfiltered. Walker said the Republican-led state Legislature allocated about $47 million a year between 2006 and 2008 for unemployment benefits. In 2009, the total rose to $60 million. Earlier this year, the Legislature approved $56 million. Walker also noted that Thurmond is a Democrat. "Where's the mismanagement?" Walker asked in his blog. The state Labor Department said the Legislature does not allocate funding for unemployment benefits. Those funds, the department said, come from taxes paid by Georgia employers. To sort this all out, let's begin by looking at how the Georgia unemployment program works. Businesses in Georgia pay into a state fund that the Labor Department uses to pay unemployment when workers are laid off or terminated through no fault of their own. In 1998, Georgia had $1.9 billion in the fund, said Brock Timmons, chief of the Labor Department's employment insurance legal section. In 2003 and 2004, the state paid out about $722 million a year from the fund, Timmons said. In 2009, at the height of the Great Recession, Georgia paid $1.47 billion in unemployment benefits. Georgia's unemployment rate has been above the national average in recent years. It is currently at 9.9 percent; the national average is 9.6 percent. "It took us by surprise," Timmons said of the rising unemployment. Some employers, as a result of the tax cuts that took effect between 2000 and 2003, paid little or no money to the unemployment fund. The percentage Georgia employers paid in the fund increased by 15 percent in 2009 and by 13 percent in 2010. State officials say Georgia has received advances totaling $454.5 million from the federal government. Georgia must pay back the money but has not set up a timetable to do so. Timmons said Georgia employers could pay more in federal unemployment taxes if the loan isn't repaid by November 2011. Georgia Democratic Party spokesman Eric Gray told us the Facebook message could have been more precise. He posted a column on Georgia Politico explaining the party's point. The column says state GOP leaders did not make the "tough choices" necessary to avert this problem when the recession hit. The column does not say what the "tough choices" were. "With the unemployment fund nearly broke, they reluctantly accepted stimulus money from the federal government to replenish the unemployment fund. This bought them time to address the problem," the column says. "Yet Republicans stuck with what they are good at -- ignoring it even more." The column does not specify what state leaders should have done to avoid the current problem of borrowing money from the federal government. The funds are still managed by the state Labor Department, which is run by a Democrat, not a Republican. Democratic Party officials say they should have been more precise in their description of the problem on Facebook. We agree. We rate it as False.

It didn’t take long for jokes to waft onto social media. One of the most popular of these was an Oct. 18 article headlined, "Canada Pays Off Entire Federal Debt One Day After Marijuana Legalization." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While some sites did not clearly make the distinction, the story originated on a Canadian publication called the Daily Bonnet, which is open about being a satire site. Here’s a portion of the article: "Less than 24 hours after cannabis became legal in Canada, the federal government announced they had made so much money in tax revenue from the sale of legal weed that they were able to pay off the country’s entire $650 billion debt. " ‘I told you so,’ said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, looking considerably less handsome than usual with his blood-shot eyes. ‘It’s remarkable! You’re crippled with debt one day and the next it’s all vanished into thin air. It’s just one more thing that makes Canada the great country that it is!’ " Millions of Canadians potheads lined up outside their local marijuana shops to legally purchase weed and pay their taxes for the first time. "It’s like the 60s all over again! But this time the government likes us!" said one Ottawa man, who purchased three hash brownies and a half dozen joints. "Who would have thought getting stoned would have such a beneficial impact on the Canadian economy! This is better than the oil sands!" "The Daily Bonnet "is a Mennonite satirical news site from the heart of the Bible belt, Steinbach, Manitoba," the site’s "about us" page says.

Pitching his case, Nofziger is quoted in the just-published "Voters Guide" from the League of Women Voters of the Austin Area: "Currently, there is no one from South Austin on the (Austin City) Council!" We left a message for Nofziger, a council member from mid-1987 to mid-1996, then re-read a Jan. 23 Austin American-Statesman news article supporting his claim. The story revealed Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell’s desire to seek a voter-approved reorganization of the council resulting in six members elected from regional districts plus two members and the mayor elected citywide. Currently, the story said, "three council members live in or near downtown, two live in East Austin, one lives in Hyde Park, and Leffingwell lives northwest." And, the story continues: "None lives south" of the Colorado River, which separates South Austin from the rest of the city. Next, we contacted Matt Curtis, the mayor’s communications director, who told us no one has moved since that article was published. Curtis said Leffingwell lives in the Balcones Drive part of West Austin and among other council members, Sheryl Cole lives in Wilshire Woods, Laura Morrison resides in Old West Austin, Chris Riley is downtown, Randy Shade lives in Clarksville and Bill Spelman hails from Hyde Park. Council Member Mike Martinez told us he lives in the Senate Hills part of East Austin, but plans to move later this year to East 11th Street near Chicon. Curtis said the latest South Austinites on the council, Betty Dunkerley and Jennifer Kim, finished their terms in June 2008. As we closed this check, Nofziger called to say he’d originally heard from local activists that the council now lacks South Austin residents. We rate his statement True.

pomt-05207	Says "Tommy Thompson's tax plan amounts to an average tax cut of almost $87,000 for the top 1 percent."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/10/tammy-baldwin/tammy-baldwin-says-tommy-thompsons-tax-plan-would-/	If you haven’t heard U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, say she is fighting for the middle class in her bid for the U.S. Senate, you haven’t been listening. But you can be forgiven. The gubernatorial recall all but filled Wisconsin’s political bandwidth until the election was held June 5, 2012. Now, more attention will turn to Baldwin and the four Republicans seeking to succeed Democrat Herb Kohl in the November 2012 Senate election. Baldwin sounded the middle class theme in attacking the best known GOP candidate, former governor Tommy Thompson, in a memo released to the media May 30, 2012. She declared: "Thompson’s tax plan amounts to an average tax cut of almost $87,000 for the top 1 percent." The 1 percent are people with incomes over $343,000, according to the memo. Sounds like a good deal for them. But is Baldwin on target? Baldwin’s evidence Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus said Baldwin's is based on a flat tax provision in a tax reform plan that Thompson released in April 2012. Two paragraphs in the four-page document are devoted to the flat tax. For two years, individual taxpayers could opt to file a tax return with a 15 percent rate, or file a return using existing exemptions. After two years, Thompson "would move to an across-the board flat tax with provisions to encourage savings, investment, home ownership and support for charities," the plan says. Here’s the Baldwin math: In 2009, according to the latest figures available from the Internal Revenue Service, the top 1 percent of federal income tax returns amounts to nearly 1.38 million people. They all earned more than $343,927. That group generated just over $1.32 trillion in adjusted gross income, which resulted in a total of just over $318 billion in income taxes paid. Had a 15 percent flat rate been in effect, the "1 percent" would have paid $198.7 billion in taxes or $119.3 billion less, under Thompson’s plan. That means those taxpayers would have paid an average of $86,502 less in income taxes. Thompson campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir noted that tax rates ranged from 10 percent to 35 percent in 2009 (as they do now). He said Thompson’s plan "better balances the nearly half of all Americans that don’t pay income taxes against the nation’s top 1 percent of earners, who pay 37 percent of the income taxes collected." As for Baldwin’s figures, he said her analysis "seems sufficient." While Thompson's proposal lacks enough detail for analysis, the Tax Policy Center evaluated the more detailed 15 percent flat tax plan advanced by Newt Gingrich during his 2012 run for the Republican presidential nomination. The center concluded that no one, regardless of income, would see a tax increase under Gingrich's plan. Under one scenario, which divided all taxpayers into five groups based on income, all five groups would get a tax cut under Gingrich's plan. So, it’s likely Thompson’s plan would benefit many more groups than the 1 percent cited by Baldwin, who is using that approach to bolster her underlying point. As for the specifics of Baldwin's claim, we ran her numbers by three tax experts: Tax Policy Center senior fellow Roberton Williams and Tax Foundation economist Mark Robyn, both in Washington, D.C.; and Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance president Todd Berry in Madison. All three said Baldwin is generally on target, but that Thompson’s plan is too short on details to know for sure whether Baldwin’s $87,000 figure is on the money. Williams said Baldwin’s numbers, on their face, are accurate. "It’s a back-of-the-envelope calculation, that’s what it is," said Robyn. Robyn and Berry agreed the 1 percent would almost certainly get a tax break under Thompson’s plan, but they couldn’t say whether Baldwin’s figure is accurate because Thompson’s plan doesn’t specify what deductions and exemptions might remain under his flat tax and who would qualify for them. "Her calculations are probably overstated a little, but we don’t know how much," said Berry. Our rating Baldwin said Thompson's tax plan "amounts to an average tax cut of almost $87,000 for the top 1 percent" and Thompson didn’t refute the figure. Tax experts said Baldwin’s figure is in the ballpark, at least as an estimate, but that Thompson’s flat tax proposal lacks too much detail to know for sure. Baldwin’s claim is accurate but needs additional information -- our definition of Mostly True.	None	Tammy Baldwin	None	None	None	2012-06-10T09:00:00	2012-05-30	['Tommy_Thompson']

pomt-14077	"Puerto Rico’s $70 billion debt is unsustainable and it is unpayable. And the reason why it is unsustainable has everything to do with the greed of Wall Street vulture funds."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/19/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-links-puerto-ricos-debt-crisis-wall/	Bernie Sanders condemned Wall Street for creating and now profiting off Puerto Rico’s debt crisis during a campaign stop on the island. Puerto Rico is currently $72 billion in debt and, in the words of its governor, in "a death spiral." Unlike other states and cities, it cannot legally declare bankruptcy. So Sanders called for the Federal Reserve to help the U.S. territory out, just as it bailed out the financial sector responsible for imperilling 3.5 million Puerto Ricans in the first place. "I think all of us understand and your government understands that Puerto Rico’s $70 billion debt is unsustainable and it is unpayable," Sanders said May 16 at a town hall in San Juan. "And the reason why it is unsustainable has everything to do with the greed of Wall Street vulture funds." So is Wall Street to blame for the island’s economic woes? Sanders has a point that hedge funds and banks are certainly exacerbating the situation and, in some cases, attempting to block a solution. However, experts told us and the research shows that Puerto Rico has been accumulating debt long before Wall Street got involved. Origins of the debt This $72 billion debt did not appear solely thanks to the maneuvers of Wall Street. Rather, it’s been building up for decades, resulting from a combination of U.S. policy, local mismanagement and economic decline. The local government has essentially maxed out a very special credit card given to it and other U.S. territories. When the island became a commonwealth in 1917, Congress also made bonds issued by the Puerto Rican government "triple tax-exempt" (meaning they can’t be taxed at the federal, state or local level) and thus very attractive to investors. For decades, this allowed the government to overspend, in part out of necessity and in part out of sheer irresponsibility. Puerto Rico has had to pick up a disportionate chunk of the tab for federal social programs. More than 60 percent of its residents receive Medicare or Medicaid, but federal funding is considerably lower than the states. (For example, $3 billion for Oklahoma’s Medicaid program and $3.6 billion for Mississippi’s compared to $373 million for the island, a fraction of its $2.9 billion in expenses.) Disparities in funding aside, the local government has also made some poor management and spending decisions. Inefficient public utilities have been running up the tab since the 1940s and now account for the largest portion of Puerto Rico’s debt ($20 billion). Meanwhile, the state-run power authority continues to dole out free electricity. Similarly, public employees enjoy "lavish pension benefits" like holiday bonuses and loans for international travel but the pensions remain severely underfunded ($1.9 billion in assets versus $45.5 billion in liabilities). Now add in changes in federal policy, economic depression and population decline and you’ve got a recipe for even less revenue and total debt unsustainability. For decades, U.S. businesses operating in Puerto Rico received significant tax breaks, an economic boon for the island. But that all ended in 1996, when President Bill Clinton signed legislation phasing out the incentives over 10 years. By 2006, Puerto Rico was already $43 billion in debt and fell into a recession that, compounded by the global financial crisis, continues to this day. Marc Joffe, the principal consultant at Public Sector Credit Solutions, tracked Puerto Rico’s debt from 1910 to 2015. Here’s a chart we made using his data: Wall Street’s role The island was already knee-deep in debt by the time the financial industry got involved, but Wall Street is certainly profiting off of the situation. According to Sanders in his San Juan address and his campaign, hedge funds now hold about 50 percent of Puerto Rico’s debt. This is the high end of estimates we found, which range from 20 percent to 50 percent. But this is a relatively recent development. Prior to 2014, most of Puerto Rico’s bonds were owned by traditional mutual funds and retail investors, according to Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations who previously worked in the Obama administration's Treasury Department. Morningstar, the research investment firm, estimated that some 180 mutual funds had Puerto Rican bonds in their portfolios in 2013. In 2014, multiple credit ratings agencies downgraded Puerto Rico’s bonds to junk status. Because of the high risk associated with this low grade, most traditional investors were unable or unwilling to invest. Enter Wall Street. Hedge funds and other non-traditional buyers "eyeing fat yields and possible trading gains" purchased $3.5 billion worth of junk bonds at a tax-free interest rate of just under 9 percent (the high rate reflecting the high risk). As Puerto Rico’s debt had already topped $70 billion in 2013, $3.5 billion wouldn’t have made much of a difference. "The combination of Puerto Rico’s decision (to sell more bonds) and the availability of Wall Street financing helped Puerto Rico dig itself into a bigger hole," said Setser. In fact, if the hedge funds hadn’t purchased these bonds, which were after all issued to pay off old debt, "the crisis would have come a little earlier since the level of debt was already unsustainable," said Joffe of Public Sector Credit Solutions. That being said, Wall Street should be held accountable for its opportunism as some hedge funds and banks have certainly chosen to take advantage of the situation, said Rafael Fantauzzi of the National Puerto Rican Coalition. Since 2014, hedge funds have been buying up bonds on the cheap in the secondary market (those previously owned by traditional investors). Sanders’ campaign provided PolitiFact an example of bonds bought for 29 cents on the dollar yielding an interest of 34 percent. Bloomberg has reported yields ranging from under 10 percent to as high as 80 percent. Sanders in his San Juan speech and his campaign also noted that banks like Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and UBS have received hundreds of millions of dollars in fees to manage the island’s bond sales. The exact figure, according to the Wall Street Journal, is $1.4 billion for $61 billion worth of bond sales since 2006. That’s the equivalent of a service charge of 2.3 percent, double the average rate for municipal bond sales but quadruple the rate for corporate bond sales. Exacerbating the situation The most damning evidence for "the greed of vulture funds" is Wall Street’s efforts to prevent Puerto Rico from digging itself out of the hole. As we’ve previously reported, Puerto Rico is legally unable to declare Chapter 9 bankruptcy. But there is currently legislation in motion to allow the island to restructure the debt. The Sanders campaign forwarded us a New York Times report of a letter representatives of BlueMountain, a hedge fund that holds Puerto Rican bonds, sent to Republican staff members urging against allowing debt restructuring. The Center for Individual Freedom, a dark money group, has also spent $2 million on issue ads against debt relief efforts in Congress, supporting the hedge funds’ position. "That’s very concerning that financial interests, specially these so-called ‘vulture funds,’ are disrupting the political process and preventing Puerto Rico having a smoother landing in this situation they got themselves into," said Joffe, adding that that’s what they did in Argentina as well. In lieu of debt restructuring, Wall Street recommends cutting spending. A report commissioned by 34 hedge funds advises Puerto Rico to raise taxes, lay off teachers, close schools, and cut wages and worker benefits, Medicaid, and welfare. (About 45.4 percent of Puerto Ricans live below the poverty line and the commonwealth already closed 150 schools in the last five years and increased its sales tax.) So while the hedge funds and banks "have played a relatively modest role in creating the need for a comprehensive debt solution," said Setser, they are "playing a more important role in hindering a bipartisan solution." Our ruling Sanders said, "Puerto Rico’s $70 billion debt is unsustainable and it is unpayable. And the reason why it is unsustainable has everything to do with the greed of Wall Street vulture funds." Puerto Rico’s debt was already unsustainable by the time Wall Street hedge funds and banks began playing a role as a result of decades of local mismanagement, U.S. policy and economic misfortune. But Sanders has a point that the financial sector has taken advantage of and is excerbating the situation. What's more, they're effectively preventing crisis relief by actively working to stop Puerto Rico from restructuring its debt.

pomt-03835	"There is no clinical evidence that vaccinating healthcare workers protects patients."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2013/mar/17/service-employees-international-union-committee-po/seiu-district-1199-says-theres-no-clinical-evidenc/	The Rhode Island Department of Health and a union representing health-care workers in hospitals and nursing homes recently set aside their court dispute over state regulations requiring that the workers get flu immunizations. The Department of Health required health-care workers to get immunized or, if they refused, to wear surgical masks when having contact with patients, in an effort to help reduce the spread of flu to patients. The SEIU Healthcare Employees Union, District 1199, in a suit filed in December, argued that the regulations violated due-process and collective-bargaining rights. The union withdrew its suit as the flu season was winding down, saying it hoped to reach a compromise with the health department. A March 5 Providence Journal story on the dispute prompted us to look at the union’s complaint, where we found this claim: "There is no clinical evidence that vaccinating healthcare workers protects patients." The debate over whether to mandate vaccinations for employees has been going on nationally for years. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated, from a survey it did, that across the health-care worker population, including doctors, nurses and others, 66.9 percent of workers were vaccinated for the 2011-12 flu season. Several national health agencies, including the CDC and the American Medical Association, strongly recommend that all health-care employees get vaccinated. We wondered whether there really was no evidence that vaccinating health-care workers protects patients. We quickly found several relevant, peer-reviewed studies that indicated otherwise, though their findings were not uniformly the same and methodologies differed. One was done by researchers at the Institute of Virology at the University of Glasgow and published in 2000 in The Lancet, one of the most respected medical journals in the world. The study, which looked at health-care workers in 20 long-term elderly care hospitals in Scotland, concluded that vaccinations of health-care workers "was associated with a substantial decrease in" death among patients but that surveillance of those involved in the study "showed no associated decrease in non-fatal influenza infection in patients." Another study, published in BMJ, formerly known as the British Medical Journal, was conducted at a chain of nursing homes in England. It said it found decreases both in deaths of nursing home residents and in "influenza-like illness" when more workers were vaccinated during the winter of 2003-04. And a study published in the journal Vaccine in 2009 used computer modeling to simulate a flu outbreak. Its authors, four researchers from the Netherlands, said their model showed that health-care employee vaccinations reduce flu transmission. We contacted the union to ask for data supporting its position and ultimately heard by e-mail from Bill Borwegen, the occupational health and safety national director for the SEIU in Washington, D.C. "From a common sense standpoint, it would certainly seem to be a "no-brainer," Borwegen said of vaccinating health-care workers to prevent flu transmission to patients. "However there have been three systematic reviews of all of the epidemiological evidence ... and they have all concluded remarkably that there is no clinically proven connection." Borwegen added that "of course we all should strongly promote voluntary flu vaccination for self-protection, but we also need to understand the limitations of the current vaccine." He sent us links to three studies. One largely focused on the effectiveness of the vaccine generally and not on health-care workers. But the other two were more relevant to the union’s claim. The most on point was a review published in 2010 by the Cochrane Collaboration, an organization of international experts that reviews medical research. The Collaboration reviewed studies of whether vaccinating health-care workers protects elderly patients, including those that PolitiFact Rhode Island had reviewed. Its review cited problems or inconsistencies with the studies and concluded that vaccinating health-care workers who care for the elderly "did not show any effect on the specific outcomes of interest, namely laboratory proven inﬂuenza, pneumonia or deaths from pneumonia" among the patients. However, it said vaccinations did have an effect on influenza-like illnesses, hospital admissions and "overall mortality of the elderly." The third study referenced the Cochrane findings and said there was a "paucity of evidence" to support mandatory vaccinations. But one of the three authors of the Cochrane review -- Dr. Roger Thomas of the University of Calgary -- was quoted in the New York Times "Well" blog as saying: "Not having evidence doesn’t prove it doesn’t work; we just don’t know." It’s also worth noting that there is debate over the effectiveness of current flu vaccines. For example, an October 2012 study by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, at the University of Minnesota, asserted that coming up with more effective flu vaccine should be a priority. Our ruling SEIU Healthcare Employees Union, District 1199, said in its lawsuit that "there is no clinical evidence that vaccinating healthcare workers protects patients." That’s an unequivocal statement. But in fact, researchers found such evidence and published their findings in peer-reviewed studies in respected medical journals. The fact that other researchers disputed the evidence doesn’t mean the evidence doesn’t exist. We’ll leave it to the scientists to fight over how conclusive the evidence is. But our judges rule this claim False. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-12257	The GOP health care proposal would slash more than $135 million in federal funding available to PA schools.	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/jul/11/bob-casey/trumpcare-fight-casey-overstates-gops-potential-me/	U.S. Sen. Bob Casey says the Senate GOP’s healthcare plan could devastate already cash-strapped public schools that receive Medicaid reimbursements for programs benefiting poor children and students with disabilities. Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat who has been outspoken on social media against the Senate GOP plan, tweeted last week: "The GOP health care proposal would slash more than $135 million in federal funding available to PA schools." But Casey didn’t specify in the tweet where that number came from, and Republican officials say their bill doesn’t target vulnerable populations like children with disabilities. So what’s the deal? First, a little background on the Medicaid funding that schools receive. Since 1988, schools can register with the federal government as Medicaid providers and receive reimbursements, similar to hospitals. For the last 30 years, Medicaid reimbursements subsidized primary or preventive services at schools — think hearing and vision tests — for children already covered by Medicaid under the School Based ACCESS Program. It’s also been used to fund special education and services to children with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or IDEA. Now, as the Senate GOP is floating its healthcare plan (A.K.A. the Better Care Reconciliation Act), some school administrators and advocacy groups say they’re concerned cuts to Medicaid could impact their ability to provide services to both children living in poverty and children with disabilities. About $4 billion in Medicaid funding goes to schools annually. Under the GOP’s most recent plan, Medicaid spending would be 26 percent lower in 2026 than it would be under the agency’s extended baseline, and the gap would widen to about 35 percent in 2036, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO estimated that overall Medicaid spending would drop by $772 billion between 2017 and 2026 under the BCRA. The vast majority of that reduction, per the CBO, would come from three key provisions: The repeal of the individual mandate, a reduction in the federal matching rate for adults covered by Medicaid after it was expanded under the Affordable Care Act and a per capita cap on Medicaid payments beginning in 2020. This reduction in Medicaid spending is likely to push more financial responsibility onto states and municipalities in the coming decade, should the bill become law as is. In a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-KY, and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-NY, the School Superintendents Association and dozens of related groups wrote: "Under the per-capita caps included in the BCRA, health care will be rationed and schools will be forced to compete with other critical health care providers — hospitals, physicians, and clinics — that serve Medicaid-eligible children." So now we come back to Casey, who claimed in a tweet that the GOP’s healthcare plan would "slash more than $135 million in federal funding available to PA schools." Casey’s spokeswoman Jacklin Rhoads said the figure came from the Department of Health and Human Services, and provided a spreadsheet that indicated how much each Pennsylvania school district received from Medicaid in the 2014-15 fiscal year. For example, the School District of Philadelphia, which has an annual budget of about $2.5 billion, received about $10.9 million that year in total reimbursement for direct claims and administration. In total in fiscal year 2014-15, Pennsylvania schools received about $134.5 million, according to the figures provided by Casey’s office. That’s the key figure referred to in the tweet. In the same document was a second column titled: "How much money would be lost from a 30 percent cut." That column indicates Pennsylvania schools could stand to lose $40.3 million per year, with the School District of Philadelphia losing about $3.3 million, or less than 0.2 percent of its total budget. (The District largely declined to comment, though a spokesman said officials are "monitoring the proposed legislation and will assess the impact when there is a final version for consideration.") The 30 percent figure cited by Casey's office came from a report published by the School Superintendents Association. Here's their rationale from the report: "Republicans have expressed a desire to reduce federal Medicaid spending by 25 percent by distributing Medicaid funding through a block-grant or a per-capita cap, which would shift costs to states. However, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that the block grant like the one proposed in the House 2017 budget would cut Medicaid spending by $1 trillion over a decade, which would be the equivalent in 2026 of cutting away one-third of the program’s budget. Other estimates include a proposed cut closer to 30 percent or 35 percent in the long-term since it encompasses a 25 percent cut over 10 years on top of the cuts that would occur with the repeal of the Affordable Care Act." The report was released in January, several months before the Senate GOP unveiled its healthcare plan. Our ruling In a tweet, U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat, said: "The GOP health care proposal would slash more than $135 million in federal funding available to PA schools." His office pointed to data that indicated schools in the state received a total of $134.5 million in the 2014-15 fiscal year in Medicaid reimbursements for School Based ACCESS services. First off, $134.5 million is not "more than" $135 million. Beyond that, Casey’s tweet implies all $135 million in Medicaid reimbursements to schools would be cut under the GOP healthcare plan. But there is no provision in the GOP healthcare bill that specifically cuts Medicaid funding to schools. Overall, the CBO estimates Medicaid spending would decrease by about 26 percent by 2026, meaning a statewide cut of $35.1 million to schools might have been a more reasonable estimate. But even that cut wouldn’t be guaranteed under this plan and would occur if states chose to reduce Medicaid reimbursements to school districts because of cuts in funding from the federal government.

pomt-07412	After the U.S.-led military alliance ejected Saddam Hussein’s forces from Kuwait in 1991, the Kuwaitis "never paid us."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/27/donald-trump/donal-trump-says-kuwait-never-paid-us-back-ousting/	During an April 27, 2011, news conference in Portsmouth, N.H., Donald Trump -- the businessman and potential Republican presidential candidate -- was asked what he would do differently from President Barack Obama. "What I would do differently is come down really hard on OPEC," Trump said, referring to the cartel of oil-producing states, including many in the Middle East, which are behind the recent rise in gasoline prices. "If you look at these nations, they wouldn't be there except for us. You take a look at Kuwait. I mean, we handed Kuwait back to the people that right now essentially own Kuwait, because it's really ownership more than anything else. We handed it back. They never paid us." Trump was referring to the Persian Gulf War in 1991, when a U.S.-led military alliance drove Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait after the Iraqi dictator invaded the small, wealthy, oil-producing emirate. Is it really true that Kuwait didn’t bother paying us back after we bailed them out? Not at all. We turned to the final report on the war presented to Congress in 1992. According to the report, the U.S. was on the hook for the cost of more than 500,000 U.S. troops and associated equipment beyond what the military would have had to pay for ordinary, non-war activities. But rather than shouldering this burden alone, the administration of President George H.W. Bush secured financial pledges from fellow coalition members. The report says that these war costs, known as "incremental costs," were estimated to be $61 billion. In 1990 and 1991, coalition nations committed almost $54 billion to offset that cost -- roughly two-thirds from Persian Gulf states directly threatened by the invasion and one-third from other countries, largely Japan and Germany. By March 11, 1992, the United States had received nearly all of the money that had been pledged. Here’s a breakdown, in descending order by pledge size, according to a report to Congress: Saudi Arabia: $16.8 billion pledged, $12.0 billion paid in cash, $4.0 billion paid in kind. Total paid: $16.0 billion Kuwait: $16.1 billion pledged, $16.015 billion paid in cash, $43 million paid in kind. Total paid: $16.1 billion Japan: $10.0 billion pledged, $9.4 billion paid in cash, $571 million paid in kind. Total paid: $10.0 billion Germany: $6.6 billion pledged, $5.8 billion paid in cash, $683 million paid in kind. Total paid: $6.5 billion United Arab Emirates: $4.1 billion pledged, $3.9 billion paid in cash, $218 million paid in kind. Total paid: $4.1 billion South Korea: $355 million pledged, $150 million paid in cash, $101 million paid in kind. Total paid: $251 million Total reimbursements: $54 billion pledged, $47.3 billion paid in cash, $5.6 billion paid in kind. Total paid: $52.9 billion A final accounting published a decade later by the House Budget Committee’s Democratic staff found that the final reimbursements eventually crept up slightly, to $54.1 billion. Of that, $48.4 billion was in cash, and $5.7 billion was in kind. So Trump was flat wrong that Kuwait "never paid us." When the books were closed on the war, the United States found itself out of pocket by about $7 billion -- less than half of the $16 billion shelled out by the Kuwaitis.

pomt-10386	"Obama has maintained a friendship with a now convicted felon."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/18/republican-national-committee-republican/friends-perhaps-but-out-of-touch/	Less than an hour after Antoin "Tony" Rezko's June 4, 2008, conviction on federal charges of fraud and money laundering, the Republican National Committee fired off a news release titled "Rezko: Obama's Longtime Friend and Money Man." The first line reads: "Obama has maintained a friendship with a now convicted felon." There is no question Rezko was a longtime friend of Sen. Barack Obama's. In a lengthy interview with the Chicago Sun-Times published March 15, 2008, Obama detailed a relationship that dated back to when Obama was finishing law school at Harvard and Rezko approached him about coming to work for his development company. Obama declined. He got to know Rezko, he said, when Obama's law work overlapped occasionally with Rezko's development business. But the two became friends when Obama made his first run for Illinois state Senate. Rezko was a key supporter and fundraiser for Obama. "So we became friendly at that point, and through most of my years in the Senate, he was somebody I considered a friend, and I'd probably see maybe when I wasn't in the midst of a campaign, I would probably see maybe six times a year," Obama said. "We'd have lunch or we'd have breakfast." Obama and his wife, Michelle, had dinners with Rezko and his wife a couple times, Obama said, and they once visited the Rezkos' home at Lake Geneva, in Wisconsin, for the day. When Obama ran for U.S. Senate in 2004, Rezko served on his finance committee and was a significant fundraiser. Rezko even hosted a fundraising event in his home. In the wake of Rezko's October 2006 indictment, the Obama campaign took all campaign contributions tied to Rezko — $160,000 as of January 2008 — and donated them to charity. Although the GOP's support material for its claim that Obama "has maintained a friendship" with Rezko relates much of this prior relationship, the words "has maintained" suggests that Obama has an ongoing friendship with Rezko. In the March interview with the Chicago Sun-Times, Obama said he had not spoken to Rezko since the indictment. Obama was asked if he still considered Rezko a friend. "Yes, with the caveat that obviously if it turns out that the allegations are true, then he's not who I thought he was, and I'd be very disappointed with that," Obama said. In a statement issued after the verdict, Obama said he was "saddened" by Rezko's conviction. "This isn't the Tony Rezko I knew," he stated. Obama said that if elected president, he would not pardon Rezko for his corruption convictions or reduce his prison time. (Rezko is in federal custody pending his Sept. 3, 2008, sentencing.) Any implication that Obama continues to maintain a friendship with Rezko — getting together, even speaking on the phone — is misleading. But the GOP says it only meant that Obama had, in the past, maintained a friendship with Rezko — which he certainly did. And "maintained a friendship" is a bit ambiguous as well. Obama said in March he hadn't spoken to Rezko in more than a year, and it's a safe bet the two won't be kicking back at a sports bar any time soon. But still, even in March, Obama said he still considered Rezko a friend. We rate the GOP statement Mostly True.

pomt-09145	The final pitch of Don Larsen's perfect game in the 1956 World Series "was a foot and half probably high and outside."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/11/george-will/george-will-says-final-pitch-don-larsen-1956-was-f/	At PolitiFact, we try to fact-check statements about serious topics like war and peace, the economy and health care policy. But we also think it's important to take the occasional detour. George Will, the syndicated columnist who's a regular roundtable member on ABC's This Week, gave us such an opportunity. To close out the show's roundtable segment on June 6, 2010, This Week host Jake Tapper brought up Detroit Tigers pitcher Armando Galarraga's near-perfect game on June 2, 2010, which fell apart when umpire Jim Joyce blew a call at first base. Joyce later acknowledged that he should have called the runner out, which would have cemented the perfect game, and baseball fans argued passionately over whether Commissioner Bud Selig should have overruled Joyce's call retroactively. (Selig decided to let the call, and the not-quite-perfect game, stand.) Will -- a bestselling author on baseball and one of the game's most prominent fans -- took Tapper's bait as if it were a hanging curve ball. Will argued that Joyce's incorrect call should stand, arguing, among other things, that the sterling sportsmanship displayed by Galarraga, Joyce and the other players after the mistake amounted to a far richer gift to the game and its fans than recording another perfect game. As evidence of how the sport can overcome bad calls, Will cited the final pitch of New York Yankees pitcher Don Larsen's legendary 1956 perfect game during the World Series -- the only one ever thrown in more than a century of World Series games. Will characterized umpire Babe Pinelli's call of a third strike on Brooklyn Dodgers pinch hitter Dale Mitchell as clearly incorrect, even suggesting that Pinelli rushed the game to a conclusion in order to preserve the perfect game. Yet Will concluded that baseball has survived quite nicely despite Pinelli's error. "In the most important perfect game ever pitched -- 1956, Don Larsen in the World Series -- the 27th out was made by Dale Mitchell," Will said. "A wonderful batter's eye he had. He struck out 119 times in 4,000 Major League at-bats. The umpire (Pinelli) -- it was his last game, by the way -- called strike three on Dale Mitchell. It was a foot and half probably high and outside. He was so eager to get the game over." A foot and a half outside the strike zone seemed to us like a pretty badly blown call. We thought it would be worth checking to see if Will was correct in how he described Pinelli's call. Will would have been 15 at the time of the 1956 World Series, and we wondered if he had a seat behind the batter's box that day, or maybe watched the pitch on one of those primitive black-and-white televisions of the era. Had he reviewed a video of the game? We sought comment from the noted columnist, some explanation of how he would know so precisely the way the ball strayed from the strike zone, but he and his staff did not provide a comment. Let's note that Will is correct about Mitchell's career statistics -- he struck out only 119 times in 3,984 at bats -- but did not mention that Mitchell was at the end of his career, with some baseball experts saying he'd lost a step. Mitchell's plate appearance against Larsen was the second-to-last of his career, and he batted just .204 (11-for-54) during the 1956 regular season and went hitless in four at-bats in the World Series. "This was not Dale Mitchell in his prime," said Gabriel Schechter, a research associate at the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown. "I think it would be fair to say that his reflexes had slowed down, making it tougher for him to react to borderline pitches." We should also note that Will was not quite correct about this game being Pinelli's last. The perfect game was indeed Pinelli's last game behind home plate, but he finished out the rest of the World Series as a field umpire. Now for the big question: Was Larsen's final pitch really "a foot and a half" high and outside? First, we'll relate the case for Will. Lew Paper -- a Washington attorney who wrote the book "Perfect: Don Larsen's Miraculous World Series Game and the Men Who Made It Happen" -- told PolitiFact that "every Yankee on the field who could see the last pitch to Mitchell, other than Larsen and (catcher Yogi) Berra, said that it was clearly outside the strike zone." In his book, Paper relates that Hall of Fame outfielder Mickey Mantle later said that he had "a clear view from center field, and if I was under oath, I'd have to say that the pitch looked like it was outside." From third base, Andy Carey thought the pitch was "high," while Yankees shortstop Gil McDougald said, "It wasn't even close. It was high." Because these comments are consistent, and because they go against their teammate Larsen's interest, they carry some weight. In addition, Duke Snider, the Dodgers Hall of Fame outfielder, told Paper that in a conversation he had with Babe Pinelli years after the perfect game, the umpire said he'd wanted to go out with a perfect game and that any pitch close to the strike zone would be called a strike. If Snider reported Pinelli's quote accurately, then it's certainly possible to believe that the umpire may have bent the strike zone in this unusual situation. But none of this proves that Pinelli's call was as flagrantly out of the strike zone as Will suggests Indeed, most experts we interviewed agreed that the pitch was borderline. While most said it was likely outside the strike zone, we didn't find much support for the idea that Larsen's pitch was a foot and a half outside of it. Most said Pinelli's was a defensible judgment call -- which, if true, would reduce its value as a point of comparison for the Galarraga incident. Referring to the widely seen video clip of the final pitch, Steven Goldman, a contributing editor with Baseball Prospectus, describes the ball as "tailing away" from Mitchell -- enough that Berra had to "lean pretty far outside" to catch it. He said that Will's description was "broadly accurate" but also "a bit hyperbolic." We watched that video over and over, and couldn't quite discern a ball on the screen. It was like watching mimes pretend to play baseball, but we're not the experts. "If it was not a strike, it was very close," said Doak Ewing, president of Rare Sportsfilms, which sells a DVD of the perfect game. "It wasn't a foot and a half out of the strike zone." The strongest defense of Pinelli's decision to call strike three came from Schechter of the Hall of Fame. "My view is that the pitch seemed a little high by today's standards, but not necessarily by 1956 standards, because the strike zone was technically larger back then," Schechter said. "It also might've been outside, but lots of pitches that look outside aren't. I think the operative baseball maxim is that 'it was too close to take,' especially in a situation like that where a pitcher might get the benefit of the doubt." (For baseball novices, "taking" a pitch means not swinging because the batter expects the umpire to call it a ball.) Schechter agreed with Goldman and Ewing that "the pitch might have been out of the strike zone as we know it today, but not by a foot and a half." He added that anyone looking at the pitch today from the filmed version has to be careful about how they judge it. "The camera angle we see is from above and to the first-base side, making it tougher to judge where the ball really was." We asked Alan M. Nathan -- an emeritus professor of physics at the University of Illinois (Urbana-Champaign) who has written widely about the physics of baseball -- what he thought of the camera angle and its value in judging Pinelli's call. "Like many others, I have seen that video many times," Nathan said. "The camera angle on the Larsen video is far from being ideal." Because the view is off-center, he said, it's subject to what physicists call parallax -- a difference in the apparent position of an object when viewed along two different lines of sight. "There is a lot of parallax, making it difficult to know with any accuracy about whether the pitch was really outside." Nathan added that, judging by the film, "the pitch looks outside. I can't easily tell that it is high, and I don't see how the others can tell that it is high. But I agree that it was too close a pitch to take with two strikes. Note that Mitchell himself started to swing at the pitch, but appeared to hold up in time." Larry Gerlach, the founder and former chairman of the umpires committee of the Society for American Baseball Research, agrees. "Perfect game, last inning, two outs, two strikes: the batter damn well swing at anything close," said Gerlach, a history professor at the University of Utah. "That is a cardinal tenet of umpiring — and batting. Pinelli made a great call, and Mitchell, by leaving the bat on his shoulder, did not do his job. You simply do not 'take' a pitch in that situation." So let's recap. There's ample evidence -- including the players' eyewitness testimony -- that the pitch was not a down-the-middle, obvious strike. In all likelihood, it was somewhat out of the strike zone. But we found wide agreement among our experts that Will is exaggerating when he says that Larsen's pitch was a foot and a half outside the strike zone. And if it wasn't a flagrantly bad call like Joyce's earlier this month, then the example's value for Will is reduced. As umpire, we rate Will's statement Half True.

pomt-01362	"This (Ebola) is not as bad as SARS was in 2003."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/19/tavis-smiley/tavis-smiley-says-ebola-outbreak-not-bad-sars-outb/	In an attempt to tamp down panic, some have compared the current Ebola outbreak to past epidemics -- particularly the SARS outbreak of 2003. On ABC’s This Week Oct. 19, talk show host Tavis Smiley said that those who think President Barack Obama’s response to Ebola is too soft are blowing the situation out of proportion. For context, they should remember the outbreak of SARS -- sudden acute respiratory syndrome -- 10 years ago. Talking to Republican strategist Mary Matalin, Smiley said, "This is not as bad as SARS was in 2003, and everybody wants to pile on, Mary, like you did on all the things Obama has done wrong. I've been a critic on certain issues, but this is not the president's fault." Is Smiley right that SARS in 2003 was worse than today’s Ebola crisis? Well, it depends on the context. We talked to experts and found that looking at the Ebola and SARS outbreaks in their points of origin -- West Africa and Hong Kong, respectively -- Ebola has been more destructive. SARS, on the other hand, had a wider global reach than Ebola. "It depends on what’s your gauge for ‘worse,’ " said Laurie Garrett, a senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. Several experts told us that the potential for the Ebola outbreak to grow -- and the humanitarian toll on West Africa -- makes it more worrisome. A note: Either way, Ebola does not pose a significant threat to the United States, though it may be damaging to other countries. The effects To start off, here’s some World Health Organization data comparing the SARS outbreak in 2003 and the current Ebola outbreak as of Oct. 17. SARS -- 2003 Ebola -- 2014 Number of countries affected 25+ 7 Number of cases (global) 8,096 9,216 Health worker cases (global) 1,706 423 Number of deaths (global) 774 4,555 Mortality rate 9.6 percent 50 percent Number of cases (U.S.) 27 3 Cases contracted in U.S. 0 2 Number of deaths (U.S.) 0 1 Proven treatments None None So by the numbers, Ebola is significantly more deadly. Also, there already are more cases worldwide. That said, SARS is much more communicable than Ebola, meaning it is easier to catch. It can spread through a sneeze, cough, sharing a beverage or speaking up close with someone who has the disease. It is also possible that SARS travels through the air. Ebola, on the other hand, is not airborne. Experts say it only possible to get Ebola by coming into direct contact with the body fluids of someone who is sick. In sum, SARS spread to many more countries than Ebola has so far. However, there have been more cases of Ebola, and the death toll is much higher. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention anticipates that the number of cases in West Africa could reach the hundreds of thousands by January. "Both are substantial public health outbreaks" said Dr. David Weber, an expert in epidemiology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. "(It’s) not really useful to try to determine which is worse." From the perspective of a United States citizen considering the two diseases’ impact here, Smiley’s statement might have more weight, said Dr. William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University. Many more cases of SARS made it to the United States than Ebola cases so far. (though there were no SARS deaths). It’s also important to remember that the largest focal point of the SARS outbreak (other than Hong Kong) was Toronto -- which brought the disease a little more close to home, Schaffner said. There were 251 SARS cases and 43 deaths in Canada. Even if the number of Ebola cases in the United States is low -- and lower than the number of SARS cases -- Smiley is incorrect because of the overall humanitarian impact of Ebola when compared to that of SARS, said Dr. Howard Markel, director of the Center for the History of Medicine at the University of Michigan. "In terms of U.S. (Ebola) cases, it is still minimal," Markel said. "If you're in West Africa, it's a nightmare and very serious, and far more deadly already than SARS was." Our ruling Smiley said Ebola "is not as bad as SARS was in 2003." Both diseases are serious and have harmed communities. SARS spread to more countries and is easier to transmit than Ebola. But Ebola has had more cases and higher death toll, and those numbers continue to rise. SARS may have had more of a presence in the United States, but Ebola is poised to be a larger humanitarian crisis globally. We rate Smiley’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-06884	"When I served as City Commissioner, we made great strides …we successfully fought for, and won, adding women and people of color to the Fire Bureau."	true	/oregon/statements/2011/jul/29/charlie-hales/when-charlie-hales-was-portland-city-council-it-di/	PolitiFact Oregon is leery of statements from politicians touting their accomplishments as they run for office. So we were on our guard when we came across this boast in Charlie Hales’ letter to Portland on his website: "I’m good at solving problems and getting things done. When I served as City Commissioner, we … successfully fought for, and won, adding women and people of color to the Fire Bureau." Hales has a reputation for championing streetcars and high-density living, but diversifying a bureau? We wanted to know what happened at the Portland Fire Bureau, and the nature of Hales’ role in the fight to add more women and people of color to a traditionally white male profession. Hales was elected in 1992 and given oversight of the Fire Bureau as part of his portfolio. On Sept, 7, 1994, the Portland City Council approved a new firefighter trainee program, specifically to boost the number of women and people of color at the fire bureau. Hales, making the pitch, explained that the goal of the program was to recruit potential firefighters and train them to take the firefighter exam. The Oregonian reported at the time that of 712 sworn firefighters, line supervisors and battalion chiefs, there were three women firefighters, 10 African Americans, 11 Hispanics, three Native Americans and two Asians. That means 3.6 percent were members of ethnic minority groups and 0.42 percent were women. Commissioners unanimously approved the ordinance, which included $158,000 for six months. Hales had help from Fire Chief Robert Wall, whom he hired from California specifically to shake up the bureau; Randy Leonard, union president at the time; and William Kendrix, then president of the Portland Black Firefighters’ Association. Kendrix, who retired in 2004, said his organization brought the trainee idea forward, and that "Commissioner Hales, Randy Leonard and Chief Wall understood that if you wanted to change the numbers, then you had to reach out and provide some community support." Hales said in an interview that he did not seek out the Fire Bureau, but once he inherited it, he made diversity a priority. "These are issues on which I led," he said, adding that "others on the council were colleagues and supporters." Leonard, the former union president, is now a sitting commissioner who supported current Mayor Sam Adams for re-election until Adams announced he would not run. Leonard told PolitiFact Oregon he brought forward the plan that would eventually become the trainee program. He recalled that all four commissioners and Mayor Vera Katz asked hard questions about cost. And Hales? "I would say he certainly wasn’t opposed," Leonard said. "I would not say he led the effort, I would not say he spearheaded the effort, but I would say he was supportive of the effort." We also called Gretchen Kafoury, who served on the council in 1994 with Katz and Hales. She doesn’t recall all the facts, or all the maneuvering, but she said: "Charlie certainly did work to diversify employment in the Fire Bureau. I’m totally confident in that statement." The heart of the claim is whether the Fire Bureau hired more women and minorities. Here are the numbers: 1993 2002 2005 NOW ** African American 10 27 26 25 Asian American 2 23 25 38 Latino 11 25 28 32 Native American 3 13 15 23 Women, all 3 36 40 50 Total, sworn 712 670 669 698 **In addition, seven firefighters are biracial/multiracial. Hales oversaw the Fire Bureau in 1994 when the City Council approved a trainee program to diversify its ranks. Hales hired a new chief specifically to diversify the bureau. And the numbers started going up. iIn spite of Leonard’s equivocation, we think it’s fair to say that as a member of City Council, Hales "successfully fought for, and won, adding women and people of color to the Fire Bureau." We rate the claim as True. Comment on this item.	None	Charlie Hales	None	None	None	2011-07-29T06:00:00	2011-05-31	['None']

pomt-10239	Obama voted "to cut off funding for our American troops on the battlefield."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/02/joe-lieberman/if-obama-voted-against-funding-the-troops-so-did-l/	Joe Lieberman, the independent senator from Connecticut, alleged in his speech at the Republican National Convention that Sen. Barack Obama had voted to cut off funding for men and women in uniform. Lieberman issued the attack almost as an aside as he praised Sen. John McCain's approach to the war in Iraq. "When others were silent about the war in Iraq, John McCain had the guts and the judgment to sound the alarm about the mistakes we were making in Iraq," Lieberman said. "When others wanted to retreat in defeat from the field of battle, which would've been a disaster for the U.S.A. — when colleagues like Barack Obama were voting to cut off funding for our American troops on the battlefield — John McCain had the courage to stand against the tide of public opinion, advocate the surge, support the surge and because of that, today, America's troops are coming home — thousands of them — and they're coming home in honor!" Republicans have made similar charges in the past, such as when McCain himself said on Aug. 11, 2008, that Obama "tried to prevent funding for the troops who carried out the surge." We evaluated that claim here . To support the charge, the McCain campaign has cited Obama's vote of May 24, 2007, against an appropriations bill that included funding for the military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan (and passed, 80-14). So was that a vote "to cut off funding for our American troops on the battlefield"? Not primarily. Obama was fighting at the time for a requirement that President Bush begin to bring the troops home from Iraq. The bill in question did not include such a requirement, and that is why Obama voted against it. Obama said at the time that he wanted to fund the troops, he just didn't want to fund the particular military strategy that the bill would enable. "We must fund our troops," Obama said at the time. "But we owe them something more. We owe them a clear, prudent plan to relieve them of the burden of policing someone else's civil war." Clearly Obama wanted to provide funding for the troops — just not the president's military strategy. If, by voting against funding for a strategy he opposed, Obama voted to "cut off funding for the troops," then so did almost every Republican in the Senate — and Lieberman himself — when they voted against a $124-billion appropriations bill on April 26, 2007, that would have funded operations in Iraq and Afghanistan but also required Bush to begin withdrawing troops from Iraq. (McCain missed the vote on that bill, which passed 51-46 and was subsequently vetoed by Bush.) In a very narrow sense, yes, those votes were against military funding — a portion of which goes to equip and pay the troops. So there is a grain of truth to Lieberman's attack. But because it is so misleading — treating a strategic disagreement as a stand against men and women in uniform — we find it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-15018	"90% of Americans want national background checks that close loopholes."	true	/texas/statements/2015/oct/05/jeremy-bird/jeremy-bird-says-90-percent-americans-want-mandato/	An adviser to a group focused on turning Texas Democratic-blue suggested after the fatal shootings in Oregon that there’s a huge consensus nationally in favor of mandating a background check before any gun purchase. Jeremy Bird, a Chicago-based senior adviser to Battleground Texas, said in an Oct. 2, 2015, tweet: "90% of Americans want national background checks that close loopholes. 9-0. Won't solve whole problem but is a start." He posted that comment the day after a man opened fire at Umpqua Community College in Roseburg, Ore., killing nine. According to news accounts, authorities subsequently collected 14 guns owned by the man, who killed himself at the scene. Hours before Bird tweeted, ATF Assistant Special Agent in Charge Celinez Nunez said at a news conference that all of the weapons were purchased legally, seven of them by the shooter or his family members in the last three years. And was Bird right about sweeping support for universal background checks? A previous ‘True’ Bird’s claim rang a bell. In April 2013, we found True a claim by Lee Leffingwell, then Austin’s mayor, that 90 percent of Americans and 74 percent of National Rifle Association members supported background checks of gun purchasers. Polls taken in 2012 and 2013 supported both figures, though one taken closest to Leffingwell’s comment indicated support among all Americans possibly slipping a bit below 90 percent. Currently, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers but not for gun sales by private sellers. But President Barack Obama and others have called for requiring criminal background checks for all gun sales. In 2013, the National Rifle Association suggested that an expansion would fail to rope in criminals. A January 2013 Pew Research Center poll found 85 percent of all respondents in favor of making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks, with comparable support from Republicans, Democrats and independents, Pew said. The margin of error for the entire sample was 2.9 percentage points. Several 2015 polls By email to our inquiry about Bird’s statement, Pew spokesman Brian Mahl pointed out a center survey of 2,002 adults taken from July 14-20, 2015, that found (again) 85 percent of respondents in favor of making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks. Pew said in its August 2015 results summary: "While there is broad support for several specific gun policy proposals – and opinion on these measures has not changed significantly since 2013 – the public continues to be more evenly divided in fundamental attitudes about whether it is more important to control gun ownership or to protect the right of Americans to own guns. Currently, 50% say it is more important to control gun ownership, while 47% say it is more important to protect the right of Americans to own guns." Our own web search turned up a survey of 1,326 adults, intended to be a representative national sample, taken Jan. 2-16, 2015 by researchers at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Some 84 percent of respondents favored requiring background checks for all gun sales, compared to 89 percent in a similar survey taken two years before, a "slight erosion," the authors wrote. We noted before a January 2013 CBS/New York Times poll indicating 92 percent of all the respondents at that time favoring background checks for all potential gun buyers. The poll had an overall margin of error of three percentage points. A more recent CBS News poll, taken of 1,047 registered voters July 29-Aug. 2, 2015, showed 88 percent of respondents favoring background checks for all gun purchases including, CBS News said, "large majorities of Republicans (81 percent), Democrats (93 percent), and independents (89 percent)." Quinnipiac University polls National voter surveys by Quinnipiac University continue to show widespread support for universal background checks. We noted in our Leffingwell check that a national Quinnipiac University survey of 772 registered voters, taken Jan. 30 through Feb. 4, 2013, found 92 percent supporting background checks for all gun buyers. That survey had a margin of error of 2.3 percentage points. A subsequent Quinnipiac University survey, taken of 1,944 registered voters from Feb. 27, 2013 through March 4, 2013, found 88 percent in favor of background checks for all gun buyers. The poll had a margin of error of 2.2 percentage points. By email, Battleground Texas replied to our inquiry by pointing out a news story in The Hill, a Washington, D.C., newspaper, stating that a June 2014 Quinnipiac University poll found 92 percent of surveyed voters in favor of universal background checks for gun purchases. The survey reached 1,446 registered voters from June 24-30, 2014 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 2.6 percentage points. More recently, a Quinnipiac University survey of 1,574 registered voters, taken Sept. 17-21, 2015, found 93 percent of respondents in favor of requiring background checks for all gun buyers. Similarly, 93 percent of respondents with a legally acquired gun in the household indicated support for such checks. The poll had a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points. Quinnipiac University Survey (Sept. 17-21, 2015) SOURCE: Press release, "Don't Shut Down Government, U.S. Voters Say 3-1, Quinnipiac University National Poll Finds; Voters Oppose Admitting Syrian Refugees," Quinnipiac University Poll, Sept. 28, 2015 Texas poll shows less support there And in Texas? A February 2013 University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll of 1,200 Texas voters found 78 percent of respondents somewhat or strongly supporting criminal and mental health background checks for all U.S. gun purchases, including at gun shows and for private sales. Those results had a margin of error of plus or minus 3.3 percentage points. A June 2013 follow-up survey found 74 percent of the 1,200 respondents somewhat or strongly supporting such background checks. Our ruling Bird said: "90% of Americans want national background checks that close loopholes." Polls continue to show a strong tilt in favor of background checks prior to all gun purchases; the latest available poll before Bird spoke found 93 percent of adults in favor. Then again, the popularity of this idea may bear watching. Other 2015 polls found as few as 84 percent of respondents backing the universal checks. We rate the claim True.

pomt-09898	"Across the country, $174 billion of the Recovery Act have been committed in its first 130 days."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/15/joe-biden/vice-president-biden-correct-174-billion-stimulus-/	To counter Republican criticism that the stimulus money is not being spent fast enough, Vice President Joe Biden has been traveling the country to boast about the recovery plan's success stories. In conjunction with a July 9, 2009, trip to Ohio, Biden's office put out a news release with this talking point: "Across the country, $174 billion of the Recovery Act have been committed in its first 130 days." The White House says it is getting the numbers from its own Web site, Recovery.gov. We counted 130 days after Obama signed the bill on Feb. 17, which took us to June 27. On that day, the government had committed $157.8 billion, slightly less than the $174 billion cited by Biden. Those numbers are culled from weekly reports submitted by all federal agencies. The total stimulus cost will ultimately be roughly $787 billion, with about $499 billion for new spending. (The other $288 billion is for tax relief.) So that means that about 35 percent of the spending ($174.9 billion of $499 billion) has been allocated so far. That might sound like a lot, but Republican critics complain the money is just trickling out. For example, Sen. Jon Kyl, the No. 2 Republican in the Senate, complained last week that only 6.8 percent of the stimulus package has been spent. The numbers can be confusing, making you wonder whether Kyl is right about the 6.8 percent or Biden is right about the 35 percent. So we investigated and found that, like so many things in the federal budgeting process, it all comes down to semantics. John Porcari, deputy secretary of the Department of Transportation, wrote how this confusion is playing out in miniature at his agency, after getting what he considered some bad press in a USA Today story that maintained that only $132 million of the total $27.5 billion earmarked for road construction funding has been spent. Indeed, there's a big difference between how much money the government has already spent — that figure is about $60 billion, according to the White House — and how much the government has obligated or committed to a project. "Whenever a state obligates or dedicates their Recovery dollars to a project that means it is green-lighted," Porcari wrote on Recovery.gov. "States can start advertising the project and soliciting bids and once a bid is awarded contractors can buy supplies, bring workers on board and start breaking ground. It could be weeks before the reimbursement process starts so those outlays are in no way an indicator of how much money is getting to states, how much work is being done or how many people are working. The $16 billion obligated to thousands of highway projects is the true measure of how much highway money is reaching states." Using his definition, about $16 billion has been obligated to road construction projects, far more than what's actually been spent. So for practical purposes, money "committed" is the same as "obligated" and "allocated." It's money that will be spent on a particular project. It's fair to use those broader terms, according to Jim Horney, a budget expert at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, because the guarantee of the money can sometimes be enough to keep an agency or a company from laying off a worker. "It's not just when the check has been written that we see an impact," he said. Take Virginia, for example. Earlier in the year, lawmakers were planning to lay off teachers to save cash. But when the stimulus passed, the state knew it would be getting some financial relief, so officials changed their budget to keep those teachers employed. The money isn't in the state treasury at that moment, but it still has a ripple effect on the economy, Horney said. "If [teachers] knew they would be laid off, they would have started saving money, stopped buying clothes, preparing for hard times ahead," he said. Knowing they would have a job in the coming school year, teachers were less likely to adopt austerity measures. Horney had this caveat: Impact on the economy depends on how quickly the money is actually spent or reimbursed. If it takes five years for the government to pay a state back for a project, then the state may take some cost-cutting measures in the meantime. Conservatives, though, say the true measurement of economic impact is money actually spent, said Brian Riedl of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. "The economic theory behind the stimulus suggests only actual outlays can create jobs and drive money through the economy," he said. So back to Biden. He said that $174 billion had been committed at the 130-day mark. Federal records show he was a little off. The administration's Recovery.gov site shows that $157.8 billion had been committed. So we give Biden a Mostly True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2009-07-15T17:05:02	2009-07-09	['None']

pomt-00490	Says Leah Vukmir said: "I’m not endorsing Donald Trump."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/08/kevin-nicholson/kevin-nicholsons-attack-leah-vukmir-over-support-d/	On one level, the Republican primary campaign for the U.S. Senate in Wisconsin has been a contest over which candidate can appear more pro-President Donald Trump. On that score, Kevin Nicholson hit his primary revival, Leah Vukmir, in an online video that was posted Aug. 1, 2018. The winner of their Aug. 14, 2018 primary will face Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin. Nicholson’s 30-second ad shows clips of Vukmir criticizing Trump, including saying Trump is offensive to different groups of people. It starts -- and ends -- with Vukmir saying: "I’m not endorsing Donald Trump." That leaves the impression that Vukmir never endorsed Trump for president. But she she eventually did -- prominently. And she backs Trump today. All of our fact checks in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race. Chronology The clips of Vukmir criticizing Trump are from March 2016, prior to Wisconsin’s primary election in April 2016. Trump lost that contest by 13 points to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz. But, of course, Trump went on to win the GOP nomination before defeating Democrat Hillary Clinton in the November 2016 general election. OK, now let’s track Vukmir. Before the Wisconsin primary, Vukmir first supported Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who briefly ran for the GOP nomination before dropping out in September 2015. Then she backed U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, who ended his run in March 2016. Vukmir said she ultimately voted for Cruz in the Wisconsin primary. (For his part, Nicholson wasn’t an original Trump supporter, either. He supported Rubio initially, but said he voted for Trump in the primary.) Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. What’s important here, though, is that during the general election campaign Vukmir not only endorsed Trump, she was part of a women for Trump group and appeared in a radio ad supporting his candidacy against Clinton. That’s completely left out of Nicholson’s ad. What’s more, since it is running in the days prior to the election, it makes it seem as if this is Vukmir’s current position. It’s not. (Note: We’ve rated as False a claim by Vukmir that "I have always been there with" Donald Trump.) Our rating Nicholson says that Vukmir said: "I’m not endorsing Donald Trump." But that was before Trump became the GOP nominee for president in 2016. After he won the nomination, Vukmir endorsed Trump and prominently supported him, as she does today.

pomt-15002	"In the states that allow open carry, violent crime was 23 percent lower."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/oct/09/matt-gaetz/violent-crime-lower-states-open-carry/	Florida is one of only a handful of states left in the country that doesn’t allow any open carry of firearms, and some state legislators want to change that. State Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fort Walton Beach, is sponsoring a bill that would allow those with a conceal carry license to openly carry their firearms. On Oct. 6, 2015, a House panel voted in favor of the bill, which will now advance to other committees in anticipation of a January legislative session. In a press conference before the hearing, Gaetz tried to allay fears that public safety would suffer by comparing crime rates in states without open carry with those that allow it. "It is important to note that in the states that allow open carry, violent crime was 23 percent lower, the murder rate was 5 percent lower, the aggravated assault rate was 23 percent lower and robbery rates were 36 percent lower." We decided to fact-check his claim that violent crime was 23 percent lower in open carry states. The statistic suggests that open carry laws make states safer, or at the very least don’t make them more dangerous. But the reality is much more complex, according to experts and research. Comparing states on violent crime rate Gaetz used Uniform Crime Reporting figures compiled by the U.S. Department of Justice to create his statistics. The data come 2012. He divided the states into two groups — the eight states that did not allow open carry at the time, which included Florida, Texas, California, South Carolina, Illinois, New York, Oklahoma, Arkansas — and the 42 states that did allow open carry. Gaetz then compared the total number of violent crimes (defined by federal officials as murder, forcible rape, robbery and aggravated assault) with the total population in the eight states without open carry in 2012. We checked his math and found the same result: Those states had a combined violent crime rate of about 434 per 100,000 people. The remaining 42 states had a violent crime rate of about 352 per 100,000. That means states with open carry laws did have a 23 percent lower violent crime rate that year. Not all open carry states are the same, however, and laws vary from state to state. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence lists states that prohibit the open carry of handguns in public places, states that allow open carrying without a permit, and states that require some form of license to open carry. They currently list five states that prohibit the open carrying of handguns in public places. But that’s not the only issue with these statistics. We asked several experts about Gaetz’s methodology. Many of them said the single law was too narrow to draw meaningful conclusions about its impact. In essence, his number -- for one year -- is right, but so what? Gaetz framed the use of the stats as "evidence that this bill does not create a less safe environment." John Pierce, co-founder of gun rights group OpenCarry.org, agreed with that point. But he said the data doesn't necessarily reflect a correlation between allowing open carry and fewer instances of violent crime. He noted that Texas and Florida are both populous states with huge numbers of concealed carry permit holders so focusing just on open carry laws will give a skewed picture about the effect of legally-armed citizens on crime rates. Tomislav Kovandzic, a University of Texas professor who teaches classes on research methods and gun control, was more blunt. "The problem with this approach is that it implicitly assumes that both groups of states were identical/similar before the laws in the treatment states (in this case, open carry states) were enacted," Kovandzic told PolitiFact via email. "This is rarely, if ever, the case. As a result, the comparison merely reflects group differences that existed before the treatment states enacted the laws." A sound look at the issue would require controlling for factors like specific crimes, population characteristics or other details, not Gaetz’s static group comparison. "Even if he averaged multiple years together to make his open carry versus non-open carry comparison, it wouldn’t change the futility of the approach," he said. What does more detailed research have to say? Florida State University criminology professor Gary Kleck said that plenty of research has found rates of carry permit holding "have no net effect on crime rates, including violent crime rates, one way or the other." However, Kleck said that the research he has seen doesn’t differentiate between open carry and concealed carrying. Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, pointed us to a 2010 study that looked at whether right-to-carry laws affected crime rates. The conclusion: they didn’t. "The best available evidence suggests that right to carry concealed laws are associated with increases in aggravated assaults with guns, but have no measurable effect on population rates of murder and robbery," Webster said. Our ruling Gaetz said, "In the states that allow open carry, violent crime was 23 percent lower." This is a fact that experts say is largely meaningless and shouldn’t weigh into any serious policy discussion. There may be less crime in those states, but there’s no way the single data point Gaetz gave can provide clues as to the effects of open carry laws. Gaetz’s statement is a one-year snapshot that is misleading. We rate it Half True.	None	Matt Gaetz	None	None	None	2015-10-09T15:00:00	2015-10-06	['None']

pomt-09804	A new bill "was written into the new health care reform initiative ensuring that Congress will be 100 percent exempt."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/11/chain-email/64000-question-e-mail-says-congress-exempt-health-/	A chain e-mail claims that Congress has exempted itself from health care reform. The e-mail appears to have been created shortly after President Barack Obama appeared in a forum on health care with Charlie Gibson of ABC News, an event that took place on June 24, 2009. It has the subject line, "The $64,000 Question." (For you young whippersnappers, The $64,000 Question was a popular game show that aired in the 1950s and revived in the 1970s as The $128,000 Question .) Here's the text of the e-mail: "Finally ... The $64,000 question was asked ... Yesterday on ABC TV (better known as the all Barack Channel) during the 'Network Special on Health Care' ... Obama was asked: "'Mr. President, will you and your family give up your current health care program and join the new "universal health care program" that the rest of us will be on????' ... (Bet you already know the answer) ... There was a stoney silence as Obama ignored the question and chose not to answer it!!! "In addition, a number of senators were asked the same question, and their response was ... 'We will think about it.' And they did. It was announced today on the news that the 'Kennedy Health Care Bill' was written into the new health care reform initiative ensuring that Congress will be 100 percent exempt! "So, this great new health care plan that is good for you and I ... is not good enough for Obama, his family or Congress...?? We (the American public) need to stop this proposed debacle ASAP!!!! ... This is totally wrong!!!!! "Personally, I can only accept a universal health care overhaul that extends to everyone ... Not just us lowly citizens ... While the Washington 'elite' keep right with their gold-plated health care coverage. If you agree please pass this on ... " A reader sent us the e-mail and asked if it was true. To start with, the e-mail seems to assume — though it doesn't say so explicitly — that the health care reform plan sends everyone into a new public plan. This is not the case. The Democratic health care legislation under consideration in Congress leaves in place employer-provided health insurance for the vast majority of Americans. But people who work for small businesses, are self-employed or currently uninsured would be eligible for a separate system known as the health care exchange. It would offer a variety of plans, including a government-run plan that is known as the public option. Much of the controversy about health care reform has surrounded the public option. Critics say it could create a large bureaucracy and would not provide coverage as good as private insurers, while supporters say it would stimulate competition for people in the exchange. People who receive health insurance coverage from large employers would not be eligible for the public option. Members of Congress are offered insurance through their employer, which in this case is the federal government. They can purchase it through the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan, which is offered to all federal employees. (We've written about this plan previously.) Under the plan, federal workers — and members of Congress — can choose from a variety of insurance plans just as people would in the new health care exchange. There's nothing in the health care bills that exempts Congress from the same requirements as regular citizens. However, some Republicans have attempted to pass amendments that would require members of Congress to drop their current coverage and force them to enroll in the public option. Republicans have said it would prove to the American people that the public option is a good thing. But Democrats have largely voted against these amendments, as we've reported previously . But the chain e-mail doesn't address this. Instead, it says members of Congress have somehow exempted themselves from reform, which is not correct. Under the bill, the lawmakers would continue to receive the same insurance they get now, just as most Americans would. Members of Congress are treated like any other citizens under the terms of the bill. We rate the chain e-mail's statement False.

That is the question Atlanta leaders are grappling with as the Atlanta Falcons have discussed plans with city and state officials to build a $1 billion retractable-roof stadium downtown and demolish the 20-year-old Georgia Dome. The key to any deal is the City Council’s approval of a commitment by Atlanta to finance about 20 percent of the total cost using bonds backed by a hotel-motel tax. That’s a bargain when you compare it with other recent stadium deals across the country, some city officials say. "Of the 18 stadiums built from 2004 to 2013, 47 percent of the total cost came from public sources," Atlanta Chief Operating Officer Duriya Farooqui said at the first public hearing on the proposed deal. Her boss, Mayor Kasim Reed, is a vocal proponent of a new stadium. The claim was included in a slide presentation Reed’s staff prepared on stadium construction costs for the hearing in the City Council’s chambers. The Feb. 13 meeting drew so much interest that additional spectators watched the proceedings on television from another room. PolitiFact Georgia wanted to know whether the claim was accurate, or is the public investment in professional sports facilities far less than the mayor’s staff is letting on? Reed’s spokeswoman, Sonji Jacobs, referred us to a report on the sports news website Deadspin.com that had the information the mayor’s staff used in its presentation. Deadspin was the site that broke the Manti Te’o girlfriend hoax story. "[P]rivate funding (53 percent) has actually surpassed public funding for the first time in decades," Deadspin wrote. The percentage of public funding for sports facilities has decreased in recent decades, as taxpayers have become less tolerant of their money going to stadiums or arenas with teams owned by enormously wealthy owners. Lawmakers have tried to become more creative in public financing of the construction of sports facilities, using lodging taxes on out-of-towners, a ticket tax, public parking revenue, taxes from car rentals and other sources. There are also the more traditional methods of funding these multimillion-dollar projects, such as collecting the money from sales taxes. In the past decade, eight of the 18 facilities were built for Major League Baseball franchises, four for pro football, four for National Basketball Association teams and two for National Hockey League teams. The cost of the stadiums range from as low as the $250 million to build the FedEx Forum in Memphis, Tenn., home of the NBA’s Memphis Grizzlies, to $1.6 billion for MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J. The NFL’s New York Giants and Jets share use of MetLife Stadium, the site of next year’s Super Bowl. By our own count, these 18 sports facilities cost a combined $11.7 billion to build. The public contribution toward these projects totaled about $5.6 billion, 48 percent of the total cost. We wanted to look at the public investment in sports facilities that cost $1 billion or more to build since that is the projected cost of the proposed stadium in Atlanta. There were four venues in that category: MetLife Stadium; Cowboys Stadium in Arlington, Texas; the Barclays Center in New York City; and Yankee Stadium, also in New York City. The public investment in those facilities was about 18 percent. Again, the current discussion in Atlanta is a 20 percent public investment in a new football stadium downtown. Jacobs, the mayor’s spokeswoman, noted that most of the billion-dollar sports venues were built in the New York City area, where land and construction costs are typically higher. She also noted that MetLife Stadium is shared by two teams, and she believes that skews any comparison of the billion-dollar venues. Four of the five teams that play in the billion-dollar venues have a higher net worth than the Falcons, who ranked 28th among the NFL’s 32 teams, according to Forbes. Here’s the most recent Forbes breakdown: Dallas Cowboys: $1.85 billion. New York Yankees: $1.85 billion. New York Giants: $1.3 billion. New York Jets: $1.23 billion. Atlanta Falcons: $814 million. Brooklyn Nets: $530 million. The Falcons are owned by Arthur Blank (who has a reported net worth of $1.5 billion and whom Forbes lists at the 329th-richest American). Blank sits on the board of directors of Cox Enterprises, which owns The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. But the owners of the teams in the billion-dollar venues are super rich. For example, Nets majority owner Mikhail Prokhorov is reportedly worth $13.2 billion. Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has a net worth of $2.7 billion, Forbes reports. Jets owner Woody Johnson is part of a family that is worth about $13 billion. On the other end of the cost spectrum, the least expensive projects had a higher percentage of public funding. For example, the FedEx Forum was built through an authority created by the city of Memphis and Shelby County. The authority included a $1.15-per-ticket surcharge to help pay construction costs, according to newspaper accounts. Since Farooqui’s claim included smaller and, typically less-costly arenas, we also decided to break down the public investment in facilities solely used by baseball and football teams, since Atlanta is considering a football stadium. Our examination shows the public investment in those 12 facilities was 44 percent. That’s pretty close to the claim. Jacobs said the best comparison is between the Falcons’ proposal and other multiuse stadiums. There were three retractable-roof stadiums built in the past decade. The public investment in them were 27 percent (Arlington), 68 percent (Phoenix) and 86 percent (Indianapolis). Our conclusion: Farooqui said in her presentation that 47 percent of the cost of 18 pro sports facilities built in the past decade came from public sources. Our examination of the claim showed the estimate is on target, even if you remove arenas. The public investment, though, in other billion-dollar stadiums is much less than 47 percent. We believe this context is necessary to fully understand Farooqui’s statement. We rate Farooqui’s claim as Mostly True.	None	Duriya Farooqui	None	None	None	2013-03-01T06:00:00	2013-02-13	['None']

pomt-15208	Says Marco Rubio’s "proposed college affordability overhaul would specifically benefit for-profit colleges."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/aug/12/american-bridge-21st-century/pac-accuses-rubio-favoring-profit-colleges-educati/	A liberal political action committee is attacking Sen. Marco Rubio’s proposed overhaul of the nation’s colleges and universities, saying his plan unfairly benefits for-profit schools. After Rubio went on Fox & Friends on Aug. 10, 2015, to lambaste Hillary Clinton’s call to make post-secondary education more affordable, American Bridge 21st Century went after Rubio’s own plan. "Perhaps in his eagerness to criticize, Marco neglected to mention his long-time advocacy for and support of for-profit colleges," the PAC wrote on its website. "And Marco neglected to mention that his own proposed college affordability overhaul would specifically benefit for-profit colleges — institutions with a reputation for willfully misleading students, targeting veterans, in particular." Rubio has spent a lot of campaign time talking about getting a proper education, but we haven’t learned many details of his strategy. Will for-profit colleges "specifically benefit" from his ideas to make education more affordable? We decided to take a crash course on his plan and find out. Rubio’s plan not specific Rubio took aim at current education practices in a July 7 speech in Chicago. Among his goals would be to change how schools are accredited, saying the current system favored traditional colleges. "Our higher education system today is controlled by what amounts to a cartel of existing colleges and universities, which use their power over the accreditation process to block innovative, low-cost competitors from entering the marketplace," Rubio said in his speech. "Within my first 100 days, I will bust this cartel by establishing a new accreditation process that welcomes low-cost, innovative providers." Accreditation is a system designed to evaluate whether a school or institution meets quality guidelines, and is generally performed by one of several regional boards. These boards are private groups that must be approved by the federal government, and are comprised of members from already qualified schools. It’s important to keep in mind that a school must be accredited in order to qualify for federal financial aid like student loans and Pell grants. Sources told us that makes accreditation very attractive to for-profit schools, which are owned by private companies looking to make money. Experts we interviewed did agree that unless you’re a traditional college, getting accredited can be difficult and lock out schools that could teach skills for less than a degree-granting university. Massive open online courses, boot camps and for-profit colleges often aren’t accredited. It’s not clear what the "innovative providers" Rubio mentioned in his speech truly are. Other than broad talking points, Rubio has yet to provide specifics about what he means, and his spokesman did not clarify what schools or programs would benefit from changes in the accreditation process. But that means American Bridge can’t say with certainty, either. "Admittedly, we are slightly reading between the lines because Rubio did not utter the words ‘for-profit’ and he has yet to release a white-paper on this specific proposal," American Bridge spokesman Ben Ray told PolitiFact. But "code words" in Rubio’s speech like catering to "market forces" and "competition" show that he means for-profit colleges, Ray added. Media outlets and critics like American Bridge have pointed out that Rubio has a history of advocating for the privately run schools. American Bridge argues that for-profit schools have a history of overpromising results to recruit students, especially in Florida. In 2014 Rubio defended Corinthian Colleges, a for-profit company that late declared bankruptcy and closed more than 100 campuses after a federal investigation into its lending practices to students. The U.S. Department of Education fined the company $29.7 million for misleading students at Florida locations by lying about job placement rates. Rubio had asked the agency to continue providing federal aid to Corinthian while the company was being investigated. The company donated more than $27,000 to Rubio over the last five years. Kevin Carey, education policy program director of the New America Foundation public policy institute, agreed that the schools usually have to conform "to join the club" and get accredited. But American Bridge is reaching to say Rubio’s plan aims to benefit those private companies when he mentions "innovative providers." "I think it could mean many things, probably including online or technology-enabled education, but not exclusively for-profit colleges," Carey said. He noted that Corinthian Colleges already was an accredited institution, so while Rubio may have supported the company, the example doesn’t necessarily apply to a potentially revamped accreditation process the way American Bridge suggests. Our ruling American Bridge 21st Century said Rubio’s "proposed college affordability overhaul would specifically benefit for-profit colleges." Rubio has suggested revamping the accreditation process to allow "innovative providers" to become accredited. Exactly which schools or programs he means and why they need to be accredited is up for debate, because Rubio hasn’t given any details. That makes it extremely difficult for American Bridge to say the change is specifically to help for-profit colleges, despite Rubio's past affinity for the businesses. Many for-profit schools already are accredited, although experts say others may potentially benefit from Rubio’s plan. Rubio's plan is not specific in benefiting for-profit colleges, so we rate American Bridge’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-12921	"The vast majority of people that got insurance under President Obama's Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, got it through Medicaid."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/15/rand-paul/medicaid-expansion-drove-health-insurance-coverage/	President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and the key issue facing Republicans is how do they get rid of the sweeping health care law without creating chaos for an estimated 20 million people who gained insurance under the program. That includes many people who gained health care through more generous rules for Medicaid, a longstanding federal program for the very poor. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said dealing with people who got Medicaid is "the big question." "The vast majority of people that got insurance under President Obama's Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, got it through Medicaid," Paul said Jan. 15, 2017, on CNN’s State of the Union. Paul proposed that if any state wants to retain expanded Medicaid, it should be prepared to raise taxes to do so. Paul’s federal plan emphasizes reducing insurance regulations to lower prices and promoting health savings accounts. Our focus is on his statement that the vast majority of the newly insured under Obamacare came through the Medicaid program. We were curious if that was accurate. More people became eligible for health insurance through Medicaid after passage of the Affordable Care Act. The law expanded eligibility for the poor, though states could choose not to participate in the expansion. We reached out to Paul’s office for his source and did not hear back, but the U.S. Health and Human Services Department issued a report in March 2016 that at first glance gives some support to his claim. It said that Medicaid and CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program) added 14.5 million people by the end of 2015. (That’s the most recent data available.) Take that number at face value and about three-quarters of the newly insured came through the two closely linked programs. But the analysts we reached told us that a fair number of those new people were eligible for coverage under old rules that predated the Affordable Care Act. How many? The Kaiser Family Foundation broke it down into about 10.7 million newly eligible and about 3.4 million who were eligible before but hadn’t enrolled. Joan Alker, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy, told us that most of that 3.4 million are children. She said Medicaid analysts explain this through the "welcome mat effect." "There was a lot of outreach and publicity, and people started coming in," Alker said. "The parents might qualify for expanded Medicaid, but their kids were already eligible under Medicaid or CHIP. And the same could happen for parents who signed up through the marketplace." The marketplace was the way to sign up -- often through a government website -- for individual private insurance under the Affordable Care Act. It turns out, the impact of Obamacare on Medicaid is more complicated than simply more generous eligibility rules for adults. Benjamin Sommers at the Harvard School of Public Health said research he and his colleagues did showed that about half of the Medicaid increases came through eligibility changes and about a half through drawing in those who were eligible before. For Sommers, both effects are part of the Affordable Care Act. In that sense, he thinks Paul has a point. "The majority of the national coverage gains are Medicaid, but not the vast majority," Sommers told us. In an op-ed, Sommers wrote that eligibility rules and the welcome mat effect are so intertwined, if parents lose their eligibility, very often coverage for their kids lapses as well, even though the children still qualify. "If parents are disenrolled after an ACA repeal, many children will return to being uninsured," he wrote. A couple of other factors make it difficult to say precisely why Medicaid grew under Obamacare. Health care analyst, John Holahan at the Urban Institute, a Washington-based academic center, noted that the Medicaid enrollment data is shaky. "If all 50 states send in their numbers, 40 of them might do a good job and for 10, the data might be garbage. You try to impute and make estimates to account for the flawed and missing information," he said. And Laura Wherry, assistant professor of medicine at the UCLA School of Medicine, said any model depends on some guesswork as to what would have happened if the Affordable Care Act hadn’t happened at all. Our ruling Paul said the vast majority of people that got insurance under Obamacare got it through Medicaid. About 20 million people gained coverage and about 14.5 million of those were under Medicaid or CHIP. But a sizeable fraction of that 14.5 million were eligible before the Affordable Care Act took effect. One estimate said about a quarter of them were previously eligible. Another estimate put it as high as half. There is some guess work behind all the reports. Medicaid might account for slightly more than half of those who gained coverage. Most people wouldn’t say that amounts to the vast majority, but it is likely still the majority.

pomt-02996	"Since Mr. Foster's been mayor, we have less small businesses in the city of St. Petersburg."	false	/florida/statements/2013/oct/17/rick-kriseman/st-petersburg-mayoral-candidate-rick-kriseman-says/	With less than three weeks until the St. Petersburg mayoral election, the Oct. 15 Tampa Bay Times/Bay News 9 forum, like the 20-some-odd debates before it, centered on the city’s progress since Mayor Bill Foster took office. Foster asked if the city is better off now than it was four years ago. Challenger Rick Kriseman, former city council member and state legislator, took every opportunity to point out ways he felt Foster’s leadership has been lacking, especially when it comes to economic development. Among his claims, Kriseman said: "Since Mr. Foster's been mayor, we have less small businesses in the city of St. Petersburg." We wanted to dig into St. Petersburg small business statistics to find out if Kriseman was right. (We examined other claims by Kriseman here and by Foster here.) Kriseman’s campaign manager, Cesar Fernandez, referred us to the City of St. Petersburg Business Tax Division. The office collects taxes from each business in the city. When sifting through the data with city officials, we learned there are a number of different ways to define "small business." University of South Florida St. Petersburg economics professor Suzanne Dieringer said the number of small businesses would vary based on how it's measured. Even when experts agree to define a small business by number of employees, there’s no consensus among experts about which number to use. "I think if you ask six economists what’s the size of a small business you’d get six different answers," said City Council Chairman Karl Nurse. The U.S. Small Business Administration says any business with fewer than 500 employees fits the bill. By the SBA definition, over 90 percent of businesses in the city would be considered small. Nurse said it’s not necessarily the number of small businesses that’s important to assess economic growth, but rather the total revenue the city pulls in from business taxes. The city taxes businesses differently depending on the type. Many businesses are taxed by number of employees. Businesses with more than 30 employees must pay an additional fee for each employee, starting with No. 31. But there are other means of taxing as well. For example, warehouses are taxed by their square footage and piano instructors by the number of students they have. Tammy Jerome, the city’s director of billing and collections, said there’s no clear-cut way to define what makes a small business by things like square footage or amount of inventory, so it’d be difficult to get an accurate count of the small businesses in town. Because different businesses are taxed in different ways, calculating the number of small businesses by looking at each business that files taxes and indicates employing fewer than 500 people would leave out small businesses that pay taxes to the city based on other metrics. Since most businesses in St. Petersburg employ fewer than 500 people, we can use the total number of businesses and the total amount of tax money they pull in for the city to get an imperfect picture of how the climate for small businesses has changed during Foster’s term. Here’s how much revenue the city has generated from this policy by year, according to Jerome. We’ll start with 2009 because Fernandez said Kriseman was referring to the number of small businesses before Foster took office in 2010, but the wording of Kriseman's forum statement would lead viewers to believe he meant 2010, not 2009. The 2013 numbers we're using aren't yet final. 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Revenues $2,596,245 $2,405,903 $2,407,083 $2,409,290 $2,446,970 Businesses 15,768 15,498 15,103 15,923 15,520 While the revenue’s clearly gone up since 2010, the number of businesses has taken a bumpier path. The city’s unfinalized number of 15,520, is higher than the 2010 number, but not by much. Experts can’t say for sure if the number of small businesses specifically increased or decreased. Since 2010, the revenue the city’s earned from business taxes has gone up, which contradicts the point Kriseman tried to make about the economic state of the city. If he had clearly used 2009 in his talking point, he would've been more on target. Our ruling Kriseman criticized his mayoral race opponent, saying there are fewer small businesses in St. Petersburg than there were when Mayor Foster took office. But the available data leads us to believe that the number of businesses, and the city’s revenue from those businesses, have actually increased. There are lots of different ways to define what constitutes a small business, but experts told us most city businesses could be considered small. Based on the available data, we rate Kriseman's claim False.	None	Rick Kriseman	None	None	None	2013-10-17T16:59:46	2013-10-15	['None']
pomt-12877	Says Rex "Tillerson won't divest from Exxon."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jan/27/charles-schumer/chuck-schumer-wrongly-tweets-tillerson-wont-divest/	Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he won’t vote to confirm Rex Tillerson as secretary of state — in part because Tillerson, the former CEO of ExxonMobil, won’t divest from his former employer. "Tillerson won't divest from #Exxon, won't recuse himself, doesn't display values of American foreign policy--I'm voting no," Schumer tweeted Jan. 27, 2017. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com That’s incorrect. Tillerson divested from Exxon, where he worked for 40 years, in early January. An hour later, Schumer tweeted: "Rex Tillerson won’t lift a finger on climate change, won’t rule out a Muslim ban, won’t divest from Exxon, won’t recuse himself. He doesn’t display values of American foreign policy." To Schumer’s credit, spokesman Matt House acknowledged the mistake and said his staff would correct the tweets. House said the tweets were supposed to just say Tillerson wouldn’t commit to recusing himself from issues that involve Exxon. But that’s also wrong, as we’ll explain. We still wanted to put Schumer’s claim that "Tillerson won’t divest from Exxon" on the Truth-O-Meter and set the record straight. Tillerson has agreed to sell his more than 600,000 shares in Exxon, and Exxon drew up an additional agreement with federal ethics regulators. Tillerson retired from Exxon on Dec. 31 and is entitled to 2 million Exxon shares paid out over 10 years — a package worth more than $170 million as of Jan. 27. However, under the ethics agreement, Exxon will pay out those shares in cash, and they will be put in an independently managed trust that will not be allowed to invest in Exxon. If Tillerson violates the agreement, he will forfeit the trust, and the money will go to a charity not chosen by Exxon or Tillerson. Tillerson is also giving up $4.1 million in bonuses, as well as retiree benefits. In order to comply with ethics requirements, Tillerson is ultimately forgoing about $7 million in compensation he would otherwise receive, according to Exxon. Walter Shaub, director of the Office on Government Ethics, gave Tillerson’s divestment plan a glowing review, calling it a "clean break from Exxon." "I’m especially proud of the ethics agreement we developed for the intended nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson," Shaub said in remarks delivered at the Brookings Institution on Jan. 11. "Mr. Tillerson is making a clean break from Exxon. He’s also forfeiting bonus payments worth millions. As a result of OGE’s work, he’s now free of financial conflicts of interest. His ethics agreement serves as a sterling model for what we’d like to see with other nominees. He clearly recognizes that public service sometimes comes at a cost." In contrast, Shaub criticized President Donald Trump’s plan for severing ties with his businesses because it is not a complete divestiture. In his Brookings remarks, Shaub said he "was glad in November when the president-elect tweeted that he wanted to, as he put it, ‘in no way have a conflict of interest’ with his businesses. Unfortunately, his current plan cannot achieve that goal. It’s easy to see that the current plan does not achieve anything like the clean break Rex Tillerson is making from Exxon." Regarding Schumer’s claim that Tillerson hasn’t committed to recusing himself from any decisions involving Exxon, federal law requires that Tillerson, if confirmed, stay out of any such decisions for one year. That could pose problems given Exxon’s extensive international business interests. In his Jan. 11 confirmation hearing, senators asked Tillerson if he would agree to continue recusing himself after that year is up. "I will honor, obviously, the statutory recusal period and then after that, any matter that might involve ExxonMobil or has the appearance that it could lead to some type of conflict, I will seek the guidance of the Ethics Council," Tillerson said. "A review by them, and if it is the view that it would be proper for me to recuse, I'll honor that." Our ruling Schumer said, "Tillerson won't divest from Exxon." But that’s not even close to the truth. Tillerson retired from Exxon on Dec. 31 and laid out a plan for full divestment in the following week. The director of the Office of Government Ethics called it a "clean break from Exxon." We rate Schumer’s claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-02550	Wisconsin is "not a high tax and fee state." When you look at "all the money state and local governments bring in" from residents, "we're more in the middle."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/feb/05/mary-burke/mary-burke-says-wisconsin-not-high-tax-and-fee-sta/	Democratic gubernatorial hopeful Mary Burke has walked a tightrope on the issue of taxes early in her bid to knock off Gov. Scott Walker in November 2014. The Madison Democrat has supported what she calls fiscally responsible and targeted tax relief while criticizing Republican Walker’s plan to send at least half of a projected $1 billion budget surplus back to taxpayers. The former Trek Bicycle executive has said Wisconsin’s tax rates should be competitive with other states, but adds that businesses consider other factors first when considering expansion or relocation. Speaking Jan. 19, 2014 to the East Side Progressives group in Madison, Burke outlined her view of where Wisconsin ranks vs. other states on collecting revenue from citizens. "If you look at, overall, all the money that state and local governments bring in from the people of Wisconsin, we're more in the middle," Burke said, according to a story posted on Madison’s WKOW.com site. "In terms of a state, we're not a high tax and fee state." Let’s start by noting that if Burke had limited her remarks to taxes -- not taxes and fees -- she would have flown in the face of Wisconsin’s No. 10 ranking among states for total tax burden as a share of personal income. Indeed, property-tax and income-tax collections here run more than 25 percent above the national average. Instead, she chose a broader measure of government revenue collection. And as the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported, the picture changes when fees become part of the mix. Was Burke right that the bigger picture shows we are "more in the middle" than "high"? When we asked for backup, her campaign cited a report by the Tax Foundation ranking Wisconsin 23rd in per-capita "state and local revenue." That ranking reflects U.S. Census Bureau-reported figures derived from state governments, local municipalities, school districts and other taxing authorities. They are the grist for state-by-state rankings computed by research groups nationwide. But there is a major problem with Burke’s reliance on this particular ranking, aside from the fact that newer data is available. The "state and local revenue" category reflects federal aid received by these governmental units, not just "taxes and fees." Two respected fiscal research groups in Wisconsin confirmed that for us. We consulted the Wisconsin Budget Project affiliated with the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, and the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. Let’s look at how these two groups tally up a more accurate look at "taxes and fees" and where Wisconsin ranks. Their findings vary slightly from each other due to methodological differences, but are in general agreement: Rankings based on population Wisconsin was ranked 19th and 18th by the groups on taxes plus fees on a per-capita basis. The Wisconsin figure of $6,346 per person is just slightly above the national average, the Budget Project calculated. That’s higher than the U.S. mark by about 1 percent or less -- $34 to $70 per person, based on the two groups’ research. Those are the two strongest points in favor of Burke’s claim. Rankings relative to personal income Wisconsin was ranked 14th by one organization and 16th by another on tax and fee collections relative to the state’s personal income. Using this measure, Wisconsin’s take is between 4.8 percent and 6 percent higher than the national average. Wisconsin collects taxes and fees equivalent to 15.2 percent of the state’s total personal income, the Taxpayers Alliance says. South Dakota is lowest, at 10.8 percent, while Alaska leads at 27.7 percent. Which approach is better? Researchers use both measures, we found. Many say the income-based measure introduces a valuable "ability to pay" perspective, notes the Federal Funds Information for States. Jon Peacock, director of the Budget Project, said his group uses both in part because Wisconsin’s personal income per-person trails the U.S. average. So using the income approach naturally yields higher rankings for Wisconsin than those based on population, he noted. On another research point, Dale Knapp, research director at the Taxpayers Alliance, said "it’s useful to talk national average but rank gives a better sense of where we fit." Rankings have dropped There’s no debate that Wisconsin’s ranking on tax-and-fee collections has dropped from near the top 10 over the last decade. In the year 2000, it was 13th based on the burden on personal income, and 11th based on the population measure. On fees alone, Wisconsin ranked 30th in the latest data despite local governments relying more heavily on them to make up for a near freeze in property tax revenue they can collect, the Taxpayers Alliance noted. In the big picture, Wisconsin traditionally relies more on taxes than do other states, and leans less on federal aid and user fees, license revenue and other charges. It’s important to note that these rankings cover only through mid-2011, and therefore don’t include tax cuts approved by Walker and legislative Republicans in the last two state budgets. What she said But the question at hand is Burke’s specific claim on taxes plus fees. Burke said Wisconsin’ ranking was closer to the middle, no longer "high." There’s certainly fodder for Burke in the finding that Wisconsin is within $34 of the national average by one measure. But how do we characterize a range of rankings from 14th to 19th? Are those out of the "high" zone? The Tax Foundation has described as "mid-ranked" states that came in below 15 or above 35 in a study of state and local tax collections as a share of income. It did so because so many states in that group are bunched closely together in terms of tax burdens, while states in the high and low groups are not. So, depending on which type of ranking you prefer, Wisconsin is either in that middle tier or at the lower edge of the "high" rankers. Our rating Burke said Wisconsin is "not a high tax and fee state," adding that, "When "you look, overall, at all the money that state and local governments bring in," Wisconsin’s ranking is "more in the middle." Burke’s careful wording signals she meant the combination of taxes and fees raised by the state and local governments in Wisconsin, not taxes alone. Her campaign cites a statistic that is too broad to apply to an analysis of Wisconsin’s "taxes and fees" burden. By one widely used measure, Wisconsin is very close to middle of the pack -- just a shade over the national average with a ranking as low as 19th. By the other, we remain significantly above the national average, with a ranking around 15th. This meets the definition of partially accurate. Half True.

pomt-02358	Women "are still paid 82 cents for every dollar a man earns in Texas."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/mar/20/wendy-davis/wendy-davis-drawing-outdated-survey-slightly-overs/	Texas women are paid less than men, Wendy Davis stresses. In a March 10, 2014, tweet, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee pointed out that her Republican opponent, Attorney General Greg Abbott, passed up a chance to say whether he would have vetoed a Davis-sponsored measure related to ensuring equal pay for Texas women that didn’t make it into law. Davis, a Fort Worth state senator, wrote: "While @GregAbbott_TX dodges questions on the Texas Equal Pay Act, women are still paid 82 cents for every dollar a man earns in Texas." We’ll leave it to Abbott and Davis to debate the 2013 measure vetoed by Gov. Rick Perry. But we wondered: Are Texas women still paid 82 cents for every dollar earned by a man? We found that pay gaps persist, though comparisons can be dicey. Comparing women and men doing 'same' job In August 2013, we rated as Mostly False a related Davis claim: "Texas women make an average of $8,355 less per year than men doing the very same job." That’s not necessarily correct for individuals doing the same job. In 2010, $8,355 was the general gap between median salaries of full-time working Texas men and women, according to federal estimates, and the 2012 gap was nearly $500 less than that. Significantly, the research cited by Davis did not drill down to salaries for men and women doing the same jobs. In contrast, 2013 survey results indicated a $2,000 gap between the median pay for Texas men and women with comparable professional experiences holding the same or similar jobs. Annual U.S. Census Bureau surveys But Davis’ recent "82 cents" claim wasn’t specific to people doing the same jobs. Responding to our request for back-up information, Davis spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña pointed us to an April 2013 "fact sheet" from the National Partnership for Women & Families, an advocacy group for workplace fairness and other issues. The sheet opens: "In Texas, on average, a woman who holds a full-time job is paid $35,301 per year while a man who holds a full-time job is paid $43,160 per year. This means that women in Texas are paid 82 cents for every dollar paid to men, amounting to a yearly gap of $7,859 between men and women who work full time in the state." That statement is footnoted to the one-year American Community Survey undertaken in 2011 by the U.S Census Bureau and a bureau chart indicating median earnings in the past 12 months by sex by work experience for residents 16 and older. These aligned with the partnership’s fact sheet. Latest available estimate Kliner pointed out, too, that comparable results based on the 2012 ACS were posted online by the bureau in September 2013. The 2012 estimates indicate that median earnings for Texas men who worked full time year-round in the past 12 months were $44,802; for Texas women meeting these criteria, median earnings were $35,453 — or 79 cents for every dollar earned by men who worked full time. Because Davis said women "still" earned 82 cents for every dollar earned by men, we calculated the comparable figure for previous years, according to the bureau’s surveys. We found the comparable figure to be 80 cents in 2006, 2009 and 2010, 79 cents in 2007 and 78 cents in 2008. Separately, we downloaded a bureau chart showing slightly different estimated median earnings for full-time male and female civilian workers in Texas based on the bureau’s 2012 survey. The resulting chart indicated a median wage for full-time working men of--$45,166 for men, $35,518 for women. By this metric, we calculated, civilian full-time female workers in Texas earned an estimated 79 cents for each dollar earned by full-time male workers. In 2011, a bureau chart suggests, the comparable figure was 81 cents. Kliner told us the partnership relies on bureau estimates not limited to civilian workers because it believes that delivers a more complete view of the workforce. "It is also the chart that has been used historically, so it allows for comparisons over time," she wrote. Upshot: The latest available estimate is that Texas women working full time earned 79 cents for every dollar earned by such men in 2012. That was a penny better than in one of the previous six years, the same or a penny less than the result in four of the years and three cents less than the 82 cents estimated for 2011 and relied upon by Davis. Experts note caveats Experts we queried agreed with our math while offering caveats. By email, Lloyd Potter, the state demographer, pointed out that any focus on earnings for full-time workers leaves out part-time workers. Women, he wrote, are more likely to be employed part-time. Still, Potter said, "if we just looked at part-time workers, again, you’d probably find women earn less." In our 2013 fact check, we noted there’s a range of how many hours full-time workers log, and men are more likely than women to be on the job for 41 hours or more per week, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Because more men work overtime, that should translate into higher earnings for them -- because they are paid more, or because their longer hours lead to more job success -- and contribute to the wage gap. Though more nuanced analysis shows that job differences explain much of the pay gap, experts agree that much of it still cannot be accounted for. That’s where sexism comes in, some say. "Finally," Potter said, "the differential quoted probably is not adjusted for educational attainment or work experience." It is not. "If it were, we’d probably find the differential would shrink (toward equality) as women tend to have less work experience than men though educational attainment is fairly comparable among adults across sex." Austin economist Stuart Greenfield similarly said by email: "In the aggregate, Sen. Davis’ statement is absolutely, positively correct," though he said that "when one controls for work experience, education, and other factors, the earnings’ differential is reduced." National comparisons Greenfield also pointed out a Dec. 2, 2013, Bureau of Labor Statistics press release summarizing median-pay changes among full-time workers over the years: "In Texas, the ratio of women’s to men’s earnings trended upward from 1997 to 2004. It then fluctuated from 2005 to 2009 before climbing to a series high of 85.6 percent in 2010. However, in the last two years the Texas women’s to men’s earnings ratio has declined 6.0 percentage points to its lowest level since 2001." According to the 2012 survey results, Texas women fared better compared to men in their state than women in 24 states. Arizona placed first; women working full time earned 87 cents for every dollar earned by men.(For more than a decade, the graph indicates, Texas women fared better than their male counterparts in the state compared to women versus men in the nation as a whole, though conditions dipped in Texas compared to the nation in 2011 and 2012. We asked Cheryl Abbot, a regional economist for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to speak to why this was so. See her reply here.) Jennifer Lee, a researcher for the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, which focuses on programs serving low-income Texans, said of the 79-cent pay difference estimate suggested by the 2012 survey: "This is how the ‘wage gap’ is usually calculated. If you expand who you’re looking at to include all employed individuals (whether or not they work full-time or year-round), women earn 71 cents for every dollar that a man earns," Lee said by email. Lee reminded us of a February 2007 paper by Cornell University labor economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn, "The Gender Pay Gap: Have Women Gone Far Enough?" The paper states that 53 percent of the gender wage gap stems from variation in job, industry and union status between the genders. According to the paper, major reasons for such wage gaps include: Occupational and industry category (49% of the reason) – Lee said that many women are concentrated in particular occupations. Occupations that are heavily female, such as health care support or personal care and service occupations, tend to pay low wages, she said. For example, home health aides in Texas, who are largely female, earn on average $17,430 per year, Lee said, while women also represent 63% of workers earning minimum-wage or less in Texas. When you break down earnings data by occupation, she said, this gap persists in almost all occupations. Labor Force Experience (10.5%) – A portion of the gap is explained by factors related to work experience, such as interruptions in work for child care, Lee said. Unexplained (41%) – Lee said a large portion of the gap is unexplained by women’s choices. This could be because of conscious or unconscious biases (research shows this is particularly acute against mothers), Lee wrote, while other research shows that different attitudes around wage negotiations may contribute to the gender wage gap. Lee added: "A lot of people see occupational choices and time off from work as women’s choices. And while this is true, I think it’s important to realize that the choices we make are heavily influenced by the environment in which we make choices, the choices that are available, and how those choices are presented. So while it’s true that more women work in low-wage jobs, there may be reasons why women don’t choose to work in some higher-wage occupations. Similarly, mothers may choose to take time off work to care for young children, but perhaps they wouldn’t if child care were more available or affordable." Our ruling Davis said that Texas women are still paid 82 cents for every dollar a man earns in the state. Her figure, based on a 2011 federal survey, reflects median earnings for adults who worked full time in the past 12 months, leaving out part-time workers. It’s also outdated in that according to the latest available survey, taken in 2012, Texas women earned 79 cents for every dollar earned by men (again working full time in the past 12 months), less than what Davis said.

pomt-14229	Ten times, no Republican candidate for president had enough delegates to claim the nomination before the party’s convention, and seven of those times "somebody who was not the leader of delegates was selected as the nominee of the party."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/apr/15/john-kasich/7-times-delegate-leader-wasnt-one-who-got-gop-nomi/	Seeking an endorsement to boost his presidential campaign, Republican Ohio Gov. John Kasich met with the editorial board of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel a week before Wisconsin’s primary. (He won the endorsement, but won no delegates in the April 5, 2016 primary.) A few minutes into the March 29, 2016 interview, Kasich was asked how he can win the GOP nomination given that he so badly trails Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in delegates. Kasich replied by predicting that none of the remaining Republican hopefuls will have amassed the necessary 1,237 delegates in order to claim the nomination ahead of the party’s July 2016 convention in Cleveland. Then he made a claim that, if true, could make his plan -- to get delegates at the convention to throw their support to him -- appear more plausible. Republicans have had 10 conventions in which no candidate had won a majority of delegates, Kasich said, and "only three out of 10 times was the front runner selected. Did you know? You didn’t know that. I know you don’t know that." "So, seven times, somebody who was not the leader of delegates was selected as the nominee of the party." So, the claim we’re checking is that 10 times, no Republican candidate for president had enough delegates to claim the nomination before the party’s convention, and seven of those times someone who was not the leader in delegates was chosen at the convention as the nominee. Kasich is essentially correct on the numbers. But his statement is somewhat misleading in that the scenario he describes hasn’t occurred in more than 60 years, and the nominating process has changed considerably since then. Kasich’s evidence To back Kasich’s claim, his campaign cited a March 2016 article in The Federalist about "brokered" Republican conventions. Sometimes the term "contested" or "open" is also used. Despite Trump’s considerable lead, it’s an open question whether he will reach the threshold of 1,237 delegates prior to the gathering in Cleveland. As Kasich indicated, the article said seven out of the 10 Republican conventions in which no candidate had a majority of delegates, the person who won the nomination was not the delegate leader. The most recent brokered Republican convention was in 1952. Ohio Sen. Robert Taft entered the convention as the delegate leader, with 35 percent of the delegates, followed by General Dwight D. Eisenhower,with 26.3 percent. The article says the delegates gave the nomination to Eisenhower, who in turn won the presidential election, because he was deemed more electable. A March 2016 article in The Week about brokered conventions also cited the seven of 10 figures. Political scientist Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us that Kasich’s seven-of-10 claim is on target. But there is an important caveat, according to Burden, who said: "Before the 1970s, candidates often did not run in many primaries and caucuses to win delegates. And contested conventions were quite common. In the ‘modern’ nominating era, contested conventions are uncommon, with 1976 (Gerald Ford defeated Ronald Reagan) being the only close case. Before reforms pushed states to use open processes for selecting delegates, entering the convention with more delegates than an opponent was less meaningful than it is in the contemporary era." Other experts agreed. David Karol, government and politics professor at the University of Maryland, emphasized that the phenomenon Kasich cites "is in the distant past, when the process and our political culture were quite different." Karol, who co-authored one book and co-edited another about presidential nominations, added: "Most delegates were chosen by state party organizations and there was far less public input than there is today. But our political culture was quite different then and it wasn't considered an outrageous coup when the convention (chose someone other than the delegate leader). There wasn't a strong expectation that the nominee would run in and dominate the primaries." (A final note: Some experts say the count could be six of nine times in which a contested GOP convention resulted in the nomination of a candidate who wasn’t the delegate leader. But Northeastern University political science professor Willam Mayer, who has written books on presidential nominations, told us that Kasich’s definition of a contested convention is defensible.) Our rating Kasich said that 10 times, no Republican candidate for president had enough delegates to claim the nomination before the party’s convention, and seven of those times "somebody who was not the leader of delegates was selected as the nominee of the party." He’s correct on the numbers. But his implication that history is on his side is misleading in that it’s been more than 60 years since the GOP chose a nominee who wasn’t the delegate leader going into the convention; moreover, the process of choosing a nominee has changed considerably in the intervening years. For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification, our rating is Mostly True.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2016-04-15T05:00:00	2016-03-29	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-13720	Donald Trump "called the military that I served in a disaster."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/27/john-hutson/rear-adm-john-hutson-says-donald-trump-called-mili/	On the third night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, retired Rear Adm. John Hutson joined a series of speakers who sought to attack Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on his foreign-policy bona fides. At one point in his speech, Hutson said Trump "called the military that I served in a disaster." It’s a barb that Clinton and her surrogates have used frequently against Trump. But how accurate is it? The remark comes from the Republican primary debate sponsored by the Fox Business Network on Jan. 14, 2016. Moderator Maria Bartiromo said, "Mr. Trump, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in her response to the State of the Union address appeared to choose sides within the party, saying Republicans should resist ‘the siren call of the angriest voices.’ She confirmed she was referring to you, among others. Was she out of line? And, how would a President Trump unite the party?" After saying he felt no ill will towards Haley, Trump said, "But she did say there was anger. And I could say, oh, I'm not angry. (But) I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. Our military is a disaster. Our health care is a horror show. Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it. We have no borders. Our vets are being treated horribly. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes, I am angry. And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry." On other occasions, Trump has specifically assailed President Barack Obama’s record -- and, by extension, that of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton -- on military spending, saying the armed forces had been cut too far. For instance, during a visit to Washington in April, Trump said, "Our active-duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time. The Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991. Pilots flying B-52s in combat missions today. These planes are older than virtually everybody in this room." (We’ve looked at similar claims here.) However, in the debate exchange with Bartiromo, Trump didn’t specify that he was talking about the military’s budget. Our ruling Trump "called the military that I served in a disaster." Trump did say that, almost verbatim. But it’s worth noting that Hutson has described Trump’s words as a personal affront to the institution he devoted his career to, drawing the most unflattering interpretation for a statement that is far less specific. Hutson’s statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7dec5c38-b6e0-4150-bf4f-5ab4ee8fec97	None	John Hutson	None	None	None	2016-07-27T21:25:16	2016-07-27	['None']
pomt-08755	"The government is trying to now close the Lincoln Memorial for any kind of large gatherings."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/27/glenn-beck/glenn-back-claims-government-is-trying-to-close-Li/	While hyping his upcoming "Restoring Honor" rally at the Lincoln Memorial, Glenn Beck ominously warned during his June 28, 2010, radio program this may be the last chance to attend a large rally at the historic Lincoln Memorial. "The government is trying to now close the Lincoln Memorial for any kind of large gatherings," Beck said. "This may be the last large gathering ever to assemble at the Lincoln Memorial. Historic, historic." The comment came in the context of Beck challenging critics -- "enemies have come out from the woodwork" -- who criticized Beck's decision to hold the rally on Aug. 28, the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s "I Have a Dream" speech, which King delivered from the same steps on which Beck plans to speak. "They (critics) have gone on to say that this is a slap in the face of Abraham Lincoln," Beck said. "Okay. So, I don't have a right -- I don't have a right to speak my mind and this -- I told you, the reason why 8-28 is -- one reason why it's historic is because it may be the last time anyone is allowed to hold a rally at 8-28, and they will -- they will couch that in, it's too sacred of a spot." In an Aug. 25, 2010, story, Los Angeles Times reporter Kathleen Hennessey quoted a National Park Service spokesman calling Beck's claim baseless and wrong. We contacted Beck's publicist for clarification of, and backup for, Beck's claim about government efforts to close the Lincoln Memorial for any kind of large gatherings, but got no response. So we, too, contacted the National Park Service and got this unequivocal statement via e-mail: "There is absolutely no attempt by the government to restrict gatherings at the Lincoln Memorial or at any of our sites," said Margie Ortiz, a National Park Service spokeswoman. "There is zero basis for his claim." The National Park Service issues about 3,000 permits a year for Lafayette Park, the White House sidewalks, as well as other park sites in the Capital area, including the Lincoln Memorial. About 60 percent of them are for "First Amendment Activity," Ortiz said. Major rehabilitation work on the Lincoln Memorial reflecting pool and grounds will begin next month, and could continue for two years, but National Park Service officials said that work will not prevent the use of the facilities for gatherings, though the size of a gathering would be considered when weighing applications during the construction period. So far, though, that has not been an issue. "The Lincoln Memorial stands as a symbol of freedom," Ortiz said. "The Memorial is an American icon that attracts millions of visitors a year who seek inspiration and hope. Why would the National Park Service close the Lincoln for any kind of large gathering? Wouldn't this be contradictory to everything the Memorial stands for?" Those wishing to hold an event at the Lincoln Memorial need to obtain a permit, and there are some rules, regulations and fees spelled out on the permit website. Some national events -- such as the Lighting of the National Christmas Tree in the northern half of the Ellipse -- carry priority status, but otherwise, applications for demonstrations and special events are done "in order of receipt ... on a first-come, first-serve basis," Ortiz said. "We remain content neutral to whatever 'message' the permit applicant brings with them." To review, Beck warned "the government is trying to now close the Lincoln Memorial for any kind of large gatherings" and that his rally "may be the last large gathering ever to assemble at the Lincoln Memorial." It is possible that gatherings as large as Beck's event may be limited during renovation of the Lincoln Memorial reflecting pool and grounds -- though no applications have been denied to date. But Beck suggests the government is trying to silence political speech by blocking future rallies, and there's absolutely no evidence of that. We rule Beck's statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-06995	Former Atlanta Public Schools Superintendent Beverly Hall left the school district "significantly better than she found it."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2011/jul/11/shirley-franklin/ex-mayor-franklin-says-former-aps-school-chief-imp/	As Beverly Hall’s beleaguered term as Atlanta Public Schools superintendent came to a close, former Mayor Shirley Franklin waxed elegiac. Franklin’s June 23 post on Blogging While Blue cast Hall’s tenure as one of collaboration and accomplishment. Hall reached out to the entire community, she said, and APS experienced "notable successes." "She leaves the school district significantly better than she found it," Franklin concluded. Wait a second. What about that cheating scandal? The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has written for years about allegations of widespread cheating at APS. Late Tuesday, the state released the results of a yearlong investigation that confirmed these reports, and then some. The test score success that rocketed Hall to national acclaim was the result of widespread cheating that may have gone on for a decade, the report said. The investigation implicated 178 educators, including 38 principals, and more than 80 confessed. Investigators confirmed cheating in 44 of 56 schools they examined, they said. District leaders knew or should have known about it, the report said. The scandal made national news. Time magazine called it "likely the largest cheating scandal in U.S. history to date." The Christian Science Monitor called it "America's biggest teacher and principal cheating scandal." APS even became a punch line on Thursday’s "Tonight Show." Jay Leno said it’s so hot he’s been sweating like an Atlanta student trying to take a test on his own. We contacted Franklin, who started her term in 2002, three years after Hall took office. She said she could not respond to our questions by deadline because she no longer has staff to assist her. "When my schedule is tight, I can't direct staff to handle one or the other of the requests," Franklin said. APS did not respond to our calls and emails. Undeterred, we switched on our Truth-O-Meter. Franklin’s post listed five reasons why schools are better off after Hall: The districtwide graduation rate increased by about 30 points. Graduates earned a record $129 million in college scholarships in 2010, up from $9 million in 2000. Philanthropic groups invested $160 million in APS. $1 billion was spent constructing and renovating schools. APS built 17 new schools and renovated more than 60 others. First, we looked at the district graduation rate. Georgia Department of Education figures show it jumped from 39 percent in the 2001-2002 school year to 66.3 percent in 2009-2010. But this dramatic increase, like the district’s skyrocketing test scores, may be fiction, according to the findings of an AJC investigation published Aug. 15. The surge took place between 2003 and 2005. During those same years, the district removed thousands of students from its rolls -- about 30 percent of all pupils in grades nine through 12, the article said. That means the district no longer included them in the graduation rate. Many were recorded as "transfers" to other systems, at times without proof they hadn’t dropped out. One consultant estimated more than one-third of those who left were not documented. District officials denied they tried to get rid of low-performing students to boost their numbers, but their credibility is questionable. One of those officials gave investigators false information during the state’s cheating investigation, Tuesday’s report alleged. Now we turn to Franklin’s claim about new infrastructure. APS reports construction projects to the state Department of Education, but not its costs, so we cannot confirm her spending figure. Records do show that since 1999, the year Hall took office, the state Department of Education approved plans to build 15 new schools and update 61. This is very close to Franklin’s count. As for Franklin’s scholarship and donation figures, the school district is not required to report them to the state, so we cannot confirm them independently. We do know that in light of the cheating scandal, there is reason to question whether APS won its donations fairly. APS received $125,000 in scholarships in 2002 as a finalist for the Broad Prize for Urban Education because of overall improvements, including test scores, according to an AJC article. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation donated money because it thought APS was on "the leading edge" in "effective teaching," a foundation spokesman told the AJC in 2010. A spokesman told the AJC that it will continue to support APS. How do we rule? The data Franklin uses to demonstrate Hall left APS "significantly better than she found it" is flawed. At least two of the statistics Franklin mentions are clouded by APS’ integrity crisis, and two are unconfirmed. That leaves school construction as the only clear-cut accomplishment of the Hall administration, and this does not outweigh the trouble the district now faces. The district has to re-educate students who received high scores they did not earn. It must replace the 178 implicated educators. Key administrators may face criminal charges, and court battles could drag on for years. A district culture that Hall shaped over 12 years needs to be gutted and rebuilt. Confirmation of massive, widespread, coordinated school cheating is more than a bombshell. It’s the H-bomb of revelations. After Hall’s term, the district’s academic reputation, culture and integrity are in ruins. How can it possibly be better off? We rate Franklin’s claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-00271	Says Republicans "just passed" the Veterans Choice program after 44 years of trying. "They've been trying to pass that one for many, many decades."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/02/donald-trump/donald-trump-gop-finally-passed-veterans-choice-af/	President Donald Trump has been barnstorming for Republicans in the midterms. On Oct. 1 he landed in Johnson City, Tenn., to help U.S. Senate candidate Marsha Blackburn, covering familiar ground about the improving economy. He touted securing $716 billion for the military, and he gave Republicans credit for giving veterans a new health care option. "We just passed Choice," Trump said. "That was 44 years, they’ve been trying to pass Choice. So that if you have to wait for nine days, 30 days, 21 days, months, you don’t do that anymore. If the line is big, and you’re unhappy, you go to a private doctor, they take care of you and we pay the bill." Trump repeated the point, saying, "They’ve been trying to pass that one for many, many decades. They couldn’t do it. We got it passed. We’re good at passing things, right?" Trump is wrong that Choice wasn’t passed until he came into office. Congress passed a new version of a Choice program in June 2018 — but the program itself has been around since 2014. After the scandal of long waits and the efforts of administrators at some facilities to cover that up, Congress and the Obama administration passed the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014. For veterans who couldn’t be given appointments quickly enough, or who lived more than 40 miles from a Veterans Health Administration hospital, the government would pay for private care. In four years, Washington spent $12 billion on the program. The bill signed by Trump, the VA Mission Act, is a major effort to fold a variety of community care programs at the VA into one integrated whole. That change won’t take place for at least a year. Until then, the law provides $5.2 billion to continue the Choice program in its present form. We reached out to the Trump administration but did not hear back. Our ruling Trump said that he and his fellow Republican "passed Choice," something that others had been trying to do for 44 years. He described the program as one that allowed veterans to get private care at government expense. The program to do exactly that has been around for four years. And it’s always been referred to as Choice. We rate this claim False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2018-10-02T15:02:31	2018-10-01	['None']
pomt-08999	On whether BP's $20 billion fund to compensate oil spill victims is "a slush fund."	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/13/sharron-angle/sharron-angle-flip-flops-bp-oil-spill-slush-fund/	Sharron Angle, the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Nevada, was a guest on a radio show recently when a caller expressed surprise that the government could pressure oil company BP to create a "slush fund" to pay claims. Angle agreed. "No, government shouldn"t be doing that to a private company, and I think you named it clearly. It"s a slush fund," she said during the appearance on the Alan Stock News Show on KNXT radio in Las Vegas on July 7, 2010. As you may recall, Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, used similar language last month. Apologizing to BP for what he called a "shakedown," he also referred to the $20 billlion as a slush fund. But other Republicans, including House Minority Leader John Boehner, promptly distanced themselves from his remarks. "I have said from the beginning that BP ought to be held responsible for every dime of this tragedy. And they ought to be held accountable to stop the leak and get it cleaned up as soon as possible," said Boehner. "BP agreed to fund the cost of this cleanup, and I'm glad they're being held accountable." Barton then apologized for his apology, saying that he believed BP should be held accountable for the accident. Angle's comments came a month later, but it didn"t take long for her to distance herself from her own remarks. By the close of business the next day, Angle"s campaign issued a statement entilted "Setting the record straight about BP and the Obama Administration." "Having had some time to think about it, the caller and I shouldn"t have used the term ‘slush fund"; that was incorrect," said the "Statement from Sharron Angle." "My position is that the creation of this fund to compensate victims was an important first step -- BP caused this disaster and they should pay for it. But there are multiple parties at fault here and there should be a thorough investigation. We need to look into the actions (or inactions) of the Administration and why the regulatory agency in charge of oversight was asleep at the wheel while BP was cutting corners. Every party involved should be held fully accountable." We"ve seen some artful flips, but rarely are they executed so fully -- and quickly. Our rating: Full Flop!

pomt-05924	Students today "take more years to get through" college.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/30/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-students-today-take-more-years-/	Newt Gingrich says too many college students are slackers. During a campaign event in Stuart, Fla., on Jan. 28, 2012, Newt Gingrich said college students are taking too long to graduate. "Students take fewer classes per semester. They take more years to get through. Why? Because they have free money," Gingrich said. "I would tell students: ‘Get through as quick as you can. Borrow as little as you can. Have a part-time job.’ But that’s very different from the culture that has grown up in the last 20 years." We wondered whether the statistics showed that students are indeed taking longer to graduate than they did in the past. So we looked into it. We turned to figures on post-secondary education compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics, a division of the U.S. Department of Education. As it turns out, the trend for four-year colleges is exactly the opposite. Percent of bachelor’s degree-seeking students completing bachelor's degrees within four years after start, at all four-year institutions Students starting college in ... Percent graduating in four years 1996 33.7 1997 34.1 1998 34.5 1999 35.3 2000 36.1 2001 36.2 2002 39.3 So the percentage of students completing degrees within four years has actually risen incrementally in recent years. Between the graduating classes of 2000 and 2006, the percentage of students graduating in four years increased by one-sixth. So where four-year colleges are concerned, Gingrich’s comment is off the mark. But Gingrich has a point in regard to two-year institutions. Percent completing certificates or associate's degrees within 150 percent of normal time, all two-year institutions Students starting college in ... Percent who graduated in three years 1999 29.3 2000 30.5 2001 30.0 2002 29.3 2003 29.1 2004 27.8 2005 27.5 So for two-year institutions, the rate did fall slightly, though by less than what the rate for four-year institutions rose. Christopher Swanson, the vice president for research and development at Editorial Projects in Education, the publisher of Education Week, said that in general, education experts haven’t been worried so much that the trendlines for college completion are going in the wrong direction. "The main narrative you hear about (concerns) the low completion rates in general," he said. On that score, he said, "there doesn’t seem to be a whole lot to write home about." Swanson did take issue with the general tenor of Gingrich’s comments -- that you should borrow as little as you can and instead get a job if you want to increase the likelihood that you’ll finish college on time. "That seems to fly in the face of what I think is a pretty well-established finding from the research that working during college or post-secondary education tends to be detrimental in terms of completion (that is, that you’re less likely to complete) and time to completion (that it takes longer)," Swanson said. "There may be any number of issues and problems with excessive student borrowing, but being able to borrow for college does allow students the opportunity to focus more exclusively on their school work than would probably have been the case otherwise. If you follow the don’t borrow/get a job argument and play that out a bit, that sounds a lot like what happens as a matter of course in community colleges. And the completion rates there are extremely low, on the order of one-third completing within an extended timeline." Our ruling Gingrich said that students today "take more years to get through" college. While graduation rates are lower than experts would like them to be, it's not true that students are taking longer to graduate from four-year institutions. The percentage graduating on time at four-year colleges has actually risen consistently in recent years. The only exception to this pattern is at two-year colleges, where the percentage of students graduating within three years has fallen slightly. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/670cf7ee-39a3-41a7-9d3a-e6c3459864a0	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2012-01-30T16:49:30	2012-01-28	['None']
pomt-01532	"Much more than 50 percent of parents out there are spankers."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/17/donald-trump/trump-more-half-parents-spank-their-kids/	The furor over Minnesota Vikings running back Adrian Peterson and his admission that he struck his 4-year-old son with a wooden switch has put parenting and corporal punishment in the spotlight. Peterson has said he grew up treated the same way by his parents. The Vikings pulled Peterson from the team’s active roster while his case moves through the courts. During a Sept. 17 broadcast on ESPN’s Mike and Mike, billionaire Donald Trump waded into the debate. While saying that he was never a "spanker," which is less severe than Peterson’s offense, Trump said there’s no simple response because many parents physically discipline their kids and they turn out "good." "It's a pretty tough thing because I saw something last night that much more than 50 percent of people out there and parents out there are spankers," Trump said. We thought it would be worthwhile to check if spanking is as common as Trump said. In large measure, the data says it is. A 2013 study by Columbia University researchers found that 57 percent of mothers and 40 percent of fathers engaged in spanking when children were age three, and 52 percent of mothers and 33 percent of fathers engaged in spanking at age five. Disadvantaged families represented a large share of the survey group but the results are consistent with other studies. A 1999 article in Clinical Child and Family Psychology Review reported that 72 percent of parents of children between the ages of two and four said they sometimes spanked their kids. A 2002 poll commissioned by ABC News asked a random sample of adults if they had ever spanked their children. Over half of them said they had. That ABC survey showed an interesting regional difference. In the South, 62 percent of parents said they spank their children. For the rest of the country, the fraction dropped to 41 percent. We should note that pediatricians as a group strongly discourage spanking. They cite evidence that ties it to behavioral problems and lower school performance. The spanking label covers a lot of ground. Some parents hit harder and more often than others. To talk simply of spanking masks important differences in how parents treat their children. Our ruling Speaking about the Peterson case, Trump said that much more than 50 percent of parents are spankers. In this fact-check, we’re not judging whether spanking is akin to what Peterson did, we’re simply verifying Trump’s statistic. He’s close. We found two polls that put the fraction a bit over half, rather than "much more." But that aside, Trump is largely correct within a broad definition of spanking. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-06089	Says Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker eliminated "cancer screenings for uninsured women" and offered "no alternatives."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jan/06/gwen-moore/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-ended-planned-parenthoo/	Twice on Dec. 27, 2011, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis., accused Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker of eliminating a cancer-screening program for low-income women. "Scott Walker cuts cancer screenings for uninsured women, offers no alternatives," read Moore’s first statement on Twitter, the online messaging site that has some 200 million account holders. "Walker kills women’s cancer screening program for political gain," her second tweet claimed. In the messages, Moore cited two website articles about the state Well Woman program. Among other things, it provides tests for cancer for low-income women who don’t have insurance that covers such screenings. The articles refer to Walker canceling a state contract with Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, which provides services related to the cancer screenings in four counties -- Winnebago, Fond du Lac, Outagamie and Sheboygan -- between Milwaukee and Green Bay. In the vast majority of Wisconsin’s 72 counties, a county health department serves as the local coordinator for the screenings. But since the program was started in 1995, Planned Parenthood has had what now is a $130,000-per-year state contract to serve as coordinator in the four counties. In that role, Planned Parenthood uses two employees to help women sign up for and receive the cancer screenings. In 2010, 715 women in the four counties were served, according to the state Department of Health Services. So did Walker kill a cancer-screening program for poor women? In a word: No. 1. The contract in question was for helping women sign up for and get the screenings, not the screenings themselves. The screenings are separate. Some are done by Planned Parenthood, but they also are done by other health care providers. 2.Walker’s administration did end Planned Parenthood’s contract -- but neither the assistance Planned Parenthood provided, nor the screenings themselves, ever ended. Indeed, the change put the four counties on par with how the program is handled in most of the rest of the state. When we asked Moore spokeswoman Nicole Williams if she had additional evidence to back Moore’s charges against Walker, she provided a news release from Planned Parenthood. But that release made clear both the assistance and the screenings would continue. So let’s see how Moore, who counts Planned Parenthood as an ally, got it all wrong. Walker moves to end contract Walker and Planned Parenthood are political foes. Planned Parenthood’s services -- unrelated to the Well Woman program -- include abortion, which Walker opposes. And two weeks before losing its contract, the organization announced its support of the campaign to recall Walker from office in 2012. Walker earlier in 2011 moved to cut Planned Parenthood’s public funding for family planning services. Controversy over the contract surfaced in December 2011. Dec. 1, 2011: The state health department, according to Planned Parenthood, notifies Planned Parenthood by phone that its contract would end effective Jan. 1, 2012. So, it’s clear the Walker administration abruptly ended the longtime contract -- but that didn’t mean an end to the cancer screenings or the assistance that Planned Parenthood was providing in the four counties. Dec. 23, 2011: The state health department announces that Winnebago County would take over the screening assistance in the four counties and that there would be a transition.(The news release did not mention that the assistance would be transitioned from Planned Parenthood.) So, the state made it clear the cancer screening-related services would continue. The change to Winnebago County puts the four counties in the same position as nearly all other counties in that a local health department, rather than a private agency such as Planned Parenthood, will serve as the local coordinator. But again, that’s not ending the screenings, which was Moore’s claim. Dec. 27, 2011: On the day Moore issued her tweets, Planned Parenthood announces it had agreed to continue providing assistance for the screenings for 60 days past the end of its contract. So, Planned Parenthood itself made it clear that neither the screenings nor the assistance in getting the screenings would end. How Moore went wrong Moore used as her tweets, almost word for word, the headlines from the two website articles she linked to in the tweets. Both articles incorrectly reported that Walker had ended entirely the screenings in question. Moore’s spokeswoman said Moore’s tweets were merely relating what the articles said. But neither article was from a straight news source. And Moore is responsible for stating bad information, even if it came from another source. That’s the approach PolitiFact has consistently taken, with Democrats and Republicans alike. A Dec. 17, 2011, Forbes.com article Moore cited was written by a contributor who took the stance that Walker was playing politics with the contract. And a Dec. 20 article she linked to was written by the left-leaning Huffington Post political website. As for why Planned Parenthood’s contract was canceled, Walker explained his decision, in a news article his spokesman provided to us, by saying: "There are many clinics that are not as controversial as Planned Parenthood, and our goal was to make sure low-income women had access to those sorts of screenings from other providers around the state that don't carry the controversy you get with Planned Parenthood." Doug Gieryn, director of the Winnebago County Health Department, told us that local health officials were happy with Planned Parenthood’s work and upset that the state ended its contract. But as for Moore’s claim that Walker eliminated the cancer screenings, Gieryn said: "That’s inaccurate." And by quite a lot. Our conclusion Moore said Walker eliminated "cancer screenings for uninsured women" in four Wisconsin counties and offered "no alternatives." But all Walker eliminated was a contract with Planned Parenthood for assisting women in getting the screenings. And the screenings never ended -- nor did the assistance Planned Parenthood provided. Moore’s claim was false and ridiculous -- our definition of Pants on Fire. (Editor's note: In the original version of this story, published Jan. 6, 2012, we stated Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin does not provide the actual cancer screenings. Planned Parenthood does offer the screenings separately from the contract that was canceled, which involved helping women sign up for the screenings. )	None	Gwen Moore	None	None	None	2012-01-06T09:00:00	2011-12-27	['Scott_Walker_(politician)']

pomt-11357	"We’ve started building the wall."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/04/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-claims-border-wall-under-cons/	President Donald Trump claimed his administration has kicked off one of his landmark campaign promises: the construction of a border wall with Mexico. "We have to have strong borders. We need the wall. We’ve started building the wall, as you know, we have a $1.6 billion toward building the wall and fixing existing wall that’s falling down, it was never appropriate in the first place," Trump said standing next to Baltic leaders during an April 3 press conference. Trump made similar remarks in Ohio on March 29: "We started building our wall. I'm so proud of it. We started. … We have $1.6 billion." And on March 28 tweeted pictures of construction work at the border and wrote, "Great briefing this afternoon on the start of our Southern Border WALL!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Trump’s words leave the impression that construction is underway for the border wall he promised, and that $1.6 billion is helping pay for it. That’s not the case. There are projects underway along parts of the border to improve or replace fencing, but none of that includes any of the eight border wall prototypes ordered by the Trump administration. In fact, U.S. Customs and Border Protection told PolitiFact this week that a prototype has not been selected. The White House did not respond on the record to our request for comment. $1.6 billion is for fencing, not border wall Trump reluctantly signed a $1.3 trillion omnibus spending bill on March 23 that he threatened to veto in part because his promised border wall was "not fully funded." The bill included $1.6 billion for some projects at the border, but none of that can be used toward the border wall promised during the presidential campaign. The bill said the designated funds "shall only be available for operationally effective designs deployed as of the date of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2017" (May 5, 2017), "such as currently deployed steel bollard designs, that prioritize agent safety." The specific uses are: • $251 million for approximately 14 miles of secondary fencing along the southwest border in the San Diego sector; • $445 million for 25 miles of primary pedestrian levee fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector; • $196 million for primary pedestrian fencing along the southwest border in the Rio Grande Valley Sector; • $445 million for replacement of existing primary pedestrian fencing along the southwest border; • $38 million for border barrier planning and design; and • $196 million for acquisition and deployment of border security technology "This is replacing and improving existing fences," said Sanho Tree, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, a left-leaning think tank. According to Los Angeles Times reporting, the photos Trump shared in his March 28 tweet about "the start of our southern border WALL" were for the replacement of an estimated 2.25-mile border wall in Calexico, Calif., built in the 1990s using recycled scraps of metal and old landing mat. That barrier is being replaced with a 30-foot high bollard-style wall. Plans for that replacement began in 2009 and were funded in 2017, the newspaper reported. The Los Angeles Times quoted Jonathan Pacheco, a spokesman for the Border Patrol’s El Centro Sector as having said earlier in March: "First and foremost, this isn’t Trump’s wall. This isn’t the infrastructure that Trump is trying to bring in. … This new wall replacement has absolutely nothing to do with the prototypes that were shown over in the San Diego area." Customs and Border Protection issued a news release March 30 headlined, "Border Wall Construction Underway." The release said the $1.6 billion funding would provide for the construction of about 100 miles of new border wall. It uses the term "border wall" to refer to fencing and other structures, not the prototypes Trump has touted. It highlights, among other construction, the 20-mile replacement of primary vehicle barrier in Santa Teresa, N.M.; the replacement in San Diego of 14 miles of outdated steel plate barrier with a bollard structure; the replacement of at least two miles of border barrier in Calexico with 30-foot bollard wall; and four miles of bollard wall in El Paso. "We’re building 35 new gates along a stretch of 55 miles of existing border wall," acting deputy commissioner Ronald Vitiello said in the release. Trump's claim "not only conflates walls and fences, but also plays into Trump's false narrative that there are not already barriers along much of the border," said Hannah R. Gurman, a clinical associate professor at New York University who has researched the history of U.S. immigration enforcement and its intersection with criminal prosecution. As far as the prototypes go, it’s uncertain if one of them will be built at the border as designed. The Department of Homeland Security "does not anticipate" that a single prototype will be selected as the design standard for future border wall construction, said Customs and Border Protection spokesman Carlos Diaz. "Rather, the eight different prototypes are each anticipated to inform future border wall design standards in some capacity," Diaz told PolitiFact April 2. Diaz said the agency has tested, assessed and evaluated the prototypes to determine which of them most effectively stops illegal crossings. Evaluators have proposed new features to add to CBP’s "toolkit" of border wall designs, Diaz said. PolitiFact’s Trump-O-Meter is tracking Trump’s promise to build a border wall and make Mexico pay for it. It rates In the Works because the promise has been proposed or is being considered. Our ruling Trump said, "We’ve started building the wall." There are projects underway to replace existing border fencing and to add some new barriers. But it’s disingenuous to claim they amount to the border wall Trump has long promised. A recent appropriation of $1.6 billion allows the replacement of existing fencing, but not the construction of any sort of wall prototype. CBP said the prototypes will be used "to inform" future design standards. We rate Trump’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-08145	"We are giving almost $2 billion of taxpayer money to the junk food and fast food industries every year to make the (childhood obesity) epidemic worse."	false	/ohio/statements/2010/dec/06/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-assails-tax-deductions-fast-fo/	Childhood obesity in the United States has more than tripled the last 30 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and the American Heart Association. It has reached epidemic levels and increased risks for heart disease, diabetes, stroke, cancer and osteoarthritis. The inactivity associated with watching television has long taken much of the blame. But a recent UCLA study reported in the American Journal of Public Health found that commercials, not TV itself, were the link to obesity. In fact, it found no association with television viewing and obesity for those who watched videos or commercial-free programming. For Rep. Dennis Kucinich, the implication is clear: Taxpayers are subsidizing the obesity epidemic by providing tax breaks to the food industry for marketing fast food and junk food to children. "We are giving almost $2 billion of taxpayer money to the junk food and fast food industries every year to make the (childhood obesity) epidemic worse," he said in a news release Nov. 10. That whet our appetite for curiosity. So PolitiFact Ohio sank its teeth into Kucinich’s claim that taxpayer dollars are used to market to bad food to children. On the ills of fast food and marketing efforts, Kucinich cited a new study from the Rudd Center for Food Policy and Obesity at Yale University: "The research is clear. Eating fast food harms young people’s health," the study says. And it concludes that efforts to market fast food to children are both effective and rapidly expanding. The fast food industry spent more than $4.2 billion in 2009 on TV commercials and radio, magazine, outdoor and other ads, the Rudd study said. The industry spent nearly $2 billion in 2006 on marketing and advertising specifically aimed at children, according to a report to Congress from Federal Trade Commission. But how do taxpayers subsidize that? That answer is simple. Fast food marketers get the same break that other businesses do. The federal tax code allows companies to deduct "reasonable and necessary" expenses of marketing and advertising from their income taxes. That doesn’t sit well with Kucinich when the marketing targets kids. The Cleveland Democrat introduced a bill, HR 4310, to eliminate that tax deduction. The bill attracted 28 co-sponsors and has been referred to the Ways and Means Committee. Kucinich's bill would prohibit any company from claiming a tax deduction for the expense of marketing fast food to children. Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation estimated "on a very preliminary basis" that the legislation could raise $15 billion to $19 billion in additional federal revenue over the 10-year budget period -- "which is almost 2 billion per year," said Kucinich’s press aide. A revenue estimate from the Joint Committee is treated as confidential unless released by the member of Congress who requested it. Confidentiality allows the committee staff to maintain its nonpartisan role in the policy process. Kucinich’s office gave us a copy of the staff letter with the committee’s estimate, but we were unable to get background details. But the letter notes that a number of unsettled issues surround the bill -- ranging from defining "fast food restaurant" or "food of a poor nutritional quality" to determining what constitutes advertising that is "primarily aimed at" children -- and all of those issues would affect the bill’s impact (including the amount of new tax revenue). The committee’s estimate clearly covered more than the child-oriented fast food advertising in the 2006 FTC survey. At the top corporate tax rate of 35 percent, the $2 billion cited in that report would have yielded about $700 million in additional tax revenue. A study from the National Bureau of Economic Research does support Kucinich’s assertion that eliminating the tax break would reduce the number of overweight children. Eliminating the tax deduction would reduce the number of overweight children by 5 to 7 percent, it said, and banning advertising to children would prompt an even larger reduction. So where does that leave us on Kucinich’s assertion? Kucinich inflated the tax revenue benefits of his bill, rounding up from the high end of the Joint Committee on Taxation’s soft and "very preliminary" estimate. That revenue estimate is nearly triple the tax benefit that would be generated by the firmest number we found for advertising specifically aimed at children, the $2 billion figure in the 2006 FTC study. Regardless of which estimate is best, Kucinich’s assertion that fast food marketers are using "almost $2 billion of taxpayer money" is off base. It’s not tax revenue that’s being spent. Rather, it’s an estimate of money the fast food industry didn’t have to pay in taxes as a result of deductions for business expenses that every business can take. Childhood obesity is a serious topic and the congressman may be nobly intentioned. But dollar figure he uses is shaky at best and his description of the money as taxpayer dollars is misleading. That’s why we rate Kucinich’s claim as False.	None	Dennis Kucinich	None	None	None	2010-12-06T06:00:00	2010-11-10	['None']

pomt-10146	John McCain's health care plan "leaves you on your own to pay McCain’s health insurance tax."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/03/barack-obama/health-care-ad-is-right----until-the-end/	A new ad from Barack Obama attacks John McCain's health care plan. "John McCain talks about a $5,000 tax credit for health care," an announcer says. "But here’s what he’s not telling you. McCain would make you pay income tax on your health insurance benefits. Taxing health benefits for the first time ever. And that tax credit? McCain’s own Web site said it goes straight to the insurance companies, not to you, leaving you on your own to pay McCain’s health insurance tax. Taxing health care instead of fixing it. We can’t afford John McCain." The ad has a good bit of truth in it, but the notion that it leaves you "on your own" to pay a new tax on insurance is deceptive. Let's back up a minute, though, to explain a few features of current health care policy and how McCain's proposal would change it. Most Americans who have health insurance — about 71 percent — get it through their employer. Usually, the premiums are split so that the employer pays part and the employee pays part. Strictly speaking, the part that the employer pays is considered compensation and workers would owe taxes on it if there wasn't a tax exemption in federal law. The exemption makes employer-provided health insurance more attractive to both workers and employers. McCain wants to improve the health care system by encouraging greater competition for health insurance. His idea is that people should be able to go out on the open market and buy their own health insurance, and not be pushed into an employer-provided insurance plan by tax incentives. So under McCain's plan, the tax exemption for employer provided health insurance would disappear, and people would get a tax credit of $2,500 per person ($5,000 for couples) to spend on any health insurance they wish. They might choose to use their employer's plan and use the tax credit to offset the new tax on the benefit, or they might go off and buy insurance on their own. At times, the McCain campaign has touted the credit without mentioning the proposed repeal of the tax exemption on employer-provided insurance. (For an example, see the exchange on health care insurance between Sarah Palin and Joe Biden during the vice presidential debate on Oct. 3, 2008.) The ad reminds viewers — fairly, in our view — about the end of the tax exemption, an important part of the overall McCain plan. But then the ad says, "McCain’s own Web site said it goes straight to the insurance companies, not to you, leaving you on your own to pay McCain’s health insurance tax." McCain's Web site does say that, but there's an excellent reason that the credit goes to the insurance companies. It's so people don't blow the tax credit on cigarettes and beer (or whatever else they'd like) instead of health insurance. Under McCain's plan, workers would pay taxes on the health exemption, but they would get $2,500 knocked off their health insurance bill. If workers come out ahead and there's money left over, that would go into a health spending account for them to spend on health-related incidentals. It's a complex switcheroo, but there's ample evidence to show that the plan would be a wash for most workers. The McCain campaign says only workers with "gold-plated" health programs would do worse. An independent analysis from the nonpartisan Urban Institute confirms that: "In general, lower-income people with health insurance would receive benefits from the credit that would be well in excess of the value that they receive from today’s tax exemption. The gains are much smaller for higher-income people." So the Obama ad gets its particulars correct, but ends with an unfair assertion. McCain's health plan does not leave you "on your own to pay McCain’s health insurance tax." We rate Obama's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05504	"This rule could prevent children under 18 from using such tools as a power screwdriver, a milking machine or something as simple as a wheelbarrow on the family farm . . . "	mostly false	/tennessee/statements/2012/apr/15/lamar-alexander/lamar-alexander-says-child-farm-labor-rules-could-/	Update (April 27, 2012): On Thursday, the Department of Labor withdrew the proposed changes to the child labor rule in response to opposition from lawmakers and farmers. It actually came out just hours after our partners at PolitiFact Florida had posted a ruling on a similar claim by Florida Congressman Tom Rooney. A Department of Labor press release dated April 26 reads: "The decision to withdraw this rule – including provisions to define the 'parental exemption' – was made in response to thousands of comments expressing concerns about the effect of the proposed rules on small family-owned farms. To be clear, this regulation will not be pursued for the duration of the Obama administration." It added that the department will instead work with rural stakeholders to develop a program to promote safety. The Department of Labor’s announcement -- while good news for Alexander and Rooney and others who opposed the rule -- does not affect our rating in this fact-check. Alexander and Rooney failed to prove that children working on farms would be banned from operating a battery-powered screwdriver or a pressurized garden hose, and the Department of Labor specifically said those activities would not be prohibited under the proposed rule. --------------- Tennessee’s senior senator has co-sponsored a bill to prevent the Department of Labor from enacting proposed rules regarding child labor in agricultural settings. He says the rules are over the top – they "take the cake," he says – and take "job opportunities from our nation’s youth." Alexander is talking about proposed changes in the Fair Labor Standards Act regarding child labor on farms that take up 49 pages of fine print in the Federal Register published on Sept. 2 of last year. According to a Dec. 12, 2011, post from U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack, "We want to ensure that children of farm families maintain their ability to help with the family farm, while working to prevent unnecessary child injuries or deaths." According to Vilsack, "while only 4 percent of working youth are in the agriculture sector, 40 percent of fatalities of working kids are associated with machines, equipment, or facilities related to agriculture." So we decided to look at whether the proposed rules would prohibit some kid under 18 from carting a load of alfalfa to the manger or tightening up a license plate on a pickup before heading out on the blacktop. First, we asked Alexander’s office specifically for support for his contention that the bill would prevent children from using a power screwdriver or wheelbarrows. Alexander spokesman Jim Jeffries cautioned that the senator only said "could," not "would," but he also provided the text of the rule dealing with unpowered conveyances that he says could apply to wheelbarrows: "The proposed Ag H.O. would prohibit hired farm workers under 16 years of age from operating and assisting in the operation of hoisting apparatus and conveyors that are not power-driven but run on human power or gravity, including manlifts and boatswain-chair-type devices often used in grain storage operations." It goes on to spell things out in even more specific detail, though never mentions wheelbarrows. It’s pretty arcane stuff and there’s a lot of legalese in the proposed rules, making them an easy target for ridicule, but it is a serious set of rules. The release finishes by claiming: "It would even ban youth from operating a battery-powered screwdriver or a pressurized garden hose." When Alexander’s office pointed to the rules themselves for support, we looked them over. A search for "milking equipment" did quickly lead to a section listing various kinds of "power-driven machinery" that could not be used by working children and student learners (like kids with 4-H and Future Farmers of America) and milking equipment was not only listed but singled out for explanation. The section says that "a study of 988 worker's compensation claims among dairy farms in Colorado found that milking parlor tasks represented 48% of injuries among dairy workers and indicated the worker was performing a milking activity at the time of the injury." However, the third sentence of the first paragraph of the summary of the proposed rules changes, as published by the DOL, reads as follows: "The proposed agricultural revisions would impact only hired farm workers and in no way compromise the statutory child labor parental exemption involving children working on farms owned or operated by their parents." So, no matter the government rules, if a parent with some ownership in the farm tells a child to crank up the milking machine, there’s nothing to prohibit it. That seems like an important and broad exception, given that the bill sponsored by Alexander and 44 others has as its title: "Preserving America's Family Farm Act." If you’re working your own parent’s farm, the new rules don’t apply at all, and the act also contains many exemptions for programs, like 4-H, aimed at giving youth experience working on farms. If Alexander meant some other family’s farm, where the child is a paid laborer, it’s worth noting that The Child Labor Coalition pointed out there were 16 fatal injuries in 2011 of children working under the age of 16 -- 12 of them involving crop production. The Department of Labor has come under significant attack for this attempt to more closely align child labor rules on farms with labor rules for other work, and it has responded by saying it believes it has a public duty to look after child laborers being paid to work on a farm not belonging to their parent. Technically, the new rules don’t specifically mention screwdrivers, wheelbarrows or garden hoses. The Department of Labor told us the rules would not in fact prevent their use by children working on a farm. "There is no part of Senator Alexander’s press release that accurately reflects the proposed rule," a spokesperson for the Department of Labor wrote in an email. The department also points out there has been substantial time for public review, and it will take into consideration the huge amount of feedback the rules have received. As with a lot of commentary on alleged over-regulation and government overreach into the realm of private business, we suspected there might be more to Alexander’s and many others’ concerns that do not involve wheelbarrows full of alfalfa or showing Bessie off at the county fair. Might the pushback be related to migrant child labor employed by big agribusiness concerns? Typical of the more than 4,100 written submissions from the public are those from Cliff and Bertha Gardner of Ruby Valley, Nev., who wrote: "This rule will have a dramatic effect on our Ranching Operation. We will not be able to work our Grandchildren, Nieces and Nephews. It is much better to teach these young people to work at an early age than have them getting into trouble in town because there is nothing to do." David Arbogast, in his public submission to the DOL, skated a little closer to what really may be at stake for big agribusiness interests when he asked, "Could this proposal also be racially motivated to further block Latino children from working the fields with their parents? Again, the government has no business meddling in the family’s parenting duties." The American Farm Bureau Federation’s submission, the Washington-based non-profit promoting agriculture, asked that the federal rules not duplicate regulations on the books at the state level. In Washington State, it points out, minors as young as 12 pick strawberries and farms hire teachers, school bus drivers "and others in the supervision of the minor work crews." In California, it notes, minors 12 and 13 may work in agriculture up to 8 hours a day and 40 hours a week "on non-school days." It turns out many children work in agribusiness enterprises side by side with impoverished migrant worker adults, and a lot of them get injured. While it may be quaint, the image of a farm boy in overalls may be a misleading focus for rules seeking to address the reality of child labor on those farms that actually generate most of the nation’s food. The last week of March was National Farmworker Awareness Week, some of it focused on child labor. A peer-reviewed article in the journal of the American Academy of Pediatrics noted: "Relatively few adolescents are employed on farms compared with other types of industry, yet the proportion of fatalities in agriculture is higher than that for any other type of adolescent employment." Clearly, the rationale for the upgraded standards is a concern for the welfare of young workers and for minimizing specific workplace injuries the department has investigated. That’s what the rules actually say; they’re based on actual injuries. The report in some sections is not for the squeamish, detailing sometimes gruesome injuries and deaths like youths chewed up in various kinds of machinery. Such concerns date to the turn of the last century and are memorialized in the findings of the National Institutes for Occupational Safety and Health which routinely look at promoting safe work conditions for young workers. You can see an example of the agency’s concern from 1999 here. "The reason the labor laws are in place is…because there have been kids who have been hurt," said Diane E. Bush, coordinator of the Labor Occupational Health Program at the University of California-Berkeley. "Most people think of the workplace as a safe place where young people are going to learn responsibility and it will have a positive impact on them. "It’s important to make sure they’re working in an environment where that’s going to happen, rather than ending up with a serious or even worse, a fatal injury." Our ruling The proposed rules could limit the kinds of potentially dangerous work children might perform on "family" farms owned by someone else’s family. To make their point, however, Alexander and many others are not mentioning the parental exemption and then using examples of some activities the labor department says are not the target of its revised rules. The proposed rules are aimed at protecting children involved in agribusiness, not at children learning farming from their flannel-clad dads. We find the orchestrated criticism misleading and rule Alexander’s statement Mostly False.	None	Lamar Alexander	None	None	None	2012-04-15T06:00:00	2012-03-22	['None']
pomt-11449	Says Sen. Tammy Baldwin "claims to support a 'Buy America' philosophy, but her actions speak louder than her empty words."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/mar/12/leah-vukmir/Vukmir-misfires-on-Baldwin-trade-barb/	Global trade is a hot button issue that got even hotter when President Donald Trump announced on March 1, 2018 that he would impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. In a tweet, Trump framed it this way: "Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world. We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer. We want free, fair and SMART TRADE!" That harkened back to Trump’s inauguration speech, when he declared: "We will follow two simple rules: ‘Buy American and hire American.’" U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, has touted a similar Buy American theme, and has introduced a bill to require the use of U.S. steel and iron on some government water projects. Indeed, during an April 2017 visit to Snap-On in Kenosha, Trump endorsed Baldwin’s legislation: "I support the concept of everything from the U.S. I’m very much into that and I agree with her 100 percent." Meanwhile, state Sen. Leah Vukmir of Brookfield, a Republican who hopes to challenge Baldwin in November 2018, has trashed Baldwin’s "Buy American" record as "empty words." In an op-ed piece posted Jan. 25, 2018, on the Daily Caller website, Vukmir argued Baldwin’s support for Buy American is more show than substance. Vukmir’s piece read, in part: Senator Baldwin and her colleagues in Washington were given a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reform an outdated, broken and costly tax code that discouraged job growth and investment in America, failed to reward the middle-class or boost economic growth, and lined the pockets of Washington D.C. special interests, all at the expense of hard-working citizens and small businesses. She claims to support a "Buy America" philosophy, but her actions speak louder than her empty words. Is it true, as Vukmir claims, that Baldwin supports a proposal at the same time she is undermining it with her votes? The supporting evidence When asked to provide backup to support the "actions speak louder than her empty words" claim, Vukmir communications staffer Mattias Gugel wrote: "When it comes to helping Wisconsin’s middle class and making America more competitive through pro-growth policies like tax reform, repealing Davis–Bacon and right to work, Sen. Baldwin stands in the way every single time." Here are brief explanations of those references: Tax reform: In December 2017, Trump signed into law a $1.5 trillion tax bill, capping a yearlong effort by the White House and Republicans in Congress to cut tax rates for corporations and individuals. The legislation marked the first major reform of the American tax system in more than 30 years. Baldwin labeled the plan a "giveaway to the wealthiest few" and voted against the measure Davis-Bacon: The Davis-Bacon Act of 1931 is a federal law that requires local "prevailing wage" pay for laborers and mechanics on public works projects. It applies to "contractors and subcontractors performing on federally funded or assisted contracts in excess of $2,000 for the construction, alteration, or repair (including painting and decorating) of public buildings or public works." Conservative Republicans have tried to repeal Davis-Bacon, but the provision has the strong backing of the trades unions, as well as Democrats, including Baldwin, along with many moderate Republicans. Right-to-work: These provisions exist in 28 states, including Wisconsin. In general, they provide that employees in unionized workplaces may not be compelled to join a union, nor compelled to pay for any part of the cost of union representation, while generally receiving the same benefits as union members who do contribute. Baldwin opposed the "right-to-work" measure in 2015 when it was approved in Wisconsin, arguing it would "weaken the economic security of hard working middle class families." So, Baldwin has opposed the three measures. But each of those examples applies more broadly to economic-related matters than to a specific Buy American plan, which was the subject of Vukmir’s claim. And, if related matters are tallied on one side of the ledger, it’s only fair to look at other actions by Baldwin. The other side of the coin Baldwin made the "Buy American" legislation a highlight of the first TV ads in her re-election campaign. They began running Feb. 27, 2018. In an email, campaign spokesman Bill Neidhardt cited a series of additional measures specifically related to Buy American: 1. As a member of the House of Representatives, Baldwin introduced the CHEATS Act during the 112th Congress (2011-2012). The measure, which did not pass, would have allowed the U.S. to impose duties on Chinese imports that were receiving illegal subsidies from the Chinese government, allowing them to undercut the prices of Wisconsin’s manufacturers. 2. During the 115th Congress (2017-2018), Baldwin introduced a bill to require the president to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. The TPP, put in place under President Barack Obama, was a 12-nation agreement among the United States and Pacific-rim countries that was designed in part to counter China’s rising dominance of the region. Shortly after taking office in January 2017, Trump formally abandoned the agreement. Baldwin had labeled TPP "a bad deal for American workers." "Instead of creating an even playing field, this deal increases the global race to the bottom in worker pay," Baldwin said in a Jan. 23, 2017, news release. "American manufacturing jobs will continue to go abroad as Buy American rules are further eroded." 3. In addition, on Feb. 20, 2018 Baldwin announced the Made in American Shipbuilding Act, which would require any vessel that was paid for with U.S. taxpayer dollars to be constructed with American parts and by American workers. (A footnote: When we asked Baldwin for her position on Trump’s tariff plan, she took a tempered approach, saying she supports sending a "strong message to bad actors" like Russia and China, but fears a blanket tariff could start a trade war that could hurt Wisconsin manufacturers and the state's agricultural economy.) Our rating Vukmir said Baldwin "claims to support a ‘Buy American’ philosophy, but her actions speak louder than her empty words." Vukmir cited several broad matters that relate to the economy, but none that specifically applied to undermining Buy American initiatives. Meanwhile, Baldwin has been engaged with other "Buy American" actions. Indeed, at times her views seem to align with Trump’s "America First" policies. We rate Vukmir’s claim False.

pomt-12434	"Law firm @POTUS used to show he has no ties to Russia was named Russia Law Firm of the Year for their extensive ties to Russia. Unreal."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/16/chris-murphy/donald-trump-chris-murphy-russian-law-firm-year/	President Donald Trump made public a letter from his tax attorneys on May 12 saying Trump’s tax returns from the past decade contain no undisclosed income from Russian sources. That same day, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., found what was a too-good-to-pass-up irony about the firm Trump used to write the letter. "Law firm @POTUS used to show he has no ties to Russia was named Russia Law Firm of the Year for their extensive ties to Russia. Unreal," Murphy said in a May 12 tweet. The post was certainly popular -- it has been retweeted 56,000 times as of the writing of this fact-check. It also elicited an eye-rolling .GIF from Sen. Bob Casey, D-Penn. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Given the continued interest in possible links between Trump and Russia, we decided to look into Murphy’s statement. Morgan Lewis earned 'Russia Law Firm of the Year' title Trump’s tax lawyers are partners in the Washington, D.C., office of Morgan Lewis, which employs some 2,000 attorneys in 30 cities around the world, including 40 lawyers and staff in Moscow. In the May 12 letter, Trump’s attorneys generally downplayed the president’s ties to Russia, and said Trump’s tax returns from the past decade contain no undisclosed income from Russian sources. Murphy is correct that Morgan Lewis was once named the "Russia Law Firm of the Year." This award was bestowed in 2016 by Chambers & Partners, a reputable source of law firm rankings, which cited the firm’s work in Russia’s energy, finance and technology sectors. Murphy’s spokesman, Chris Harris, also pointed us to an item on Morgan Lewis’ website trumpeting the accolade, calling it a "prestigious honor" that recognizes its Russia office’s excellence in client service, strategic growth and other achievements. Elsewhere on Morgan Lewis’ website the firm boasts about its Moscow office, saying "Our lawyers are well known in the Russian market, and have deep familiarity with the local legislation, practices, and key players." So what? So Murphy is basically right on the facts: (1) Trump did use a letter from his Morgan Lewis tax attorneys to downplay Russia ties, (2) Morgan Lewis was named "Russia Law Firm of the Year," and (3) the firm has extensive Russia ties. That said, it would be wrong to conclude that by hiring Morgan Lewis, Trump shares the firm’s extensive Russia ties. That’s unproven. A Morgan Lewis spokesman told ABC News none of the firm’s attorneys have handled any business dealings for Trump in Russia. The spokesman added that Trump’s tax attorney, Sheri Dillon, has never been to Russia and does no work there. The reality is, beyond a laugh line, there’s not much people should read into Murphy’s statement. By the same logic, for instance, Trump’s tough talk toward Germany would potentially be undermined by the fact his tax attorneys work in a firm that operates an office in Frankfurt. And unless Murphy were willing to credit Trump for Morgan Lewis’ progressive telecommuting policy to help working parents, his position would lack coherence. Our ruling Murphy said, "Law firm @POTUS used to show he has no ties to Russia was named Russia Law Firm of the Year for their extensive ties to Russia. Unreal." While any suggestion Trump shares the law firm's extensive ties is unproven, Murphy has the basic facts correct. The tax attorneys Trump has used to minimize his Russia ties are partners at Morgan Lewis, the 2016 "Russia Law Firm of the Year," which boasts significant work in Russia. The firm, however, says that Trump’s lawyer has done no work in Russia. We rate Murphy’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-03991	Says U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, was elected in a "very low turnout" race.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/feb/10/chris-matthews/chris-matthews-says-sen-ron-johnson-was-elected-ve/	For anyone still keeping score on pundit reaction to the clash between then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin over the attack on U.S. diplomats in Libya: Don’t count Chris Matthews in the Johnson camp. To say the least. The host of the MSNBC-TV talk show "Hardball" lambasted the questions and remarks that Johnson, a Republican, addressed to Clinton when she appeared before a Senate committee on Jan. 23, 2013. Matthews and two guests that night heaped praise on Clinton, while ripping Johnson’s queries about the way the attacks were initially portrayed to the public. Matthews went on to question, at least implicitly, the legitimacy of Johnson’s 2010 win over Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold. That mid-term election saw Republicans regain control of the U.S. House of Representatives and pick up seats in the Senate, including this one. "That was kind of a pissant performance by that guy from Wisconsin," Matthews said of Johnson’s questioning of Clinton. "I don't know how these guys get over the wall into American politics. I think they won in a very low turnout elections (sic) in Wisconsin." Matthews was just getting warmed up. He added: "I think everybody should run now in national elections, forced to go into elections where there's a lot of voters, so you don't get this weird, warped sense of people coming who supposedly represent the American electorate. That guy doesn't represent anybody." Wisconsin, in our memory, typically has high turnout elections. But is Matthews right that Johnson was elected in a "very low turnout" one? Depends on the point of comparison. Compared with the 2008 and 2012 presidential years, the 2010 election in Wisconsin drew about 800,000-900,000 fewer voters, with the Senate race and a gubernatorial contest leading the ballot, state turnout data shows. That gap is a well-known feature of American politics. In those two presidential years, about 72 percent of voting-eligible Wisconsinites turned out, and it was even higher -- almost 75 percent -- in 2004, according to calculations and analysis by the United States Election Project at George Mason University. By contrast, Wisconsin turnout in the 2010 midterm election featuring Johnson-Feingold was about 52 percent of eligible voters. So from that perspective, the turnout was lower. MSNBC spokeswoman Lauren Skowronski told us that Matthews meant just such a comparison in his remarks. She explained further that Matthews’ reference to multiple candidates -- "they won in very low turnout elections in Wisconsin" -- likely referred to Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who also won in that 2010 election. On his show, Matthews also longed for a system where everybody runs in the higher-turnout presidential years. That’s his opinion, of course, so we can’t fact check it. But we can note that such a change would require a constitutional amendment, because Article One fixes those terms at six years for senators and two for House members. Case closed? Hardly. We wondered: How did the 2010 midterm here stack up to midterms past -- and to similar contests in other states? At 52 percent, turnout in 2010 was slightly lower than the 2006 turnout of 53 percent and significantly higher than the 45 percent in 2002, according to data from the George Mason project’s website. If you go back to 1998 -- when Feingold nipped Republican challenger Mark Neumann in a midterm -- the turnout was considerably lower than in the 2010 race that Matthews termed "very low turnout." In fact, in 1998, Feingold’s vote total was 230,000 lower than his future challenger Johnson received in 2010. So there’s also fodder for saying that 2010 was a typical turnout year, or even high compared to a couple other relatively recent midterms. But Matthews’ statement put things in a national perspective -- "I don't know how these guys get over the wall into American politics." So, how did turnout in Wisconsin stack up? In 2010, the turnout in Wisconsin ran 11 percentage points above the U.S. average. Only six states had higher turnout on the day Johnson defeated Feingold: Minnesota, Maine, Washington, South Dakota, Oregon and Alaska. It’s not hard to find examples of Democratic Party senators who won in November 2010 in states with lower turnout than Wisconsin. Among them: Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, Michael Bennet of Colorado, Barbara Boxer of California and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. We found that Wisconsin’s turnout is typically around the top 5 no matter the year, based on six elections we reviewed. There were even five states that had lower turnout in the 2012 presidential contest than Wisconsin did in the midterm year of 2010, according to the George Mason data. They were: Arkansas, Texas, Oklahoma, West Virginia and Hawaii. Michael McDonald, the George Mason professor behind the elections project, said the Republican Party generally -- but not always -- gets an advantage in lower turnout midterm elections. Younger voters, the poor and minority voters come out in smaller numbers than in presidential election years, cutting into the modern Democratic Party’s base, he noted. It can cut the other way, too. Democrat Tammy Baldwin won Wisconsin’s other Senate seat in 2012 amid the higher turnout in the presidential year. The 2012 electorate included a higher percentage of liberals, city-dwellers and young voters, and a lower percentage of Republicans, than the 2010 electorate, our Journal Sentinel colleague Craig Gilbert reported in a "Wisconsin Voter" story in November 2012. University of Wisconsin-Madison political scientist and pollster Charles Franklin said it was "crazy talk" by Matthews if the MSNBC host was arguing that the only way a conservative such as Ron Johnson could win was in a midterm election. National "wave" elections favoring one party or the other can factor in, and the particulars of each campaign factor in as well. Franklin noted that Jim Doyle, the Democrat who served two terms as Wisconsin governor, unseated a Republican incumbent in a 2002 midterm election. And Doyle won re-election in 2006. Our rating Matthews said Johnson won in a "very low turnout" election when he knocked off Feingold in 2010. His comment holds up if the comparison point is presidential years, but it’s off the mark if prior midterms in Wisconsin and in other states are the standard. We rate his statement Half True.

pomt-09535	Houston is "the third-most toxic city in the United States of America."	true	/texas/statements/2010/feb/09/farouk-shami/farouk-shami-says-houston-no-3-toxicity-nation/	Houston businessman Farouk Shami, running for governor, turned to his leading Democratic foe on Monday night and leveled a foul charge. In a televised debate, Shami told Bill White, the former Houston mayor: "Our city is the third-most toxic city in the United States of America." White didn’t take issue with Shami’s description, but it was news to us. We decided to check into the Bayou City’s "ick" ranking. Shami’s campaign said the candidate based his statement on a 2009 article in Forbes magazine putting Houston behind only Atlanta and Detroit for toxicity among major U.S. cities. The magazine said it based its rankings of the nation’s 40 largest metropolitan statistical areas on data provided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. "We counted the number of facilities that reported releasing toxins into the environment," the magazine said, "the total pounds of certain toxic chemicals released into the air, water and earth, the days per year that air pollution was above healthy levels, and the number of times the EPA has responded to reports of a potentially hazardous environmental incident or site in each metro area's principal city." Its article states Houston's residents live with with air that's far filthier than it should be. "Facilities in Houston released 88.7 million pounds of toxic chemicals in the environment in 2007," the magazine says, "and the former site of a methanol fire and chemical explosion number among the city's 50 sites necessitating an EPA response. Factories that serve the local petrochemical industry emit benzene and 1-3 butabeine, toxins proven to be particularly harmful, that the area's intense sunlight and lack of wind keep trapped in the local area's atmosphere." Jim Lester, vice president of the Houston Advanced Research Center, a Woodlands-based nonprofit group that studies and promotes sustainable development, is quoted saying Houston has become "one of the favorite places in the world for doing air-quality science." He saw that as a boon: "The more people understand about it (air quality), the more changes are likely that will take us in a positive direction." When we reached Lester, he revisited pollution levels reported by industries and posted online by the EPA. In 2007, Harris County industries reported either releasing or disposing of 36.1 million pounds of toxic chemicals, while industries around Detroit in Wayne County nearly matched that dubious achievement, reporting the disposal or release of nearly 30 million pounds of toxic pollutants. Shami correctly referred to a recent national comparison. We rate his statement as True.	None	Farouk Shami	None	None	None	2010-02-09T17:45:11	2010-02-08	['United_States', 'Houston']

pomt-02796	"Back door gun control is in full effect in the United States" due to "Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2013/dec/03/allen-west/allen-west-blames-obamas-epa-closing-smelter-evide/	Former Congressman Allen West has taken aim at a surprising gun control villain: the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. "It seems that back door gun control is in full effect in the United States. Why? Thanks to Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), we can no longer smelt lead from ore in the United States. ...," wrote the Republican and retired Army lieutenant colonel on his website Dec. 1. "So America, back door gun control is moving forward and while we are all distracted with Obamacare and Iran nuclear negotiations, our Second Amendment rights are undergoing an assault by clandestine infiltration." Here’s West’s explanation in a nutshell: The Doe Run lead smelter in Herculaneum, Missouri will close its doors this month due to air quality restrictions. "What this all means," West wrote, "is that after December 2013, any ammunition that will be available to US citizens will have to be imported, which will surely increase the price and possibly come under government control." Is West correct to conclude that the EPA’s actions are "back door gun control"? A reader asked us to check West’s claim, so we did. (A hat tip to the Blaze, which published its own fact-check between the time we spotted West’s claim and the time we published it.) Lead’s dangers Lead is a serious health hazard. According to the Mayo Clinic, "even small amounts of lead can cause serious health problems. Children under the age of 6 are especially vulnerable to lead poisoning, which can severely affect mental and physical development. At very high levels, lead poisoning can be fatal." Lead contamination can be found in air, water and soil as well as homes from old paint. Lead-based paint and lead-contaminated dust in older buildings are the most common sources of lead poisoning in children. Adults who work with batteries, home renovations or in auto repair shops also may be exposed to lead. The health dangers prompted the U.S. to phase out leaded gasoline in the 1980s. As Doe Run announced at the time, the company reached a settlement with the EPA and the state of Missouri in 2010 which included paying fines and ceasing smelting operations in Herculaneum. But the news is gaining fresh attention now because the actual closure date of Dec. 31 is looming. West’s blog cited an Oct. 29 post by Terresa Monroe-Hamilton on noisyroom.net which slammed the feds for "back door gun control" in driving the plant to closure. (The Blaze reported that West’s initial post failed to cite noisyroom but later updated with attribution.) Monroe-Hamilton sent us to a post she wrote Dec. 3 in response to the controversy, in which she said what she wrote was an "opinion piece." But the long history of lead-control efforts casts serious doubt on the idea that the closure was driven by anti-gun concerns. Ever since the EPA was created in 1970, one of its missions has been to limit pollution from smelters which are "terribly toxic sites," said David Rosner, a professor of sociomedical sciences at Columbia University who studies the politics of pollution. The Doe Run smelter, he says, was shut down because it was a major polluter -- not as a way of curbing guns. "It had nothing to do with gun control or bullets," Rosner told PolitiFact. "The idea of linking this to an issue of gun control or a surreptitious way for the government trying to shut down the gun industry is nuts. This was an EPA decision because of children who were being poisoned by what had come out of that plant." While West, who represented South Florida for one term, pointed the finger at "Obama’s" EPA, the EPA’s case against Doe Run actually began decades ago. The St. Louis area failed to meet federal clean air standards for lead in 1987 -- during the Reagan administration -- due to emissions from the smelter, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported in 1989. Reagan wasn't the only Republican president to advance the anti-lead effort. In 2008, under President George W. Bush, the EPA adopted tougher air quality standards for lead that were 10 times more stringent than the past. In 2010, the EPA reached a settlement with Doe Run. In November, Doe Run issued a news release about the closure: "Although the United States is home to a number of secondary lead smelters, which recycle lead from various sources, the Herculaneum facility is the last primary lead smelter in the United States," according to the release. The release explains that the company isn’t shutting down entirely. While the company is closing its primary smelter, which extracts lead from ore, it will continue to operate as a secondary lead smelter -- essentially a recycler for lead contained in other products. According to the company, more than 80 percent of all lead produced in the United States is used in either vehicle batteries or in stationary batteries for backup power used by the military and in telecommunications and medical applications."In the U.S., the recycle rate of these batteries is approximately 98 percent, making lead-based batteries the most highly recycled consumer product," the company release said. "These batteries are recycled at secondary lead smelters. We own such a smelter in southern Missouri." The company added that lead is used in ammunition and other materials. Doe Run spokeswoman Tammy Stankey emailed PolitiFact to say that the company "will continue to supply our ammo customers using secondary lead." We interviewed experts on lead or ammunition to ask about the impact of the plant closure. Most said there should not be major concerns. Michael Bazinet, a spokesman for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, confirmed that lead used for ammunition made in the U.S. comes almost exclusively from recycled sources. "While no one should ever be pleased about the closure of any industry, in this case there should not be a noticeable effect on consumers. ... We should not see any effect on the civilian marketplace," Bazinet told PolitiFact. The foundation’s general counsel, Lawrence Keane, echoed that view in an interview with the Washington Times Others agree. While Doe Run is the last "primary" lead smelter in the U.S. there are plenty of "secondary" processing of lead in the U.S., Richard Lowden, a research engineer at the U.S. Department of Energy Oak Ridge National Laboratory told PolitiFact in an email. "Primary lead is of higher purity and is needed for specialty applications such as unique types of lead-acid batteries," Lowden said. "Secondary lead is slightly less pure and is used in most applications -- over 80 percent of domestic consumption, including bullets. The U.S. imports very little lead, with the main foreign sources being Canada and Mexico. I do not believe shooters have to worry about a source of lead for bullets." Florida Bullet, a Clearwater-based company that supplies ammunition to most law enforcement agencies in Florida, isn’t worried about the smelter’s closure. The bullets the company sells, made by Federal and Speer, "use reclaimed lead, so this is not going to bother us as far as production goes," said the company’s president, Tom Falone. "We don’t foresee this being a problem for us." When we asked Michele Hickford, West’s spokeswoman, why he blamed Obama if the EPA had zeroed in on the smelter long before Obama was president, she said, "The plant closed under Obama. Regardless of what this lead plant is used for, the EPA net is tightening on the entire industry, and if you follow it to its logical conclusion, the industry will be shut down eventually. This is yet another example of the Obama administration circumventing the legislative process to achieve its goals." Our ruling West wrote that "back door gun control is in full effect in the United States" due "to Obama’s Environmental Protection Agency." But there is no evidence that it was a clandestine effort at back door gun control. Rather, the EPA’s settlement with Doe Run -- which concluded a case that began years before Obama was elected president -- had to do with emissions of a chemical that can cause serious injury and death to adults and children. And ammunition experts shot massive holes in the notion that the smelter’s closure would cut production, reduce supply or raise the cost of ammunition. Pants on Fire!

pomt-04230	"Our welfare system now consumes 42 percent of our budget."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2012/nov/25/patricia-morgan/ri-state-rep-patricia-morgan-says-spending-welfare/	The classic conflict that underlies many political debates these days is how to balance what we wish government would do for us with how much we can afford to pay for those government services. One of those who worries our good intentions may be getting too big for our wallets is state Rep. Patricia L. Morgan, R-West Warwick, who won reelection this month to her second term. A reader sent us one of her campaign fliers last week, asking us to check one of its claims. The headline on the flier was "Waste and Abuse in Rhode Island Government is hurting our JOB Climate and YOU. Is it Fair?" The claim that caught our reader’s eye: "Our welfare system now consumes more than 42 percent of our budget." The flier said such spending was diverting funds that could otherwise be spent on roads, higher education and improving the economic climate for private business. We wondered what Morgan’s definition of the "welfare system" was and whether it really made up 42 percent of the budget. When we called Morgan she said she defines welfare as a payment from the government that someone gets without having to work to earn it. That would cover food stamps, free or subsidized childcare, subsidized housing, even the RIPTA bus passes given to participants in Rhode Island IWorks, the welfare and job training program for low-income families, she said. She said she didn’t do an exhaustive breakdown of all state agencies to arrive at her 42 percent figure. Instead, she used the state House of Representatives fiscal staff’s evaluation of the fiscal 2013 budget as enacted. She said she took the $3.66 billion the staff calculated the state is set to spend on "assistance, grants and benefits" in 2013 and divided it by the total budget of state and federal spending, around $8.09 billion. "Assistance, grants and benefits" made up 45.2 percent of the budget. We decided to take a deeper look to see whether Morgan’s number and analysis was on target. But first, let’s talk about Morgan’s definition of "welfare system." When many people hear the term, they might think of welfare payments to poor people -- now known as Rhode Island Works. But other programs provide types of direct payments too, such as General Public Assistance, Supplemental Security Income and Individual and Family Support. Combined, those are slated to cost about $562 million in 2013, about 7 percent of the total state budget. But for purposes of this item, we’ll work with Morgan’s broader definition of welfare as any government payment to an individual. The House analysis of the budget notes that while most of the $3.6-billion figure Morgan cited is made up of social service aid, it also includes "grants to environmental agencies, local law enforcement agencies." State Budget Director Thomas Mullaney told us that, in fact, the "assistance, grants and benefits" category includes every grant from every department. That would include such spending as Federal Emergency Management Agency payments for storm cleanups as well as the legislative grants representatives and senators give out to such groups as Little League teams in their districts. The House staff analysis actually broke out what it classified as human service-related assistance, grants and benefits -- closer to Morgan’s definition of "welfare system." They totaled $2.54 billion, or about 31 percent of the total state 2013 budget -- lower than Morgan’s figures. More than half of that, $1.6 billion, was federal money spent on providing Medicaid services to Rhode Island’s poor. What about the costs for administering these programs? Morgan said the House report says overall, all spending for human services -- including administration -- totals about $3.19 billion, or about 39.3 percent of the budget. Even though some of that money wasn’t going directly to beneficiaries, she said it counted because it was the expense of delivering those benefits. But that figure includes spending on departments that don’t make payments to individuals, including the Department of Health, the state medical examiner’s office, the Office of Child Advocate and the Office of Child Support Enforcement, which last year helped collect about $80 million in child support owed by deadbeat parents. We believe the 31 percent figure is more applicable Our ruling State Rep. Patricia Morgan says spending on "welfare systems" in Rhode Island accounts for 42 percent of the budget. Even working with Morgan's broad definition of welfare, our analysis showed that figure is closer to 31 percent. Why does this matter? As Morgan’s flier noted, social-service programs, particularly Medicaid, are clearly putting an increasing strain on state and federal taxpayers. That’s a big challenge for lawmakers. It’s important to get the numbers right. We rule Morgan's statement Half True.	None	Patricia Morgan	None	None	None	2012-11-25T00:01:00	2012-11-06	['None']

pomt-14793	"It is already in the law that there is a requirement to screen (refugees) for religion."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/01/jeb-bush/bush-says-law-requires-religious-screening/	The probability that terrorists would try to take advantage of the refugee wave landing in Europe has led many Republicans and some Democrats to call for tighter policies here at home. Republican candidate Jeb Bush has rejected one of the more hard-line proposals that would ban all Syrian Muslim refugees from entering the United States. But Bush has said that America ought to give priority to Christians fleeing the ravages of religious militants under the command of the Islamic State. Asked on CBS News’ Face the Nation if a Christian preference wouldn’t play into the ISIL narrative that their war was a struggle between Islam and Christianity, Bush said this wouldn’t represent any real change. "It is already in the law that there is a requirement to screen for religion," Bush said Nov. 29, 2015. "This is the practice of our country. There was a bipartisan bill that of course didn't pass in Congress this year to provide preference for Christians who are being slaughtered in the Middle East, persecuted based on their faith. Religious minorities, I think, should have some preference." We decided to look at whether American officials are legally bound to ask refugees about their religion. The short answer is, it depends. If a refugee says he or she fears religious persecution, then their religion absorbs a lot of time in the interview process. But if their fear stems from their political views, then there is no obligation to ask about their religion. Still, experts said it is standard practice to ask refugees about their religion, even if they are not specifically escaping religious persecution. The Bush press office pointed us to an opinion piece in the National Review that paraphrased the relevant part of the Immigration and Nationality Act (section 101(a)(42)) this way: "An alien applying for admission must establish that … religion [among other things] … was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant." The full list of possible grounds for persecution includes "race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion." A State Department spokesperson told PolitiFact that there is no legal requirement for refugees to indicate a religious preference. But if they make religion the basis of their claim, then many questions about their religious background follow. In some particular cases, the State Department designates certain groups as ones of "special humanitarian concern" and in the past, religion has helped define such groups. Examples include Soviet Jews and Iranian religious minorities. For those special groups, religion is an essential aspect of the person’s background, said Mark Hetfield, president of HIAS, a refugee assistance group that began over a century ago to help Jews fleeing Eastern Europe. (HIAS today works with people of any faith from around the world and has worked with both the UN and the State Department to help refugees.) "But this is not due to a legal requirement," he said. "This is to see if they fit in the parameters of the program." A standard practice Most refugees begin their formal path to resettlement with an interview conducted by staff of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees. If a person is headed toward the United States, their next stop is a Resettlement Support Center overseen by the U.S. State Department. According to the department’s press office, the resettlement centers routinely ask about religion. Hetfield affirmed that. "There is a data field for religion which is always filled in," he said. "If it is not directly relevant to the claim, U.S Citizenship and Immigration (staff) won't ask about it, but it will be in the applicant's file." We reached Bill Frelick, director of the refugee rights program at Human Rights Watch, when he was in Bulgaria interviewing Syrian, Iraqi and Afghan asylum seekers. Frelick said religious affiliation is a typical but optional question for refugees. The practitioners we reached found Bush’s emphasis on the legal dimension of asking about religion problematic. To them, simply asking is not screening. It provides information that might ease a refugee’s transition to life in America and finding a place of worship. Screening in the sense of vetting takes place only when the refugee says he or she fears religious persecution. Refugees are tracked based on the countries they have fled, not their religion, so we don’t know the fraction of refugees claiming religious persecution. Anecdotally, religion plays a role in many refugee applications in the Middle East, whether the person is Sunni or Shia Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Baha'i, or some other faith. Our ruling Bush said that there is a legal requirement to screen for religion. U.S. immigration law does state that American officials must dig into a person’s religion if their refugee status is based on a fear of religious persecution. However, there is no formal requirement if the person bases the claim on other grounds. In practice, questions about religion are common even if they are not required. His statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-12-01T17:54:04	2015-11-29	['None']

pomt-02062	From 2000 to 2008, we averaged "about five mass shootings a year. We're now averaging 15. So that's a three-fold increase."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/may/28/pierre-thomas/abcs-thomas-mass-shootings-have-tripled-2000/	The brutal murders May 23, 2014, near the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara, dominated the national news and provoked a lot of talk about what could have been done to save the lives of six young college-aged victims. The public quickly learned the basics. The killer had a history of mental illness. He revealed his plans in a YouTube video posted shortly before his rampage. He killed his first three victims, his roommates, with a knife. He legally owned three handguns and used at least one of them to kill three strangers before committing suicide. In a search for some pattern, ABC’s This Week host, Martha Raddatz asked ABC senior justice correspondent Pierre Thomas about deadly gunfire on or near college campuses since 1996. "Officials you talk to say there really is a spike nationwide," Raddatz said. "The problem is, it's even bigger than that," Thomas said. "Between 2008 and 2000 roughly, we were averaging about five mass shootings a year. We're now averaging 15. So that's a three-fold increase." That seemed like a major jump. Does the country really have three times as many mass shootings? We decided to take a closer look. We reached out to Thomas to learn what background information he was using and did not hear back. However, we found an FBI study that, while it ultimately doesn’t support his claim, does offer some numbers that sound very much like the ones Thomas used. Pete Blair, director of the Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center at Texas State University was the lead researcher on the study Active Shooter Events from 2000 to 2012. Blair found that from 2000 to 2008, there were about five events each year where someone with a gun attempted to kill multiple people. But after 2008 there were nearly 16 each year. That matches the tripling that Thomas described. The problem is, Thomas talked about mass shootings. That’s not the violence Blair studied. In about 20 percent the cases Blair looked at, no one died. In more than 10 percent of the cases, only one person was killed. Neither scenario meets the definition of a mass shooting. Blair explained that the FBI’s focus was on crafting strategies to save lives once a gunman arrives. "Active shooter is a response protocol for the police," Blair said. "We believe that we can learn as much from events that do not turn into mass killings as those that do." Blair found that about half the time, the incidents are over before police arrive and the most common reason is that the shooter commits suicide. In research circles, there is no hard and fast definition for a mass shooting. Instead, the FBI uses the term "mass murder" when four or more people are killed in what is essentially a single episode. By that definition, Blair said there has been no increase in mass shootings. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University in Boston, told PunditFact the rate of mass murders has held steady for decades. "Since 1976, we’ve averaged about 20 cases a year," Fox said. "On average, about 100 people a year are killed by mass murderers." The data on killings is fraught with analytic pitfalls. USA Today researchers found that the FBI’s homicide data is accurate only about 60 percent of the time. On top of that, different studies look at different kinds of events. For example, Fox includes killings within families and murders committed during burglaries in his tally. In contrast, the magazine Mother Jones did an extensive investigation that aimed to identify instances where at least four people were murdered and the motive was indiscriminate killing in a public setting. Researchers eliminated cases where the violence took place in a home or was tied to a robbery or gang warfare. (Those standards might exclude the Santa Barbara slayings because three of the victims were the killer’s roommates and were slain in their apartment. Nor would it be correct to call them shootings because they were stabbed to death.) Using its approach, Mother Jones found that the rate of these killings has gone up over time. During the period 2000 to 2008, there were 1.8 mass murders a year. From 2009 to 2013, the rate doubled to 3.6 events per year. This shows an increase, but not as large as Thomas suggested. There’s another way to slice the data. Criminologist Gary Kleck at Florida State University went beyond homicides and focused on any event in which seven or more people were killed or injured in a single location. By his tally, the yearly average between 2000 and 2008 was 2.4 events, compared to 5 events per year after 2008. This offers some support for Thomas’s statement but again, the numbers are quite different from the ones he used. Our ruling Thomas said that mass shootings have tripled since the 2000 to 2008 period and the country now sees about 15 episodes a year. The study that matches those figures looked at a different form of violence and included instances where no one was murdered. The study’s author told us that mass murders, as defined by the FBI, have not increased. Using a more narrow definition, Mother Jones found that the country now has between three and four mass killings a year, a doubling since about a decade ago. Another study that looked at the number of people wounded, not necessarily killed, offered similar results. The annual rate is much lower than Thomas said and the change in the rate is also considerably less. There is some evidence that mass killings have increased but that finding hinges on a careful choice of incidents, and by any measure, Thomas’ numbers are way off. We rate his claim Mostly False.

pomt-03136	"Studies have shown that voter fraud is non-existent in Texas."	false	/texas/statements/2013/sep/13/eddie-bernice-johnson/voter-fraud-occurs-texas-though-convictions-and-gu/	Texas’ attorney general, Greg Abbott, has his facts wrong on the voting process, U.S. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson said in an opinion column published Aug. 8, 2013, in the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. For example, "Abbott advocates the use of voter ID laws, allegedly to stop voter fraud," the Dallas Democrat wrote. "Studies have shown that voter fraud is non-existent in Texas." "Non-existent" is pretty strong; we don’t have to look any farther than our own reporting to know that statement isn’t entirely accurate. But how prevalent is voter fraud in Texas? Johnson spokesman Cameron Trimble told us by phone and email that the column should have said "virtually" non-existent. He sent us web links to research and news stories that described nationwide voter fraud as rare. None of the materials analyzed fraud in Texas specifically, and we found only one mention of a Texas case -- the 2006 conviction of a Pecos woman who filled out and mailed absentee ballots for others. Trimble’s sources mostly referred to voter fraud -- deception committed by individual voters, such as voting more than once, impersonating a voter or voting despite ineligibility -- rather than overall election fraud, which encompasses actions by others, such as election officials or campaign workers, who break election laws in ways that could include intimidating voters, publishing misinformation about polling places or possessing ballots not their own. We dipped into that distinction in an April 2012 fact-check that rated as Half True a claim from Abbott that he had secured 50 convictions for election fraud. Abbott’s basis was his office’s records on 2002-12 prosecutions for alleged election code violations. For this fact-check, we asked Abbott’s office for an updated list. County district attorneys and the Texas secretary of state’s elections division usually refer allegations of election code violations to the attorney general. We also called the secretary’s office and several district attorney offices around the state, but found no specific information about how many violations were reported or prosecuted. Abbott spokeswoman Lauren Bean emailed us records showing that from August 2002 through September 2012, the office received 616 allegations of election-code violations and recorded 78 election-code prosecutions. By our count, 46 of the prosecutions ended with a conviction, guilty plea, no-contest plea or guilty plea as part of deferred adjudication. Of those, 18 cases appeared to involve fraud committed by individual voters: 12 cases with ineligible voters, five cases of voter impersonation and one case of voting more than once. So, by our reading of the attorney general’s records, 18 instances of voter fraud have been confirmed in Texas since 2002. In 2012, the News21 investigative project headquartered at Arizona State University’s journalism school compiled a database that showed 104 Texas cases of alleged election fraud among 2,068 nationwide since 2000. The News21 students, who published their results online Aug. 12, 2012, gathered allegations through public information requests, news accounts and court records. According to the project’s website, they included all cases "that had reached some level of official action: That is, someone was charged, an investigation was opened, a specific accusation was made against a named person." News21 determined that 37 of the 104 Texas allegations were made against voters. Most of the cases were still pending at the time the students published their project in 2012, but 15 had resulted in a guilty plea or conviction, according to the database. Our ruling Johnson said, "Studies have shown that voter fraud is non-existent in Texas." She did not provide, nor did we find, studies showing such fraud to be non-existent. To the contrary, Abbott’s records show 18 convictions, no-contest pleas or guilty pleas on voter fraud charges from 2002 through 2012. That’s not a lot of fraud, by any means, but it still evidently occurred. Johnson might have meant to say "virtually non-existent," but the Truth-O-Meter holds individuals accountable for what they actually say. We rate this statement as False. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-05942	Says Ohio has 77 job training programs spread across 13 state agencies.	true	/ohio/statements/2012/jan/27/john-kasich/john-kasich-says-ohio-has-77-job-training-programs/	Gov. John Kasich says job training programs will be his seminal issue of 2012. But as Ohio continues to push for new jobs and retaining the ones it has, a problem has emerged. Employers say Ohio has too few skilled workers, which in turn makes companies leery about moving their business here from outside the state. The governor doesn’t dispute that notion completely, but asserts that Ohio is trying. Ohio currently has 77 workforce job training programs across 13 state agencies, Kasich said Jan. 10, 2012, in a boardroom interview with editors at The Plain Dealer. Kasich views that as a weak spot in the state’s economic development plans and wants to reorganize the programs. Politifact Ohio double-checked to see if the governor had his figures correct. According to the state, to be defined as a state workforce training program the service has to: Receive state and/or federal resources to operate; Help people identify, prepare or attain employment or assist and employer with training or retaining its workforce; and Not be a program used by a state agency to train its own staff. By that criteria, the state has exactly 77 workforce training programs, according to the Ohio Department of Development. The programs are spread across 13 state entities: Board or Regents Department of Aging Department of Alcohol and Addictive Services Department of Commerce Department of Development Department of Education Department of Health Department of Jobs and Family Services Department of Rehabilitation and Correction Rehabilitative Services Commission Department of Transportation Department of Veteran Services Department of Youth Services Some, for example, at the Board of Regents, are college scholarship programs but are considered workforce development because they assist students with pursuing education degrees in certain high need fields, like nursing, science or math. To put the governor’s thoughts in sharper focus, while Ohio has a wealth of workforce training programs, Kasich doesn’t think much of the state’s efforts or efficiency in linking participants in these programs to actual jobs. "If you have 77 and 13 it means you have zero. That’s how I add that up," Kasich told The Plain Dealer. "Nobody knows what anyone’s doing." The point the governor is arguing is that the state does not have a strategic plan for how to address workforce training, instead it has a bunch of individual programs working in isolation. The administration is working to change that approach. Our point here is not to argue which job training approach is best, but rather to check the governor’s claim that there are 77 programs spread through 13 agencies. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate the governor’s comment as True.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2012-01-27T06:00:00	2012-01-10	['None']
pomt-06523	"Senate Bill 5 makes it harder for nurses to give the patients the quality care they need."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/oct/10/we-are-ohio/we-are-ohio-claims-sb-5-would/	We Are Ohio, the main group trying to repeal Ohio Senate Bill 5, recently rolled out a TV commercial warning voters that upholding the law would compromise the health care nurses can provide. The message is similar to a claim in a previous ad that SB 5 would make it illegal to negotiate for enough firefighters to do the job. PolitiFact Ohio rated that claim Mostly True. "Senate Bill 5 makes it harder for nurses to give the patients the quality care they need," a nurse identified as Shawna Turner says in the commercial. SB 5 – the state’s new collective bargaining law that is strongly opposed by unions and Democrats – will reduce public workers’ negotiating power, ban public-worker strikes and eliminate binding arbitration. The bill also would force public workers to pay at least 15 percent of their health insurance costs and to pay at least 10 percent of pay toward pension contributions. The SB 5 referendum will appear on the Nov. 8 ballot as Issue 2. A "yes" vote would go toward upholding the law and a "no" vote would be for its repeal. The commercial, which began airing on Sept. 27, raises questions about how SB 5 impacts nurses – a group of workers less commonly associated with SB 5 than others, such as police officers and teachers. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check the ad’s claim. We started by checking how many nurses belong to public unions and, therefore, will be affected by SB 5. There are about 160,000 registered nurses in the state and between 6,000 and 10,000 of those are public employees, according to the Ohio Nurses Association. That means SB 5 would affect between 4 percent and 6.25 percent of Ohio nurses. The Ohio Nurses Association represents about 3,000 public-sector nurses, chief executive officer Gingy Harshey-Meade said. The Ohio Civil Service Employees Association and the Service Employees International Union also represent Ohio nurses. These nurses work at places such as prisons, city or county hospitals and public health departments. When the nurse in the commercial says the new law will make it harder for nurses to provide care, the following text appears on the screen: "Source: Senate Bill 5; p229, Section 4117.08 (B)." That section of the law specifies a handful of subjects that cannot be collectively bargained. Among those topics is "the number of employees required to be on duty or employed in any department." In an email, We Are Ohio spokeswoman Melissa Fazekas said the restriction on bargaining staffing relates to patient care because "it is more difficult for a nurse to provide quality care when he/she is working short-staffed." Jason Mauk, spokesman for the pro-SB 5 group Building a Better Ohio, sought to minimize the idea that SB 5 bans workers from negotiating staffing. He said management can discuss the issue if it chooses. As evidence, he has pointed to a different provision in SB 5 that lists "the number of persons required to be employed or laid off" under topics that can be negotiated at management’s discretion. It is unclear how this provision would mesh with the ban cited in We Are Ohio’s commercials about nurses and firefighters. Certainly, however, management has no obligation to discuss staffing and unions do not have the right to collectively bargain the issue. The current collective bargaining agreement that covers Turner, the nurse featured in the commercial, gives some insight into how SB 5 would affect nurses working conditions. Turner, who works at the Ohio State University Ross Heart Hospital, is represented by the Ohio Nurses Association. The union’s contract with the university contains a clause that gives management the right to set staffing levels. ONA’s contract with OSU says management has the right "to determine staffing and staffing patterns including, but not limited to the assignment of nurses as to the numbers employed, duties to be performed, qualifications required, and areas worked." That sounds a lot like the rule that SB 5 would impose. But union officials say the same contract that gives OSU the right to make staffing decisions, for example, also gives the union a significant voice in those decisions. Kelly Trautner, deputy executive officer of the Ohio Nurses Association, pointed to a provision in ONA’s contract with Ohio State that requires meetings between the union and management to discuss "matters of mutual concern." Trautner said there are other provisions, too, that give the union the right to discuss staffing. But SB 5 completely removes that right and erases the provisions in past contracts that provide the union a voice in staffing matters, Trautner said. So what about the claim that S.B. 5 make it harder for nurses to give patients quality care? The claim contains an element of truth. The power SB 5 gives to management for staffing decisions is significant – especially when you consider past clauses in collective bargaining agreements that empowered workers to speak up for staffing concerns will not carry over to new contracts if SB 5 takes effect. The argument there is that a reduced staff makes it harder to give quality care. But there are some critical facts on which the ad is silent. First, it is impossible to say whether public employers will cut nursing staffs. The ad assumes that with staffing non-negotiable, management will cut staffs or not provide adequate staffing to a point that it will have an impact on the quality of care. That’s where this claim differs from the claim in the previous ad involving firefighters, which specifically focused on the inability to bargain over staffing. This claim goes one step further, saying it will make patient care harder to provide. Even more significantly, though, the commercial makes no distinction between nurses who are public employees and those who are non-public employees, and as such implies all nurses will suffer if Issue 2 passes. But only a tiny fraction of Ohio nurses are public employees - just four to six of every 100. A listener knowing those critical facts would have a different impression of the claim. On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Mostly False.	None	We Are Ohio	None	None	None	2011-10-10T06:00:00	2011-09-27	['None']

pomt-06679	Sherrod Brown "has stood side by side" with President Barack Obama, presiding "over the most rapid increase in the debt over the last 2.5 years" and hurtling toward " the worst jobs record in the modern era."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/08/national-republican-senatorial-committee/nrsc-blasts-brown-standing-obama-his-jobs-record-a/	If the state of the nation is determined in any way by the president, those who stand with the president are destined to share credit or blame. Fair or not, that’s how political messages are being framed for the 2012 elections. We’ve see few better examples than what follows from the National Republican Senatorial Committee. After noting that U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio won office in 2006 saying he wanted to pursue sound economic policies, the Republican committee said in a news release on Aug. 23: "However, as Senator Brown has stood side-by-side with President Obama on virtually every major issue, including all of his major spending proposals, he and his fellow Democrats in Washington have presided over the most rapid increase in the debt over the last 2.5 years and they are on track to have the worst jobs record in the modern era." That’s a mouthful. Yet broken down into components, each part of the claim can be checked. And because this rap against Brown will be heard again and again over the next 14 months, PolitiFact Ohio thought it was worthwhile to do the checking now. So the components, in order: Brown "has stood side by side with President Obama on virtually every major issue, including all of his major spending proposals." Jahan Wilcox, a spokesman for the NRSC (an arm of the Republican Party), cited as major issues the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, better known as the economic stimulus bill; the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010; and the debt-hike bill of August 2011, which lifted the $14.3 trillion ceiling on government borrowing. Those certainly are big. Obama pushed for passage and Brown voted yes on each one, as did Senate and House majorities. Brown’s communications director, Meghan Dubyak, notes that the senator and president have disagreed on some big issues, too, such as carbon dioxide emission limits on factories and coal-burning power plants, a speedier withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan, and foreign trade. Were these major issues? Our dictionary (Webster’s Ninth New Collegiate) defines major as greater in importance, or notable or conspicuous in effort and scope. The carbon caps were a significant issue in House of Representatives races last year in Ohio. But the stimulus and health care bill’s were Obama’s masterpieces, even if their final versions represented compromise. These, and the economy, have defined the Obama presidency. Brown "and his fellow Democrats have presided over the most rapid increase in the debt over the last 2.5 years." The debt has shot up from $10.626 trillion when Obama entered office to $14.622 trillion on Aug. 30, according to the Treasury Department’s "Debt to the Penny" database. In raw dollars, that $4 trillion increase is the most rapid rise in debt under any president, according to CBS News, which was one of the NRSC’s sources for the claim. Note the word "rapid," because it’s important here. Total debt during President George W. Bush’s presidency rose by $4.9 trillion, according to the Treasury Department, but that was over the course of eight years. Obama has been in office less than three years. But a dollar today is not worth what it was in, say, 1940, so we wondered about the rate of increase. We turned to the Office of Management and Budget’s historical debt tables and took out a calculator for additional perspective. Measured by rate of change, the gross federal debt has grown by 38 percent during the 2.5 years of Obama’s presidency. That is not a historical record Consider a one-year change during World War II, from the end of 1942 to the end of 1943: The gross debt rose 80 percent from $79.2 billion to $142.6 billion. It went up by another 43 percent the next year. That was debt from a world war, of course, an extraordinary time. Before moving on, it’s important to note one more piece of context. The NRSC did not say specifically that all the current debt was Obama’s and Brown’s fault. The statement was simply that Brown and fellow Democrats have "presided" over the rise, which the NRSC says means that Democrats voted to let the debt rise that high, approving debt-ceiling hikes like the controversial one that passed in August. Brown’s spokeswoman says she reads that to mean the NRSC is blaming Brown for the underlying policies and programs that drove up the debt, and we agree that the NRSC makes that implication. PolitiFact has noted a number of times that the Obama administration inherited debt from Bush, the result of major tax cuts, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a costly Medicare prescription drug benefit, and a recession. The debt then grew under Obama with the stimulus, the continuation of the wars and tax cuts, and an economy that still threatens to flat-line. Both parties say if only their policies were followed, the nation would ease out of this mess. We don’t claim universal wisdom but, as we have observed before, there’s blame and credit all around. Brown and Obama "are on track to have the worst jobs record in the modern era." There are several ways to weigh this claim. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, which the NRSC used, show job losses of 2.37 million from January 2009, the month Obama entered office, through July 2011, the most recently recorded month. But since Bush was still president for the first 19 days of January 2009, and the nation was already losing 600,000 to 800,000 jobs a month at that point, some claim it is fairer to start the measurement in February 2009, Obama’s first full month in office. That puts the job losses during Obama’s presidency so far at 1.64 million. Is this the worst in the modern era? The NRSC points to the Washington Post’s "Fact Checker" column for backup here. The Post weighed similar claims made by former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Texas Gov. Rick Perry about Obama, and wrote, "When Romney made his statement, both Ronald Reagan and Obama were tied for the first two years of their presidency — a decline of about 2.3 percent in the number of people employed. The economy, however, really started to pick up in Reagan’s third year, while it has flagged under Obama, so for the first 2 ½ years, Obama’s record is now worse: a decline of about 1.4 percent under Obama, versus 0.5 percent under Reagan." The comparison can change with each successive month. But the NRSC allowed for some wiggle room by saying Obama and Brown are "on track" for a horrible jobs record. So is the NRSC right? As the Post noted, it is foolish to blame Obama for every one of those job losses, since the nation was already bleeding jobs when he got elected. We’ll go a step further: A single senator represents one vote out 100, and hardly has power to control job losses. He can, however, support policies, and sometimes his single vote matters. Brown cast a crucial final vote that allowed the stimulus bill to pass, returning to Washington on a White House-provided plane on Feb. 13, 2009, from visitation in advance of his mother’s next-day funeral. A number of economists say that as bad as the economy got, more jobs would have been lost had it not been for the stimulus. That is not to say all economists agree, nor is it to argue that Obama and Congress have or haven’t handled the economy effectively. It is merely noting a single senator’s role, since the NRSC assigns Brown blame. Going back to each part of the claim, then, the NRSC is correct on the highlights when it says Brown has stood side by side with Obama on virtually every major issue. But it overlooks energy -- a major issue in Ohio in 2010, though potentially less so in 2012, and one on which Brown took a different position than the president. It is correct in a narrow way when it says that Brown and Obama "presided" over the most rapid rise in debt in 2 ½ years, but that claim ignores much greater rises in the rate of growth during the 1940s, as well as the reason for some of the debt. As for being on track for the wost jobs record in the modern era, Obama may be headed for that ignominious distinction, but a single legislator generally lacks that kind of power. Put together, this compound claim leaves out important details and context. On the Truth-O-Meter, it merits a rating of Half True.

pomt-03331	Dozens of artists, including Justin Timberlake, Jay Z and Rihanna, are canceling Florida shows like Stevie Wonder in protest of "stand your ground."	false	/florida/statements/2013/jul/23/instagram-posts/are-jay-z-justin-timberlake-and-rihanna-joining-st/	Did you hear? Dozens of the world’s hottest musical acts are joining music legend Stevie Wonder in protest of Florida’s "stand your ground" law after the George Zimmerman trial, according to social networks and the blogosphere. Memes zooming through social media name two dozen artists that have canceled their tour dates in the Sunshine State indefinitely "UNTIL THE LAW IN FLORIDA IS ABOLISHED!" The list is populated with world-famous acts such as Justin Timberlake, Jay Z, Rihanna, Rod Stewart, Patti LaBelle, the Rolling Stones, Madonna, Alicia Keys, Usher, will.i.am, R. Kelly, Trey Songz, Mary J. Blige, Kanye West, Ciara, Kelly Rowland and other groups. Timberlake is singled out for nixing the kickoff of his tour in Miami because he refused "TO ENTERTAIN A STATE WHO’S GOVERNMENT ALLOWS PEOPLE TO SHOOT-N-KILL UN-ARMED TEENAGERS!" The PSA first caught PolitiFact Florida’s eye when it was shared in Instagram. Then the list got more attention when versions of it trickled into mainstream coverage. We are skeptical of chain emails and the like that are typed in ALL CAPS, contain misspellings and do not disclose their sources. The meme we’ve seen (which touts the misspelled names of RIHANA and ALISHIA KEYS as signing on) is a triple whammy. We decided to investigate whether dozens of high-profile acts are really joining Wonder and boycotting Florida. Our synopsis: Just because it’s in the news does not make it true. Adding names to Stevie Wonder's boycott Talk of Florida boycotts started July 14, the day after Zimmerman’s "not guilty" verdict in the death of Trayvon Martin. Wonder announced then in Quebec City that he will never again perform in Florida until the 2005 "stand your ground" law is abolished. He took it a step further: "As a matter of fact, wherever I find that law exists, I will not perform in that state or in that part of the world." (More than 20 other states have similar "stand your ground" laws.) Several musical artists and celebrities reacted to the verdict with anger and disbelief. Many gave musical tributes to Martin, including Beyoncé, Young Jeezy, Jay Z and Justin Timberlake, Patti LaBelle, Bruce Springsteen, and Wyclef Jean. But none of the artists on the Instagram list -- even those who have spoken out against the verdict -- publicly announced they are joining Wonder’s boycott. We checked social media accounts, websites and news reports and found no declarations of support for the boycott from the people on the list. Still, it wasn’t long before the story crossed over into news coverage. American Urban Radio Networks reporter April Ryan cited "sources close to Stevie Wonder camp" for her July 22 report that claimed a similar slate of artists are joining him in support of changing "stand your ground." Some have already called off concerts, she wrote. Her AURN report was picked up by congressional newspaper The Hill and the Huffington Post on July 22, read and shared by thousands. The next day, even more newspapers picked it up but tried to add a little more caution (including the Tampa Bay Times). Ryan’s list contained two groups that were not on the Instagram roundup: Eddie Levert, lead singer of the R&B group The O’Jays, and gospel duo Mary Mary "We love our fans but we MUST do something!!" Mary Mary wrote on Facebook. "We understand a No from us isn’t as big as a No from Stevie Wonder but if all our voices join together we can REALLY change things!" These are the only artists from Ryan’s list of 23 artists who have announced they are joining Wonder’s effort. Ryan has since updated her post with a disclaimer: I obtained from multiple sources early Monday a list of artists and entertainers who my sources told me had committed to a boycott of Florida following the George Zimmerman acquittal. Since publishing that list I have heard from several representatives of the artists named who say, on behalf of their clients, they are uncomfortable being identified on that list and are seeking additional information. The Huffington Post, hearing from artists' reps that the list was not true (but not willing to go on the record), later wrote a story discrediting its original post. The shows still go on We did our own reporting. Most of the artists do not have upcoming tour dates in Florida. Rihanna, for example, was just in Tampa in April. Madonna is not on tour. "This leg of Rod Stewart's tour hasn't ever included Florida dates so that isn't accurate," said Hannah Kampf, a spokeswoman for Stewart. Madonna did not join the boycott, spokeswoman Liz Rosenberg told us. Neither did Alicia Keys, whose spokeswoman said in a statement, "We question the validity of this list since Alicia's name along with many others has appeared erroneously." A spokeswoman for the Rolling Stones told Mother Jones no one in the band had "heard anything about this." Timberlake and Jay Z do have their shared "Legends of the Summer" concert on Aug. 16 at Sun Life Stadium in Miami. Timberlake has another concert planned for December in Orlando. If the show is off, no one told the ticket vendors, updated either artist’s website or informed the venues. Sun Life Stadium tweeted us that the concert "is on as scheduled." Funk maestro George Clinton and Parliament Funkadelic, also named among artists boycotting Florida, is scheduled to play in Tallahassee on July 28. We found nothing to contradict that. And funk stars Maze and Frankie Beverly are still slated to perform at the Mahaffey Theater in St. Petersburg on Sept. 15, a spokeswoman confirmed to tbt*, a daily tabloid published by the Tampa Bay Times. Our ruling The Internet is rife with claims of Stevie Wonder’s beefed-up Florida boycott. It’s short on proof. Most of the stars identified in social media lists may have spoken out against the verdict or in support of Trayvon, but we haven’t seen them go the extra mile and call off shows until the "stand your ground" law is abolished. With the exception of two smaller acts that aren’t included in some iterations of the meme, we could not find evidence to back up the notion that scores of acts are joining up with Wonder's boycott. We rate this statement False. We updated this check after publishing with comments from representatives for Madonna and Alicia Keys.

pomt-05463	"If you're earning under $100,000 a year and you commute to New York every day you pay more to the Port Authority in tolls than you pay to the state of New Jersey in income tax."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/23/john-wisniewski/john-wisniewski-claims-some-new-jersey-commuters-p/	Hudson River tolls are not a drop in the bucket. Crossing the waterway sets motorists paying cash back $12. For some New Jerseyans, commuting to work in New York costs more than they pay in New Jersey income taxes, according to Assemblyman John Wisniewski, a Democrat from Middlesex County. "There's one statistic that says if you're earning under $100,000 a year and you commute to New York every day you pay more to the Port Authority in tolls than you pay to the state of New Jersey in income tax," Wisniewski, the chairman of the state Democratic Party, said in a YouTube video posted on April 13. "That's outrageous and that's got to be changed." PolitiFact New Jersey found Wisniewski’s statement is accurate because people who earn all of their income from wages in New York won’t pay New Jersey income taxes. Wisniewski said his statement refers to a married couple with children. When the assemblyman’s office initially calculated the statistic it was based on a couple who earned $80,000 a year and had two children and one partner commuted to work in New York, using E-ZPass and taking two weeks of vacation, according to Tim O’Donovan, Wisniewski’s communication director. But a broad group of commuters pay more tolls than New Jersey income taxes. New Jersey residents who work in New York file tax returns with both states. New Jersey provides a credit that varies depending on income to residents for taxes paid to New York. Any resident who only has income from wages in New York "will always get a full credit," said Neil Becourtney, a certified public accountant and tax partner at J.H. Cohn LLP’s Roseland office. "They will end up with no New Jersey income tax." Ron West, professor of taxation and law at Fairleigh Dickinson University, noted that if income is earned in New Jersey and New York, there "could be a situation where the credit will not fully offset the New Jersey tax and there would be something owed." Still, even if residents owe nothing to New Jersey, West said, "they’re paying tax, but New Jersey is not getting their hands on it." Instead, New York is. For example, a married couple who earns $100,000 combined would owe New York more than $5,000 in income taxes, factoring in personal exemptions but no other deductions. Had that income been earned in New Jersey, the couple would owe roughly $2,600. The credit offsets the couple’s New Jersey taxes. So, they owe nothing to their home state, but they still pay New York taxes. O’Donovan said Wisniewski’s office also looked at what residents would owe New Jersey without the credit. By that measure, a married couple with a taxable income of less than $94,950 would pay more in tolls than taxes if one partner commuted every weekday using E-ZPass. The same applies for an individual with a taxable income of less than $71,750. Driving to New York five days a week, 52 weeks a year, would cost an E-ZPass user $2,470 in tolls annually. Cash users would pay $3,120. Annual toll costs drop about $100 with two weeks’ vacation taken. Our ruling "If you're earning under $100,000 a year and you commute to New York every day you pay more to the Port Authority in tolls than you pay to the state of New Jersey in income tax," Wisniewski said. If New Jersey residents earn all their income from wages in New York, they would owe New Jersey nothing because a credit offsets their tax liability. They’d still pay income taxes to New York, but Wisniewski specifically said taxes paid to New Jersey. We rate this claim True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-13535	"Her campaign and her supporters in her campaign were the ones that borne out the birther movement."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/29/reince-priebus/reince-priebus-says-clinton-campaign-and-supporter/	People may have heard from Donald Trump about the long-running myth that President Barack Obama was born outside of the United States, but Republicans say the rumor actually started from those on the left. According to GOP chairman Reince Priebus, Hillary Clinton’s 2008 campaign and supporters were responsible for starting the myth. "Her campaign and her supporters in her campaign were the ones that borne out the birther movement," Priebus told NBC’s Meet the Press host Chuck Todd. This isn’t the first time we’ve heard a claim about the birther movement. In 2015, Donald Trump tweeted that Hillary Clinton started the movement in 2008, adding "She was all in!" We rated this statement False, because there was no link to the movement and Clinton. Priebus falls halfway into the same hole, but added that her supporters also started the myth. We wanted to revisit the claim in a broader context. It started with an email In a previous fact-check, we found no evidence that Clinton or her official campaign had any direct link to starting the birther movement. Factcheck.org confirmed this, too. They reported that no journalist who explored this theory found a connection to anyone in the Clinton camp. Clinton even denied the accusation when CNN’s Don Lemon asked if she started the rumor Obama was not born in America. "That is – no. That is so ludicrous, Don. You know, honestly, I just believe that, first of all, it’s totally untrue, and secondly, you know, the president and I have never had any kind of confrontation like that," Clinton said. So the first part of Priebus’ statement is inaccurate. However, Priebus has a point about Clinton supporters starting the movement. During a somewhat close primary race between Obama and Clinton, it was reported that Clinton supporters sent out anonymous emails questioning if Obama was actually born in Hawaii. This was originally reported by Politico and the Telegraph. In addition, John Avalon, editor-in-chief of the the Daily Beast, wrote in his book, Wingnuts: How the Lunatic Fringe Is Hijacking America, that Clinton volunteer Linda Starr played a key role in spreading the tale. Starr, who served as a delegate in the Texas state convention, volunteered for the Clinton campaign during the Texas primary, according to Avalon. Starr teamed up with a Pennsylvania lawyer Philip Berg, and Berg went to federal court, suing to block Obama’s nomination. That suit was thrown out multiple times, according to our article from 2015. On June 7, 2008, Hillary Clinton suspended her campaign, and urged her supporters to rally behind Obama. Our ruling Priebus said Clinton’s campaign and her supporters started the birther movement. Half of this claim is true. It has been reported by several news outlets that Clinton supporters sent emails accusing Obama of being born outside the United States. However, there is no evidence that Clinton or her official campaign had anything to do with it. On balance, we rate Priebus’ claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3b1f7651-2206-4984-bf4f-534f5448ffd6	None	Reince Priebus	None	None	None	2016-08-29T16:17:22	2016-08-29	['None']

pomt-00569	"U.S. Embassy Celebrates America’s Independence on June 4th in Order to Accommodate Muslims."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/10/blog-posting/social-media-posts-say-us-embassy-moved-july-4-cel/	There’s a new outrage at the Obama administration in the social media universe, this time for actions that seem to place Muslim sensibilities above good old-fashioned American patriotism. "U.S. Embassy Celebrates America’s Independence on June 4th in Order to Accommodate Muslims," reads one typical headline on the website Young Conservatives. Other conservative sites published similar posts, including the Federalist Papers Project (which blamed a "misplaced sense of political correctness"), Gateway Pundit (which griped, "It’s an Obama world") and the American Thinker (which called the decision "mind-boggling"). Several readers spotted such claims in their social media feeds and asked us to check them out. The urban-legends site Snopes.com also checked into the claim. Most of the social media posts cite a news story published on June 5, 2015, in the Jakarta Post, an English-language newspaper in Indonesia’s capital city. "The United States Embassy enjoyed its annual 4th of July celebration on Thursday, June 4, one month early, in order to respect the upcoming Ramadhan month, which will begin on June 17 and last for one month," the story said. "U.S. Ambassador to Indonesia Robert O. Blake and U.S. Ambassador to (the Association of Southeast Asian Nations) Nina Hachigian presided over the festivities, which involved brass band renditions of the Star-Spangled Banner and the Indonesian national anthem, Indonesia Raya." The same day, the embassy put out a prepared text of the ambassador’s remarks from the event. "Friends, my fellow Americans, welcome to America's Independence Day celebration!" he said. "We are celebrating a month early to respect the holy month of Ramadan, but today we remember the revolutionary Congress meeting on July 4, 1776, in Philadelphia that issued America’s ‘Declaration of Independence’ that changed the course of modern history." So, there’s a solid basis for the social-media claims that (1) the embassy moved the date of its celebration of July 4, and (2) that it did it in order to accommodate Ramadan. Still, it’s worth noting some additional context that overheated social media posts overlooked or ignored. Indonesia has more Muslim residents than any other country in the world -- an estimated 204 million in 2010, or 88 percent of the country’s total population. So the marking of Ramadan -- the month-long period of daylight fasting and self-reflection -- has a significant impact on daily life in Indonesia. Because Ramadan is tied to the lunar calendar, it cycles around the calendar through all the seasons. This year, it happened to overlap with July 4, but in another year, it could overlap with Christmas or Thanksgiving. Diplomatic experts told PolitiFact that the key reason such parties are held in the first place is not for the benefit of embassy staff or Americans, but rather to share America’s values with opinion leaders in the host country. "An embassy’s Fourth of July celebration is an occasion to play host to a wide range of important figures in the local society, to cultivate their friendship and understanding, and to show off some of the attractive features of American culture -- openness, hospitality, generosity, and the enjoyment of simple pleasures," said Harry W. Kopp, a former foreign service officer who co-authored the book Career Diplomacy. If people in Jakarta are preoccupied with a holy month -- and one where they cannot eat during daylight hours -- then it doesn’t make sense to schedule an outreach event for that period, he said. During the daily State Department briefing on June 9, department spokesman Jeff Rathke confirmed that was the thinking. The purpose of the event "is to represent the United States to the host nation and to the host government," Rathke said. "So of course, to do that most effectively, we want to hold these events when the guests are best able to attend and when we can most effectively achieve the purpose of the event. Such reschedulings are "not unusual" and are done "for various reasons," said Nicholas Kralev, a former diplomatic correspondent and author. These include reschedulings for reasons having nothing to do with Ramadan. "In 2012, the U.S. Embassy in Oman celebrated our 236th year of independence in February that year," according to the diplomatic blog Diplopundit. "We were once told that heat is the reason for these early 4th of July celebrations at various overseas posts. At one (European) post, we heard that it was the heat and the fact that most government officials leave the capital city in July. In 2013 and again in 2014, the US Embassy in Nepal celebrated July 4th three months earlier, in March ‘in the hopes of escaping monsoon weather.’ " Our ruling Various social media posts recently offered headlines like this one: "U.S. Embassy Celebrates America’s Independence on June 4th in Order to Accommodate Muslims" The U.S. Embassy in Jakarta did reschedule its July 4 celebration for June 4, and it explained the move as a way "to respect" the holy month of Ramadan. The switch had to do with increasing the odds of a successful event by scheduling it when local people would not be distracted by a religious observance that requires daytime fasting. Also, it’s not unprecedented for embassies to re-schedule July 4th celebrations for a variety of reasons, including the weather. The blog posts are accurate but require additional information, so we rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2015-06-10T15:59:07	2015-06-06	['United_States']

This one is disturbing enough that we want to start by reiterating that it is fake, just so there is no confusion. The headline on a Feb. 28, 2017, post on NotAllowedTo.com claimed "Babysitter on crystal meth eats 3-month-old baby." The article was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially contrived as part of Facebook’s efforts to fight fake stories in news feeds. This post and others similar to it have been shared on Facebook thousands of times. The story said a 16-year-old named Anna Ritchie smoked the drug and drank alcohol while watching a child, then told police she ate some chicken wings and passed out. The parents had supposedly found the baby (alive) in the microwave, covered in barbecue sauce with bite marks on the boy’s arms and legs. So even in the context of the post, he didn’t really get eaten. If it’s any comfort, not only is the story fake, it also said the boy was expected to recover. The photo included on most of the posts is not a ravenous, drug-smoking teenager from Missouri. It’s actually of a 28-year-old Indiana woman arrested in January 2016 on domestic battery charges. The true source of this story is a Jan. 20, 2016, article on WorldNewsDailyReport.com, a website known for posting fake articles. (That version said the babysitter’s name was Anna Krutchiev.) The site says in its disclaimer that it is responsible for "the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content." There is no indication on the post we checked, or on most of the others reblogging the same fake story, that it's fabricated. Comments on these stories make it clear some horrified readers were tricked. But this story about a babysitter getting high and attempting to eat a child never happened. We rate it Pants On Fire!

pomt-14247	"The polling shows over and over again that, unlike Donald Trump, that with me as the nominee, we beat Hillary Clinton."	mostly false	/california/statements/2016/apr/12/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-repeats-mostly-false-claim-about-polls-sh/	Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz brought his fiery calls for limited government and lower taxes to California on Monday, during stump speeches in Irvine and San Diego. The Texas senator also brought a claim, one PolitiFact recently rated Mostly False, about what the polls show in a general election matchup between him and Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton. "The polling shows over and over again that, unlike Donald Trump, that with me as the (GOP presidential) nominee, we beat Hillary Clinton," Cruz told supporters at an Irvine rally. Sen. Cruz makes his claim about the polls at the 24 minute mark in the above YouTube video. Here’s the Mostly False claim PolitiFact examined, based on comments Cruz made on CNN on April 7. "My focus is on beating Hillary Clinton, and poll after poll after poll shows Donald losing badly to Hillary. And poll after poll after poll shows me beating Hillary." The claims are substantially the same. When rating the statement Cruz made in Irvine, PolitiFact California will apply the same research used by national fact-checking website PolitiFact when it examined Cruz’ claim on CNN. Why PolitiFact rated this claim Mostly False PolitiFact found Cruz was right about polls showing GOP frontrunner Donald Trump losing to Clinton in a November matchup. It rated that statement True earlier this week. But PolitiFact found Cruz wasn’t accurate when portraying his own standing against Clinton in the surveys. PolitiFact examined recent national polls archived on RealClearPolitics.com and found that the Texas senator is off. It found: "Of the nine surveys released in the last month, Cruz beats Clinton in only one — a Fox News poll where Cruz scores 3 percentage points higher than Clinton. The two were tied in the latest McClatchy/Marist poll and in a CNN/ORC poll. The margins of error were +/- 3 percentage points. In the other six polls, Clinton beat Cruz. In four of those surveys, Clinton's advantage exceeded the margin of error. Ted Cruz vs. Hillary Clinton Create your own infographics Cruz was looking stronger against Clinton in February, where he tied or beat Clinton in five of six surveys. But in only one of those polls was Cruz's edge greater than the margin of error. If you use the most recent results from the various polling organizations since Feb. 4, Cruz wins in two, ties in two and loses in seven." PolitiFact contacted Cruz' spokeswoman last week to ask about the results but didn't hear back. It concluded: "So when Cruz says he beats Clinton in poll after poll after poll, he's short a poll or two." Our ruling PolitiFact rated Cruz’ claim on CNN as Mostly False. That rating means it has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Likewise, PolitiFact California rates Cruz’ claim at the Irvine rally as Mostly False.

pomt-05990	Says 282 Texas school districts have requested emergency waivers to increase elementary school class sizes because of "unprecedented fiscal challenges."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/jan/21/silvestre-reyes/silvestre-reyes-says-says-282-texas-school-distric/	In a Jan. 9, 2012, press release, U.S. Rep. Silvestre Reyes, D-El Paso, urged Republican Gov. Rick Perry to convene a special legislative session so lawmakers can provide more money to "under-served schools." Citing the Legislature's 2011 decision to give school districts $4 billion less through August 2013 than they would have gotten under previous funding formulas, Reyes said: "Our school districts are now experiencing unprecedented fiscal challenges and being forced to take drastic measures, like increasing class sizes and cutting instructional supports. In fact, the Texas Education Agency is reporting that 282 school districts have requested emergency waivers to increase class sizes." That would be nearly a third of the state's 1,000-plus districts. Is the congressman right? His statistic checks out, we found, but it's unlikely that all the requests were driven by financial difficulties. Texas has capped the size of classes in kindergarten through fourth grade since 1984, when the Legislature passed a measure setting the limit at 22 students per teacher. The thinking at the time was that smaller classes would result in greater student achievement. But the caps had an out. Currently, a school district may receive a waiver if the state education commissioner "finds the limit works an undue hardship on the district." In an interview, Texas Education Agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us that state education officials originally set two scenarios under which waivers would be granted: if a district were unable to hire enough teachers or lacked the classroom space to meet the 22:1 ratio. Later, she said, the agency added an additional factor — if a district had experienced unanticipated enrollment growth. From fall 1993 through spring 2010, the number of districts granted class-size waivers generally fluctuated between 90 and 150 each semester, according to information in two reports from the education agency. Ratcliffe told us that over the years, the agency approved "virtually every waiver (request) that was submitted." To support Reyes' claim that the number of Texas school districts seeking waivers rocketed to 282 this school year, his office sent us a Jan. 3, 2012, El Paso Times article containing figures attributed to the state. As of Dec. 21, 2011, the article says, 282 districts had requested waivers for 1,643 campuses and 8,186 classrooms. When requesting a waiver, a district must designate how many classes at each campus will exceed the cap. Ratcliffe, confirming the 282 figure, told us that of those requests, 266 were granted outright while 16 districts were given partial approval, meaning some campuses could exceed the limit while others could not. The education agency generally rejected waivers for campuses rated "academically unacceptable" under the state's education accountability rating system, Ratcliffe said. As of Jan. 10, 2012, a total of 286 districts had sought class-size waivers. Of those, 270 — including the Austin, Del Valle, Eanes, Hays, Lake Travis, Leander, Manor, Pflugerville and Round Rock districts — had been granted waivers outright. That's an all-time high, Ratcliffe said. For comparison, she said, there were 168 waivers granted to districts in the 2010-11 school year. So, as of early 2012, district class-size waivers had increased 61 percent since the previous school year. What’s going on? Even before the 2011 legislative session began in January, state funding for education was expected to be stressed because of lawmakers' vow to balance the 2012-13 state budget without raising taxes. In addition to the $4 billion drop in formula-based funding to districts, lawmakers also did not renew about $1.3 billion in grant funding for education programs. Some districts had local funding problems as well, Ratcliffe said, as declining property values reduced property tax revenue. To help districts deal with the budget-tightening, lawmakers considered softening the 22-to-1 class-size cap. They did not agree on any change, but in the fall, Education Commissioner Robert Scott made it easier for districts to exceed the limit by adding "financial hardship" as a fourth reason districts could qualify for a waiver. Ratcliffe told us that this school year is unusual because some districts had enough classroom space to adhere to the class-size rule and had access to qualified teacher candidates, but still lacked the funds to hire them. Ratcliffe speculated that districts' financial difficulties are what led to the big uptick in waiver requests this school year. Another likely factor, she said, is that some districts built their budgets assuming that lawmakers would loosen the class-size cap — and when that didn't happen, they were too far along in budgeting for the year to adjust. We asked the education agency whether all the districts that had requested waivers as of early 2012 had cited "financial hardship" in their applications. Ratcliffe said the agency had not crunched the data that way. On Jan. 19, 2012, we looked at the data ourselves after generating a report on this school year’s waivers from the education agency’s website. The report had 2,911 entries, one for each grade level of each school that would be affected by a waiver. For example, if a district received a waiver for kindergarten and fourth grade at one elementary school, there would be two entries in the report for that campus. Our overview: ** At least 163 school districts that had received waivers cited "financial hardship" as the reason for seeking the exception for at least one campus. That's 60 percent of the total number of districts that had received waivers as of early January. ** Some districts that requested waivers hadn't cited "financial hardship" as a reason, including Houston, the state's largest school district, which had received waivers for 441 grade levels over 146 campuses, and Austin, which had received waivers for 18 grade levels in 16 elementary schools. ** Some districts exclusively cited the "financial hardship" reason in their requests, including Dallas, which had received exceptions for 45 grade levels on 34 campuses, and Bexar County's Northside, which had received waivers for 150 grade levels on 63 campuses. Our ruling Reyes accurately recaps how many districts had requested class-size waivers from the state education agency as of late December 2011 — a number that subsequently grew. Yet, his suggestion that financial difficulties born from the 2011 Legislature’s actions are responsible for all of the waiver requests is an overstatement, considering that historically, dozens of districts have sought and received waivers each year. Then again, 60 percent of districts that had received a waiver as of early January cited the new "financial hardship" reason when seeking permission to exceed the class-size law.

pomt-12406	"Voter turnout in 2016 was reduced by approx. 200,000 votes because of WI’s photo ID laws."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2017/may/24/tammy-baldwin/photo-id-law-caused-200000-drop-wisconsin-voter-tu/	As they have for years, claims of voter suppression continue to be made by Democrats, including U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin. When President Donald Trump signed an order to create a commission to study voter fraud, Moore attacked its vice chairman as having "led numerous voter suppression initiatives against minorities." Five days later, on May 17, 2017, Baldwin made this declaration on Twitter: Voter turnout in 2016 was reduced by approx. 200,000 votes because of WI’s photo ID laws. We’ve rated Mostly True a claim by TV show host John Oliver that in Sauk City, Wis., the office that provides identification for voting was open only four days in 2016. But on a claim closer to Baldwin’s, we rated False tweets that said "300,000 voters were turned away" by Wisconsin’s voter ID law in the 2016 presidential election. A federal judge had determined that some 300,000 registered voters lacked the necessary ID to vote, but there was no evidence that anywhere near that number of people were turned away from the polls. What about Baldwin’s claim? What voter ID is about Thirty-four states have laws requesting or requiring voters to show some form of identification at the polls, according to the nonprofit National Conference of State Legislatures. Wisconsin is among seven states that have a strict requirement -- voters without acceptable identification must vote on a provisional ballot and also take additional steps after election day for their vote to be counted. As the group puts it: Proponents see increasing requirements for identification as a way to prevent in-person voter impersonation and increase public confidence in the election process. Opponents say there is little fraud of this kind, and the burden on voters unduly restricts the right to vote and imposes unnecessary costs and administrative burdens on elections administrators. A few days before Baldwin made her statement, the Associated Press reported on examples of Wisconsin residents who said they couldn’t get the ID they needed to vote in the 2016 presidential election -- the first presidential contest in which the state’s ID law was in place. But the story said it is unknown how many people did not vote because they didn’t have proper identification. Baldwin’s evidence To back Baldwin’s claim, her campaign cited a report issued two weeks earlier. It’s worth noting who was behind it. The report was commissioned by Priorities USA Action, a political action committee that supported Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton and describes itself as a "voter-centric progressive advocacy organization" that is "committed to standing up to the Trump administration and its allies." The group says its "voter suppression analysis" is part of an effort to "glean lessons that can be applied to strengthen Democrats in elections in 2018, 2020 and beyond." The report was conducted by CIVIS USA, a Chicago firm founded by the chief analytics officer of the 2012 Obama campaign team. The report compares the 2012 and 2016 elections. It says that on average, turnout increased 1.3 percent in states in which there was no change to voter ID laws, but decreased 3.3 percent in Wisconsin. The report concludes that had there been no voter ID in Wisconsin, turnout would have risen by 1.3 percent -- or 200,000 voters -- over the 2012 total. (Although it doesn’t affect the rating of Baldwin’s claim, the report also argues, based on other data, that the 200,000 people it refers to "would have been more Democratic," and notes that Clinton lost to Trump in Wisconsin by about 20,000 votes.) Ignoring other factors Roughly 3 million votes were cast in each of the last three presidential elections in Wisconsin. As we’ve noted, the 2016 turnout was lower than 2012, when Obama won reelection and there was no voter ID requirement. On the other hand, the 2016 turnout was higher than when Obama was first elected in 2008 and, again, there was no voter ID law. More importantly, according to experts, the methodology of the report Baldwin cites is lacking. Put simply: The voter ID requirement undoubtedly prevented or discouraged some people from voting. But the report attributes all of the decrease in turnout to the ID law, when there are many other reasons that could also explain it, including a lack of enthusiasm for Clinton or Trump, or perhaps a belief that Trump couldn’t win Wisconsin. "The story is getting picked up by Democrats and left-leaning smart people across social media because it confirms what they already think," University of California, Irvine law and political science professor Rick Hasen wrote on his election law blog. "But there is reason for considerable caution about this study, which is at odds with what other studies of the effect of Wisconsin’s voter ID has found. There are questions about the study’s methodology being raised by people who know their stuff." Yale University political science professor Eitan Hersh tweeted: "No offense, but this is something that is going to be shared hundreds of times and does not meet acceptable evidence standards." Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us there’s simply no way to put a number on how many people didn’t vote because of the voter ID law. Bucknell University political science professor Lindsay Nielson has done research finding that voter ID laws lower minority turnout and benefit the Republican Party. But as for the voter turnout decline in Wisconsin, "there could be a multitude of other reasons" why voters stayed home, she told us. "Voter ID laws could very well have been suppressing voter turnout in Wisconsin," but "we just can’t say it’s 200,000 people. We need a lot more research before we can draw that conclusion." Baldwin campaign spokesman Scott Spector responded by saying "there is no reason to question the (CIVIS) study or believe other factors were involved," because of one of the findings in a September 2014 by the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office. But that finding didn't look at the 2016 election and involved two different states. The GAO found turnout between the 2008 and 2012 elections declined more in Kansas and Tennessee than in states that did not change voter ID requirements -- by an estimated 1.9 to 2.2 percentage points more in Kansas and 2.2 to 3.2 percentage points more in Tennessee — and the results "were attributable to changes in those two states’ voter ID requirements." Our rating Baldwin says: "Voter turnout in 2016 was reduced by approx. 200,000 votes because of WI’s photo ID laws." A report she cites from a Democratic candidate-supporting group says a decline in voter turnout between the 2012 and 2016 presidential elections in Wisconsin was entirely due to the state’s new photo identification requirement for voting. But experts say that while photo ID requirements reduces turnout to some extent, they question the methodology of the report and say there is no way to put a number on how many people in Wisconsin didn’t vote because of the ID requirement.

pomt-10116	If you're a small business and don't "adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama mandates, he's going to fine you."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/15/john-mccain/small-businesses-are-exempt/	John McCain talked a lot about "Joe the Plumber" during the third presidential debate, saying Joe is an example of a small business owner who would not do well under Barack Obama's policies. "Now, my old buddy, Joe, Joe the plumber, is out there," McCain said. "Now, Joe, Senator Obama's plan, if you're a small business ... if you don't adopt the health care plan that Senator Obama mandates, he's going to fine you." McCain used this charge during the second debate as well. We found it False then, and it's still problematic now. Here's the outline of Obama's plan: It expands health care coverage for those who don't have it by a number of strategies, such as creating national pools for individuals to buy their own insurance. It increases eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. And it aims at reining in costs for everyone by streamlining medical record-keeping and emphasizing preventive care. Obama's plan does not mandate coverage, except for children. Obama's plan says that employers who don't offer their employees insurance will be required to contribute to the national pool, what McCain calls a "fine." But Obama's plan specifically exempts small businesses from contributing to the pool. The plan does not define what's a small business and what's not. We can't say for sure whether plumber Joe would be considered a small business under Obama's plan or not. But generally, Obama does not fine "small businesses." They are specifically exempt. We rate McCain's claim False.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-10-15T00:00:00	2008-10-15	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-12711	Under the Affordable Care Act, "some people were gaming the system" by paying "for nine months of insurance, get 12 -- the other three for free."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/08/greg-walden/are-americans-gaming-system-get-cheaper-obamacare-/	Some Republicans who want to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act have recently argued that the current law encourages beneficiaries to game the system to get 12 months of coverage for the price of nine. The idea is that the law bars insurers from cutting off beneficiaries from their coverage during the first three months after they have stopped paying their premiums. This provision was intended to protect beneficiaries from being caught without coverage due to sudden financial crises or paperwork errors. But this provision does, in theory, allow people to stop paying their premiums after nine months, not paying for three, but then signing up for a new plan again. The first time we noticed this talking point was when former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., mentioned it during an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union in late February. "The reality is today that thousands, maybe approaching millions of Americans, are paying nine months for insurance," Santorum said. "Why? Because you pay for your insurance for nine months, there’s a provision in Obamacare that says you can’t be thrown off your plan for three months." Rep. Greg Walden, R-Ore., echoed this point on March 7, as House Republican leaders were touting their new bill to repeal and replace President Barack Obama’s signature health care law. "One of the issues we found is that some people were gaming the system with guaranteed issue," Walden, who chairs the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said at a news conference. ("Guaranteed issue" bars health insurers from denying coverage for such factors as pre-existing conditions.) "It's not that they had a pre-existing condition necessarily," Walden continued. "It's they'd pay for nine months of insurance, get 12, the other three for free, automatically come back in the market. That was part of what's causing this spiral downward." We wondered: Are significant numbers of Americans intentionally gaming the system, even though it would almost certainly mean additional paperwork and bureaucratic hassles, in order to save three months’ worth of premiums a year? What we found is that while such a loophole exists, there is no direct evidence of people intentionally gaming the system in this way -- and even the maximum universe of people who could theoretically be doing this represents a small proportion of the law's beneficiaries. Walden’s office directed us to a May 2016 study by McKinsey & Company's Center for U.S. Health System Reform. The study is based on roughly 16,000 interviews conducted in eight rounds between 2013 and 2016. Those interviewed are uninsured and individually insured consumers but does not include those eligible for Medicaid and Medicare. One of the study’s findings, headlined at the front of the report, was this one: "Nearly a quarter of consumers stopped payment on their premiums in 2015, yet most repurchased an exchange plan in 2016 and many repurchased the same plan." Superficially, this seems to bolster Walden’s point -- but looking only at the headline obscures some important nuances. For instance, while Walden painted this as an example of nine months in, three months out, the reality is that the study found a more complicated picture. Among those who stopped paying, 30 percent stopped in the first quarter of the year, 13 stopped in the second quarter and 22 percent stopped in the third quarter. Only 29 percent stopped paying in the fourth quarter -- the closest scenario to what Walden described. (Another 17 percent didn’t know what quarter they stopped paying.) And it’s important to remember that these percentages don’t refer to all people who have a plan through the Affordable Care Act -- they refer only to the 21 percent of those surveyed who said they stopped paying their premiums. And 29 percent of 21 percent works out to 6 percent of all survey respondents. Six percent is a pretty small share of people who could be gaming the system -- but it’s also important to note that we don’t know whether these people actually are gaming the system on purpose. The 6 percent figure is a maximum universe of possible system-gamers. In reality, the percentage is probably well below that, judging by other data from the same survey. The survey found that 36 percent of those who stopped paying did so because they gained other coverage. Those people certainly can’t be accused of gaming the system. If you exclude them, the 6 percent figure drops to 3.8 percent. Another 26 percent said they could no longer afford insurance. For some people, affordability isn’t inconsistent with gaming the system; it may be the reason they decided to do so. Still, it seems likely that some fraction of these people were genuinely cash-strapped and dropped out without expecting to sign up again. So the maximum universe of possible system-gamers is probably in the neighborhood of 2 percent to 3 percent. And it’s important to remember that this is the maximum possible universe of people gaming the system based on this data. The actual number of people gaming the system -- a behavior that can only be triangulated through the data -- could be well below this 2 to 3 percent baseline. Bottom line: Gaming the system probably happens, but it’s pretty rare. "The number of people gaming the system appears to be small, based on the McKinsey study," said Stan Dorn, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute Health Policy Center. "That fits my general sense -- that most consumers are really confused about marketplace coverage and not really in a position to game the system. Some can do so, but the proportion is small." Donald H. Taylor, a health policy specialist in Duke University's Sanford School of Public Policy, agreed. Given the "empirical holes" in the data, Taylor said, "the congressman overstated the case." Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, said that the lack of survey data on the specific question of gaming the system makes it hard to speak to motivations. Walden’s statement "is by its nature speculative because the data we have remains so poor," she said. The experts did agree that even if a small number of people are taking advantage of the loophole, it’s reasonable to discuss methods for closing the loophole through changes in the law. That said, Taylor added that "churn" among the insured population has been a longstanding concern even before the Affordable Care Act was passed. "That is why it is a tricky problem to address," he said. "If it was the same people all the time, it would be relatively easy to fix." Our ruling Walden said, "One of the issues we found is that some people were gaming the system" by paying "for nine months of insurance, get 12 -- the other three for free." A nine-month loophole exists, and experts say it’s fair to assume that some people might be exploiting it. But among the universe of people who have purchased insurance under the law, the percentage doing so is almost certainly small. Meanwhile, Walden’s assertion frames it as a certainty that the intention is to game the system, when in fact the study cited by his office didn’t probe that as a motivation.

pomt-09630	"I haven't missed a vote since 1993."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/06/chuck-grassley/grassley-claims-he-hasnt-missed-vote-1993/	Senators love to boast about their voting records, and Charles Grassley, a Republican from Iowa, is no exception. During a weekly conference call with Iowa reporters, Grassley was asked about his re-election prospects this year. "I'm going to have tough competition," he said of his three opponents. "Even though there's suggestions at the national level that this could be a very Republican year, I can't assume that it's going to be a very Republican year. And I'm going to have to campaign very, very hard. ... For instance, I haven't missed a vote since 1993. I hope I don't have to miss any votes this year because of a campaign." Has Grassley really been so steadfast? We had to limit our investigation to roll call votes; in the Senate, less controversial bills or amendments are frequently adopted by unanimous consent or by voice vote, meaning members simply say "aye" or "nay." First, we turned to Congressional Quarterly , a publication that annually studies lawmakers' voting records. According to CQ 's Web site, Grassley has had a flawless voting record since 1993. The Washington Post also compiles similar information, and we found that Grassley hasn't been absent for a vote since he missed four votes on July 14, 1993. (Those votes pertained to a bill that would allow federal employees to participate in the political process so long as it was done outside of work.) What kept Grassley from the Senate floor that day in 1993? Flooding in Iowa, according to the Des Moines Register, noting that the senator has become "the iron man of the Senate racking up ... 5,700 consecutive votes." Indeed, as an average, Grassley has voted about 99.6 percent of the time since he took office in 1981. Other senators elected at the same time cannot tout such near-perfect records. For example, Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania has, on average, voted 93 percent of the time in the last 28 years, first as a Republican then as a Democrat. And Sen. Chris Dodd, a Democrat from Connecticut, has voted on average about 90.7 percent of the time. Grassley has gone to great lengths to maintain his record. When, for example, a blizzard threatened Washington, D.C., on the eve of a crucial health care overhaul vote on Dec. 19, 2009, Grassley spent the night in his office to make sure he didn't miss it. "Bc of potential blizzard I've come to office to sleep," he Tweeted the night of the 18th. "Vote at 720am vote Sat. Hv not missed vote 7/93. 5700 votes consecutive." Grassley said he hadn't missed a vote since 1993, which is certainly correct for every recorded vote. Grassley has every right to brag. We give him a True.

pomt-07368	House Republican plan would increase costs for Oregon seniors by $6,000 with health care vouchers instead of Medicare	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/may/06/david-wu/david-wu-highlights-worries-over-paul-ryans-medica/	Medicare is the federal program that provides health care to 46.5 million Americans (including 511,450 in Oregon) and remains one of the country’s most popular but expensive programs. It’s also something less obvious - a potent political tool that candidates use often to help their chances. It’s especially true for embattled candidates looking for some medicine of their own. Which leads us to Rep. David Wu, the incumbent Democrat from Oregon’s 1st district whose erratic behavior in the weeks before Election Day last year triggered the departure of several senior staffers and questions about his chances to win re-election in 2012. In an April 21 press release, Wu warned that seniors in his district would face $6,000 in higher annual health care costs if a Republican budget proposal is passed. "Amazingly, House Republicans think they can get away with plans to increase costs for Oregon seniors by $6,000, issuing health care vouchers in order to give millionaires another $200,000 in tax breaks," Wu says in his press release. It’s an inflammatory statement designed to energize seniors and Medicare supporters to rally against the budget written by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. As a byproduct, Wu is also hoping that defeating the budget plan will bring votes his way in 2012. On May 5, 2011, senior Republicans conceded that a deal with Democrats on Medicare was virtually impossible. But let’s examine the math behind Wu's suggestion. Ryan’s proposal aimed to balance the budget by cutting spending $5.8 trillion over 10 years, reforming taxes and restraining the growth of the most costly entitlement programs - Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Right now, Medicare is a "fee for service" program, which means if you qualify for coverage the program will pay your health care provider for each procedure or visit. Ryan wanted instead a subsidy that will pay part - but probably not all - the cost of a person’s health care insurance. "Beginning in 2022, all newly-eligible Medicare beneficiaries (i.e., individuals turning 65 as well as younger, disabled individuals becoming eligible for Medicare) would only have access to health coverage through private insurance plans, rather than through the current government-run Medicare program," an analysis in April by the non-partisan Kaiser Family Foundation said. "Under the new premium support system … the government would make payments directly to private health plans on behalf of Medicare-eligible enrollees, rather than pay hospitals, physicians, and other medical providers directly for the services. …If the government payments to plans on behalf of enrollees were insufficient to cover premiums and/or other costs, beneficiaries would be responsible for additional costs," Kaiser says. This is where Wu’s math comes in, with help from Kaiser and the Congressional Budget Office. Wu says the $6,000 higher cost per year is the difference between the amount of the federal voucher and the likely cost of health insurance purchased on the open market. CBO says that the most generous $8,000 voucher provided by Ryan’s plan would cover 39 percent of the cost of the average private plan for a 65-year-old in 2022. Which means the plan actually costs about $20,500 and that beneficiaries would be on the hook for about $12,500 of the cost. According to calculations by the CBO and Kaiser, a typical beneficiary would have to pay $6,150 out-of-pocket in 2022 if Medicare essentially remains the same as today. Under Ryan’s plan that out-of-pocket cost would have jumped to $12,500, which is an increase of $6,350. Ryan argues that Wu and other critics, including President Barack Obama, do not take into account the effect millions of new customers flooding a market will have. He figures competition will lower prices as insurers battle to capture new business underwritten with government subsidies. "Medicare is projected to go bankrupt in just nine years unless we act to curb the relentlessly rising cost of health care," Ryan wrote in an April 24 op-ed published by The Washington Post. "This cannot be done with across-the-board cuts in Washington. It has to be done by giving seniors the tools to fight back against skyrocketing costs. That’s why our budget saves Medicare by using competition to weed out inefficient providers, improve the quality of health care for seniors and drive costs down." He and his allies also point out that Medicare costs are growing explosively and if not addressed the program will require deep cuts or higher out of pocket costs. Regardless of the uncertainties, there is strong evidence that people who reach age 65 in 10 years and begin using Medicare would certainly pay more under Ryan’s plan than they would if they became eligible today. Is the difference $6,000 or more? Could it be less? The answer to each is perhaps. But given current knowledge and calculations $6,000 is a number that can be defended.

pomt-00397	"Someone can write an article or book, totally make up stories and form a picture of a person that is literally the exact opposite of the fact, and get away with it without retribution or cost. Don’t know why Washington politicians don’t change libel laws?"	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/05/donald-trump/donald-trump-inaccurately-describes-libel-law/	Donald Trump has been talking about changing libel laws since before he was elected president. "I'm going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money," Trump said at a February rally in Fort Worth, Texas. "We're going to open up those libel laws." Trump returned to this theme following the release of excerpts from Fear: Trump in the White House, a new book by veteran journalist Bob Woodward that paints Trump and his White House in a negative light. "Isn’t it a shame that someone can write an article or book, totally make up stories and form a picture of a person that is literally the exact opposite of the fact, and get away with it without retribution or cost," Trump tweeted on Sept. 5 "Don’t know why Washington politicians don’t change libel laws?" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com If Trump wants to change libel law, he needs a more accurate understanding of what the current law states. The law does not currently protect people who "totally make up stories." (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Some basics about libel law The broad legal category of "defamation" includes both libel, which takes the form of writing, and slander, which takes the form of spoken words. Generally speaking, if a person believes that someone else’s statements have caused injury to their reputation, they can sue, claiming defamation. The law makes a distinction that’s relevant to Trump’s situation: If the person alleging defamation is a public figure, they must clear a higher bar than for ordinary individuals to prove that defamation has occurred. The unanimous 1964 U.S. Supreme Court decision in New York Times vs. Sullivan holds that the First Amendment generally protects even false statements about public officials and public figures. But it does not protect statements made with "actual malice," which means that the publication knew they were false and published the material anyway, or that they were published with reckless disregard to whether the material was true or false. Would current libel standards cover the example Trump tweeted about? Experts told us Trump’s scenario of someone who would "totally make up stories and form a picture of a person that is literally the exact opposite of the fact" would be subject to current defamation laws. "The president's tweet clearly assumes a situation where two things are the case," said Leonard M. Niehoff, a University of Michigan law professor. "First, that the person has ‘totally’ and intentionally ‘made the information up’ — it’s not an instance of a mistake but of deliberate fabrication. And second, that the statement made is one of ‘fact’ and so is capable of being proved true or false, rather than being an opinion or a belief." Given this scenario, Niehoff said, the law of defamation gives the aggrieved party a claim. "Even under the highly protective standard of New York Times vs. Sullivan, a public official or figure would have a claim under these circumstances because this meets the test for ‘actual malice,’" Niehoff said. "So to the extent that the president is describing the state of the law, he is simply and objectively wrong." Of course, the plaintiff in Trump’s example would have to do more than just assert their case. They would have to prove it in court. This is a high bar but not an impossible one. "Casebooks are filled with examples of people who have successfully used libel law to challenge false statements and portrayals in articles, books and movies," said David Ardia, co-director of the University of North Carolina Center for Media Law and Policy. In 2003, for instance, Tom Cruise won a $10 million judgment in a defamation case against an "erotic wrestler" who claimed he’d had a gay affair with the actor. In 2017, a jury awarded three far less famous plaintiffs with $247 million after it found a highway billboard operated by New Hampshire mortgage broker Michael Gill featured defamatory statements about them. Much more common than outright court victories, however, are defamation cases that lead to a monetary settlement between the parties. This effectively makes defamation law a tool to produce a "retribution or cost" against the alleged perpetrator without having to win a case in court. Examples of celebrities who have reached such settlements include actress Katie Holmes and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura. Alternately, a plaintiff could file a suit under the "tort of false light," said Jane E. Kirtley, a professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota’s Hubbard School of Journalism and Mass Communication. Such lawsuits cover embarrassment from a misleading or untrue implication. Trump’s use of the phrase "form a picture of a person" does sound like the way false light claims are often framed, Niehoff said. But if this is what Trump intended, he said, it only makes his tweet doubly wrong, because there would be two potential claims — defamation and false light — that would be available to the aggrieved party, at least in the states in which false light suits are allowed. About the only way a defamer could "get away with it without retribution or cost" if the target of the alleged defamation fails to file a lawsuit challenging it, or if they hire a lawyer who isn’t strong enough to win the case. But legal experts don’t consider this to be a significant caveat. "The system makes ‘retribution’ — or, as we lawyers fondly call it, ‘justice’ — available, but that always comes in the form of an opportunity, not a guarantee," Niehoff said. Ironically, Trump himself is currently the defendant in a defamation suit filed by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on his television show, The Apprentice, who has alleged that Trump had groped her. Trump denied Zervos’ allegation on multiple occasions, which prompted her to respond with the defamation suit. "His brutalizing of her a second time — this time falsely condemning her to the world as a liar for having the temerity to reveal his earlier unwanted sexual groping of her body — directly caused serious injury," her attorneys argued in court filings. Given Trump’s legal exposure, Niehoff said, "perhaps he should be careful what he wishes for" in his tweets about defamation law. Our ruling Trump tweeted that "someone can write an article or book, totally make up stories and form a picture of a person that is literally the exact opposite of the fact, and get away with it without retribution or cost." This is not accurate. Anyone who alleges defamation from a fabricated and inaccurate account could sue under at least one and possibly two legal doctrines, and if they did, they would have a good chance of prevailing at trial — even a public figure like Trump, who would have to meet a higher legal standard.

pomt-01041	"You cannot build a little guy up by tearing a big guy down -- Abraham Lincoln said it."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/25/john-kasich/did-abraham-lincoln-say-you-cannot-build-little-gu/	In his argument against President Barack Obama’s proposed increase in capital gains tax, Ohio Gov. John Kasich invoked the words of a vaunted former president -- or at least he tried. Obama wants to create a nationwide free community college program. How he proposes to pay for it -- partially by increasing taxes on the wealthy via a higher tax rate on income earned from selling assets -- would be "a prescription for economic slowdown," Kasich, a Republican, said on Fox News Sunday Jan. 25. To support his position, he relayed a quote that he said comes from former President Abraham Lincoln. "You can’t build a little guy up by tearing the big guy down," Kasich said. "Abraham Lincoln said it then, and he’s right." There’s only one problem. Lincoln never said that. The true author is Rev. William J. H. Boetcker, a minister-turned-public speaker, born in 1873, eight years after Lincoln was killed. After he left the pulpit, Boetcker, a political conservative, negotiated labor relations. In 1916, Boetcker published the list of "10 Cannots," a collection of personal truisms largely centered around the benefits of laissez-faire capitalism. The axioms have been mistakenly attributed to Lincoln for decades. Here are all 10 Cannots (Kasich used No. 3.): 1. You cannot bring about prosperity by discouraging thrift. 2. You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. 3. You cannot help little men by tearing down big men. 4. You cannot lift the wage earner by pulling down the wage payer. 5. You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich. 6. You cannot establish sound security on borrowed money. 7. You cannot further the brotherhood of man by inciting class hatred. 8. You cannot keep out of trouble by spending more than you earn. 9. You cannot build character and courage by destroying men's initiative and independence. 10. You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they can and should do for themselves. So why do Kasich and others these quotes to Lincoln? It stems from Boetcker himself, according to Did Lincoln Own Slaves? And Other Frequently Asked Questions about Abraham Lincoln, a book by Gerald Prokopowicz, a Lincoln expert at East Carolina University. In 1916, Boetcker published leaflets that had a real Lincoln quote on one side and his "cannots" on the other. A reader could easily assume these were also Lincoln quotes, and they did. Kasich’s spokesman pointed us to the fact that in 1950, Rep. Frances Bolton, R-Ohio, read the 10 Cannots into the Congressional Record. She supposedly got them from one of the earliest talk show hosts, Galen Drake. A 1950 Library of Congress report said of the frequent misquotation, "There seems to be no way of overtaking the rapid pace with which the mistaken identity has been spreading," according to a 1992 Washington Post column. Probably the most well-documented misuse of these quotes came from Reagan at the 1992 Republican National Convention in Houston. Reagan said, "What (Democrats) truly don't understand is the principle so eloquently stated by Abraham Lincoln: ‘You cannot strengthen the weak by weakening the strong. You cannot help the wage-earner by pulling down the wage-payer. You cannot help the poor by destroying the rich. You cannot help men permanently by doing for them what they could and should do for themselves.’ " So we’ve established that Lincoln did not say that line Kasich used to support his position against raising taxes on the wealthy -- "You cannot help little men by tearing down big men." But we were left wondering if, in any case, does this at all line up with Lincoln’s position on taxes? As it turns out, not really. Lincoln and taxes Well, Lincoln signed the first federal income taxes into law in 1861 in order to fund the Civil War. What’s more is that these taxes were progressive -- meaning that the wealthier people paid higher tax rates on their income. The highest rate -- 5 percent -- applied to incomes roughly equivalent to $1 million today, Prokopowicz told PolitiFact in an email. "To the extent that signing the bill indicated his approval, Lincoln thus approved of the concept of higher taxes on the wealthy," he said. "This is consistent with Lincoln's politics generally." (Quick note: Kasich was talking about capital gains taxes specifically, and here we’re talking about income tax. Until 1921, capital gains were taxed at the same rate as ordinary income.) Lincoln’s Treasury Secretary Salmon Chase came up with the idea for the tax, which is further evidence that Lincoln supported higher taxes on the wealthy, said Geoff Elliot, expert and author of the Abraham Lincoln Blog. He added that a subsequent act in 1862 created the precursor to the Internal Revenue Service Much of the debate over the Civil War income tax laws centered around whether Lincoln had the constitutional authority to impose these taxes, said Jennifer Weber, a Lincoln expert at the University of Kansas. (In 1881, the Supreme Court held up Lincoln’s authority.) In a reminder of how much political parties have changed, Weber noted that it was the conservative Democrats taking Lincoln, a Republican, to task over executive overreach and implementing taxes. There is "precious little" record of Lincoln’s views on taxes, said Ed Steers, author of several books on the Lincoln assassination. But he pointed us to a speech Lincoln delivered to the 164th Ohio Infantry in 1864, where he advocated for the progressive tax law. Lincoln said: "It is fair that each man shall pay taxes in exact proportion to the value of his property; but if we should wait before collecting a tax, to adjust the taxes on each man in exact proportion with every other man, we should never collect any tax at all. " Prokopowicz added that Lincoln believed strongly in "opportunity capitalism" and that the government should not adopt policies that would prevent anyone from acquiring wealth. However, Lincoln also believed that the government had a vital role in creating opportunity, and individuals ought to contribute to the government in order to reap its benefits. "I go for all sharing the privileges of the government, who assist in bearing its burthens," Lincoln wrote in 1836 while running for the Illinois state Legislature. Our ruling Kasich said that Lincoln said, "You can’t build a little guy up by tearing the big guy down." It’s well-established that this is not a Lincoln quote. Many have misattributed it to Lincoln, but its real author was a politically conservative minister and public speaker who was born several years after Lincoln’s assassination. Additionally, Kasich used the idea to support his position against raising taxes on the wealthy. Lincoln, however, instituted the first-ever federal income tax, and it was progressive.

pomt-04291	Says Mark Hass "raised your taxes by $1 billion in a single day."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/nov/01/taxpayer-association-oregon/did-sen-mark-hass-raise-taxes-1-billion-single-day/	Sometimes elections can start to feel a little like a song on repeat: Same candidates, same issues, same talking points -- over and over again. That’s the case with a legislative attack we first saw in 2010 that claimed Senate Majority Leader Richard Devlin, D-Tualatin, had raised "your taxes by $1 billion in a single day." Back then, we called the claim Half True. Well, the attack is back this year -- only this time we found the mailer from the Taxpayer Association of Oregon targeting Mark Hass, a Beaverton Democrat. (The Senate Democrats’ campaign arm says it’s also being used against Sen. Laurie Monnes Anderson of Gresham and Rep. Arnie Roblan, the Democratic co-speaker from Coos Bay.) A quick look at our previous PolitiFact reveals the ad has not changed much over the past couple years. Much as it had originally, the mailer breaks the tax increase down to the second, noting that raising taxes by $1 billion in a single day comes down to more than $41 million an hour, or nearly $700,000 a minute, or $11,574 each second. And the question asked on the other side of the mailer is, "Can we afford four more years of" whichever candidate is being targeted. The mailer also cites the same three taxes, House Bill 2649, 3405 and 2116, but adds a new one for this election -- HB 2001. Here’s what PolitiFact found last time regarding the first three bills: "House Bill 2649 created two new tax brackets, including a 10.8 percent bracket for joint filers with income above $250,000 and for single filers with income above $125,000. For tax years after 2011, the rate is scheduled to drop to 9.9 percent. The bill also phased out some federal tax deductions. The Legislative Revenue Office estimated it would raise taxes for 2.5 percent of full-year individual filers (38,000) and 6.1 percent of returns (25,600) that report business income or loss. The proposal was projected to raise $472 million in 2009-11; it became Measure 66 in the January 2010 special election. "House Bill 3405 raised the corporate minimum tax from $10 -- first set in 1931 and untouched until 2009 -- to a sliding scale of $150 to $100,000 depending on sales in Oregon. The $10 minimum for S-corporations went from $10 to $150. The bill also created a second tax rate of 7.9 percent and implemented filing fees. The Legislative Revenue Office estimated this would affect more than 75 percent of C-corporations and nearly all 62,000 S-corporations. The proposal was projected to raise $261 million in 2009-11; it became Measure 67 in the January 2010 special election. House Bill 2116 we explained this way: "This proposal did two things. One, it levied a 1 percent tax on insurers, projected to raise more than $115 million in 2009-11 to insure 80,000 children. Two, it replaced an expiring tax paid by hospitals, and was projected to raise $300 million for low-income adults without health care. Hospitals, the entities paying the tax, actually backed the legislation because it would allow them to recoup more money from Medicaid. Two Republicans joined all 18 Democrats in the Senate to approve this bill." Together, those bills get us over the $1 billion mark. This year, the mailer also includes HB 2001 for good measure. This bill increased the gas tax to 30 cents from 24 cents. The increase kicked in back in January 2011 and raised about $300 million in new revenue. Altogether, the measures definitely boosted the state’s bottom line by more than $1 billion. But, as we noted two years ago, there are some significant caveats here. First, it’s not necessarily accurate to hang all of these taxes exclusively on the heads of these candidates. With House Bill 2649 and 3405 in particular, the lawmakers had the help of voters. Anti-tax activists referred those two measures to the ballot, but a majority of Oregonians voted to keep the new taxes and so they remain. It’s also worth noting that the gas tax increase, while not referred to voters, passed on a bipartisan vote in both chambers. Second, aside from the gas tax, these are not taxes that would hit the pocketbooks of the average Joe -- at least not directly. PolitiFact Oregon accepts that such taxes could affect employees and consumer prices as well as health care costs, but the ad makes the taxes seem much more direct. Third, while we understand the place of hyperbole in campaigns, the per-second breakdown makes it sound as though these candidates are raising taxes "at an unbelievable clip," as we noted two years ago. Finally, we can’t help but point out that these taxes weren’t, in fact, passed on the same day -- the gas tax came earlier, and at least one version of the mailer lumps it in with the others. We called Jason Williams of the Taxpayer Association of Oregon to see what he thought about our initial ruling -- and the context we’d pointed out. His opinion hasn’t changed much since we had this conversation two years ago. The taxes will hit people, whether at the pump, in their insurance plans or at their place of employment. "Every time somebody taxes someone it is a negative impact on somebody's life," he said. "It limits their spending power, it limits their freedom." Voters wouldn’t have been asked to approve any taxes if the Legislature hadn’t passed them in the first place, he said. Williams also noted that Hass, in particular, has voted to raise taxes by nearly a billion dollars twice before -- and voters ultimately rejected those increases. He agreed context is important, but noted that the bill numbers and years of passage were included in the mailer. The last time we looked at this claim, we gave it a Half True. We noted then, as we do now, that while lawmakers did vote for $1 billion in new taxes in a single day, there were some important details missing -- the timing of the taxes, who had approved them and who was being taxed. The mailer’s statements deserve some additional clarity, but we don’t think they ignore critical facts. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-02679	Says the media created the term "polar vortex" and the cold air proves "the ice isn’t melting."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/08/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-polar-vortex-made-yet-still-proof-ice-cap/	Those images of polar bears stranded atop tiny glaciers, looking very sad about their melting home in the North Pole, are phony, says radio host Rush Limbaugh. The lefty media created them to drive the discussion on global warming, which is also phony, he says. You know what else is phony, says Limbaugh? The "polar vortex" chilling much of the country with record low temperatures (though not really colder ones than on Mars). The media is playing it up as an extreme, counterintuitive consequence of a warming planet as part of its global warming "hoax," Limbaugh said, when the polar blast really proves just the opposite. "We are having a record-breaking cold snap in many parts of the country," he said during his Jan. 6 show. "And right on schedule the media have to come up with a way to make it sound like it’s completely unprecedented. Because they’ve got to find a way to attach this to the global warming agenda, and they have. It’s called the ‘polar vortex.’ The dreaded polar vortex." "Do you know what the polar vortex is? Have you ever heard of it? Well, they just created it for this week." Here’s part of how he broke it down for his audience: "See, normally the polar vortex stays up there in the polar region, but something is causing it to dip down like it's never happened before. We've never had arctic air blasts before. And remember, now, the key to all this is you have to understand one of the fundamental concepts of man-made global warming is ice melting at the poles. "One of the ways they have always sought to convince you that the world is warming is not the climate where you live, but rather where you aren't, where you can't see what is really happening. So they tell you the ice is melting at the North Pole and the South Pole. And then they publish pictures, which are fraudulent pictures, of poor little polar bears stranded on three square feet of ice that you are told used to be the North Pole. "... Well, obviously there is no melting of ice going on at the North Pole. If they're gonna tell us the polar vortex is responsible for this cold, that means record cold is also happening in the North Pole, which means there isn't any ice melting." We’ve heard several political commentators, errantly, call into question the validity of global warming given the week’s record-breaking low temperatures. Limbaugh takes it further, dubious of both global warming and the polar vortex itself. PunditFact wanted to know: Does the unusual blast of cool air, which he says the media ginned up as the "dreaded polar vortex," disprove global warming? "Polar vortex" may sound new to Limbaugh, journalists and anyone who is not a weather expert, but it’s not a term the media cooked up to scare you. It’s been part of the conversation in meteorology circles since at least the 1940s and ‘50s, experts told us. The polar vortex is the region in the northern hemisphere that contains the planet’s cold or Arctic air. A warmer atmosphere lies outside of the vortex. The boundary between the regions is a jet stream of strong, fast-moving, frigid winds. Sometimes the jet stream is more symmetrical, encircling the polar region in an oval without many bumps. Other times, especially this week, its rotation breaks off into deep troughs, ushering cold air to the south. A polar outbreak occurs in areas that have big drops in temperature, where the polar vortex has dipped pronouncedly south. This jet stream has become more wavy in the last five years, sending more cold air to the eastern U.S. and eastern Asia, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. "It has been with us for eons," said Mark Serreze, director of the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado-Boulder. "It will be with us for eons to come." Now, whether this week’s polar outbreak is a result of global warming is a matter of active scientific debate. Rutgers University climate researcher Jennifer Francis co-authored a 2012 research paper arguing the loss of Arctic ice leads to more extremes -- not just more frigid winters for the east coast, but also record warm temperatures in Alaska, record drought in California, storms in the United Kingdom, and a warm winter for Scandinavia. "This sort of jet stream pattern is what we expect to occur more often as the Arctic continues to warm faster than the rest of the globe in response to increasing greenhouse gases," she said. "We can't say this particular event is caused by climate change, but it is becoming clearer that this sort of pattern should become more likely in the future." On his show, Limbaugh skewered a Daily Beast article with the headline "Thank Global Warming for Freezing You Right Now," but the article actually couches the connection more than its flashy headline suggests: "As crazy as it sounds, global warming may be at least partly to blame. This particular aspect of climate change science is not yet definitive, but here's what may be going on." Serreze says it is too early to tell whether one-time weather events like this polar outbreak are happening as a result of global warming. That said, the polar outbreak definitely does not disprove that Arctic sea ice is not melting, as Limbaugh concludes. Sea ice at the North Pole is obviously not melting right this second. That’s because it’s January, and the pole is in darkness all day and night. But Arctic sea ice is almost at a record low for this time of year, Francis pointed out, even though it is up from 2012, the record low year. Scientists look at long-term trends, not annual shifts, to base their conclusions. Alarm over shrinking sea ice is based on how the region is shedding more and more of it by the end of summer -- as less ice covers the Arctic Ocean, the ocean absorbs more warmth. Historically, ice covering the Arctic sea is twice as big as the continental United States by winter’s end in March, Serreze said. As the ocean warms, ice melts. Around 1980, sea ice by summer’s end in September covered as much area as the contiguous United States, Serreze said. Lately, it’s shrunk to an area smaller than the size of the United States west of the Mississippi River. "The long-term trend in Arctic sea ice is sharply downwards, and this trend has the capability to cause significant alterations in jet stream behavior that can cause an increase in both warm and cold extreme events in the winter," said Jeff Masters, director of meteorology at Weather Underground. Serreze labeled Limbaugh’s connection between the cold snap and sea ice as "absurd." Our ruling Limbaugh claimed the media made up the "polar vortex" to bolster global warming. What the cold snap does prove, he says, is Arctic sea ice is not melting -- that global warming is a hoax. Climate scientists told us his rant is wildly misinformed. The polar vortex has been a part of science for decades, and it certainly does not prove that sea ice is not melting. We rate this Pants on Fire!

pomt-12644	"We have counties where there have been one arrest under the SAFE Act. It indicates there's not a whole lot of interest in enforcing this in our upstate counties."	half-true	/new-york/statements/2017/mar/24/marc-butler/most-safe-act-arrests-have-been-new-york-city/	Republican lawmakers in Albany are pushing a new proposal to repeal New York state’s 2013 gun control law, the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, or SAFE Act. They want to repeal the law only in counties outside New York City. It would remain on the books for the city’s five boroughs. Marc Butler, a Republican Assemblyman from the North Country, claims the law is not effective upstate. "We did a random survey of some of the counties," Butler said. "We have counties where there have been one arrest under the SAFE Act. It indicates there's not a whole lot of interest in enforcing this in our upstate counties." Is Butler right that some counties have only had one SAFE Act violation in four years? And is there "not a whole lot of interest in enforcing this" in upstate counties? The SAFE Act The SAFE Act passed the New York State Legislature in a whirlwind January 2013 vote, soon after 26 people -- 20 students and six adults -- were shot and killed on Dec. 14, 2012, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. The SAFE Act places additional regulations on gun owners and dealers on what guns need to be registered, how guns can be bought and sold, and how those guns can be used. The law expanded the definition of what’s considered an assault weapon in New York state and required those guns to be registered. The law also required almost universal background checks on gun sales in New York state. The law requires anyone who wants to buy a gun to make the sale through a federally licensed dealer. Those dealers are required to perform background checks before approving the sale. Before the SAFE Act, residents were able to privately buy or sell guns without any background checks. Now, even if someone wants to give a gun to a family member or neighbor, it has to go through a federal dealer. Downstate arrests Since the law's passage, there have been 11,893 arrests for SAFE Act violations in New York state through Feb. 17, according to the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services. A disproportionate number of the arrests happened in New York City. Some 9,593 arrests were made in New York City compared with 1,641 arrests upstate and 659 arrests on Long Island or in the suburban Westchester and Rockland counties. New York City has the most SAFE Act arrests per capita with one arrest for every 692 people in the city. Long Island and the city's suburbs recorded one arrest for every 4,838 adults. Upstate arrests In upstate New York, there has been one SAFE Act arrest for every 3,411 adults since 2013. Erie County’s 254 arrests were the most among upstate counties. That's one SAFE Act arrest for every 2,870 adults in the county. Onondaga County had a higher SAFE Act arrest rate: one arrest for every 1,579 adults. Albany County had one arrest for every 5,400 residents and Monroe County had one arrest for every 3,514 adults. The arrests in most of those counties were concentrated in their largest cities. Buffalo had 78 percent of Erie County's arrests. Rochester had 81 percent of Monroe County's arrests. And, Syracuse had 87 percent of the arrests in Onondaga County. Albany County was the exception with only 48 percent of the county's arrests happening in the city of Albany. Some 172 arrests were in Oneida County, the fourth most upstate, and it had a rate of one arrest for every 1,066 adults. Oneida County District Attorney Scott McNamara says he treats the SAFE Act like any other law. "Whether I politically agree with a certain section of the law, or I don’t agree with it, I don’t let that affect what I do," McNamara said. "What I do professionally and what I might think or talk about at breakfast with my wife are two different things. I leave my personal opinions to the side." Eight counties, all upstate, had fewer than five SAFE Act arrests since the law took effect: Allegany, Chemung, Columbia, Hamilton, Schuyler, Wyoming, Tioga, and Lewis counties. Tioga and Lewis counties reported no SAFE Act arrests at all. Wyoming County is the only county with just one SAFE Act arrest. In that case, the offender gave a gun to someone not legally allowed to own one. "We aren't seeing the violations," Wyoming County Sheriff Gregory Rudolph said. But law enforcement officials say they are not ignoring the law. People are obeying the law. "To say our numbers are low because of lacking enforcement, we’re turning a blind eye? Never," Hamilton County Sheriff Karl Abrams said. "It’s definitely less violators than downstate. They do everything by the book. They don’t do illegal transfers. They don’t do anything like that." Our ruling Butler said "we have counties where there have been one arrest under the SAFE Act. It indicates there's not a whole lot of interest in enforcing this in our upstate counties." One county does indeed have just one arrest under the SAFE Act, and a handful of others have few arrests. But some upstate counties have large numbers of arrests. And even where there have been few arrests, law enforcement officials believe those numbers have more to do with residents complying with the law than authorities' lack of enthusiasm for enforcing it.

pomt-07972	Gov. Scott Walker hired convicted Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen to oversee a raid on the state employee retirement system to help balance the state budget.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/21/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-gov-scott-walker-hired-convict/	In some circles in Wisconsin, especially government workers, an e-mail has been ricocheting from in-box to in-box making an eye-popping claim. In short: Gov. Scott Walker hired convicted Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen to oversee a raid on the state employee retirement system to help balance the state budget. The claim is presented in what appears to be a news article by Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter Lee Bergquist. it is meant to mimic an online story, complete with a Jan. 13, 2011 date and a tally of reader comments. At one point, it jumped from e-mails to the Internet, briefly appearing on a Little Chute teachers union website. The story is a fake. And the statement is false, ridiculously so. But the episode gives us a chance to explore, as best we can, how the piece -- apparently an attempt at satire -- made it into the public sphere. In some ways, this is a political version of e-mails we see -- and pass along -- all the time. You know, jokes about why the Chicago Bears still suck, or silly pictures taken of customers at Walmart. This one left some people taking the claim seriously -- calling the governor’s office, state union leaders and the Journal Sentinel newsroom. The item reached other teachers union locals and workers in other professions, including the state Department of Corrections. And it has become a flash point between Walker and union leaders, who already have a rocky relationship. Here’s the gist of the non-news. The fake story claims Walker has hired former Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen (not true). And that Jensen plans to use the state retirement system to help Walker balance the state budget (again, not true). It also includes this over-the-top (yet again, not true) statement: Jensen assured police and fire officials that their pensions are safe under Governor Walker but that public employees and teachers who never put their lives on the line nor contributed to the fund ought to be worried. "Those folks need to take a long hard look in the mirror and reflect on what they have taken away from the people of Wisconsin." The fake story goes on to "quote" Jensen comments from a (never occurred) appearance on Charlie Sykes’ radio talk show on WTMJ-AM (620). We don’t know for certain where the fake story came from, though there have been accusations, which we will explore below. We do know when it jumped to the Internet. How did the item get on the Little Chute Education Association site? Union president and Little Chute High School science teacher Chris Choudoir took the blame. He said the fake story came to him in an e-mail on Jan. 14, 2011. He posted it on the site, which was launched in November and aimed at the union’s 130 members. In less than an hour he learned he had been punked. "It’s not a legitimate article, so I removed it from the blog," Choudoir said. "My intention was not to propagate a false article." He sent an e-mail apologizing to his members for the posting. The item was on the site 50 minutes, he said. He added: "That’s the problem with things in type - you don’t pick up on the sarcasm." Choudoir said traffic for the site was high that day -- some 499 hits when he took the article down. Some of those hits came from Walker’s office, which said it received three phone calls and five or six e-mails about the matter. Walker’s office blames the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the statewide teachers union, for spreading the false e-mail. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie noted that some copies of it bear the name of an employee who appears to work for the union and sent it to "all," including district chapters of the union. In one response to a teacher who contacted Walker’s office, Werwie wrote: "Scott Jensen has no role in the Walker Administration and Governor Walker is not going to raid the pension fund." Werwie concluded: "It is unfortunate that instead of working to be part of the solution the union who represents you, which claims to have your best interests in mind, spends its time spreading lies and making up fake news stories." WEAC denied responsibility for the e-mail. "We can’t confirm where the e-mail came from," said spokeswoman Christina Brey. "We didn’t generate it." Brey said union leadership told its regional directors about the item and told them "no, this is not right. It’s a hoax." She added: "We’ve taken internal action to make sure that news articles are authenticated." Let’s take a deep breath. Someone -- it’s unclear who -- tried to give the "Weekend Update" fake news treatment to a topic that clearly has public employees concerned. Walker has promised that cuts will be made in public employee benefits and suggested the state could reduce union bargaining rights. It may have been a bit of satirical venting, but not everyone got the joke. PolitiFact’s national site has evaluated 90 chain e-mails, and found many of them to contain simply ridiculous claims. This fake news story joins the heap. Feel free to forward these words: Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2011-01-21T09:00:00	2011-01-20	['Scott_Walker_(politician)']

pomt-14192	"Texas has 600,000 registered voters who don’t have the kind of photo ID needed to vote."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2016/apr/22/tom-smitty-smith/tom-smith-public-citizen-says-600000-texas-registe/	Tom "Smitty" Smith, a liberal activist, says more than half a million Texans lack sufficient papers to legally turn out to vote. Smith, the longtime director of Public Citizen’s Texas office, made his claim in an April 14, 2016, commentary on campaign finance published in the Austin American-Statesman that also mentions the law under legal challenge requiring Texas voters to present a photo ID before being casting a ballot at a polling place. Republicans who carried the ID mandate into law in 2011 say it reduces chances of voter fraud. Democrats say the show-your-ID hoop was needless and obviously intended solely to reduce turnout by minorities, the elderly and other citizens likely not to have one of the accepted kinds of identification. And "Texas," Smith wrote, "has 600,000 registered voters who don’t have the kind of photo ID needed to vote." Under the Texas law, a registered voter may cast a ballot at the polls if she or he presents one of these kinds of identification: a Texas driver's license; a personal ID issued by the Department of Public Safety; an election certificate, which is a new form of state photo identification created by the law; a U.S. military ID card; a U.S. passport; or a Texas concealed handgun permit. So, do some 600,000 of the state’s 14.2 million registered voters lack all of those? By email, Smith told us he drew the figure from a Feb. 29, 2016, Washington Post news story stating that Texas may have the country’s toughest voter ID mandate and that a federal court in the state "found that 608,470 registered voters don’t have the voter IDs that the state now requires for voting. For example, residents can vote with their concealed-carry handgun licenses but not their state-issued student university IDs." We’ve rated a similar statement about voting with concealed handgun licenses True. Federal court ruling The story was referring to a decision by U.S. District Judge Nelva Gonzales Ramos of Corpus Christi accepting the 600,000 estimate. Ramos’ October 2014 ruling, lately awaiting review by the full 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, came in a suit brought by plaintiffs led by U.S. Rep. Marc Veasey, D-Fort Worth. Specifically, Ramos’ ruling presents her finding that "approximately 608,470 registered voters in Texas, representing approximately 4.5% of all registered voters, lack qualified SB 14 ID," meaning one of the types of photo ID spelled out in Senate Bill 14, the legislation behind the Texas law. Expert's report In her ruling, Ramos said she based her finding on research presented by scholars, particularly Stephen Ansolabehere, a Harvard professor of government retained as a consultant in the lawsuit by the U.S. Justice Department. Ansolabehere, Ramos wrote, "performed an extensive match of various databases to arrive at the figures set out above, which is referred to as the ‘No-Match List.’" Ramos elaborated: "First, he (Ansolabehere) determined which of the 13.5 million voters in Texas’s voter registration database, the Texas Election Administration Management System (TEAM), lacked SB 14 ID. He did this by comparing individual TEAM voter records with databases containing the records of those who possessed SB 14 ID—current DPS-issued Texas driver’s licenses, Texas personal ID cards, EICs, Texas concealed handgun licenses, United States passports, citizenship certificates, and military photo IDs—to arrive at a list of voter records that did not match with any SB 14 qualified photo ID. "Dr. Ansolabehere ‘scrubbed’ the list by removing entries that appeared to be duplicates and those appearing in other databases that identified persons who were deceased and who had relocated (potentially out of state). He also removed voters identified as inactive, and those who were eligible for SB 14’s disability exemption to further ensure that he was counting only those who had no alternative for voting other than with a qualified SB 14 ID. All of these matches were performed with algorithms designed to address different name spellings and the use of nicknames or other variations in the way individuals are identified or would be input into a database. He concluded that approximately 608,470 voters in the TEAM database lack qualified SB 14 ID." Ramos wrote that defenders of the photo ID mandate challenged Ansolabehere’s findings "by arguing that he failed to remove felons and voters who subsequently re-registered in another state. There was evidence that the (secretary of state’s office) purges the TEAM database on a daily basis for felons," Ramos wrote, "and Dr. Ansolabehere testified that recent data from both the Pew Research Center and various secretaries of state established that the number of voters who may have re-registered in another state is extremely small—less than one percent," the judge wrote. We asked Ansolabehere if the 608,000 figure he estimated might, nearly two years later, no longer reflect the likely number of registered voters lacking one of the permitted photo IDs. By email, he said he couldn’t offer any comment beyond his September 2014 expert’s report and court testimony since the legal challenge to the law hasn’t settled out. Similarly, we asked Smith if, perhaps, the number of registered voters lacking the required photo ID to go to the polls in Texas has changed since 2014, maybe decreasing with the law in place. By phone, Smith said he doesn’t know. A 2011 state estimate Our search of the Nexis news database reminded us the Texas secretary of state’s office in 2011 answered a federal request for information by saying research indicated that about 605,500 registered Texas voters might lack a state-issued license or ID; the figure was reached by comparing voter registrations to Department of Public Safety records by first name, last name and date of birth, per an October 2011 news story in the Dallas Morning News. In reviewing Smith’s claim, we wrote the agency requesting elaboration on its own estimate and to ask if it had an updated count. By email, spokeswoman Alicia Phillips Pierce said the office has no up-to-date estimate of Texas voters lacking a poll-acceptable ID. Pierce also said she couldn’t comment on Smith’s statement because of the continuing legal fight, though she suggested we consider state briefs filed in its appeal of Ramos’s ruling. By our read, a state’s brief filed in 2015 doesn’t challenge Ansolabehere’s total estimate of voters lacking a required ID outside of a footnote stating that since implementation of the ID law, about 22,000 "of the registered voters that plaintiffs claim do not have a photo ID have voted in at least one election." Our ruling Smith said: "Texas has 600,000 registered voters who don’t have the kind of photo ID needed to vote." That may have been so in 2014, according to an expert’s research, and the figure arguably aligns with a 2011 state estimate limited to matching voter registrations and driver licenses. We didn’t find an up-to-date figure, though, and Smith’s implication--that 600,000 citizens haven’t voted for lack of acceptable IDs--might not hold up; we don’t know. We rate the claim Mostly True. Mostly True – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ab2c7daf-5de6-4a7a-8215-775d98c9a58a	None	Tom "Smitty" Smith	None	None	None	2016-04-22T17:21:21	2016-04-14	['Texas']
