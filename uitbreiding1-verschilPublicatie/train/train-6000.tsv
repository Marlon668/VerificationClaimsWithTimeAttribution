pomt-11331	There are "paid protesters" involved in the Stephon Clark demonstrations.	false	/california/statements/2018/apr/10/scott-jones/protesters-hire-sacramento-sheriff-provides-no-evi/	Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones claimed "paid protesters" fueled the conflict with law enforcement after a recent vigil and demonstration for Stephon Clark, a 22-year-old shot and killed by police. Responding to a call of a man breaking car windows, Sacramento police fired 20 times at Clark, who they said was advancing toward them with a gun in his grandparents’ backyard on March 18, 2018. Later, it was revealed, he was carrying a cellphone. Ever since, demonstrators have filled Sacramento’s streets, as well as city council meetings, calling for police reform. Jones made his statement about paid protesters during a news conference in early April. The sheriff showed video from March 31, 2018 of a deputy’s SUV striking a demonstrator who walked in front of the vehicle. A crowd of marchers had blocked two sheriff’s SUVs after a vigil for Clark in south Sacramento. Deputies had asked the crowd to step away before the collision took place. Jones described some of the people in the streets as "professional protesters and professional instigators." "We do know because of our intelligence, because of the same folks that we see at protests completely out of the area and because of our history with some of these folks that there are paid protesters," the sheriff added. "And paid people to instigate just as there are paid folks to monitor protests and video camera for their own purposes." When asked for evidence by a reporter at the conference, Jones said: "We do have evidence of it and we've seen it previously," though he was not specific. For this fact-check, we decided to zero in on Jones’ claim that some "paid protesters" took part in the Stephon Clark demonstrations, either on the evening of the vigil or before. Protest organizers have described the sheriff’s statement as baseless and inflammatory, saying the demonstrators are volunteers and not for-hire protesters. Stephon Clark, 22, was shot and killed by Sacramento police on March 18, 2018. Courtesy photo Response from sheriff’s department In a phone interview, Sgt. Shaun Hampton, a spokesman for the Sacramento County Sheriff’s Department, declined to provide evidence supporting the sheriff’s statement. "I don’t think we’re going to disclose that at this time," Hampton said, adding that he did not foresee the department disclosing evidence in the future. He also declined to say why Jones made the claim without providing any supporting material. "It’s based on our information," he said. Jones appears to be the only top law enforcement official to make such a claim. A spokesman for the Sacramento Police Department told us he did "not have any specific information" about paid protesters. Asked about paid protesters on Capital Public Radio's Insight program, Sacramento Police Chief Daniel Hahn said he believes Jones was referring only to the March 31, 2018 demonstration outside city limits. "I don't know. We weren't there," Hahn said of any payments. A spokeswoman for the California Department of Highway Patrol, which has also provided law enforcement at the demonstrations, said in an email the "CHP does not have evidence of paid protesters." Hundreds gather at the Sacramento District Attorney’s office on April 4, 2018 demanding justice for Stephon Clark. Vanessa S. Nelson / Capital Public Radio Response from protest organizers Most of the Sacramento demonstrations after Clark’s death have been well organized and peaceful. There have been isolated cases of vandalism, including breaking car windows, the disruption of a city council meeting, a brief closure of a freeway and the closure of a basketball arena. Jamier Sale is an organizer with the ANSWER Coalition’s Sacramento chapter. It helped lead the March 31, 2018 vigil and protest. ANSWER stands for Act Now to Stop War and End Racism. The national organization helped organize the U.S. antiwar movement opposing the 2003 invasion of Iraq, according to its website. Sale challenged Jones to release evidence to support his claim. "We’re an all volunteer-based organization and we’re run all from donations," Sale told PolitiFact California. "And we print our signs and we put them on sticks with our own hands. Nobody pays us to do anything. We’re organized and we’re effective. And if we come off as professional, that’s because we take what we do very seriously." Claire White is an attorney representing Wanda Cleveland, the woman struck by the deputy’s SUV. She is also vice president of the National Lawyers Guild Foundation, a volunteer organization which monitors police activity at protests, including at the recent Sacramento events. "This allegation that these people are paid, or that they’re outside agitators, has no basis in reality," White told Capital Public Radio. "The longer that Sheriff Scott Jones tries to sell that snake oil to the public, the more it’s going to tarnish his own credibility." Tanya Faison is with the Sacramento chapter of Black Lives Matter, which has also organized recent protests. "We are not paid," Faison said. "We work for free. Some of us are mothers, students and interns. We do this on the side." She said Jones’ comments are "irresponsible" and could give his supporters in the community "permission to be more aggressive" with protesters. David Meyer is a sociology and political science professor at UC Irvine who wrote the book The Politics of Protest: Social Movements in America. He said politicians frequently make claims about paid protesters, without evidence, to marginalize people who represent opposing points of view. He said Democrats made those allegations about Tea Party activists in 2009 and Republicans made them about liberal activists who packed congressional town hall meetings in 2017. Meyer said it’s not realistic to think groups paid for protesters in the Stephon Clark case. He added that the sheriff’s "assertion without evidence is unconscionable." Other claims without proof This isn’t the first time PolitiFact has examined a provocative claim from a politician who didn’t support it with evidence. President Trump has repeatedly stated there was "serious voter fraud" in California in the 2016 election — without providing any proof. PolitiFact California investigated that allegation and rated it Pants On Fire. In February 2017, PolitiFact National probed a claim by GOP Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas that political activists were "being paid" to protest members of Congress. It concluded "It’s possible some protesters somewhere may be paid, but there’s zero evidence of a wide-ranging conspiracy to bring in paid activists to disrupt meetings." It rated that claim False. Our ruling Sacramento County Sheriff Scott Jones claimed "paid protesters" inflamed recent demonstrations over the death of Stephon Clark. Protest organizers say Sacramento’s streets have been filled with volunteers, not for-hire demonstrators. They’ve called the sheriff’s claim baseless. Jones appears to be the only top law enforcement official to make this assertion and has said he has evidence to back it up. His spokesman, however, declined to provide any information to support it and said it’s unlikely they ever will. When we evaluate statements at PolitiFact, the burden of proof is on the person making the claim. We’ll assess any information that might be released in the future. In the meantime, we rate Jones’ claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-01976	"The typical Wisconsin worker makes $5,000 less each year than our neighbors in Minnesota" under Gov. Scott Walker’s policies.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/18/mary-burke/minnesota-tops-wisconsin-average-wages-5000-year-m/	Democrats ripping jobs gains under Republican Gov. Scott Walker often point to the post-recession progress in Minnesota, where the jobs recovery has outpaced that of Wisconsin. Walker, meanwhile, prefers comparisons to Illinois and its budget problems and big tax hikes. In September 2013, we rated Half True a Minnesota lawmaker’s claim that the Gopher State is "kicking butt relative to Wisconsin" on employment, school test scores, workforce education and other rankings. But we haven’t, until now, tested claims of an income gap. Gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke proclaimed such a gap in June 6, 2014 remarks to delegates gathered in Lake Delton for the state Democratic Party’s annual convention. "As you know," Burke said, "our current governor has made quite a name for himself. His divisive brand of politics may have made national headlines, but those policies have hurt middle-class families right here in Wisconsin." She added: "But the people of Wisconsin, we know Scott Walker. He promised us 250,000 new jobs. But what did we get? We’re 9th out of 10 midwestern states in job growth -- ninth out of 10! And the typical Wisconsin worker makes $5,000 less each year than our neighbors in Minnesota." Let’s see if Burke’s statement about a Minnesota advantage in the Walker era holds up. What the numbers show Burke’s campaign cited one source for numbers on earnings. We looked at it and two others. All show Minnesota on top. -- The annual average wage of Minnesota workers was $47,370 as of May 2013 -- $5,060 higher than the $42,310 figure for Wisconsin, according to survey-based estimates published by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The 2013 data is the most recent available. -- Average earnings per job in 2012 were $53,928 in Minnesota, $4,931 more than Wisconsin’s $48,997, according to the most recent U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis data. That figure takes in a larger group -- not only workers’ wages and salaries but "proprietor’s income" from self-employment. -- The same data, stripped down to exclude proprietor’s income to focus more on regular salaries and wages, shows a gap of $5,757 in Minnesota’s favor, according to research by Dale Knapp at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. So Burke’s figures are solid. More about the numbers In her convention speech, Burke argued in a general way that Walker’s policies are linked to the wage gap. Given all the factors that influence a state’s economy, experts agree the actions of a governor have a limited effect. Nevertheless, Burke’s claim misses the mark by pinning the gap solely on Walker. The Minnesota-Wisconsin wage gap dates to at least the 1960s, and gradually has grown despite ups and downs. When we asked Burke campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki about that, he argued that Walker's economic policies -- which Walker touts as turning the state around -- haven't improved it or closed that gap. As examples, he cited Walker’s refusal to accept the federal expansion of Medicaid and his opposition to a minimum wage increase. By any of our three measures, the gap did not narrow in Walker’s first two years. It grew significantly based on the average earnings per job data. It held steady if you use the other two methods. The average earnings data shows the Minnesota wage advantage averaged 7.4 percent during the second four-year term of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, who preceded Walker. So far under Walker the average is 8.8 percent. The gap of 9.1 percent in 2012, Walker’s second year, is the highest since 2000, when Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson was in charge. It’s not that Wisconsin’s average wage has fallen during the Walker era. It’s up 5.5 percent in two years, right around the national average increase. But Minnesota has fared somewhat better, which creates the increase in the gap. In combing through the annual average wage data for the two states, there are some interesting disparities between specific jobs. Minnesota ran up part of its lead on these: Occupation Minnesota average wage Wisconsin average wage Registered nurse $71,160 $64,460 Management, all positions $107,130 $97,920 Dentist $193,100 $177,430 Police and sheriff patrol officer $58,220 $54,140 Social worker (child/family/school) $59,830 $49,720 School bus driver $32,500 $29,190 Computer systems analyst $81,560 $75,170 Lawyer $126,520 $105,080 Wisconsin holds the upper hand in other categories, including: Occupation Minnesota average wage Wisconsin average wage Farm, fishing, forestry $30,910 $31,260 Retail Salesperson $23,730 $24,420 Mortician, undertaker, funeral director $58,340 $65,720 Chiropractor $72,810 $90,170 Pediatrician $185,550 $200,480 According to a bankrate.com calcuator, the Minneapolis area’s cost of living is 8.5% higher than that of the Milwaukee metro area. Our rating Burke told delegates at the state Democratic convention that "the typical Wisconsin worker makes $5,000 less each year than our neighbors in Minnesota" under Walker’s policies. The gap is real and Burke hit the mark with her description of it. The gap has grown or held steady in Walker’s time depending on the measuring stick used. Burke didn’t say Walker created the gap, but the disparity is a longstanding one, and one that existed and grew under governors of both political stripes. We rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-11588	"Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/31/donald-trump/donald-trump-inflates-apple-investment/	In his State of the Union address, President Donald Trump led off with the economy, and he drew particular attention to the recently passed tax law. "Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses," Trump said. "And it’s getting more every month, every week. Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers." A number of readers asked us to take a closer look at his claim about Apple, so we did. Apple’s press release We can see where Trump got his number. Under the headline "Apple accelerates US investment and job creation," Apple announced on Jan. 17 a series of initiatives to bolster its position in the United States. "Combining new investments and Apple’s current pace of spending with domestic suppliers and manufacturers — an estimated $55 billion for 2018 — Apple’s direct contribution to the U.S. economy will be more than $350 billion over the next five years," the statement said. Notice that Apple did not say it plans to invest $350 billion. It described its "direct contribution to the U.S. economy." Charles Lee, accounting professor at Stanford University’s Graduate School of Business, told us the distinction is huge. "Apple certainly did not just announce it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America," Lee said. "This is a statement about its importance to the U.S. economy, not a statement about its new investments due to the tax law change." So what did Apple’s press release actually say? It said its purchases from other companies will be large -- about $55 billion in 2018. Lee said if that number didn’t grow, Apple would spend about $275 billion over five years. But that’s "pre-planned," Lee said. It’s the cost of doing business and doesn’t represent new investment. If it isn’t an investment in expansion, such as building new facilities, buildings and data centers, that brings the investment total down to $75 billion. But even that figure is too high. Apple wrote the $75 billion includes expected "repatriation tax payments of approximately $38 billion." The new tax law offers a lower tax rate for companies that move profits off the books of their overseas subsidiaries and put them on their domestic balance sheets. Not only is paying Uncle Sam not an investment, Lee cautioned that it doesn’t even mean that Apple is doing anything with those overseas profits immediately. "It simply means they are pre-paying the taxes on that cash right now to take advantage of the lower rates," Lee said. "This ensures Apple will not need to pay any more taxes when, if ever, they decide to bring the cash back." After subtracting the taxes, Lee said "My best estimate of the change in Apple's U.S. investments attributable to the new laws is at most $37 billion." It could be a few billion less. In a section called "Growing Apple's U.S. operations," the company wrote that it "expects to invest over $30 billion in capital expenditures in the U.S. over the next five years and create over 20,000 new jobs through hiring at existing campuses and opening a new one." In addition, it will add $4 billion to an Advanced Manufacturing Fund, an Apple program that helps finance American and foreign companies to expand in America. That adds up to $34 billion over five years. Our ruling Trump said that Apple said it will invest $350 billion in America and hire another 20,000 workers. Trump got the new hires figure right, but Apple’s own announcement doesn’t back him up on the investment dollars. After deducting the costs of paying suppliers and paying taxes, an accounting professor estimated the investment at no more than $37 billion. And based on the press release, it could be $34 billion. That’s still a lot of money, but it’s less than 10 percent of what Trump said. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-00898	"There are at least three sectors of the border, one in particular, that are just completely insecure."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/05/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-least-three-sectors-border-are-complet/	Sen. Marco Rubio said he’s learned some lessons from his first failed foray into the immigration policy game. "What I’ve learned, is you can’t even have a conversation about that until people believe and know — not just believe, but it’s proven to them — that future illegal immigration will controlled," Rubio said. "That is the single biggest lesson of the last two years." A big piece of that, Rubio said, is border security, and he gave this stat: "There are at least three sectors of the border, one in particular, that are just completely insecure." The southwest border spans from San Diego to the southern tip of Texas, and it is broken into nine sectors. Are at least three of those sectors "completely insecure"? We decided to check. What is ‘secure’? Border patrol agents have many duties, of which stopping illegal migration is one. They also have to prevent drugs and weapons trafficking across the border, thwart potential terrorist plots, stop money laundering, among other tasks. As it is, there’s no set definition for what constitutes a "secure" border, experts told us. If you think one failure to apprehend a border crosser means a sector is insecure, then the whole border lacks security. That’s unreasonable. But where do you draw the line for what constitutes "secure." Additionally, we don’t know exactly what percentage of people successfully cross the border, nor how many successful drug running missions there are each year, etc. We can measure how many are caught in the act, but that’s only one part of the equation. So when Rubio says the border is "completely insecure," that’s not really grounded in any set metric. We asked Rubio’s office to explain what he meant by "completely insecure" and which three border sectors he was referring to. Spokeswoman Brooke Sammon did not respond to our multiple emails and calls. Measuring sector security A Government Accountability Office report from 2011 on border control measures broke down how much of each sector in 2010 was under "operational control." That means agents had the ability to apprehend violators upon or immediately after entry. Here’s what they found. Four sectors obviously stick out for their lack of operational control: Marfa (now called Big Bend), Del Rio, Laredo and Rio Grande Valley. All four achieved operational control for less than 40 percent of their respective sector. Again, this data is from 2010, so it’s unclear how those sectors of the border have fared since. At the time, operational control of the border had been increasing by 126 miles annually dating back to 2005 and more resources have been put toward the border since. Additionally, these are based on qualitative assessments. Also, the Department of Homeland Security scrapped them because they don’t provide much useful information for determining the effectiveness of border security in a particular sector. It hasn’t replaced it with anything more useful yet, said Theresa Brown, director of immigration policy at the Bipartisan Policy Center. The Bipartisan Policy Center tracks an effectiveness rate for each sector based on the number of apprehensions and turnbacks versus "got aways," meaning border patrol agents found evidence (security footage, tracks, etc.) that someone made it through. Here are the center’s most recent calculations for Fiscal Year 2013. Sector Apprehensions Turnbacks Got aways Effectiveness Big Bend 3,493 160 1,757 67.52 percent Del Rio 20,904 4,287 5,157 83.01 percent El Centro 15,725 3,688 2,779 87.48 percent El Paso 10,214 12,054 1,599 93.30 percent Laredo 45,971 16,032 15,603 79.89 percent Rio Grande 128,426 69,815 102,763 65.88 percent San Diego 26,428 7,518 3,861 89.79 percent Tucson 110,264 40,946 37,098 80.30 percent Yuma 5,734 1,993 434 94.64 percent By this rating, there are two sectors that are well below the rest in effectiveness rating: Big Bend and Rio Grande. It’s worth pointing out that Big Bend, in west Texas, sees a smaller level of activity than most other sectors and experts generally don’t consider it a problem zone. "You wouldn’t invest a lot of resources into a sector like Big Bend with very little traffic," said Christopher Wilson, a senior associate at the Wilson Center’s Mexico Institute. The Rio Grande Experts we spoke with easily identified the one border sector Rubio singled out when he said "one in particular" faced security issues: the Rio Grande sector. The number of apprehensions at the Rio Grande sector doubled to 256,000 in 2014 as a wave of unaccompanied minors and migrants from Central America attempted to enter the United States through the southernmost part of Texas. This has posed new challenges for the sector, which also saw a 7 percentage point drop in its effectiveness rate from 2012 to 2013. "I’m not sure what the senator means when he says ‘completely insecure,’ but it is true that there has been a big surge in border crossers at that point over the last few years," said Alex Nowrasteh, immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. As for the other two sectors that are "completely insecure," experts studying immigration at four different think tanks of varying political stripe couldn’t guess which two Rubio was referring to. The border sector with the most activity other than the Rio Grande is Tucson, which for a long time was the preferred route for Mexican immigration. However, apprehensions are down there from over 600,000 in 2000 to less than 90,000 in 2014. Rubio’s statement in general misses the broader trends across most of the border: Illegal migration through the border is down considerably from the record highs of the previous decade. In 2007, there were 1.6 million apprehensions, turn backs or gotaways at the border, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center. That dropped to 741,881 in 2013. That gels with other data that shows the overall population of native Mexicans living in the United States is leveling, Wilson said. Additionally, eight sectors, including the troubled Rio Grande, had higher effectiveness ratings in 2013 than they did in 2006. "The number of people trying to come across the southwest border is substantially lower than it was in the late 1990s and early 2000s," Brown said. "It's starting to increase again, but the absolute levels are way, way down, the lowest since the 1970s." Our ruling Rubio said, "There are at least three sectors of the border, one in particular, that are just completely insecure." We don’t know how Rubio came up with three sectors, and neither did experts we spoke with. There certainly is one sector of late with a troubling amount of activity, the Rio Grande in south Texas, that also is less effective at apprehending border crossers than other sectors. However, the number of people attempting to cross the border is down considerably everywhere else, and the effectiveness rating is up in eight of nine sectors since 2006, including the areas with the most significant activity.

Not Bernie Sanders. He chose a colder route. Sanders and his wife, Jane Sanders, spent their first days as newlyweds in the Soviet Union, claims George Will in a recent Washington Post column. Will’s Aug. 7 column focused mostly on the legacy of Robert Conquest, who died Aug. 3 at age 98, and whose writings on Soviet prisons documented the atrocities of the Stalin regime. A reader asked us to look into the accuracy of the final paragraph of Will’s column, which invoked Sanders’ "honeymoon." It reads: "Conquest lived to see a current U.S. presidential candidate, a senator, who had chosen, surely as an ideological gesture, to spend his honeymoon in the Soviet Union in 1988. Gulags still functioned, probably including some of the ‘cold Auschwitzes’ in Siberia, described in Conquest’s ‘Kolyma.’ The honeymooner did not mind that in 1988 political prisoners were — as may still be the case — being tortured in psychiatric ‘hospitals.’ Thanks to the unblinking honesty of people like Conquest, the Soviet Union now is such a receding memory that Bernie Sanders’s moral obtuseness — the obverse of Conquest’s character — is considered an amusing eccentricity." We wanted to see if Sanders actually honeymooned on the turf of the United States’ former adversary during the final years of the Cold War. Sister cities The trip took place while Sanders was mayor of Burlington, Vt., from 1981 to 1989. Toward the end of his mayoral tenure, the small city on Lake Champlain launched a sister-city program with Yaroslavl, located 160 miles northeast of Moscow. The program, which is still operating today, has facilitated exchanges between the two cities involving "mayors, business people, firefighters, jazz musicians, youth orchestras, mural painters, high school students, medical students, nurses, librarians and the (Yaroslavl) ice-hockey team," according to its website. Along with sister-city relationships with Bethlehem in the West Bank and Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua, the Yaroslavl program was part of Sanders’ unorthodox attempt to take on international issues from a small city in New England. Sanders also actively pursued his agenda outside of the country, writing letters to world leaders and even traveling to Cuba to meet with the mayor of Havana. "Burlington had a foreign policy," he wrote in his 1997 book Outsider in the House, "because, as progressives, we understood that we all live in one world." The bond between Burlington and Yaroslavl solidified when Sanders and his wife, as members of a 12-person delegation from Burlington, paid their Soviet counterparts a visit in 1988. The timing of the trip was unusual. Bernie and Jane were married May 28, 1988. The delegation left Burlington the next day. "Trust me," Sanders writes in the book. "It was a very strange honeymoon." When reached for comment, Sanders’ campaign said that the dates for the trip had already been set, and the couple "set their wedding date to coincide with that trip because they didn't want to take more time off." In a 2007 interview, Jane Sanders also recalled the peculiar timing: "The day after we got married, we marched in a Memorial Day parade, and then we took off in a plane to start the sister city project with Yaroslavl with 10 other people on my honeymoon." Bernie Sanders also refers to the trip sarcastically as "quiet and romantic" in his book. The "honeymoon" was dotted with meetings, interviews and diplomatic functions. A June 2015 profile in The Guardian described the former mayor’s meeting with Yaroslavl city officials: "After receiving a rundown of central planning, Soviet-style, from Yaroslavl’s mayor, Alexander Riabkov, Sanders notes how the quality of both housing and health care in America appeared to be ‘significantly better’ than in the communist state. ‘However,’ he added, ‘the cost of both services is much, much, higher in the United States.’ " An education in central planning probably wasn’t the only item on Sanders’ itinerary. Yaroslavl is home to historic churches and buildings, and the Sanderses would have been in for some good sightseeing, said Ariel Cohen, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. Will made it sound as if Sanders was visiting to condone Soviet torture practices, but the Burlington trip was more of a dialogue-building exchange program. The Vermont weekly newspaper Seven Days reported in 2009 that the sister-city relationship "helped local residents who sought to ease tensions between the United States and Soviet Union by initiating citizen-to-citizen exchanges with a Russian city." Also, the Soviet Union was barely intact at the time of the trip. Negotiations had opened up between President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev a few years earlier. "It was at the beginning of perestroika," said Michael Briggs, a spokesman for the Sanders campaign, referring to the restructuring policy Gorbachev instituted in the mid 1980s. Gulags still existed and political prisoners were still held in 1988, said Ariel Cohen, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. But a watershed moment came when Gorbachev allowed physicist Andrei Sakharov to return from internal exile two years earlier. "The power of the Communist Party was being questioned and the confrontation with the West was winding down through negotiations," Cohen said. In 1987, Reagan and Gorbachev signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, and in 1988, Reagan himself spoke in Moscow’s Red Square. One year later brought the fall of the Berlin Wall. Three years later, the Soviet Union collapsed. Participation in the Burlington-Yaroslavl program has waned over the years, though it was viewed as a "glamorous endeavor" by many in Burlington at the time, program leader Howard Seaver said in 2009. Will could not be reached for comment through his researcher. Our ruling Will wrote that Sanders chose "to spend his honeymoon in the Soviet Union in 1988." Sanders and his wife did travel to Yaroslavl, a city in the Soviet Union, after their wedding in 1988. In the sense that the trip came after the couple were married, the trip was a honeymoon. The two have also referred to the trip that way, albeit sarcastically at times. But it was an unusual honeymoon, to say the least. The trip’s primary purpose was diplomacy, not leisure, and included about 10 extra guests. Will’s claim is accurate but is missing context about the trip’s underlying purpose. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	George Will	None	None	None	2015-08-12T10:56:28	2015-08-07	['Soviet_Union', 'Bernie_Sanders']
pomt-09979	In the 1970s, "the swine flu broke out . . . under another Democrat, President Jimmy Carter."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/apr/30/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-wrong-70s-swine-flu-broke-our-/	Michele Bachmann, a Republican member of Congress from Minnesota, is known for her controversial remarks. During the fall of 2008, she nearly lost her re-election campaign because she said Barack Obama "may have anti-American views." In a 2009 radio interview, she said incorrectly that six Muslim clerics who were removed from a US Airways flight in 2006 were attending a "victory celebration" for Keith Ellison, a Muslim who was elected to Congress. So we weren't exactly surprised when we heard her suggest a link between Democratic presidents and the swine flu. Here's her comment, from an interview with Pajamas Media: "I find it interesting that it was back in the 1970s that the swine flu broke out then under another Democrat president, Jimmy Carter. And I'm not blaming this on President Obama, I just think it's an interesting coincidence." Well, at least she's right about the decade. Yes, the last big swine flu scare occurred in the 1970s. But other than that, her statement is utterly false. The scare began in February 1976 when recruits at Fort Dix, N.J., came down with flu symptoms, and one died. This led to fears of a pandemic. The president in 1976 was Gerald Ford — a Republican. Ford, following the advice of public health officials, called for a nationwide vaccination program. In just 10 days, 40 million Americans were vaccinated. But three senior citizens died shortly after receiving their swine flu shots. A public outcry blamed the deaths on the immunizations even though there was no evidence. As a recent article in Salon notes, "The government had long feared mass panic about swine flu — now they feared mass panic about the swine flu vaccinations." Political analyst Craig Crawford wrote this week that "Gerald Ford's decision to inoculate every person in the country (including himself) resulted in a political debacle that contributed to a reputation for incompetence that scuttled his 1976 election bid." Swine flu also surfaced briefly in 1988, killing a woman in Wisconsin who had visited a swine exhibit at a county fair. The president at the time was Ronald Reagan — a Republican. So Bachmann is wrong about a Democrat being in charge during the 1976 outbreak and she fails to note the swine flu death in 1988. Hmmm. Two swine flu incidents during Republican administrations. By Bachmann's logic, we should find that "interesting." But we don't. It's ridiculous for her to suggest a partisan link with a deadly disease. That's not just a mistake, that's absurdly false. So we'll get out the lighter (after we wash our hands!) and set the Truth-O-Meter ablaze. This one's a Pants on Fire.

pomt-14828	"@Jorge_Elorza still think your plan is safe? Rescue Captain Kenyon just worked 96 hours straight. 96 hours."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/nov/22/paul-doughty/union-mayor-rescue-captain-worked-96-hours-straigh/	In early November, a Providence fire captain, Zachariah Kenyon, clocked 96 hours in a row — the equivalent of two 48-hour work weeks. The 45-year-old’s marathon tour of duty follows much argument over the restructuring of the firefighters’ shift schedule, ordered in August by Mayor Jorge O. Elorza. Instead of working 42 hours per week in four shifts firefighters are now working in three shifts of 48 hours every six days, or an average of 56 hours per week. One vocal critic of the change, Paul A. Doughty, president of the firefighters’ union, went on Twitter to address the mayor: "...still think your plan is safe? Rescue Captain Kenyon just worked 96 hours straight. 96 hours. Your plan is a disaster!!!" So a firefighter worked 96 hours straight? We wondered if that really happened. And if so, how? We reached out to Public Safety Commissioner Steven M. Pare, Doughty and Kenyon, who also has a leadership position in the union, serving on its board and representing about 80 fire employees in special services divisions. Of course, we were interested in Kenyon’s story, but initially we just wanted to see the records. Kenyon gave us a personnel record that shows he reported to duty on the morning of Friday, Nov. 6, around 8 a.m. and he remained on duty for a 96-hour period that ended Tuesday, Nov. 10, around 8 a.m. The personnel record also shows that Kenyon had originally been scheduled to work two 10-hour shifts, one on Friday and another on Saturday followed by two 14-hour overnight shifts on Sunday into Monday and Monday into Tuesday. This adds up to 48 hours on duty over 5 days. Kenyon ended up on duty for each of the four scheduled shifts plus all hours in between, according to the record. The captain accepted one overtime shift and he was ordered to stand duty for the other three shifts. This is how he explained how he came to be on duty for 96 hours and Pare confirmed it. Ninety-six hours seems like a very long time for someone with public safety responsibilities to be on the clock. For Doughty and other firefighters, "working" and being on duty are the same thing. However, Providence firefighters, unlike police officers, can often climb into bed between emergencies during their shifts. So Kenyon was not on his feet like a construction worker or an emergency room nurse for 96 straight hours. It’s also clear that he got paid for 96 hours of work. Without knowing how much Kenyon slept, it seemed reasonable for Doughty to ask the mayor if this was safe. Pare asserts that the captain had ample opportunity to get the rest necessary to perform effectively in emergency situations and Kenyon could have asked to go home if he felt he hadn’t had enough sleep to operate safely. Kenyon, who doesn’t remember how much sleep he had during the 96 hours, says he was able to operate safely. "I feel I’m pretty capable," he says. Doughty disagrees, suggesting that sleep deprivation erodes a person’s ability to make good judgments about his or her capabilities. It’s against department policy for firefighters to sleep past 7 a.m., he says, and the noise at fire headquarters, with alarms sounding, is another issue. "It’s not good sleep," Doughty says. "It’s not rehabilitative sleep." We looked at public safety records, including dispatch logs, and found that Kenyon and those who also worked on Rescue 4 handled 67 emergency calls over the course of 96 hours. The crew transported 43 patients to hospitals and 15 calls were cancelled en route, according to the records we reviewed, which are not clear on what happened with the other nine calls. Kenyon, who says he doesn’t need as much sleep as others, recalls sleeping the last seven hours of his 96-hours on duty, but he says he doesn’t remember when he slept during the first 89 hours. Records that Pare provided to PolitiFact indicate there were several other periods within that 89-hour span when Kenyon was not busy with calls and had some opportunity for sleep. The records show three periods of about four hours during the morning hours of Saturday, Nov. 7, Sunday Nov. 8, and Monday Nov. 9. Our ruling No one disputes that Kenyon was on duty for 96 straight hours, Kenyon had some opportunity for sleep and it’s likely he did. But he doesn’t remember when that was, or for how long. He only recalls sleeping during the last 7 of the 96 hours The question that Doughty Tweeted: "@Jorge_Elorza still think your plan is safe?" was fair to ask, even if the public was not at risk as both Pare and the captain assert. (Further, Pare disputes Doughty’s charge that the plan is a "disaster!!!") But without clarification, Doughty’s suggestion that Kenyon "worked 96 hours straight" could leave the impression that Kenyon never slept. He did sleep. To be more accurate, Doughty could have said that Kenyon had been "on duty" for 96 hours. The job, by its nature, involves a mixture of sleep and work. For this reason, we rate Doughty’s claim Mostly True.	None	Paul Doughty	None	None	None	2015-11-22T00:00:00	2015-11-10	['None']

pomt-09497	"As bank president, Alex Sink eliminated thousands of Florida jobs while taking over $8 million in salary and bonuses."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/feb/24/republican-governors-association/republican-governors-association-blasts-sinks-reco/	On Feb. 23, 2010, the Republican Governors Association -- the gubernatorial campaign arm of the national GOP -- fired a shot at Alex Sink, the Democratic candidate for governor of Florida. The RGA, which is backing Republican Bill McCollum, took aim at Sink's career as a top executive at Bank of America and its predecessor in Florida, NationsBank. Here's the entire text of the 15-second advertisement, to be aired on broadcast and cable television outlets: "As bank president, Alex Sink eliminated thousands of Florida jobs while taking over $8 million in salary and bonuses. Alex Sink. Not one of us. One of them." In a fundraising e-mail sent several hours after the ad was launched, the Sink campaign attacked it as "full of dodges and distortions" and said it "misleads Floridians about Alex Sink's record as a business leader." We see three questions to probe here. One is whether her banks eliminated "thousands of Florida jobs" on Sink's watch. The second is whether the ad correctly describes Sink's compensation. And the third is whether it's fair to lay the blame for the job losses on Sink. We'll take these questions individually. Job losses We were unable to track down any official NationsBank documents addressing the issue of job losses from the Charlotte, N.C.-based bank's August 1997 acquisition of Jacksonville-based Barnett Bank. But news coverage at the time is consistent in reporting that the company planned to eliminate 6,000 jobs as a result of the merger. A Jan. 1, 1998, Miami Herald article quotes Rusty Rainey, who led the NationsBank-Barnett transition, saying that the merger would cut more than 6,000 jobs. Before the merger, the Herald reported, Barnett employed about 22,000 people and NationsBank had between 8,500 and 9,000 employees in Florida. It's worth noting that the 6,000 figure involves a bit of uncertainty. It's a prediction, rather than an after-the-fact accounting, so the final number may have been higher or lower. (In other reports, the Herald noted that new jobs might be created in back-office processing facilities in Jacksonville and with the expected addition of 60 to 80 supermarket branches.) In addition, Rainey said in the Herald article that the 6,000 target would be met largely by attrition rather than layoffs -- not an implausible goal, given the high rates of employee turnover in the banking industry and the relatively low unemployment levels at the time. Also, the subsequent merger of NationsBank with Bank of America in 1998 created an expected 8,000 job cuts. But that was a national number; the number of jobs lost in Florida specifically was not reported. Ultimately, none of these caveats matter much because the RGA ad was carefully worded. It speaks of "thousands of Florida jobs," rather than citing a specific number of job losses, and it refrains from describing the eliminated jobs as "layoffs." So we find this description accurate. Compensation Here too, we were unable to obtain original tax forms from the Sink campaign, but their contents were widely and consistently reported in 2002, when the gubernatorial campaign of Sink's husband, Democrat Bill McBride, released them to the public. The McBride campaign released Sink's tax returns for 2000 and 2001, which had been filed independently of her husband. Earlier, the campaign had released the couple's jointly filed return from 1999. When her income from these three years is combined, Sink earned in excess of $8 million. According to various news reports at the time, which were based directly on the tax returns released to the media, Sink earned $2.6 million in 1999, $3.4 million in 2000 and $2.8 million in 2001. (She took early retirement in a management shakeup in 2000.) That equals $8.8 million over three years. While that amount squares with the dollar figure cited in the ad, it's worth noting two caveats. One is that this income was earned between two and four years after the merger was announced. However, Sink held the same position at the time -- president of Florida operations for the bank -- and was presiding over the merged entity. So that doesn't strike us as being a major flaw. The other caveat concerns the ad's use of the term "salary and bonuses." In 2002, the Associated Press reported that Sink's 2000 income included "stock-options and lump-sum pension payments" and that her 2001 income included "stock options, deferred compensation and pension" payments. None of the coverage mentions "bonus" payments, and the campaign was not able to clarify whether she received any bonuses or not for those years. The RGA stands behind its characterization. "To most normal people, any compensation that is over and above your typical salary would be called a bonus," said spokesman Tim Murtaugh. "Very often, these bonuses take the form of some combination of stocks and other compensation." But we think the distinction is worth mentioning because in today's post-Wall Street crash environment, saying that a financial-services employee received a lucrative "bonus" at the same time the company was cutting jobs is a pretty loaded accusation. Absent any hard evidence that she received what experts would consider a "bonus," we'll downgrade the accuracy of this part of the ad slightly. Who's to blame? So our analysis suggests that the core facts in the ad are pretty accurate. But what about the larger context? Two banking experts noted that Sink did nothing unusual compared to other bank executives during that period of aggressive mergers. Stanley D. Smith, a finance professor at the University of Central Florida, said that the elimination of those jobs in the merger "would have and should have occurred no matter who the Florida CEO was. That merger was what is called an intramarket merger, where the two banks’ branches and operations overlapped. The premium that NationsBank paid was based on the savings that would occur from the elimination of overlapping branches and operations. Any competent banker would have done the same thing, and those unfortunate job losses are just a normal part of that type of merger." James McNulty, a finance professor at Florida Atlantic University, agreed. "Bank mergers very often involve job losses," he said. "The major reason that banks merge is to improve efficiency, and that involves eliminating positions that are redundant in the combined organization. In many cases jobs are reduced by attrition rather than by firing people -- those who leave are not replaced, and good people that the bank wants to retain are moved to new positions. This happens in most large bank mergers. Blaming it on Alex Sink is preposterous." There's one other issue worth considering: Was Sink as personally responsible for slashing jobs as the ad claims? Last May, Sink told reporters in the St. Petersburg Times-Miami Herald Tallahassee bureau that the decision to merge with Barnett was made by corporate executives at NationsBank headquarters in Charlotte, N.C. "I got a call one day just like the people at Barnett did that said an agreement has been reached," she said. Murtaugh of the RGA responds that "Sink was the president of the bank. Of course she was responsible for decisions made. If she says she wasn’t responsible and was only following orders, what does that say about her ability to tout her business experience? She can’t claim that she wasn’t in charge of decisionmaking and then also claim that she has business decisionmaking experience." On that point, we agree. Even if she were not the architect of the deal, she helped implement the merger over the next few years, and received a generous compensation package at the same time. With the exception of the term "bonus," which we think is a bit of a stretch, the RGA ad strikes us as generally accurate. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-11503	"So many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats."	pants on fire!	/new-york/statements/2018/feb/23/claudia-tenney/do-many-mass-shooters-end-being-democrats-rep-tenn/	An upstate New York member of Congress made national headlines when she suggested many mass shooters were Democrats. Rep. Claudia Tenney, R-Utica, was speaking with a radio host from Albany, N.Y., about how to prevent future mass shootings when she made the claim. "It's interesting that so many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats, but the media doesn't talk about that either," Tenney said on Feb. 21, 2018. The host of the radio show did not ask Tenney to back up her claim, but several reporters on Twitter did. Her office sent out a statement from Tenney that evening: "I am fed up with the media and liberals attempting to politicize tragedies and demonize law-abiding gun owners and conservative Americans every time there is a horrible tragedy," Tenney said in the statement. "While we know the perpetrators of these atrocities have a wide variety of political views, my comments are in response to a question about the failure to prosecute illegal gun crime. I will continue to stand up for law-abiding citizens who are smeared by anti-gun liberal elitists." Tenney did not answer questions about her claim at a press event the next day. Her office has not provided any support for the claim. (A lawmaker in North Carolina made a similar claim this week as well. Read more about that here.) We wondered if there was any truth to Tenney’s claim. Do many mass shooters turn out to be Democrats? Mass shooters since Columbine There is no universal definition for mass shootings. We looked at 19 shootings that have received significant national media coverage since the Columbine High School shooting in 1999. More than eight people were killed in each of the shootings. We found very few cases in which the political affiliation of the shooter could be verified. Omar Mateen, the shooter who killed 49 people at a nightclub in Orlando, Florida, in 2016, was registered as a Democrat in 2006. He voted in the Florida primary in 2016, according to reporting from Politico. A dating profile for Chris Harper Mercer, who killed nine people at a community college in Oregon in 2015, said he was a Republican, according to reporting from CBS News. There was no evidence of his political affiliation beyond the profile. A friend of Aaron Alexis, who killed 12 people at the Washington Navy Yard in 2013, said in a CNN interview that the shooter was "more of a liberal type." There were no other reports of his political affiliation. Politicians were the victims of a couple of recent shooting rampages that weren’t on our list of 19 mass shootings. In 2017, 66-year-old James Thomas Hodgkinson shot and injured six people at a congressional baseball game in Virginia — nearly killing House Majority Whip Steve Scalise. Hodgkinson volunteered for the presidential campaign of Democrat Bernie Sanders and apparently targeted the Republican team. In 2011, 22-year-old Jared Lee Loughner opened fire in Tucson at an event hosted by Rep. Gabby Giffords, an Arizona Democrat. Loughner killed six and injured 13 others, including Giffords. Authorities reported that he was obsessed with Giffords. Inaccurate reporting There was speculation about the political leanings of some of the other shooters. ABC News falsely reported that James Holmes, who killed 12 people in Colorado in 2012, was a member of the conservative tea party. ABC apologized for the error. Breitbart News reported that Holmes may have been a registered Democrat, but also walked back that claim. Holmes’ political affiliation was never verified. Fake news websites claimed Devin Patrick Kelley, who killed 26 people in a Texas church last year, was linked to anti-fascist groups. PolitiFact debunked that claim. Websites made the same claim about Las Vegas shooter Stephen Craig Paddock. We debunked that, too. Paddock wasn’t registered to vote and his family said he didn’t have strong political views, according to a report from Fox News. There were also claims that Adam Lanza, who killed 20 people at Sandy Hook Elementary School in 2012, was a Democrat. He was not registered to vote, according to the Washington Post. Most recently, our friends at Snopes debunked the claim that Nikolas Cruz, who allegedly killed 17 people at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida, was a Democrat. A search of Florida’s voter database yielded no results for Cruz’s party affiliation. There was no reporting on the political leanings of the other 11 shooters. Is it relevant? Mass shooters are rarely motivated by a political agenda, experts told us. Mass shootings are often perpetrated by young men who are socially isolated or have a mental illness, experience a trauma or conflict that sends them reeling emotionally, and have easy access to guns, said Alan Lipman, professor at George Washington University Medical Center and founder of the Center for the Study of Violence. "Their motives are almost always, without exception, nonpolitical. And they don’t describe themselves as having a particular political motivation," Lipman said. Some — like Dylann Roof, who killed nine people at a church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015 — might channel their rage at a specific group of people, said James Alan Fox, criminologist at Northeastern University and author of "Extreme Killing: Understanding Serial and Mass Murder." But that doesn’t mean they’re acting on a Republican or Democratic mission, he said. "Very few are motivated by any sort of political agenda in terms in parties. They might be anti-gay or anti-black or anti-white. You could argue those are political, I guess," he said. Even then, those beliefs are often born out of personal vendettas — not political propaganda, said Katherine Ramsland, professor of psychology at DeSales University. "Look at Stephen Paddock. We don't know his motive," Ramsland said of the Las Vegas shooter. "Devin Kelly — his political affiliation is secondary to his family disputes and need for payback. I just think it's overly simplistic to align a mass shooter's influence with a political ideology unless it's clear from the shooter that this was his (or her) driving issue." Other experts reacted similarly to the assertion that shooters tend to have common political beliefs. "Most of the school shooters are children who wouldn’t know a conservative from a communist," said Jack Levin, Northeastern professor and co-director of the Brudnick Center on Violence and Conflict. "The idea of associating politics with these mass murders is absurd. It has absolutely nothing to do with it." Lipman agreed: "There is absolutely no evidence to show that mass killings are motivated by political ideologies of any type. All of the mass killings we’ve seen have been motivated by a lethal combination of a small subgroup of mental illnesses, and easy accessibility to weapons of mass killing during the peak symptomatology of those illnesses." Our ruling Tenney said, "Many of these people that commit the mass murders end up being Democrats." There’s no proof to support that claim. The political affiliation of most of the mass shooters we looked at was either unreported or never verified. Experts said these events are rarely motivated by politics to begin with. Tenney walked back her claim later that day in a statement, saying "we know the perpetrators of these atrocities have a wide variety of political views." We rate her claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-00908	Education funding of $7,176 per student is a "historic level."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/mar/03/rick-scott/scott-calls-proposed-pupil-spending-historic/	Gov. Rick Scott used his annual opening address to the 2015 Legislature to talk about some of his favorite subjects -- taxes, business and his newfound penchant for spending more on education. SEE RICK SCOTT'S STATE OF THE STATE SPEECH ANNOTATED. "If we are going to out-compete the world, we must invest in K-12 education," he said. "This year, we are recommending an increase in K-12 funding to $50 above the historic level to $7,176 per student." That’s a change from Scott’s first year in office, when he recommended the Legislature slash $3.3 billion out of the education budget as Florida’s budget floundered during the recession. (They eventually cut $1.3 billion.) He has since reversed course, recommending additional funding each year as tax revenues and the state's economy rebounded. Let’s check the numbers to see if Scott’s per-pupil spending really is a historic high. Accounting for education K-12 education gets most of its money through the Florida Education Finance Program, a combination of state and local funding. School districts contribute property tax dollars, called the "required local effort," at a rate set by the state. Florida received federal stimulus dollars a couple of recent years, too. Total education spending became a flashpoint during the 2014 campaign when challenger and former Gov. Charlie Crist attacked Scott’s education spending. Scott responded by saying he now oversaw the highest education budget in state spending. But that was only true in total dollars, not per-pupil spending. After Crist said he held the record for spending per student, which many education advocates have said is a better method for measuring, Scott said he would raise the 2015-16 number to $50 higher than Crist’s record. That led to this year’s budget recommendation, which asks the Legislature for a $19.75 billion K-12 budget, working out to $7,176 per student. To keep track of it, let’s look at this table: Fiscal year K-12 budget (total) Per pupil spending 2007-08 (Crist) $18.7 billion $7,126 2008-09 (Crist) $17.9 billion $6,846 2009-10 (Crist)* $18 billion $6,846 2010-11 (Crist)* $18.2 billion $6,897 2011-12 (Scott) $16.6 billion $6,217 2012-13 (Scott) $17.2 billion $6,376 2013-14 (Scott) $18.3 billion $6,769 2014-15 (Scott) $18.9 billion $6,915 2015-16 (Scott -- recommended) $19.75 billion $7,176 The two years marked with an asterisk were years when Florida raked in about $900 million each in federal stimulus money to keep the budget afloat. Also note that for 2015-16, Scott’s proposal is a recommendation only; the Legislature ultimately will decide school funding levels. We should note some other caveats about Scott’s increased spending: First of all, remember that Florida schools have more students now than they did when Crist was in office. A current student total won’t be available until enrollments for next year are finished and added up, but in 2014-15 there were somewhere around 100,000 more students than in 2007. Overall spending would have to go up just to keep pace. Secondly, even though proposed spending could be increased $50, that hardly keeps up with the inflation realized in the eight-year span since Crist was in office. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index inflation calculator (an imperfect measure, to be sure, but a good benchmark), Scott would have to increase spending by an additional $850 or so to even match what per-pupil spending was in 2007. When we account for inflation, 2007’s $7,126 per-student funding comes out to $8,032 today. Our ruling Scott said his recommendation of education funding of $7,176 per student is a "historic level." That’s accurate only if you don’t account for inflation, which has ticked up each year since the previous per-student spending high in 2007-08. The claim is partially accurate. We rate it Half True.

pomt-04561	Josh Mandel "is lying about his own record. The rating of Ohio's investment fund has NOT improved."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/sep/26/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-campaign-ad-targets-josh-mandel-trut/	Truthfulness has become a persistent issue in the U.S. Senate campaign between Sherrod Brown, the Democratic incumbent, and Josh Mandel, Ohio's Republican treasurer. The Brown campaign raised the issue explicitly this month in a 30-second TV ad titled "Pants on Fire." The ad accuses Mandel of being "the candidate of the big lie," and displays a newspaper column as the source for the line. "Now Josh is lying about his own record," the ad says. "The rating of Ohio's investment fund has NOT improved." The capital letters for emphasis are in the on-screen text of the words. The claim sounded familiar to PolitiFact Ohio, and with reason. When we asked the Brown campaign for supporting sources, they cited a fact-check by us and another by our friends at FactCheck.org. When we looked further, we found a third related fact-check by PolitiFact Ohio. The first item, from October 2011, reviewed the claim in a Mandel campaign email about the STAR (State Treasury Asset Reserve) Ohio fund, an investment pool with assets of more than $4.1 billion through which the state treasurer invests money for local governments. The campaign email said the STAR Ohio fund "just received the highest possible credit rating one of these funds can receive." The source for the claim was the credit rating agency Standard & Poor's, which sent the state a letter in August 2011 affirming a AAAm rating for the STAR Ohio fund. While that is the highest possible rating, STAR Ohio has received a AAAm rating since 1995, the first year S&P rated the fund. Public finance experts told us the treasurer deserved credit for maintaining the bond rating but did not "achieve" it. We found then that a reader could reasonably assume from his email that the rating had gone up. Because the rating already had been in place for 16 years and did not improve under Mandel, we said his email overstated the case. We rated the statement Half True. FactCheck.org, in May 2012, looked at a Mandel ad that said he "earned the highest possible credit ratings as state treasurer." That statement "could give viewers the impression that Mandel improved the state’s credit ratings, but that is not the case," FactCheck.org concluded. "Under Mandel, the state’s STAR Ohio investment fund has maintained its 'AAA' rating from Standard & Poor’s. But even the state treasurer’s office acknowledges that the fund has had that same rating since 1995." We also looked at that same ad statement last May, and found it more carefully worded than the claim in the email we examined earlier. Unlike the email, the statement did not imply that the credit rating had "just" improved. Because the statement was accurate but needed for clarification the additional information that the rating had been AAAm for 16 years, we rated it Mostly True. That brings us back to the Brown campaign’s TV ad. First, it is important to know that the fund already had achieved the highest possible rating. There was not room for improvement in the rating, as could be reasonably inferred from the TV ad. More importantly, though, the ad targets Mandel’s character, questioning his truthfulness, and makes the claim that he "is lying about his own record. The rating of Ohio's investment fund has NOT improved." Ohio's investment fund has not improved under Mandel. And a natural reading of that claim is that Mandel at some point claimed it had improved. Except in the materials the Brown campaign cited in support of the ad, Mandel doesn’t actually say the rating went up. But that’s the clear implication the ad makes when it says he is now lying about his record. And PolitiFact Ohio has never heard him make that claim. PolitiFact Ohio previously rated as Mostly True the claim by Mandel's campaign that he "earned the highest possible credit ratings" for investment funds managed by the treasurer's office. We found that the claim needed additional information for clarification, but that it was accurate. When we rated Mandel’s claim in his email Half True for overstatement, that was for his use of the words ""just received," which we said could give the impression that the rating was new. He did not say in that email that the rating for the STAR Ohio fund had gone up. While the claims put the best possible spin on Mandel's performance, they do not qualify as "lying about his record." In that regard, the suggestion from the ad that he said the rating increased is just deceptive and incorrect. On the Truth-O-Meter, the Brown campaign ad’s claim rates False.

pomt-00286	West Virginia University’s incoming freshman class has the "highest-ever GPA"	mostly true	/west-virginia/statements/2018/sep/28/e-gordon-gee/does-west-virginia-universitys-incoming-freshman-c/	Is West Virginia University’s freshman class this year the smartest ever? The question came up as part of an ongoing dispute between West Virginia University and fraternities over student safety. In February, WVU President Gordon Gee released a statement charting a course for future relations between the university and Greek organizations. "Fraternities and sororities are acquiring an increasingly toxic reputation among parents, employers and members of the public," Gee wrote in the Feb. 15, 2018 letter. "At West Virginia University, we are not waiting for the next tragic death, arrest or headline-grabbing incident to prompt our action. When it comes to student misconduct in our fraternities and sororities, the time to act is now." Later in his letter, Gee wrote that following a student death in 2014, "we have had great success in changing our overall student culture to emphasize working smart and playing smart. The result has been a rise in student academic qualifications. Last fall, for example, on our Morgantown campus we welcomed our biggest class of Honors College freshmen ever, as well as our largest overall freshman class, with the highest-ever GPA." Friction between the university and fraternities has continued: Several fraternities threatened to bolt from university oversight, and during the first week of the semester in August, Gee sent a letter to parents asking them to "discourage" students from rushing unaffiliated fraternities. In this article, we aren’t going to fact-check the fraternity controversy, but one portion of Gee’s earlier letter caught our eye. Is it true that WVU’s current freshman class has the "highest-ever GPA" in the university’s history, as Gee wrote? On the university’s website, it says that "the average student enrolled in WVU’s Fall 2018 freshman class had a 3.55 high school GPA, an ACT score of 24 and a combined Math and Critical Reading SAT score of 1133. Stephen Lee, WVU’s associate vice president of enrollment management and executive director of admissions and recruitment, provided PolitiFact with a partial run of older data. The data Lee provided shows that average GPAs for the previous three years were 3.47 for the freshmen of 2017, 3.46 for the freshmen of 2016, and 3.45 for the freshmen of 2015. Here’s a chart summarizing the data from Lee: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The data shows a steady increase in the freshman GPA, but the data goes back only to 1995. So we can’t independently confirm that this fall’s freshmen have the highest GPAs "ever." Meanwhile, the data also showed a post-1995 high for SAT and ACT standardized test scores for incoming freshmen in 2018. Our ruling Gee wrote that WVU’s incoming freshman class for 2018 has the "highest-ever GPA" in the university’s history. The incoming freshman GPA is the highest since 1995, according to data provided by the university, and given the steady rise since 1995, it’s plausible that the current class’ GPA is the highest in the university’s history. But we do not have data that independently confirms that. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	E.

pomt-11835	"Supreme Court issues its first bench warrant ever."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/09/freedomjunkshuncom/fake-news-story-says-supreme-court-issues-bogus-wa/	A fake news story spread by a liberal troll website said the U.S. Supreme Court issued a bench warrant for the arrest in a fictional case against the Treasury Department. "Supreme Court issues its first bench warrant ever," read the headline on a Nov. 6, 2017, post on FreeInfoMedia.com. We saw the same article on the same day posted to FreedomJunkshun.com, the fake news site where it originated. Facebook users reported both posts as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to curb fake news. We also saw the same story on other sites. The fake story said that Supreme Court justices Neil Gorsuch and Clarence Thomas had issued the warrant to compel a man named Donald M. Allard to testify "on a case involving the Treasury Department’s mishandling of funds during the Obama administration." A bench warrant is a written order by a judge authorizing the police to find someone and bring them to court. The story said Allard, described as "a close friend and college activist friend of Barack Obama," had previously been found in contempt in two fictional courts. The Supreme Court wanted him to answer whether he was "ordered by the chief executive to transfer funds from the trust fund to the general fund without the approval of Congress," the story said. There is no warrant, of course, just as there is no such case before the Supreme Court. The story is completely bogus. FreedomJunkshun.com is a member of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, who lives in Maine. Blair is a self-described liberal troll who creates fictional stories to try to fool conservative readers. The website uses a similar layout and style as other Blair-affiliated sites and carries a disclaimer that reads, "All people, places, names and images should be considered fictitious or fictitious representations." Just to be sure the assertions in the story were fake, we asked a couple of legal experts whether there was any sort of case like the one described, or if the court had issued any bench warrants. Tom Goldstein, who runs SCOTUSblog.com with his wife Amy Howe, told us that "every possible aspect of that is fiction." Ilya Shapiro, senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said he was unaware of any bench warrant ever being issued by the Supreme Court. "Bench warrants are issued to cause the arrest of someone who violated a court rule or showed contempt for the court, so in theory the Supreme Court could indeed issue one. But I’ve never heard of it," Shapiro said. "Even in the handful of recent protest cases, the Supreme Court marshals or Capitol Police simply arrest the people on their pre-existent authority to do so." As a final note, we have to point out the tomfoolery surrounding the name of the supposed witness, Donald M. Allard. The letters of the name elide into Donald Mallard, which appears to be an allusion to Donald Duck. This is another fake story full of preposterous details cooked up by a network of trolls to fool people. We rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-01557	Says President Obama "has never made a statement ... that he wanted a residual force left (in Iraq)."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/12/john-mccain/mccain-obama-never-said-he-wanted-leave-troops-ira/	Questions about what President Barack Obama should do in Iraq now have lately been overshadowed by another question: Should Obama have left troops in Iraq after the war ended? Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has advocated for keeping residual forces in the country since he visited its capital, Baghdad, in late 2008 -- right after losing the presidential election to Obama. And he continues to argue that Obama made the wrong decision to remove all American troops from Iraq by the end of 2011. McCain repeated this point on Sept. 10, appearing on several news shows after Obama announced his strategy to combat the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria -- the militant Islamic group that has taken control of several cities in Iraq and has beheaded two American journalists. On CNN, he sparred with former White House Press Secretary Jay Carney. Carney said the decision to withdraw had been "the right approach" and said the Iraqi government had played a role in that decision. "You know, Mr. Carney, you are again saying facts that are patently false," McCain said. "The fact is, because (Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.) and I, and (former Sen. Joe Lieberman, D-Conn.) were in Baghdad. (The Iraqis) wanted a residual force. The president has never made a statement, during that or after, that he wanted a residual force left behind." It’s impossible to know for certain what the Iraqi government wanted, and we have limited information about conversations that happened behind closed doors in the White House. But we can check what Obama said publicly about leaving troops behind. As far as we can tell, McCain’s right. Throughout the first few years of his presidency, Obama did not make a public statement in which he clearly expressed that he wanted to keep troops in Iraq after the agreed upon withdrawal date. Promises, promises First, some background. Ending the war in Iraq was one of Obama’s principal campaign promises, and he kept that promise by removing combat troops by the end of 2010 and all other troops by the end of 2011. Obama announced his own draw-down plans a month after taking office. "Let me say this as plainly as I can: By Aug. 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end," he said Feb. 27, 2009. He also said he would keep between 35,000 to 50,000 military personnel there through the end of 2011 to train and advise Iraqi military and for counterterrorism purposes. The 2011 deadline was spelled out in a 2008 Status of Forces Agreement between the George W. Bush administration and that of then-Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki (who recently stepped down). What matters for this fact-check is what happened to American troops in Iraq after Jan. 1, 2012. There was public debate among leaders on that issue throughout 2011. Military commanders in Washington and in Baghdad pushed for a residual force of between 16,000 and 24,000 to conduct counterrorism work and train Iraqi security forces. The White House, reports show, was not open to a force that size, though they considered leaving up to 10,000 troops -- a controversial pitch that would have required approval from Iraq’s divided government to change the 2008 agreement. However, the New York Times detailed how the one-time goal of a 10,000-person force shrank before negotiations failed altogether. According to the New York Times, "the new goal would be a continuous presence of about 3,500 troops, a rotating force of up to 1,500 and half a dozen F-16’s." But this was all behind closed doors and only came out later, so let’s look at what Obama said publicly. Talking points Although some White House officials spoke to the media anonymously about the potential to keep residual forces in Iraq, we found no circumstance in which Obama himself talked about this as a possibility. And if he had, it would have clashed with his usual talking points. We read quite a few of Obama’s speeches and remarks from 2009, 2010 and 2011, and he repeatedly touted the complete removal of combat troops and the upcoming withdrawal of all remaining forces. Here’s a sampling: In a speech at Cairo University in 2009, Obama said, "Iraq's sovereignty is its own. And that's why I ordered the removal of our combat brigades by next August. That is why we will honor our agreement with Iraq's democratically elected government to remove combat troops from Iraqi cities by July, and to remove all of our troops from Iraq by 2012." In August 2010, he announced the removal of all combat troops from his Oval Office desk. Then he said, "Consistent with our agreement with the Iraqi government, all U.S. troops will leave by the end of next year." Almost exactly a year later, in August 2011, at the American Legion Conference, he said, "Having ended our combat mission in Iraq and removed more than 100,000 troops so far, we’ll remove the rest of our troops by the end of this year, and we will end that war." And on Oct. 21, 2011, following the final negotiations with Maliki, Obama said, "Last year, I announced the end to our combat mission in Iraq. And to date, we’ve removed more than 100,000 troops. … So today, I can report that, as promised, the rest of our troops in Iraq will come home by the end of the year. After nearly nine years, America’s war in Iraq will be over." A spokeswoman with the National Security Council did, though, point us to Obama’s president-elect platform from 2008, which said, "a residual force will remain in Iraq and in the region to conduct targeted counter-terrorism missions against al Qaeda in Iraq and protect American diplomatic and civilian personnel." However, it’s possible that this was referring to the transitional forces that would stay between the end of the combat mission in 2010 and the complete withdrawal in 2011. Obama also said in a June 19, 2014, press conference, "We offered a modest residual force to help continue to train and advise Iraqi security forces." But as far as we can tell, if this is the case, he did not talk about this to the public during the negotiations. In fact, Carney, who was Obama’s press secretary then, said something of the opposite to the press. Throughout the summer of 2011, Carney told reporters that they would consider leaving forces in Iraq if, and only if, the Iraqi government requested it. But otherwise, they would go ahead with the agreed upon plan and leave by the end of 2011. "We continue to work under the status of forces agreement that we have with the Iraqi government, that will result in full withdrawal of U.S. troops by the end of this year," Carney said in August 2011, in response to a question of whether or not the withdrawal was slowing down. "We have said in the past that we will listen to -- consider any request that the Iraqi government might have to further our engagement with Iraq militarily, just in terms of what we might do there. But that has not been forthcoming, and we are on track to withdraw by the end of the year." Our ruling McCain said Obama "has never made a statement ... that he wanted a residual force left (in Iraq)." Obama’s president-elect platform made a vague comment about leaving residual forces, and it seems that the White House -- behind closed doors -- considered it extensively. But we found no public statements of Obama saying he wanted to leave troops in Iraq past the agreed upon withdrawal date in the months leading up the war’s end. He repeatedly asserted that troops would be out of Iraq by the end of 2011. McCain’s claim is accurate but requires additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-03737	In South Carolina, women earn 76 cents on the dollar to men’s earnings.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/apr/12/elizabeth-colbert-busch/gender-wage-gap-claim-needs-more-context/	Next month, South Carolina voters head to the polls for a special election to select a new representative for the U.S. House in the state’s 1st Congressional District. The race between former Gov. Mark Sanford, a Republican candidate known for his infamous antics, and Elizabeth Colbert Busch, a Democratic candidate known for her talk-show host brother’s antics, has garnered national attention for Georgia’s next-door neighbor. This week, Colbert Busch tried to capitalize on Sanford’s poor reputation with women, while pushing for equity in employee pay. The Colbert Busch campaign did not return a call and an email for comment. "In South Carolina, women earn 76 cents on the dollar to men’s earnings," the candidate said in a news release. She went on to say that "I am committed to making sure that women earn the same pay for the same work." PolitiFact has heard and examined similar wage gap claims before. We decided to revisit the claim and check any new material available on the subject to see whether Colbert Busch’s claim was correct. Colbert Busch made her comments about the wage gap on Equal Pay Day. That day symbolizes how many months after one year a woman must work, on average, to earn as much as a man earned that same one year. In conjunction with Equal Pay Day, the National Partnership for Women and Families released a report examining the pay gap in the states and 50 largest metropolitan areas. For South Carolina, the group found that women in general are paid 76 cents for every dollar paid to men. The report is based on census data of full-time, year-round workers. The NPWF used the study to push for passage of the Paycheck Fairness Act to prevent pay discrimination. Colbert Busch’s figure is correct, and based on numerous studies that have controlled for factors like education level and time on the job and they still cannot explain the gender wage gap, said Drucilla Barker, a professor of women’s and gender studies at the University of South Carolina. "Women and men do different kinds of work and in general women’s work pays less than men’s work," she said. "The question then becomes ‘why?’" Last year, a National Women’s Law Center report provided a state-by-state ranking comparing median earnings for both genders for full-time, year-round workers, regardless of occupation, based on census data. The report found that in 2011 in South Carolina, women earned 75.6 cents for every dollar earned by a man. The state gaps follow the often-repeated national data that shows women earning 77 cents to every dollar a man earns.The 77-cent figure is derived from a 2010 census report comparing female-to-male earnings ratio of full-time, year-round workers. But that report compares all workers, regardless of occupation and other factors such as education level and time on the job. It has been used widely to support eliminating gender discrimination. Last June, in a campaign ad, President Barack Obama claimed that women are "paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men." Obama neglected to include employee factors such as education level, occupation and time on the job in his analysis, and received a Mostly False rating for oversimplifying his statement. A few months later, Colorado legislator Diana DeGette received a Mostly True rating for her claim that women "receive only 77 cents for every dollar a man earns" because she did not use the "same work as men" qualifier. The 23-cent gap has been challenged by economists and policy groups who say the gap is much smaller when factors such as education, type of job and experience level are considered. This week, the Independent Women’s Forum, a conservative nonprofit group, posted a video about the gap, calling it inaccurate, and saying that proposed laws to close the perceived gap will lead to undue government regulation. In October, a study by the American Association of University Women, which advocates for equity for women and girls, analyzed men’s and women’s earnings one year after graduation. Study authors maintain that a wage gap for almost all occupations still exists. When taking qualifiers such as education, training, age and parental status into account, women in 2009 still earned 6.6 percent less than men, the study concluded. This unexplained gap could be attributed to gender discrimination and women’s ability to negotiate salaries, the report found. An AAUW researcher noted that the wage gap can grow as careers progress. How much of a pay gap between women and men is due to discrimination against women is unclear, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "But a fair-minded person should certainly take account of hours worked per week before calculating the earnings penalty of being a women. It is less clear how much of the occupational difference, the job tenure difference and the work experience difference between women and men we should take into account." Our conclusion: Colbert Busch said that in South Carolina, women earn 76 cents on the dollar to men’s earnings. PolitiFact has examined similar wage gap claims several times over the past couple of years. During that time, the data used to make the claims has been reviewed extensively. Each time, we have noted that some studies reporting the larger gaps do not take into account several variables impacting pay, including types of occupations, age of employee, education and training, hours worked and duration on the job. That is the case with the claim made by Colbert Busch. Making such a blanket statement without the context of the qualifiers is disingenuous. There is a wage gap between men and women. She is right about that. But most studies indicate it tends to diminish when other factors are considered. Colbert Busch’s claim is accurate, but it leaves out substantial context that would give the reader a different impression. We rated Colbert Busch’s claim Half True.

pomt-12114	"(For) white working-class America, death rates among white men are up 20 percent."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/20/alex-castellanos/death-rates-white-men-20-percent-gop-strategist-sa/	President Donald Trump’s supporters continue to back him because they felt so besieged by the political landscape and life in general that it’s literally killing them, a GOP strategist said on ABC’s This Week. Alex Castellanos, who has worked as a consultant for George W. Bush and Mitt Romney, said during an Aug. 20, 2017, discussion on the show that Trump’s backers have stuck with him through controversies because they didn’t see an alternative option. Democrats attacking Trump’s response to violence in Charlottesville, Va., just fed into growing bitterness among his base over their dire socioeconomic situation, he said. "What I think a lot of Trump supporters heard this week was, the Democrats are just painting us, Trump supporters, with a Nazi brush. We're all white supremacists. That's their excuse for why they lost the election," Castellanos said. "No. White working-class America, death rates among white men are up 20 percent. They're unemployed. Gwen Ifill said, ‘no wonder they're resentful.’" We wondered about his statistic that working-class white men are dying at a higher rate than before. It turns out that researchers have identified increasing mortality among the white working class, but it’s not as high for men as the 20 percent number Castellanos cited. Increased mortality rates In response to our questions, Castellanos sent us two articles from the New York Times and the Guardian about a 2015 paper by husband-and-wife Princeton economists Angus Deaton and Anne Case. Their research showed that death rates for middle-aged, white Americans had been going up, while they had been going down for every other age, race and ethnic group. Those rates also had been falling in other countries. This was a reversal of a years-long trend in which mortality rates had been steadily decreasing, meaning that Americans across many groups were living longer. From 1978 to 1998, white Americans were seeing mortality rates fall about 2 percent each year. So the fact that Case and Deaton found an increase was considered significant. But Deaton told us the 20 percent number Castellanos cited for men was too high. (That’s a number the Guardian reported, but it cites the increase as being for "the death rate for white Americans aged 45 to 54.") "In our 2015 PNAS paper, we say that for all white non-Hispanics (men and women together), mortality rates for those aged 45 to 54 rose at half of one percent per year, which from 1998 to 2013 is 7.8 percent, not 20 percent, and certainly not 20 percent for men only," Deaton wrote via email. Case added that that was for all levels of education, not just people who didn’t have a college degree. Deaton and Case’s study showed that mortality rates were climbing for white, non-Hispanic Americans aged 45 to 54 with a high school education or less. The research further showed that deaths were up from drug and alcohol poisonings, suicides, chronic liver diseases and cirrhosis. Mortality rates rose for all education groups, but "those with less education saw the most marked increases," the paper read. It’s important to note that overall mortality rates for African-Americans were still higher than whites. But African-Americans still recorded an overall drop in the same time period, not an increase. Researchers were surprised by the Case and Deaton study in 2015. Dartmouth economists Ellen Meara and Jonathan Skinner said in an analysis that while most Americans’ life expectancies had gone up in the face of the Great Recession and rising income inequality, the study’s findings "dashed even this cautiously optimistic view of the past several decades." "These trends are indeed concentrated among the least educated Americans who never attended college," Meara told PolitiFact. "Of note, the trends do not apply to current retirees, nor youth, both groups that have experienced mortality improvements in recent decades." Others questioned the paper’s results. Columbia University statistics professor Andrew Gelman argued that the situation wasn’t as dire as it first appeared. He said that some statistical adjustments showed that middle-aged white women largely made up the difference in mortality rates, and the figures evened out when you combined men and women. Deaton and Case addressed some of these doubts in a 2017 follow-up to their paper. While the 2015 data didn’t focus on differences between men and women, their latest work did, along with adjusting their age groups. "For non-Hispanic white men aged 30 to 59 without a four-year college degree, age-adjusted all-cause mortality rose by 7 percent from 1998 to 2015," Deaton said of the latest data. Again they found that a lack of education was a major factor for increasing mortality rates, among other issues. (Gelman and Jonathan Auerbach, a Columbia doctoral student, again disputed their findings.) "We propose a preliminary but plausible story in which cumulative disadvantage from one birth cohort to the next, in the labor market, in marriage and child outcomes, and in health, is triggered by progressively worsening labor market opportunities at the time of entry for whites with low levels of education," the 2017 paper read. There’s evidence that whites with less education on the lower end of the income spectrum didn’t make up the bulk of Trump’s voters. The Washington Post reported that his base is largely affluent Republicans, whether they have a college education or not. Deaton said Castellanos was speaking too broadly, and the spirit of his comment misses what the research really says. "To be fair, that mortality rates are going up at all is a big deal, and is a measure of the fact that bad things are happening to these people," he said. Our ruling Castellanos said that for the white working class, "death rates among white men are up 20 percent." Research has shown that death rates are up for white men, which is a cause for concern because death rates have historically declined. But that research is not without controversy. Also, the researchers who documented the increase in death rates say it’s not as alarmingly high as 20 percent just for white men. A more accurate estimate would be around 7 percent. Castellanos has a point about increased death rates among whites, but he incorrectly cited figures from the study. We rate his statement Mostly False.

pomt-06459	"A Cornell University research study concludes that ethanol generates a 29 percent energy loss, meaning it takes more than a gallon of gasoline to produce a gallon of ethanol."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/oct/19/matt-gaetz/rep-matt-gaetz-says-ethanol-study-shows-its-not-wo/	Florida's ethanol mandate has been in place less than a year, and a Panhandle Republican plans to push for its repeal. Rep. Matt Gaetz, who lives in the coastal community of Fort Walton Beach, argues corn-based fuel takes more energy to make than it generates. "A Cornell University research study concludes that ethanol generates a 29 percent energy loss, meaning it takes more than a gallon of gasoline to produce a gallon of ethanol," he wrote in a recent Pensacola News Journal op-ed. A PolitiFact Florida reader sent a link our way. We were curious: Has an Ivy League researcher found ethanol to be an energy loser? We were especially curious because the U.S. Department of Energy says the majority of such studies about ethanol's "net energy balance," especially more recent ones, show the opposite. So, of course, does the renewable fuels industry. First, a little background. The Florida law, passed in 2008, has required since Dec. 31, 2010, that most gasoline include 9 percent to 10 percent "agriculturally derived" fuel. Lawmakers said they wanted to boost renewable energy that would cut greenhouse gas emissions and reduce reliance on foreign oil. But boaters in Gaetz's district were ready to "get out the pitchforks," he said. The law doesn't apply to gas sold for small engines or boats. Still, some boaters who used the mix, known as E10, found it would rot out fuel lines and gunk up carburetors. Gaetz, propelled by angry constituents, did some research — and now has a file in his Tallahassee office to support legislation to turn back the mandate. He sent us a news release from Cornell News Service, "Cornell ecologist's study finds that producing ethanol and biodiesel from corn and other crops is not worth the energy." That appears to give Gaetz's claim strong roots. So does the study itself, which said "to produce a liter of (corn) ethanol requires 29 percent more fossil energy than is produced as ethanol." Researchers included all kinds of "energy inputs" required to produce fuel from corn — more than a dozen just to grow the corn in the first place, from production of pesticides and nitrogen fertilizer to construction of farm equipment to food for farmworkers. (The authors argue that government and industry studies don't take enough "energy inputs" into account, which is why they get a different result.) All the fossil energy, from natural gas to liquid fuel to coal, got totaled up and explained as "gasoline equivalents." That's a little more nuanced than Gaetz's claim that a study said it takes "gasoline" to produce ethanol. But it's close. Still, the study was from 2005. Did Gaetz quote an outdated statistic to make his point? We chatted with one of the researchers, David Pimentel, an emeritus professor in agriculture and life sciences at Cornell. We read him Gaetz's claim. "Yeah, that's correct," Pimentel said. "We have more up-to-date data, though. ... "It would be 1.5 gallons of gasoline equivalents to produce 1 gallon of ethanol. So this is even worse." In other words, Gaetz cited an old number. But more recent work from the same researchers would have even better demonstrated his point. That's scarcely statistical malfeasance. What about the fact that Pimentel's research flies in the face of government and industry studies? We would have preferred Gaetz note that in his op-ed, but Pimentel's a widely cited biofuel skeptic whose work is addressed by USDA researchers and weighed by other Ivy League energy experts. That makes Pimentel's work the subject of legitimate discussion. This fact-check doesn't attempt to evaluate the science itself, but whether Gaetz accurately characterized a scientific study when he wrote, "a Cornell University research study concludes that ethanol generates a 29 percent energy loss, meaning it takes more than a gallon of gasoline to produce a gallon of ethanol." We found the study and talked with the Cornell researcher, who said Gaetz accurately cited him. Still, we're concerned readers might think it literally takes gasoline — rather than gasoline "equivalents" — to produce ethanol. Meanwhile, with the Ivy League appeal of Gaetz's statistic, it might appear to represent settled scientific consensus. In fact, researchers battle from paper to paper — and Pimentel's in the minority. So, the op-ed claim was accurate, but needs some clarification. That's our definition of Mostly True.

pomt-01943	"For the cost of the Iraq War we could’ve ended world hunger for 30 years."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jun/24/facebook-posts/facebook-meme-iraq-war-dollars-could-have-ended-wo/	As sectarian fighting in Iraq spreads, there’s a Facebook meme that captures the public’s frustration with the relative costs and benefits of America’s military intervention in that country. The image makes a simple claim. "For the cost of the Iraq War we could’ve ended world hunger for 30 years," it says. Lee Camp, a stand-up comedian and host of the RT show Redacted Tonight, posted it on his Facebook page. Camp said he didn’t come up with the message, but it made sense to him. "I looked up (the) numbers and found that the Iraq War has cost us $2 trillion since 2003," Camp said. "The UN estimates ending world hunger each year would cost $30 billion. So ending world hunger since 2003 would have cost $330 billion." There are a few problems with the numbers, however. First, pinpointing the cost of the war in Iraq isn’t so black-and-white. The $2 trillion figure, for instance, includes future health care and disability costs for veterans. Second, many experts find the claim that $30 billion a year can end world hunger dubious, including one of the world’s leading hunger advocacy groups. Make no mistake, the money would help. But would it end world hunger? We’ll dig into the numbers. Cost of the Iraq War The big debate in tallying the cost of the Iraq War centers on whether the total should include the projected expense of caring for veterans. Adding future health costs boosts the total by anywhere from well over $300 billion to $1 trillion. The direct military, and security, costs are easier to identify. Here are the numbers we found: Congressional Budget Office: $774 billion for direct military spending through 2014. Congressional Research Service: $806 billion, direct military spending and including Veterans Administration spending to date, through 2011. Brown University - Cost of War Project: $770 billion for direct military spending; $40 billion current health costs; $490 billion future health care costs. The total of all costs, including interest on debt and homeland security and more, is $2.2 trillion. Joseph E. Stiglitz and Linda J. Bilmes, co-authors of co-authors of The Three Trillion Dollar War: The True Cost of the Iraq Conflict: At least $3 trillion, including all current and future costs. New York Times: $872 billion for direct military spending and $26 for billion current health care costs through September 2011; $340 billion for future health care costs. The total for these categories is $1.2 trillion. Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments: $900 billion for direct military spending and current health care costs. "The future cost of veterans’ benefits and services due to Iraq veterans could well exceed the direct cost of the war itself -- a trillion dollars or more," said Todd Harrison, a senior fellow at the center. The tallies show a wide range. The lowest, $774 billion, comes from the CBO but includes no veterans health care costs. The higher estimates, in the neighborhood of $3 trillion, include a long list of costs that span from 2001 to decades in the future. Cost to end world hunger If we took the highest cost estimates for the war, that would provide about $70 billion annually over 30 years. No one questions that those funds could do a lot of good. But beyond that, the data support little more. The estimate that $30 billion could end world hunger for a year comes from the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. In 2008, Senegalese diplomat and director-general Jacques Diouf made an appeal to help the millions of people who are hungry across the globe. "How can we explain to people of good sense and good faith that it was not possible to find $30 billion a year to enable 862 million hungry people to enjoy the most fundamental of human rights: the right to food and thus the right to life?" Diouf asked. Multiply $30 billion by 30 years and you have $900 billion. That’s less than several but not all of the estimated costs of the Iraq War -- without factoring in inflation. But a host of experts we talked to agreed that the $30 billion a year figure is impossible to verify and likely incorrect. (The UN Food and Agriculture Organization did not respond to our request for more information about where their estimate comes from.) Part of the problem is counting how many people are in a state of hunger. The UN World Food Programme says the figure is 842 million. The UN Millennium Development Goals project puts the number at 1.02 billion. Part of the problem is trying to estimate what it would take to lift everyone out of hunger. "I don't believe in the UN claim," said William Easterly, a development economist and co-director of New York University’s Development Research Institute. "The numbers on the extent of world hunger are notoriously unreliable. There is only fragmentary data on stunting and wasting in children, the only direct measure of hunger." Oxfam America, the national chapter of one of the leading global organizations in the fight against hunger and poverty, is also skeptical. "We at Oxfam do not have a figure for the price tag to end hunger and we are not aware of any credible recent figures," said Laura Rusu, an Oxfam spokeswoman. Liz Young researches world hunger at Staffordshire University in England and is the author of the book Food and Development. Young said the claim is "impossible to substantiate." "Such assertions are normally made by activists to make a point, often a very reasonable point, but such assertions stretch the science a little," Young said. Harold Alderman is a senior research fellow at the International Food Policy Research Institute, a Washington group focused on practical solutions to hunger and poverty. Like Young, Alderman doubts the claim but supports the general thrust behind it. "I am not sure that, counting administration and leakage, that that would quite work to completely end hunger for each person in each year," Alderman said. "But I am fairly confident that it would go a long way towards this goal, especially if over time the number of those in need declines." Alderman added that there are 10 relatively low-cost approaches that have a proven track record in reducing malnutrition in children and he is very confident that the Iraq War could have paid for those with money to spare. One of the analytic hurdles in this claim lies in its choice of words. If the Facebook post had said the Iraq War could have ended hunger 30 times over, it would have been on slightly firmer ground. As it is, it makes a claim based on the state of global hunger over the next 30 years. Our experts noted that a lot could happen in 30 years to change the dynamics -- from regional armed conflicts, to the effects on food production from climate change. Our ruling The Facebook post said the money spent on the Iraq War would have ended world hunger for 30 years. While a back-of-envelope calculation gives the claim a superficial appearance of accuracy, below the surface it lacks substance. We found no advocacy group or expert who expressed confidence in the estimates of the total number of people who suffer from hunger or in any estimate of what it would cost to end it. A majority felt that the dollars spent on war would have helped a good deal, but the funds would still fall short of the goal. The claim uses the appearance of mathematical accuracy to support a bold vision of the future, but that does not make it more sound. We rate the claim Half True. Correction: An earlier version of this fact-check misspelled the name of Oxfam spokeswoman Laura Rusu.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2014-06-24T12:00:02	2014-06-16	['None']
pomt-10388	"John McCain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming ... five years ago."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jun/17/john-mccain/mccain-spoke-up-early/	A new TV ad from the McCain campaign portrays the Arizona senator as a leader in the fight against global warming. The ad begins with fast-paced music and horns honking. It shows black-and-white scenes of crowded freeways, smokestacks belching and a glacier collapsing. "John McCain stood up to the president and sounded the alarm on global warming . . . five years ago," the narrator says. The stark black-and-white scenes are replaced by more pleasant color footage of a wind turbine against a bright blue sky and water flowing through a dam. "Today, he has a realistic plan that will curb greenhouse gas emissions. A plan that will help grow our economy and protect our environment." With images such as a newspaper headline that says "McCain climate views clash with GOP," the ad portrays McCain as an independent voice on climate change. Indeed, the Congressional Record shows that McCain spoke up about global warming in January 2003. And as chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, he held hearings on the issue several years before that. On Jan. 9, 2003, McCain and Sen. Joe Liberman introduced the Lieberman-McCain Climate Stewardship Act, which sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by capping them and allowing companies and utilities to sell or trade their emission rights. When he introduced the bill, McCain called it "the first comprehensive piece of legislation" in capping emissions. "The U.S. is responsible for 25 percent of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions," he said. "It is time for the U.S. government to do its part to address this global problem, and legislation on mandatory reductions is the form of leadership that is required to address this global problem." By contrast, the Bush administration has opposed cap-and-trade programs and preferred voluntary efforts on climate change. Manik Roy, director of congressional affairs for the Pew Center on Global Climate Change, said McCain had actually been working on the climate change bill in 2001, but it got delayed after the 9/11 attacks. The Lieberman-McCain bill ultimately failed in October 2003 by a 43-55 vote, but Roy said it was a key step in "educating the Senate" about how government could respond to global warming. "It is absolutely correct that McCain stood up on this issue, forced the Senate to focus on this issue when nobody else thought it made sense and did it with strong opposition from the White House," Roy said. He called McCain "a huge leader on this issue in the Senate." And so we find McCain's statement to be True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-06-17T00:00:00	2008-06-17	['None']
pomt-06817	"Two elections in a row (Waukesha County Clerk Kathy Nickolaus) has screwed up counting the vote"	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/11/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/democratic-party-wisconsin-chairman-mike-tate-says/	On the brink of falling one victory short of taking back the state Senate, state Democratic Party Chairman Mike Tate blamed a familiar punching bag late on election night. Tate lashed out at Waukesha County Clerk Kathy Nickolaus, whose April 2011 failure to include an entire municipality’s unofficial vote count in the Supreme Court contest for more than a day led Democrats to falsely believe their preferred candidate, JoAnne Kloppenburg, had won. This time around, there was no such delay, but partial election-night returns from one community in the county were among the last reported. Those figures from Menomonee Falls, a GOP stronghold, would ultimately reverse the early "lead" in unofficial returns that recall challenger state Rep. Sandy Pasch (D-Whitefish Bay) had over state Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills). While the Menomonee Falls totals were still out, Tate told a WISN-TV interviewer on Aug. 9, 2011 that "this is an election that Sandy Pasch has won" and that Nickolaus "at worst is conducting criminal voter fraud" amid some "very questionable activities." He didn’t stop there. "Look, this should be a concern shared by everybody who lives in Waukesha County," Tate said. "Two elections in a row she has screwed up counting the vote. Regardless if you are a Republican or a Democrat you should know that your vote is going to count." Those are, to say the least, pretty strong statements. But they weren’t just off-the-cuff remarks in the midst of a live interview. The party immediately issued a news release (Headline: "Waukesha County Tampering") charging that Nickolaus "is once more tampering with the results of a consequential election and in the next hours we will determine our next course of action. For now, Wisconsin should know that a dark cloud hangs over these important results." Let’s pause this tape and look at the process. Given the party’s continued criticism, we thought it was important to see if Nickolaus, as Tate claimed, "screwed up counting the vote" for the second time in a row. We asked Tate what evidence he had to back his claim of tampering with the election. He said suspicions were raised because the Waukesha vote totals were among the last to come in statewide on a night with six Senate recall elections. (Democrats unseated two GOP incumbents, falling one shy of regaining control of the Senate). The most important word in his claim is the "counting" part. County clerks such as Nickolaus don’t count any ballots on election night. That’s up to the municipal clerks who supervise polls in their community. County clerks receive reports from municipalities, which send in their unofficial returns on election night. They are double-checked later later when they are certified by the county’s Board of Canvassers. (In the April election, Nickolaus posted one final number for the county, not municipality-by-municipality numbers, which helped conceal the missing community for days. A recount confirmed Justice David Prosser won by about 7,000 votes. Since then, Nickolaus has been posting community-by-community numbers as they come in, as she did during the Aug. 9 election) Two Waukesha County communities are in the 8th Senate District: Butler and Menomonee Falls. Butler sent in totals within 35 minutes of close of polls at 8 p.m., and those were posted early in the evening. But Menomonee Falls Clerk Janice Moyer told us that heavy turnout there prevented tabulation of absentee ballots in some cases until after polls closed. "It takes time, and we want them to do it correctly," Moyer said of poll workers. Nickolaus did not get most of the Menomonee Falls count until 10:36 p.m., according to Moyer. Nickolaus said results were posted on the county’s web site by 10:47 p.m. The last batch came in an hour later, and Nickolaus said she posted them within six minutes. So the gap in reporting Waukesha County results was not due to Nickolaus, who posts and tallies the totals but does not count the votes. What’s more, a staggered flow of returns is common on election nights, as each community finishes its count. Other communities were still out when Tate made his statement, including on turf that Pasch won in Brown Deer in Milwaukee County. And even in the races Democrats won, all precincts had not yet reported when victory was declared. What about Tate’s contention of a "second time" Nickolaus messed up a vote count? Nickolaus admitted a mistake in the Supreme Court race, but investigators found no vote-tampering. She failed to include Brookfield in the total she released that night, but that error was not related to counting the votes -- just reporting the totals she received from locals. It looked suspicious, and caused a firestorm. But it involved the unofficial count only and did not affect the official vote count released days after that election. In the state Senate race, as the realization settled in early Wednesday morning that Darling would win with 54 percent of the vote, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin issued a retraction of sorts that it "would not pursue questions of irregularities." But it threw fuel on the fire about the results, contending -- erroneously -- that the race was a "virtual tie." And in a day-after media conference call, Tate again criticized Nickolaus, saying she had arguably been "sitting on these results." In that call, Tate responded to a questioner who asked if he felt he had defamed Nickolaus. Tate responded that he has said a lot of things in his two years as party chairman. He added: "If that’s what’s going to be called defamatory, I guess I’m willing to stand by that." So, we’ll return to the original remarks as well. In claiming Nickolaus "screwed up counting the vote" for the second election in a row, Tate offered no proof that the numbers that eventually came in were off. Nor did he offer proof she was "sitting on" votes -- much less "tampering" or "conducting criminal voter fraud" on election night. This claim is inaccurate and, in the "heat of the moment" as he put it, Tate made a ridiculous claim. In this case, where there’s heat, there’s fire: Pants on Fire.

pomt-02004	"We came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/10/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-she-and-bill-were-dead-broke/	Hillary Clinton is walking the line between being remarkably successful and yet still in touch with the lives of ordinary people. The former secretary of state and potential 2016 presidential candidate has found herself trying to limit blowback to her claim that she and husband Bill were "dead broke" when they left the White House. She made the comment during an interview with ABC’s Diane Sawyer. Sawyer pressed Clinton on a reported haul of $5 million in speaking fees. "You have no reason to remember, but we came out of the White House not only dead broke, but in debt," Clinton said. "We had no money when we got there, and we struggled to piece together the resources for mortgages for houses, for Chelsea's education. It was not easy. Bill has worked really hard. And it's been amazing to me. He's worked very hard." Republicans called the claim laughable and the next day Clinton clarified, again on ABC, that she and Bill had done very well over the past 14 years. "We have a life experience that is clearly different in very dramatic ways from many Americans," Clinton said. "But we also have gone through some of the same challenges many people have." We wanted to take a closer look at Clinton’s claim of being "dead broke" when their time in the White House ended after December 2000. The Clintons’ balance sheet Clinton’s 2000 Senate financial disclosure form, via the Open Secrets website, provides a rough view of the balance between the couple’s assets and liabilities. These forms only show amounts in broad ranges -- from $15,001 to $50,000, from $50,001 to $100,000 and so forth -- but under any set of assumptions, the Clintons were in the red, a problem driven by Bill Clinton’s enormous legal bills. Their highest possible assets totaled about $1.8 million, while their lowest possible debts were nearly $2.3 million. The most optimistic scenario left them in a hole of about $500,000. But the federal disclosure form does not include homes used for personal use and the Clintons owned two. In 1999, they bought a five-bedroom home in Chappaqua, N.Y., for $1.7 million. In December 2000, just as they were leaving the White House, they bought a seven-bedroom house near Embassy Row in Washington, D.C. The price was $2.85 million. While those homes had mortgages, which would increase the amount of the Clintons' debt, the family also had equity in them. The New York Times reported that the Clintons put $855,000 down on the Washington house, for instance. That equity would have covered the low-end debt estimate of about $500,000. Point being: Clinton’s 2000 disclosure doesn’t prove the Clintons’ liabilities exceeded their assets when they left the White House. We reached out to Hillary Clinton’s office for more details and did not hear back. Were they dead broke? All this begs the question of whether someone who can afford to buy a $2.85 million house is "dead broke." We reached two accounting professors at Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business, one of the top-ranked schools in the country. Assistant Professor Jeffrey Hoopes said to call the Clintons dead broke would be a stretch for how the term is commonly understood. "Almost any president leaving office can expect tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars of future earnings as a result of their having been president," Hoopes said. "Speaking, consulting, board positions, and so on, are all very lucrative." Professor Brian Mittendorf said a balance sheet of assets and liabilities simply doesn’t paint a complete picture. Mittendorf compared the Clintons to a medical school graduate saddled with huge debts but with the prospect of a very hefty income down the line. "While one can claim to be technically broke, creditors wouldn't take it as such as long as future income streams could cover the liabilities," Mittendorf said. In December 2000, at least one large bank saw the Clintons through that lens. Whatever their balance sheet might have been, Citibank lent them $1.995 million to buy that house in Washington, D.C. This was a safe loan. By Feb. 5, 2001, Bill Clinton was commanding regular speaking fees of $125,000 or more. Hillary Clinton herself did quite well in 2001. The book publisher Simon and Schuster paid her $2.84 million in royalties. By 2004, the Clintons had erased their debts and Hillary Clinton was ranked the 10th-wealthiest member of the Senate, with a net worth between $10 million and $50 million. Our ruling Hillary Clinton said she and Bill were in debt and dead broke when they left the White House. The public record shows that they possibly had more liabilities than assets, but it doesn’t show that conclusively. More important, a balance sheet does not tell the full story and the experts we reached said the Clintons’ earning potential had a real economic value that the financial sector traditionally acknowledges and is willing to bank on. A few weeks before they left the White House, the Clintons were able to muster a cash down payment of $855,000 and secure a $1.995 million mortgage. This hardly fits the common meaning of "dead broke." We rate the claim Mostly False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2014-06-10T18:18:14	2014-06-09	['White_House']

pomt-02282	Gov. McAuliffe's budget would "raid school, other $$ 4 Obamacare in VA."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2014/apr/06/republican-party-virginia/virginia-gop-says-mcauliffe-budget-would-raid-scho/	The Republican Party of Virginia says Gov. Terry McAuliffe is planning to help fund Medicaid expansion in Virginia by taking money from education and other state services. A March 26 tweet on the RPV website said, "@TerryMcAuliffe Not only did the GOP read your budget, we found the part where you were going to raid school, other $$ 4 Obamacare in VA.," We wondered whether the governor’s Medicaid plan really calls for such a diversion of funds. McAuliffe, a Democrat, has been urging the General Assembly to expand eligibility in the state’s Medicaid program to an additional 400,000 low-income and disabled Virginians. Under provisions of the Affordable Care Act, also called Obamacare, the federal government would pay the entire expansion cost for the next three years and 90 percent of it down the road. The Republican-led House of Delegates has twice refused to broaden the program, saying the federal government can’t be trusted to pay its promised share. A stalemate between the House and the Democratic-controlled Senate is delaying passage of a two-year state budget. We asked Garren Shipley, the state GOP’s communications director, for evidence that McAuliffe plans to "raid" education and other services to pay for Obamacare. Shipley referred us to a paragraph in the thick budget plan released by the governor last month. On Page 516, it says, "The Director of the Department of Planning and Budget is hereby authorized to transfer appropriations among agencies and programs as needed so as to implement coverage for newly eligible individuals pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1396d(y)(1)[2010] of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act." That sequence of numbers, letters and parentheses in the paragraph refer to the section of U.S. law that spells out Uncle Sam’s obligations for paying most of long-term costs for Medicaid expansion. Shipley said the paragraph allows the administration to move money from any agency or department to fund Medicaid expansion. Shipley said if McAuliffe "intended" to do otherwise, the language would not be in his budget plan. But Brian Coy, a spokesman for McAuliffe, called the claim "an absurd allegation on its face." "That language is there for a very discrete purpose," he said. "It will allow the Department of Planning and Budget to distribute money that would come into the Commonwealth for closing the coverage gap for Medicaid expansion." If Virginia broadens eligibility, the new federal funds would flow into the Department of Medical Assistance Services, which runs the state’s Medicaid program. But to fully benefit from the expansion, DMAS would need to transfer some of the money to other state departments -- something is not empowered to do. Under expansion, for example, Medicaid would cover the treatment of inmates that needed to stay in non-prison hospitals for more than 24 hours. Funds would need to be shifted from DMAS to the Department of Correctional Services. The conduit for that transfer would be the Department of Planning and Budget. Expansion also would broaden Medicaid services for mental health and substance abuse. That would require money to be shifted from DMAS to the Department of Behavioral Health. Again, the Department of Planning and Budget would be the pipeline. Secretary of Finance Ric Brown said that because the transfer language sits in a section of the budget dealing with Medicaid expansion, the administration believes it applies only to those limited uses. But Brown added that wording of the provision could be improved. "The language could be tightened down," he said. "It could be tweaked to make sure it’s specific." We sought an opinion on the provision from retired state Sen. John Chichester, a former chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Chichester, a Republican who crossed party lines last fall and endorsed McAuliffe for governor, said the amendment would give the administration power to take money from other areas of the budget for Medicaid. But he questioned whether such a policy would be wise. Coy said such an effort would be unwise. He noted that the governor’s budget uses $225 million in expected savings from Medicaid expansion to fund pay raises for state employees and teachers, boost the Virginia Retirement System and increase benefits to workers who face hazardous duty. "The budget is taking the savings from Medicaid money and puts it into programs," Coy said. "We’re not going to then pull money from those programs into Medicaid." Our ruling The state Republican Party tweeted that within McAuliffe’s budget, "we found the part where you were going to raid school, other $$ 4 Obamacare in VA." McAuliffe invited some concern by submitting a budget amendment that can be interpreted as giving him authority to transfer money in and out of Medicaid from other state programs. The governor disputes that the provision gives him such power. In any case, "can" does not mean "will." The GOP goes overboard in saying McAuliffe is "going to raid" schools and other state programs to help pay for Medicaid expansion -- an endeavor that almost entirely would be supported by federal funds. The Republicans offer no proof that this is McAuliffe’s plan. In making the sensational claim, the GOP ignores that the governor has proposed using savings from Medicaid expansion to bolster other state programs, including education. So the GOP tweet has a grain of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give people a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-01602	"If black America were a country, it’d be the 15th wealthiest nation in the world."	false	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/02/larry-elder/larry-elder-if-black-america-were-country-itd-be-1/	Conservative commentator Larry Elder and liberal CNN contributor Marc Lamont Hill got into a heated argument recently after while discussing the situation in Ferguson, Mo. Elder accused the media of exaggerating American racism for political ends. "As long as black people believe that race and racism are the major problem in America, you’ve got that 95 percent monolithic black vote without which the Democratic party cannot survive," Elder said. Elder used his father’s rise from janitor to small business owner as an example of what he called the "thriving black middle class." "This is what happens in America," Elder said. "If black America were a country, it would be the 15th wealthiest country in the world. For crying out loud, this is not our grandfather’s America, and we ought not act like it is." Fifteenth wealthiest, out of 196 countries, sounds impressive and worth checking out. Buying power of African-Americans Elder referred us to an annual report by Target Market News called "The Buying Power of Black America," which publishes the only estimate we could find of the total earned income of African-Americans. In 2011, the report he provided us, Target Market News put the income spent by African-Americans at $836 billion. Elder got his talking point by comparing that figure to the World Bank’s list of each country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP), which is the monetary value of all the finished goods and services produced. In 2011, "black America's" $836 billion would have put it in 16th, above Indonesia and below South Korea. (The Target Market News report is behind a paywall, so we can’t see precisely how they reached their figure. We asked if Target Market News would provide us a copy, but we didn't hear back.) Target Market News hasn’t published another estimate on African-American’s earned income since 2011, but a 2013 report by the Selig Center for Economic Growth pegs their contribution to the market at $1 trillion. That would also rank 16th -- above Indonesia and below Mexico. Case closed? Not really. Experts told us that there are two major problems with Elder’s methodology. Earned income vs. GDP First, earned income and GDP aren't quite the same thing. Comparing them isn’t fair, said NYU economics professor Gian Luca Clementi, "because GDP is a concept that applies to a jurisdiction, not a group of people living in a jurisdiction." GDP is "a measure of the total income produced in a country," Clementi said, and factors like government expenditure and private investment mean that buying power and GDP aren't comparable. Second, Clementi said, "a country's total GDP only gives a measure of the total income produced in the country. Anyone having the ambition of using GDP as a measure of average economic well-being, should start dividing by the number of residents." Clementi used China as an example to better explain. While China has the world's second-highest GDP, "its inhabitants are still a lot poorer than any Western country’s residents." We took Clementi's suggestion and divided the most recent estimate of black earned income, $1 trillion, by the Census Bureau estimate of 44.5 million African-Americans. That would create a per capita buying power of around $23,000 a year, which would translate to around 34th around the world on the International Monetary Fund’s list of countries by GDP per capita (between the Bahamas and Malta). But $23,000 doesn’t go as far in the United States as, say, in Lithuania. Economists multiply GDP per capita by a conversion factor called purchasing power parity to account for the different values of goods and services in different countries. If you apply these factors, the African-American population’s $23,000 a year ranks 44th (between Portugal and Lithuania). The United States as a whole, for comparison, ranks seventh. Our ruling Arguing that racism is "not a major problem," Elder said that "if black America were a country, it would be the 15th wealthiest in the world." Elder took an estimate of African-Americans' total earned income ($836 billion in 2011) and looked at how it compared to national GDPs (it was actually 16th). But comparing earned income for a group of people to national GDPs isn’t a sound methodology, experts told us. The comparison falls more off the rails when you look at things on a per capita basis. In that scenario, black America’s buying power would rank around 44th when compared to countries’ per capita GDPs. We rate his claim False. Correction: Elder said racism was not a "major" problem. An earlier version of this fact-check omitted the word major.	None	Larry Elder	None	None	None	2014-09-02T14:03:08	2014-08-20	['United_States']

pomt-15225	"A majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty ... I have never supported amnesty."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/aug/07/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-most-gop-candidates-have-supported-amnest/	Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, has a more aggressive stance on illegal immigration than the majority of his 2016 primary competitors, Cruz said at a primetime Republican debate Aug. 6. "A majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty," he said. "I have never supported amnesty, and I led the fight against Chuck Schumer’s gang of eight amnesty legislation in the Senate." (Schumer is U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y.) Of the 10 candidates on the stage, how many of them have supported "amnesty" for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants currently in the United States? The tough part about this fact-check is that "amnesty" is a vague term; some consider amnesty to be anything less than deporting all illegal immigrants, while others think of amnesty as letting immigrants stay with no punishment or additional requirements. We asked Cruz’s campaign staff how he would define "amnesty," but they didn’t answer that question. Cruz himself has been adamantly opposed to a pathway to citizenship, but he’s been quiet on whether he would support some other legal status for illegal immigrants. We’ve previously found that in modern politics, the standard for amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, supported and signed by President Ronald Reagan. The law allowed illegal immigrants to become legal permanent residents if they met certain standards, such as proving they had been in the country for several years and paying back taxes and a fine. After meeting other requirements, the legal permanent residents could apply for a green card and eventually make their way toward citizenship. The law was widely described as an amnesty program. We do know Cruz considered the 2013 bipartisan Senate immigration proposal to be a form of amnesty and opposed the bill. The failed bill was similar to the Reagan law in that immigrants had to meet certain requirements before gaining legal status that put them on a path to citizenship, though the requirements are more stringent than the previous law. So we’ll use that bill as a rough standard for evaluating the positions of those who shared the debate stage with Cruz. Three debaters have expressed outright support for the Gang of Eight bill, so called after the bipartisan group of eight senators who proposed it in 2013. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., by Cruz’s standards, has been a clear supporter of amnesty, as he was a member of the Gang of Eight. At the time, he said the bill was "not amnesty," and we rated that claim Half True because of the vague nature of the term "amnesty." Since then, Rubio has softened his support for a path to citizenship and emphasized border security, but he still supports passing immigration legislation. Fellow Floridian Jeb Bush, the former governor, said in March 2015 that he would put his support behind a Gang of Eight-style immigration bill that included a path to citizenship. Like Rubio, though, Bush insisted at the debate that his position is not amnesty, because his ideal plan requires illegal immigrants to meet certain requirements before gaining legal status. Recently, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee has avoided saying whether or not he would support a path to citizenship, though he has suggested he would not blanket deport all illegal immigrants. But in 2013, asked by Fox if he would side with Cruz or the Gang of Eight, Huckabee said he would choose the latter -- though he emphasized an eventual immigration bill had to emphasize border security. He has also previously endorsed a path to citizenship. We could find only one of the candidates at the Aug. 6 debate (other than Cruz) who said he did not support this bill specifically. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., did not support the Gang of Eight bill because he said it did not include strong enough provisions for ensuring less illegal immigration in the future. But in a March 2015 speech, Paul walked a fine line -- supporting a path to some sort of normative legal status, but he did not use the word "citizenship." For the remaining four candidates, we could not find their opinions on the Gang of Eight bill specifically, but all four have at some point supported a path to citizenship or legal status, even if their position has since changed. While Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker no longer supports a path to citizenship, he said in 2013 that "it makes sense" people could not only stay in the United States but get citizenship after overcoming penalties, waiting periods and other requirements. Neurosurgeon Ben Carson has declined to comment on the Gang of Eight bill. He has said that the solution for illegal immigrants currently in the United States is for them to go back to their home country, where they can apply for a visa and return legally. In Carson’s 2012 book, America the Beautiful, he said a path to citizenship is a moral choice. In 2010, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said he supported a "commonsense path to citizenship." But this year, he said he’s changed his mind and no longer supports such a path. Ohio Gov. John Kasich said in 2014 and 2015 that he isn’t keen on a path to citizenship, but he’s open to the possibility -- especially because you can’t deport everyone who is already here, and it would help get lawmakers to a point of compromise on immigration legislation. Despite his fiery rhetoric regarding Mexican immigrants, real estate mogul Donald Trump hasn’t said many specifics about what he’d do regarding the illegal immigrants already here. He has said this year that he would support a "merit-based" system for some illegal immigrants earning their right to stay, echoing comments he made in 2011. Many of these candidates have changed their position on what to do about the illegal immigrants already in the United States. But as far as we can tell, Cruz is the only one who has never plainly supported something like a path to citizenship or some other form of legal status. Six have expressed outright support for a path to citizenship at some point in their recent political careers. It is worth noting again, however, that the definition of "amnesty" isn’t hard and fast, so what Cruz may consider amnesty might not be what any of these candidates considers to be amnesty. Our ruling Cruz said at a Republican debate, "A majority of the candidates on this stage have supported amnesty," adding, "I have never supported amnesty." All of the candidates at the debate, with Cruz as the exception, have at some point in their recent political careers expressed support for a pathway to citizenship or other legal status for illegal immigrants currently in the United States, somewhat like was proposed in the Gang of Eight bill. Because there is no hard and fast definition for "amnesty," some would argue that this does not necessarily count. However, it is reminiscent of 1986 legislation that was widely considered amnesty. By Cruz’s standards, any path to citizenship is amnesty. We rate Cruz’s claim Mostly True.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2015-08-07T17:10:35	2015-08-06	['None']

pomt-08835	McCain opposed the border fence.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/11/jd-hayworth/hayworth-claims-mccain-opposed-border-fence/	As the U.S. Senate race in Arizona heats up, the TV ads are getting more and more brutal. In its latest ad, J.D. Hayworth's campaign attacks Sen. John McCain for alleged opposition to constructing a fence on the U.S.-Mexico border. The ad begins with a narrator announcing that "McCain lies...again." Then, over the course of several slides, it says that "McCain wrote the Amnesty Bill ... opposed the border fence," and supported "Social Security and Medicare benefits for illegals." In this item, we'll be checking the claim that McCain opposed the border fence. The ad cites McCain's vote on an amendment to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations Act of 2007. Introduced by Sen. Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican, it would have provided an additional $1.8 billion to "construct double-layered fencing and vehicle barriers along the southwest border." It also called for offsetting increased funding for the fence "by reducing all other discretionary amounts on a prorata basis." We checked Senate voting records and found that McCain voted against the amendment. He was joined by several other Republican lawmakers, and the amendment was rejected. Still, it is a gross exaggeration to make the leap that voting "nay" on a single amendment translates into opposing the construction of a fence on the border. McCain voted for the final version of the bill signed into law by President George W. Bush on Oct. 4, 2006. "The bill I sign helps us address one of the central issues facing all states, but particularly a state like Arizona, and that's illegal immigration. I understand full well that illegal immigration puts pressure on the public schools and hospitals. It strains state and local budgets. In some communities, it increases crime. The administration and Congress have been taking decisive steps to address this issue," Bush said before signing the bill. According to the president's remarks, the legislation appropriated $1.2 billion for strengthening the border. More specifically, it provided funding for more border fencing, vehicle barriers, and "cutting-edge technology" such as ground-based radar, infrared cameras and advanced sensors. Even more telling, however, is what happened three weeks later. On Oct. 26, 2006, President Bush signed The Secure Fence Act of of 2006. This separate legislation, which had solid Republican support, authorized the construction of a 700-mile, double-layered fence on the U.S.-Mexico border. McCain not only voted for the bill, but the New York Times referred to him as one of the "Republican architects" of the legislation. That's hard to square with the anti-border enforcement candidate that Hayworth's ad describes. (We first learned about the New York Times article, along with a few other sources which we double-checked, from our friends over at FactCheck.org) Why did so many Republicans, including McCain, vote against an amendment to increase funding for the fence construction? According to Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H., who also voted "nay" on the amendment, the extra funding would have been offset with cuts elsewhere in the bill, which would have meant not being able to hire 750 new border-patrol agents. Hayworth's ad claims that McCain opposed the border fence. As "proof," Hayworth cited McCain's vote on an amendment that would have provided increased funding for the construction of a double-layered fence on the U.S.-Mexico border. What the ad conveniently left out, however, is that McCain voted for the final bill, which provided $1.2 billion for strengthening the border. It also ignored McCain's key role in securing the passage of The Secure Fence Act of 2006, which authorized construction of a 700-mile fence on the border. Finally, it neglected to mention that the defeated amendment would have been paid for with cuts from other parts of the 2007 Homeland Security appropriations bill. Republican leaders -- who voted with McCain -- say that adopting the amendment would have resulted in cutbacks in hiring new border patrol agents. The ad is technically right that McCain voted against additional funding at one point. Still, we found that the claim is a gross exaggeration, so we rate it False.	None	J.D.

pomt-00400	Says he was sued by the NRA and the gun lobby "all because in my city we refused to repeal an ordinance which said you couldn’t shoot guns in city parks."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/sep/05/andrew-gillum/fact-checking-andrew-gillums-claim-he-was-sued-nra/	Speaking about recent mass shootings in Florida, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum called for the enforcement of "common sense gun laws" and touted his own fight against the National Rifle Association. "I was literally sued, drug through court for two years by the NRA and the gun lobby, all because in my city we refused to repeal an ordinance which said you couldn’t shoot guns in city parks," Gillum, Tallahassee’s mayor, said in an Aug. 29 interview on MSNBC’s The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell. Gillum is competing against Ron DeSantis, a pro-Trump Republican congressman, in the race to become Florida’s next governor. The election is Nov. 6. Gillum is right — he and other Tallahassee elected officials were sued because they did not repeal an ordinance prohibiting the discharge of firearms in public parks. But he left out some context. The NRA supported the lawsuit filed by gun rights advocates, but it was not a party to it. Courts allowed the ordinance to remain on the books, since a 1987 state law effectively declared it "null and void" and the ordinance wasn’t being enforced. Background on Tallahassee ordinances, lawsuit Two groups advocating for gun rights, Florida Carry, Inc. and the Second Amendment Foundation, filed a lawsuit in May 2014 against the city of Tallahassee, then-Mayor John Marks and several city commissioners, including Gillum, who served on the commission at the time. (He was sworn in as mayor November 2014.) The NRA did not sue. But it filed an amicus brief supporting Florida Carry and the Second Amendment Foundation. "Mayor Gillum knows the NRA is not suing him, but he also knows he wouldn’t get much attention by crying out that a small Florida group and another from Bellevue, Washington, have taken him to court," Marion P. Hammer, former NRA president wrote in an opinion piece published by the Tallahassee Democrat in January 2017. Second Amendment Foundation and Florida Carry said they were suing Tallahassee and its elected officials for "refusing to repeal ordinances restricting the use of firearms in defiance of Florida’s firearms preemption law." The lawsuit claimed that the ordinances (one from 1957 and another from 1984, amended in 1988) had been reprinted without being amended, and infringed on the Florida Legislature’s intent to provide uniform firearm laws across the state. A 1987 Florida law gave the state the exclusive power to regulate firearms and ammunition, and deemed "null and void" related local ordinances and regulations. The legislature in 2011 doubled down on the law by allowing penalties against local officials who enacted or enforced firearm regulations. The 1957 provision said, "No person shall discharge any firearms except in areas five acres or larger zoned for agricultural uses." The ordinance amended in 1988 made it "unlawful for any person to discharge a firearm in a park or recreational facility owned, managed, maintained, or controlled by the city," the lawsuit said. It added that Gillum and other commissioners in February 2014 voted in favor of indefinitely tabling a repeal discussion. The city of Tallahassee, in a filing to dismiss the lawsuit, argued that Florida Carry and the Second Amendment Foundation had "no clear legal right to compel" city commissioners to repeal the ordinances and that since the legislature had rendered the ordinances invalid, "nothing else is required." Nonetheless, the case moved forward. A circuit court judge, George S. Reynolds, III, ultimately sided with the city, saying that the city’s actions did not enact or cause the ordinances to be enforced. "While cleaning up the city code so that old city ordinances which are no longer legal, relevant, or enforced are removed may be good public policy, it remains the city’s prerogative – not the plaintiffs, nor this court’s," Reynolds wrote in his November 2015 opinion. The groups appealed to the Florida 1st District Court of Appeal. But the appeals court in February 2017 also ruled in favor of the city. While the ordinances "may still be ‘on the books,’ they are unenforceable and invalid," the court’s opinion said. Our ruling Gillum said that he was sued by the NRA and the gun lobby "all because in my city we refused to repeal an ordinance which said you couldn’t shoot guns in city parks." Gillum was among Tallahassee elected officials sued by two gun rights groups for not repealing a decades-old ordinance restricting the use of firearms in city parks. The local ordinance had been deemed null and void by a state law and not been enforced. The NRA supported the groups and filed an amicus brief, but it was not a formal party in the litigation. Other gun rights groups were the plaintiffs. Gillum’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-15215	Scott Walker "had a 2.3 GPA when he was asked to leave Marquette University for cheating."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/aug/11/facebook-posts/scott-walker-was-asked-leave-marquette-university-/	A reader asked us the other day to check a meme attack on Gov. Scott Walker that keeps making the rounds. She saw it on Facebook. The image in the meme, which apparently began circulating in early 2012, puts a dunce cap on Walker's head. It makes a reference to what would be the failed effort, later that year, to recall the Wisconsin Republican from office. Perhaps because Walker is now running for president, the meme has surfaced again. It said: "Walker had a 2.3 GPA when he was asked to leave Marquette University for cheating. Is it any wonder he’s attacking teachers now?" There is no indication on the meme itself of who produced it. Walker has denied being forced out of school. When we asked about the meme, his campaign responded by referring us to a brief comment he made Aug. 8, 2015 at the conservative RedState Gathering in Atlanta. Asked about lacking a college degree, Walker said: "It's simple. My senior year of college, I got a job offer from the American Red Cross. A lot of my friends who were a year or two older had degrees and no job. I had a job offer, no degree. I'm pretty smart. I took the job." As we'll see, Walker was a senior when he left for the Red Cross. And although Walker has refused requests to release his college transcripts, there isn't evidence to back the claims in the attack. College days examined Here's what we know about the governor's college days from a widely noted piece we published in December 2013: In February 1988, as a sophomore at Marquette, a Catholic university in Milwaukee, Walker entered a campaign for student government president. The day before the election, the student-produced Marquette Tribune endorsed Walker's opponent, liberal John Quigley, but said Walker was qualified. A controversy ensued. Students told the Quigley campaign they’d seen Walker workers and/or College Republicans emptying editions of the Tribune from racks in high-traffic buildings on campus. The newspaper responded with an election-day editorial headlined, "Walker unfit." It decried his "mudslinging" and said another factor in its reversal on Walker being qualified was the alleged theft of papers, which Walker’s camp denied. Quigley won handily. Administrators investigated. But we found no paper trail, and could not learn from interviews, what came of that investigation, if anything. For our December 2013 article and at Walker's request, Marquette issued a statement saying Walker "was a student at Marquette from fall of 1986 until spring 1990 and was a senior in good standing when he voluntarily withdrew." That meant that no conduct issues, academic or otherwise, blocked Walker from continuing in school at the time of his departure. The university also said Walker was in good standing each term while he was enrolled at Marquette as well as when he left, and that he "was not expelled or suspended from the university at any time." In February 1990, shortly before dropping out, Walker took a job in marketing and fundraising with the local chapter of the American Red Cross. It's also possible he was lured from school by politics. In fall 1990, while still living in the campus area, Walker ran against then-state Rep. Gwen Moore, a Democrat now in Congress, and lost. Two final notes: 1. In a separate item, also published in December 2013, we rated False a claim by the Wisconsin Democratic Party that Walker dropped out or was kicked out of college "not long after" he was "kicked out of student elections" at Marquette. After the original article was published, the Democratic Party removed the accusation from its website. 2. As for his grade point average, Walker’s gubernatorial campaign said in 2010 that he had a 2.59 (on a 4.0 scale), about three-tenths of one point higher than the meme claims. But we don't know for sure, because he has refused to release his transcripts. Indeed, when Walker said in February 2015 at the Conservative Political Action Conference that he had "unsealed" his college records, we rated his claim False. He had authorized Marquette to issue the statements we noted, but he has not released his transcripts. Our rating An Internet meme says Walker "had a 2.3 GPA when he was asked to leave Marquette University for cheating." Walker left school as a senior for a job with the Red Cross, but has not released his transcripts, which has left some to question the move. There is no evidence, however, to prove the grade point average, "was asked to leave" or the cheating parts of the claim. We rate it False.

pomt-04077	Says a recent study shows Florida students are second in the world in fourth grade reading, behind Singapore.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/jan/21/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-florida-fourth-graders-are-worlds-/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott wants to operate every facet of state government like a business. Monitor spending. Measure performance outcomes. Compare results to competitors. His vision for the state’s education system isn’t all that different. "I like measurement," Scott said during a Jan. 15, 2013, discussion with black lawmakers. "One positive, as you know: In the fourth grade reading, we're second to Singapore in the world, Florida students were. In math, we're above the international average. So there's some good things happening." His claim that Florida fourth graders are oh-so-close to being the world’s best readers piqued our interest. Right away, we found his source: results from the latest Progress in International Reading Literacy Study. The study is coordinated by the International Association for the Evaluation of Educational Achievement and completed every five years since 2001. It examines reading achievement and habits of American fourth graders and their peers across the world. In 2011, fourth graders from 53 countries and subnational entities participated. That year, Florida used federal grant money to be evaluated independently of the United States -- the only U.S. "benchmarking" state for the PIRLS exam. Florida paid $1.9 million from a federal Race to the Top grant for this assessment and two other international studies, including the Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS) of fourth and eighth graders. The PIRLS results, released December 2012, surprised state officials. The average score of Florida fourth graders ranked No. 2, above the average for the United States. "Second in the world. To be able to use those words is ... wow," Mary Jane Tappen, a deputy chancellor at the Florida Department of Education, told the Orlando Sentinel. The gaps between reading scores for the highest achieving countries were not statistically significant. Florida’s score was just two points short of No. 1 Hong Kong -- not Singapore, as Scott said. Florida edged out Russia and Finland by one point, and Singapore by two points. Northern Ireland, the U.S., Croatia and Chinese Taipei were in the second highest tier of readers, followed by Ireland and England. That’s not the only way to look at the data. Florida did finish second behind Singapore in terms of the percentage of fourth-grade students scoring in the advanced reading level (24 percent vs. 22 percent). One measure isn’t exactly better than the other, said Martin West, associate professor at Harvard’s Graduate School of Education."These are just slightly different ways of cutting the data and the distribution of achievement in a given system," West said. The results vouch for Florida’s success in improving reading achievement in elementary grades, West said. In 1998, Florida fourth graders were well below the national reading average, but they were performing well above the national average by the late 2000s, he said. "They made considerable progress over the course of that decade," West said. "They’ve sort of held their level over the past couple of years." How important is the ranking? Chad Minnich, an editor at the TIMSS & PIRLS International Study Center at Boston College, warns against considering results based on rank. A more useful takeaway, he said, is to look at the increased number of countries who scored above the test’s high international benchmark, and that Florida did very well among those. Still, we wondered what would have been had other states been evaluated on their own. Florida’s education system has been getting a lot of accolades lately, but it’s still not in the upper echelon of states like Massachusetts, Maryland, Connecticut and New Jersey. Most people consider the annual National Assessment of Education Progress, dubbed "the nation’s report card," to be the best state-by-state measure of state education systems. The exam is given to a sample of fourth, eighth and 12th grade students every two years in reading and math. Florida students typically perform above average on the NAEP. States including Massachusetts, New Jersey, Connecticut and Maryland -- states with vaunted education systems -- are usually top dogs. "It’s certainly the case that based on this data from NAEP, we know that there are at least a handful of states that were they to participate, they would be likely to perform at higher levels than Florida," West said. Our ruling Scott said Florida students are second in the world in fourth grade reading, behind Singapore, and offers a study as evidence. The study backs his claim up, to a point. Florida students finished second in overall reading to Hong Kong, not Singapore. In the percentage of advanced readers, Florida ranked second behind Singapore. But it’s important to note these rankings do not account for every country in the world. Or every state in the United States. In fact, Florida was the only state included in the ranking Scott cited because Florida paid to be included. Scott would have been correct to say Florida finished second in the study, but he stretched the truth a bit when he said Florida ranked second in the world. It would have been more accurate to say Florida ranked second among 53 education systems that were included. We rate Scott’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-05551	Says under the Affordable Care Act, New Jersey’s "new (Medicaid) enrollees won’t qualify for the matching federal funds simply because we added them onto the rolls before 2014."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/apr/08/amy-handlin/affordable-care-act-withholds-federal-matching-fun/	Before being required by the national health care reform, New Jersey expanded Medicaid coverage to certain low-income parents, but according to one assemblywoman, the state is not getting any federal matching funds in return. Assemblywoman Amy Handlin (R-Monmouth) made that claim in an April 4 opinion piece published in the Times of Trenton, criticizing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act enacted in 2010. "The federal government is supposed to match what states spend on new enrollees," Handlin wrote. "I have serious concerns about Washington’s ability to keep a promise, especially because it has already indicated New Jersey’s new enrollees aren’t entitled to federal funds." Handlin later continued: "These new enrollees won’t qualify for the matching federal funds simply because we added them onto the rolls before 2014." The assemblywoman’s claim is largely inaccurate, because the state is still receiving federal matching funds for these parents. But when the reform’s expanded Medicaid eligibility takes effect in January 2014, New Jersey is slated to receive half of the matching rate awarded to some other states. In response to our findings, Handlin said in a statement: "The point is that we are taking a significant hit just for doing the right thing ahead of the federal mandate. The taxpayers in states that waited will get double the federal benefit." Here’s what PolitiFact New Jersey found: On a voluntary basis, New Jersey began providing Medicaid coverage for certain low-income parents in 2000 through its NJ FamilyCare program. Under health care reform, covering that population will be a requirement for all states. Starting in January 2014, states must provide coverage to adults under 65 years old with incomes below 133 percent of the federal poverty level. For instance, an individual with no children would qualify for Medicaid if the person earns less than $14,000 a year. New Jersey currently receives a federal matching rate of 65 percent for that parent population, but since the state began covering this population before enactment of the reform law, the federal match will drop to 50 percent in January 2014, according to state officials. States that did not previously cover parents will be eligible for a 100 percent match to support the expanded coverage -- double what New Jersey would be receiving, officials said. "New Jersey has been in the forefront on expansion of parent coverage and we believe states that were early adopters are being penalized by the Affordable Care Act (ACA)," according to an application submitted by the state in September to the U.S. Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Jennifer Velez, commissioner of the state Department of Human Services, told the Assembly Budget Committee last week that federal officials had denied the state’s request to immediately increase the match to 75 percent, and to 85 percent in 2014. New Jersey officials are now awaiting an answer to their request for a 100 percent match starting in 2014, Velez said. "Once they said no to the 75-85, right, our ask again was, ‘Will you consider our current parents -- at 65 percent match -- will you consider them ‘newly eligible’ in 2014,’ which would be matched at 100 percent, which is what other states will get who haven’t covered their parents," Velez told the committee members. Federal officials said last month a final rule on matching funds "will follow as technical work with States on (Federal Medical Assistance Percentage) methodologies and income conversion continues." Our ruling In an opinion piece in the Times of Trenton, Handlin claimed that federal officials "already indicated New Jersey’s new enrollees aren’t entitled to federal funds" and that "new enrollees won’t qualify for the matching federal funds simply because we added them onto the rolls before 2014." But the issue is not over whether matching funds will be granted, but how much. New Jersey currently receives a 65 percent match for certain low-income parents covered by the NJ FamilyCare program. That match is slated to drop to 50 percent, representing half of the rate to go to some other states. We rate the statement Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-06561	Wisconsin's new state budget includes "a 15 percent increase for road construction and yet we’ve got local towns tearing up" paved roads and replacing them with gravel.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/oct/02/mike-mccabe/campaign-money-critic-mike-mccabe-says-cash-strapp/	Folks aren’t afraid to speak their mind at Fighting Bob Fest, an annual political gathering in Madison, Wis. The event is named for Robert LaFollette, a fighter of corporate power and political corruption who served as governor, congressman and U.S. senator from Wisconsin in the late 1800s and early 1900s. Among those who spoke at the festival on Sept. 17, 2011, was Mike McCabe, executive director of the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks money in state politics and advocates for campaign finance reform. The nonprofit Madison group is affiliated with left-leaning organizations such as public employee unions. During one portion of McCabe’s fiery, 22-minute speech, it wasn’t a question of whether he made a statement worth fact checking, but which one to look at. In rapid-fire approach, he likened campaign contributions to legalized bribery; called the state’s new voter photo ID law a "poll tax"; and branded as "protection money" campaign contributions from David Koch to the Republican Governors Association and from the RGA to GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. McCabe also made a factual claim that was, if less explosive, still intriguing. The state’s 2011-2013 budget, he said, includes a "15 percent increase for road construction and yet we’ve got local towns tearing up pavement and putting down gravel because the money is steered to private contractors instead, not to the local road crews that work for the townships and for the county." Towns tearing up paved roads and turning them into gravel? McCabe’s statement -- which was picked up by the liberal Daily Kos, a national website that does political analysis -- includes two pieces, the increase and the shift to gravel roads: 15 percent highway increase McCabe cited a document produced by Walker’s office on his 2011-2013 budget proposal. It shows that Walker proposed increasing spending on state highways by $410.5 million, or 14.7 percent, "over base amounts." And he pointed out that state money spent on highways goes to private contractors as opposed to local governments. That figure, however, shows just one piece of a much larger pie. The full pie includes not only general tax money -- the "base amounts" -- but also cash the state borrows for highway improvements. Department of Transportation budget director Paul Hammer cited a different DOT document that was also provided to us by Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie. It shows the 2011-2013 budget spends $3.23 billion on highways. That is actually less than what was spent in the previous budget, under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, which was $3.27 billion -- although that figure included $91 million in one-time federal stimulus funds. So, McCabe cited a figure that the Walker administration used to suggest it was increasing spending on highways. But the total highway spending isn’t a 15 percent increase, but actually a decrease, so McCabe’s first claim is wrong. Converting paved roads to gravel In telling his audience "we’ve got towns tearing up pavement and putting down gravel," McCabe waved a copy of the Sept. 8, 2011, edition of Isthmus, a weekly Madison newspaper. It carried an article about state budget cuts to villages in the Madison-area. McCabe cited a portion of the article about Rick Stadelman, executive director of the Wisconsin Towns Association, which said: "Stadelman says he knows of several townships with blacktop roads in need of repair that have opted to dig out the blacktop and go back to gravel." We asked Stadelman which towns were converting paved roads to gravel. Noting that 40 percent of Wisconsin’s 62,000 miles of town roads already are gravel, he said he has heard towns talking about doing such conversions, but could recall only one that had: Mukwa in Waupaca County in east-central Wisconsin. You can probably see where this road is leading. Jim Curns, Mukwa’s town chairman, told us the town did convert a quarter-mile section of one little-used road from blacktop to gravel. But not as a result of Walker’s budget. He said it was done three to five years ago -- while Doyle was governor -- because the town couldn’t afford to repave it. To see whether other communities are converting paved roads to gravel, we checked with Dan Thompson, executive director of the League of Wisconsin Municipalities, and John Reinemann, the Wisconsin Counties Association’s legislative director. Both said they heard of isolated cases in recent years in which towns converted small sections of roads to gravel, but saw no evidence of a trend and nothing related to the 2011-2013 state budget. We looked some more and found that the Town of Saukville in suburban Milwaukee and the Town of Verona in suburban Madison are considering converting paved roads to gravel. But they haven’t done any yet. On that score, Wisconsin appears different than some of its neighbors. The Wall Street Journal reported in July 2010 that paved roads were being torn up across rural America and "replaced with gravel or other rough surfaces as counties struggle with tight budgets and dwindling state and federal revenue." And in March 2011, the Minneapolis Star Tribune described how financial issues led Michigan to change more than 100 miles of paved road to gravel and that an estimated 120 miles of pavement have been ground up or left to crumble back to gravel in North Dakota. Larry Galehouse, director of Michigan State University’s National Center for Pavement Preservation, which advocates for maintaining highways in order to reduce the need for reconstruction, told us: "This trend has been happening in many states, but primarily on very low volume roads and streets." He had no examples of roads being converted to gravel in Wisconsin. Our conclusion McCabe claimed the state budget includes a "15 percent increase for road construction and yet we’ve got local towns tearing up pavement and putting down gravel because the money is steered to private contractors instead." McCabe relied on a budget proposal document that didn’t spell out the full amounts spent on highways. State spending on highways in the new budget is actually down slightly from the previous one. McCabe also relied on a statement by a towns association official who could cite only one example of a paved road being converted to gravel -- and that occurred years before Walker was elected governor. The other experts we consulted said there is no trend in communities tearing up pavement and putting gravel in its place. We rate McCabe’s statement False.

pomt-07525	A government shutdown "could disrupt ... veterans' benefits."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/06/debbie-stabenow/debbie-stabenow-says-government-shutdown-could-dis/	With a possible government shutdown looming, Sen. Debbie Stabenow, D-Mich., is backing legislation that would make sure the paychecks for members of Congress stop along with everything else. Although similar measures have been proposed, so far congressional paychecks are still intact. We addressed this proposal more generally in a separate item. But for this item, we were more interested in checking one of the arguments Stabenow made as she argued for the bill’s passage. "Lawmakers need to be held accountable and should feel the impact of a government shutdown just like many other Americans will," Stabenow said in a March 1, 2011, news release. "A shutdown could disrupt Social Security checks, veterans' benefits, hold up exports and cost private sector jobs and will stop paychecks for hundreds of thousands of people. It's only fair that members of Congress' paychecks be stopped too." You can read our analysis of whether a shutdown would endanger Social Security checks in our rating of a statement by President Barack Obama here. In this item, we’ll look what could happen to veterans’ benefits. First, some background about the laws that govern shutdowns, from a recent briefing paper by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. The Constitution (Article I, Sec. 9) says, "No Money shall be drawn from the Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations made by Law." This is reinforced by the Antideficiency Act, which stems from an 1870 law and which has been revised significantly over the years. That act prohibits federal officials from spending money before an appropriations measure has been enacted, though exceptions exist for "emergencies involving the safety of human life or the protection of property." The biggest risk for veterans benefit checks comes from the fact that employees of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs are paid through appropriated funds. So a shutdown could prevent those employees -- just like employees of the Social Security Administration -- from going to work. How many VA employees would be considered "essential" -- and thus would stay on the job during a shutdown -- and how many would not remains to be seen. Many VA employees are doctors and nurses at VA hospitals and are unlikely to be furloughed. This situation for benefits employees is not yet clear. As a practical matter, the department has a bit of a cushion. Veterans’ benefit checks go out at the beginning of every month, so if a shutdown starts April 8 -- as would happen if lawmakers cannot agree on a deal -- there wouldn’t be widespread problems for existing beneficiaries for a few weeks. However, if a new month dawned with the government still on hiatus, a new round of checks could indeed be delayed, depending on which employees are deemed "essential." "If it goes beyond the first of the next month, you may see disruptions there," said David Autry, a spokesman for Disabled American Veterans. Checks for veterans from the Defense Department would be subject to the same types of uncertainties as those sent by the VA. In the meantime, two other benefits-related activities could be curtailed by a shutdown, depending on staff availability. Answers to routine inquiries from veterans could be slowed or stopped entirely. And there might be no employees to handle new claims for benefits. During the last government shutdown in 1995, "more than 400,000 veterans saw their disability benefits and pension claims delayed," Senate Veterans Affairs Chairwoman Patty Murray, D-Wash., said, according to the Army Times. "Money that they were counting on didn’t come to them. Payment of GI Bill education checks were delayed for hundreds of thousands of our veterans. Telephone calls from our veterans to veterans’ benefits offices went unanswered. Mail from veterans to our VA offices wasn’t opened. It wasn’t answered." So where does this leave us? By saying that a government shutdown "could disrupt ... veterans' benefits," Stabenow phrased her statement cautiously, and, for the most part, accurately. A shutdown is not destined to disrupt checks to veterans, but it could -- either for new claims, or, if the shutdown drags on long enough, for existing beneficiaries. Stabenow could have added that a shorter shutdown in line with the duration of those in 1995, or a generous allocation of "essential" employees, could minimize or even eliminate the impact on veterans checks this year. But we think that’s a minor omission, given how carefully she couched her statement. On balance, we rate her comment True.	None	Debbie Stabenow	None	None	None	2011-04-06T17:26:56	2011-03-01	['None']

pomt-12196	Cher "is moving to Canada because of President Trump."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/26/blog-posting/did-cher-move-canada-because-donald-trump/	Cher’s prolific use of Twitter to criticize President Donald Trump has prompted an obscure website to claim the singer is moving to Canada because of his policies. "BREAKING: A Hollywood Star Is Moving To Canada Because Of President Trump," said a headline for a story published July 14, 2017 on conservativearmy88.com. "Many Hollywood celebrities announced that they will move in another country if Donald Trump won the elections. Well, the elections were held 7 months ago and he won, but no celebrity kept the promise," the post said. (The presidential election was held more than seven months ago, Nov. 8, 2016). The article speculated on Cher’s relocation, even though the headline presented a more affirmative claim. "However, singer Cher may be the first to move to Canada because of the President. As Trump announced he wants to change the Obamacare, she took it to Twitter to express her anger," the post said. Several celebrities did say they would leave the United States, including to Canada, if Trump was elected. On her part, Cher joked she would move to another planet, Jupiter. In reply to a Twitter user, Cher wrote on June 16, 2015, the day Trump announced his candidacy: "IF HE WERE TO BE ELECTED,IM MOVING TO JUPITER 😖" We reached out to the singer via social media for comment but did not get a response. Cher’s website lists a series of upcoming performances in Las Vegas and Washington for the rest of the year. And while her Twitter feed features a series of tweets criticizing Trump and his policies, a search of the word "Canada" in her tweets did not yield any message saying she had moved up north. Cher also attended the Women’s March on Washington on Jan. 21. "I want to let people know that I'm here for them and I believe in this movement," Cher told the Los Angeles Times. It’s also worth noting that conservativearmy88.com’s website does not have any information identifying who runs it, its mission, where it’s based or other information that credible news organizations publish on their website.

pomt-04753	Says "taxes were raised 115 times in the eight years before I became governor" and those increases were part of a "path that led to wealth and jobs and people leaving our state."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/28/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-keynote-address-taxes-new-je/	In the biggest speech of his political career, Gov. Chris Christie took a moment to repeat one of the favorite lines of New Jersey Republicans: The state raised taxes 115 times in the eight years before he took office, contributing to a loss of jobs, wealth and residents, the governor said Tuesday night during his keynote address at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla. "When I came into office, I could continue on the same path that led to wealth and jobs and people leaving our state or I could do the job people elected me to do – to do the big things," Christie said. The governor went on to say: "But we were on a path we could no longer afford to follow. Now they said it was impossible -- this is what they told me -- to cut taxes in a state where taxes were raised 115 times in the eight years before I became governor." Christie’s number is about right, but the governor should have said that figure includes increases in taxes, fees and other tax policy changes. Also, as we previously found, there are many factors behind losing jobs, wealth and residents. PolitiFact New Jersey found the same problems in October when we fact-checked a similar claim by State Senate Minority Leader Tom Kean Jr., who said Democrats chased away jobs by "raising taxes over 115 times" in the past 10 years. We confirmed that from 2002 to 2009, state officials approved roughly 115 increases in taxes and fees or other tax policy changes. Those tax hikes included increases in the cigarette tax, the sales tax and the gross income tax. Among the fee increases was a bill passed in 2008 to increase the maximum fees for permits to manufacture, store, sell or use explosives. But Christie also described those "taxes" as part of a "path that led to wealth and jobs and people leaving our state." As we determined for previous fact-checks, there are many factors leading to a loss of jobs, wealth and residents. For instance, experts have pointed to the general downturn in the economy as one of the contributing factors. Our ruling During his keynote address, Christie claimed "taxes were raised 115 times in the eight years before I became governor" and those increases were part of a "path that led to wealth and jobs and people leaving our state." But the governor shouldn’t have described all of those 115 increases as "taxes." In the eight years before he took office, state officials approved roughly 115 increases in taxes and fees or other tax policy changes. Also, there are multiple factors behind losing jobs, wealth and residents, such as the general downturn in the economy. We rate the statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-14461	In head-to-head polls for the general election, "I beat Hillary Clinton by more than anybody, by 11 points."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/03/john-kasich/john-kasich-correct-he-polls-best-against-among-go/	Early in the Republican presidential debate in Detroit, the candidates mixed it up over polling data. First, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said that "of all the people on this stage, (Donald Trump) performs the worst against Hillary Clinton" in head-to-head matchups for the general election. Ohio Gov. John Kasich later added that he’s the candidate best positioned to take on Clinton, the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination. "I beat Hillary Clinton by more than anybody, by 11 points," Kasich said. He was referring to the four Republicans on the debate stage -- himself, Rubio, Trump and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas. Was Kasich correct? We turned to the polling averages at RealClearPolitics.com, a popular aggregator of comprehensive polling data. We’ll start by noting that polling experts typically urge caution when comparing head-to-head matchups for the general election this early in the campaign cycle. That said, we looked at the polling results a couple of different ways. One was the RealClearPolitics poll average, which averages the most recent polls. The other was the range of results since Feb. 1. Here’s a table summarizing the results: Democratic nominee, RCP average Republican nominee, RCP average Head-to-head leader and margin Strongest poll for Republican since Feb. 1 Weakest poll for Republican since Feb. 1 Hillary Clinton 40.3 percent John Kasich 47.7 percent Kasich +7.4 Kasich +11 Kasich +3 Hillary Clinton 43.5 percent Marco Rubio 48.5 percent Rubio +5.0 Rubio +7 Rubio +2 Hillary Clinton 45.0 percent Ted Cruz 46.5 percent Cruz +1.5 Cruz +3 Clinton +2 Hillary Clinton 45.4 percent Donald Trump 42.0 percent Clinton +3.4 Trump +2 Clinton +8 What does this tell us? First, it confirms Kasich’s assertion that he beats Clinton "by more than anybody" still in the race. The average of recent polls shows that Kasich’s edge over Clinton is 7.4 points, which is larger than the leads over Clinton being posted by Rubio, Cruz or Trump. (In fact, on average, Trump actually loses to Clinton by 3.4 points.) The one element of Kasich’s statement that isn’t entirely supported by the data is that he beats Clinton by 11 points. It’s true that in his strongest recent poll, Kasich defeated Clinton by 11 points -- it was a USA Today-Suffolk poll taken between Feb. 11 and Feb. 15. But emphasizing that one poll is a bit of cherry picking. It also tells us that Rubio was correct that Trump does the worst against Clinton, as he loses to her by an average 3.4 percentage points in recent polls. Our ruling Kasich said that in head-to-head polls for the general election, "I beat Hillary Clinton by more than anybody, by 11 points." The RealClearPolitics average of recent polls shows Kasich faring better against Clinton than Rubio, Cruz or Trump. But focusing on the 11-point margin in his best poll is a bit of cherry picking. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-06971	Says a quote at the top of the redesigned website for the Department of Justice comes from a socialist who wanted to impose global common law.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/14/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-quote-top-redesigned-departmen/	The latest socialist/communist plot to take over the world is insidiously (if innocuously) placed at the top of the Department of Justice's newly designed website. At least, that's what a writer for the American Spectator and a number of chain e-mails would have you believe. "What's black and white and 'red' all over? The Department of Justice's newly designed website. Gone are the standard red, white, and blue motifs, replaced by an all-black backdrop. And prominently placed on virtually every page of the site is a quote credited to a man who facilitated a greater role for socialists and communists at the U.N. and the global 'workers rights movement,' according to a July 16, 2010 column in the American Spectator, written by someone who goes under the pen name, the Washington Prowler. "...Most jarring is the quote that appears on virtually every page of the website. 'The common law is the will of mankind issuing from the life of the people,' which, some DOJ staff say, is tied to a man who ushered in the socialist and communist theories that now permeate the United Nations." The quote is lifted from an inscription on the side of the Department of Justice Building. According to the Spectator: Some attorneys believed the quote is pulled or adapted from the writing of Sir William Blackstone, the 18th Century British jurist, who wrote the Commentaries on the Laws of England, which influenced not only British law, but also the American constitutional and legal system. But other Department of Justice employees say the quote originates from British lawyer, C. Wilfred Jenks, who back in the late 1930s and after World War II was a leading figure in the 'international law' movement, which sought to impose a global, common law, and advocated for global workers rights. Jenks was a long-time member of the United Nation's International Labor Organization, and author of a number of globalist tracts, including a set of essays published back in 1958, entitled The Common Law of Mankind. Most telling: Jenks, as director of the ILO is credited with putting in place the first Soviet senior member of the UN organization, and also with creating an environment that allowed the ILO to give "observer status" to the Palestinian Liberation Organization, and to issue anti-Israeli statements, which precipitated efforts by the U.S. Congress to withdraw U.S. membership from the ILO. The U.S. actually did withdraw in the mid-1970s due to the organization's leftist leanings. "It was Jenks's efforts that helped make the ILO a tool of the socialist and communist movement," says one of the DOJ lawyers. So already we're dealing with speculation from some unnamed attorneys in the Department of Justice. But even with this flimsy evidence, the story grew wings among conservative bloggers on the web, and various versions of the claim circulated widely by chain e-mail. One of the chain e-mails we received repeats the quote now on the DOJ website, and then gets sarcastic: Catchy, huh? Just one tiny little (too small to be relevant obviously) point -- the quote is from C. Wilfred Jenks, who in the 1930's was a leading proponent of the "international law" movement, which had as its goal to impose a global common law and which backed 'global workers' rights.' Call it Marxism, call it Progressivism, call it Socialism -- under any of those names, it definitely makes the DOJ look corrupt in their new website with Marxist accessories to match. How very interesting that 'they' couldn't find a nice quote from one of our Founders. People, we have lost our Republic. This is an example of the slow, methodical misuse of power our current government is doing as they lead us to socialism, and destroying our republic as we have known it. As with most chain e-mails, it ends, "Please, pass this on to people on your e-mail list. ASAP!" The whole argument, of course, rests on the supposition that the quote came from a socialist leader. We bet you can see where this is headed, but we'll usher you through the unraveling. We first contacted the Department of Justice. Tracy J. Russo, a spokeswoman for the DOJ, confirmed the quote appears on the façade of the main Department of Justice building in Washington, D.C. "The building was completed in 1935, and this inscription is just one of many that circle the building’s exterior," Russo said via e-mail. "It does appear on the eastern side of building, overlooking 9th Street NW. The full quote is: 'The common law derives from the will of mankind, issuing from the life of the people, framed by mutual confidence, and sanctioned by the light of reason.'" The quote was a favorite of former Attorney General Janet Reno, who dropped it into numerous speeches. For example, in a 2001 speech, Reno said, "There is, on the wall of the 9th Street gate, a saying that I have come to rely on again and again. It says, 'The common law derives from the will of mankind, issuing from the life of the people, framed by mutual confidence, and sanctioned by the light of reason.' Unless the law issues from all of the people, some of the people will feel left out. They will come to feel alienated. They will be angry. And this will not be a cohesive democracy. If you don't care about that, they will feel left out, alienated, and they will not have the opportunities that others have to skills, to jobs, to opportunity. That will only hurt America." Russo said the quote was chosen for the website when it was redesigned in October 2009 because the main Justice building was used as inspiration for the website design. "We’ve heard various reports of its origin but have not found any definitive information regarding the source," Russo said. "We don't actually know its origin." So we reached out to the Library of Congress. And three weeks later, they got back to us ... and the socialist conspiracy theory came crashing down. It turns out, the quote did not come from C. Wilfred Jenks. Jennifer Gavin, a spokeswoman at the Library of Congress said she asked two reference librarians to research the issue and here's what they found: The inscription, "The common law is the will of mankind, issuing from the life of the people," is attributable to Hartley Burr Alexander, 1873-1939 - poet, philosopher, scholar, and architectural iconographer. The chief sculptor of the U.S. Department of Justice building (1932-1934), C. Paul Hennewein, retained Dr. Alexander, then chairman of the philosophy department at the University of Nebraska, to assist with a unifying theme for the sculpture and inscriptions for the new building. Dr. Alexander’s correspondence and photographs are archived in the Hartley Burr Alexander Projects Collection at Scripps College in Claremont, California, where he was invited to chair a professorship in philosophy. So was Hartley Burr Alexander some kind of Marxist? Nope. "He seemed to be something of a liberal, but not a communist," said Richard T. Hull, an emeritus professor at the University at Buffalo who wrote a brief biography of Alexander for the American Psychological Association. A native of Lincoln, Neb., Alexander was a writer, poet and professor of philosophy at the University of Nebraska and later at Scripps College in Claremont, Calif. According to Hull's biographical sketch, Alexander "was a famed lecturer and teacher. He wrote articles, editorials and poems for several newspapers. He wrote and presented a number of pageants and a light opera. In addition to his articles in philosophical journals, he did field work in the anthropology of the Native American, developing a special interest in the poetic and spiritual quality of Native American songs and rituals and the symbolism of Native American mythology." The Department of Justice Building isn't the only one inscribed with his words. According to Hull's research, Alexander -- who was president of the American Philosophical Association in 1918-1919 -- was commissioned to design the decorative scheme, and write inscriptions for the Nebraska State Capitol building, the Los Angeles Public Library, the Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Building in Philadelphia and the Oregon State Capitol building. In other words, Alexander had a varied and illustrious career, none of which would suggest putting his words atop the DOJ website is any kind subliminal socialist message. This whole issue is much ado about nothing. The authors cooked up a conspiracy theory based on misinformation about who authored the quote on the DOJ website (and the side of the DOJ Building), and then they ran with it. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2011-07-14T11:53:02	2011-06-22	['None']

pomt-06355	Rhode Island Treasurer Gina Raimondo "raised the mortality rate from 65 to 87" and "used a 1994 annuity chart" to create the pension crisis.	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/nov/06/paul-valletta/rhode-island-union-official-paul-valletta-says-big/	Paul Valletta Jr., president of the Cranston firefighters union, caused a stir during a recent hearing on the proposed pension overhaul plan when he claimed that General Treasurer Gina Raimondo "cooked the books" to create Rhode Island’s pension crisis. Valletta, a lobbyist for the Rhode Island State Association of Fire Fighters and an opponent of Raimondo's proposed reforms, said the general treasurer did it two ways. The first was by scaling back the predicted expected rate of return on the state pension fund’s investments, dropping it from 8.25 percent per year to 7.5 percent. (State pension investments have earned 5.74 percent per year over the last 10 years; 1.52 percent per year during the past 5 years.) The second was by increasing the predicted life expectancy of people in the retirement system. Both changes automatically mean the state needs more money to pay for retirement benefits. In fact, state officials say taxpayers next year will have to contribute $615 million, nearly double this year’s payment, unless the pension system is changed. We don't predict stock market trends. Instead, we'll stick with the statements Valletta made about the life expectancy issue. Raimondo, Valletta said, "raised the mortality rate from 65 to 87." Eighty-seven is too high, he contended, because "if you look at the Social Security mortality rate for the State of Rhode Island . . . it's 78 years old. But when they changed that mortality rate by her actuary in that meeting, they used a 1994 annuity chart" instead of more recent and more accurate figures. His comments raise a host of questions. * Did the state retirement system assume that the life expectancy of state workers was age 65 before Raimondo came along? * Did she really raise that age by 22 years, to 87, when the federal government pegs the life expectancy at 78 for Rhode Islanders? * Did the state really use a two-decade old annuity chart to predict life expectancy? * Did Raimodo make these decisions on her own? We decided to investigate. First of all, Valletta is really talking about life expectancy, not mortality rate, which is the number of deaths over a period of time. We found Social Security data citing a life expectancy of 78.2 years for Rhode Islanders, but those numbers were from 2000. To get more recent statistics, we checked with the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which compiles all kinds of federal data, including life expectancies by state. Its latest statistics, from 2007, list the life expectancy in Rhode Island as 79.3 years. That's still pretty close to the 78 years cited by Valletta. But that's the life expectancy for a child born in 2007. Actuaries need to have up-to-date forecasts for people with the same age profile as current and future retirees. (To show how it gets complicated, the 2007 Social Security life table shows that the typical 65-year-old male will live to age 82 but someone who is already 80 will, on average, live to age 88.) When we asked Raimondo's office about Valletta's allegations, we were directed to the latest actuarial experience study done for the state Employee's Retirement System of Rhode Island. The state retirement board used the study -- based on data through June 30, 2010 -- when it adjusted the life expectancies of workers and retirees in April 2011. The report from Gabriel Roeder Smith & Company says the actuaries started with a 1994 actuarial table, but the study also makes it clear that the table was only a starting point. The actuaries then adjusted life expectancies based on gender and job (women and retired teachers tend to live longer than the typical male state worker). The expectancies were further adjusted upward by 10 to 20 percent to insure that the pension fund has a cushion to cover costs, especially at a time when life expectancy is increasing. Then the estimates were compared with actual death rates to see whether further adjustments were needed. According to the latest report, especially a key chart on page 28, the initial adjustments weren't enough. For example, the state actuaries projected that the typical male teacher would live to age 84.8. That turned out to be very, very close to what was actually happening, based on the retirement system’s data. From 2000 to 2006, the actual life expectancy was 83.9 years and from 2004-2010 it was 1.2 years higher -- 85.1 years. The report recommended ratcheting up the life expectancy for that group to 85.7 years. You can see the actual numbers in this chart, calculated for those who retired at age 65.. Actual life expectancy Estimate life expectancy 2000-2006 2004-2010 Previous Newest Male state employee 81.4 83.0 82.1 83.2 Female state employee 85.2 86.2 86.3 86.6 Male teacher 83.9 85.1 84.8 85.7 Female teacher 86.5 87.6 87.7 88.4 Joseph P. Newton, the actuary for the retirement board, emphasized this in followup testimony before the joint Senate and House Finance Committees on Nov. 1. "When a baby is born, [he or she] will live [on average] 78 years. We don't care because we want to measure when people are receiving pension checks, and they [typically] start receiving pension checks at 65," he said. "When we say the life expectancy we're using is 87, it's for a 65 year old, somebody who has already made it from zero to 65. So now they're expected to live to 87." Newton said that, based on the April vote of the retirement board, the state is now using 2000 projections instead of a 1994 actuarial table. We asked Valletta about Newton’s figures. He said he stands by his statement and believes the state should be using the Social Security life expectancy. He said he understands how the state actuaries calculated their estimate "but I don't agree with it. . . . I don't buy these actuary reports. . . . Whatever numbers they need to get to, they can find a way to get to." Our ruling Union official Paul Valletta said General Treasurer Gina Raimondo created the pension crisis when she, in part, used an outdated annuity chart and "raised the mortality rate from 65 to 87" even though life expectancy (as calculated by Social Security) is actually 78. First, the life expectancy for state workers wasn't 65 when the vote to raise it was taken. It was 82 to 88 (depending on the group). Second, the board didn't bump the life expectancy up by 22 years. It increased it by 0.3 to 1.1 years, depending on the group, to provide a funding cushion in case life expectancies continue to go up. Finally, Raimondo didn’t make that decision on her own. She was one vote on the 15-member retirement board, which she chairs. (The board voted 9-6 last April to approve the new life expectancies and lower the expected rate of return on the pension fund’s investment. Only one of the seven public employee representatives voted in the majority.) Valletta's statement includes a grain of truth -- a 1994 actuarial table was previously used in the calculations and 78 years is close to the Social Security estimates for overall life expectancy for the entire state. But he has omitted crucial facts and chooses to disbelieve the actual data that leads to a very different conclusion. We rate his statement Mostly False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-06072	Says President Barack Obama "is a socialist."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/08/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-barack-obama-socialist/	In our super-heated political discourse, explosive words get tossed around pretty easily these days. Hitler comparisons and terms like Nazi and socialist have become the currency of political attacks not just in the blogosphere but also by elected officials. Texas Gov. Rick Perry launched such an attack at a Republican presidential debate in New Hampshire on Jan. 8, 2012. Asked if he agreed with Sen. John McCain that President Barack Obama "is a patriot," Perry replied: "I make a very proud statement and, in fact ,that we have a president that's a socialist. I don't think our founding fathers wanted America to be a socialist country. So I disagree with that premise that somehow or another that President Obama reflects our founding fathers. He doesn't. He talks about having a more powerful, more centralized, more consuming and costly federal government. "I am a Tenth Amendment believing governor. I truly believe that we need a president that respects the Tenth Amendment, that pushes back to the states. Whether it's how to deliver education, how to deliver health care, how to do our environmental regulations. The states will considerably do a better job than a one-size-fits-all Washington, D.C. led by this president." This was not the first time Perry has used the term against Obama. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas trace the origins to at least June 2008 when Perry told a Republican group that a European plan for cutting global poverty was "the type of socialistic program that Obama wants to bring to America." More recently, Perry told Fox News last November that, "I think Barack Obama is a socialist." A similar claim has been made by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who wrote a book titled To Save America: Stopping Obama's Secular-Socialist Machine. We've addressed Republican charges of Democrats being socialists before. In 2008, we explored a claim by Sarah Palin based on Obama's conversation with Joe the Plumber (as Samuel Joseph Wurzelbacher came to be known after that conversation) that Obama's tax policy was socialism (Pants on Fire). Last year, PolitiFact Oregon and other PolitiFact state sites checked a claim by bloggers that 70 House Democrats are socialists (Pants on Fire). Asked about his Obama-is-a-socialist claim in November, Perry said, "When you talk about printing money and spending government money, and trying to spend it out. That conversation he had with Joe the Plumber -- kind of redistribute the wealth -- the best I can tell, that's socialism." But as we explained in our examination of Palin and Joe the Plumber's statements, Obama's tax policy relies on the same progressive approach that has been the cornerstone of American tax policy since the federal government first collected an income tax in 1863, an approach embraced by Republicans and Democrats. It was based on the Tax Act of 1862, which President Abraham Lincoln signed, and which imposed a "duty of three per centum" on all income over $600, and five percent on income over $10,000. The idea is that the wealthy pay a larger share of their income because they are more able to afford it. To the extent the government then gives some of the money to the less-wealthy through various programs, you could say the income is being redistributed. But that concept has been embraced by Republicans and Democrats for well over a century. That's a far cry from true socialism, which is defined as support for "governmental ownership and administration of the means of production and distribution of goods." That's enough for us to set the Truth-O-Meter ablaze, but let's dig a little deeper to explore whether Obama's main policies can accurately be called socialism. * The health care law. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has called the Democratic health care law "job-killing," a claim we rated False. Is it possible it's also socialism? (If it is, we should note that anything that kills jobs isn't very good socialism!) In fact, the health care law relies largely on the free enterprise system, an economic approach that Perry usually speaks about fondly. To increase health care coverage for the uninsured and people in small business, the law sets up exchanges to encourage private health insurance companies to compete. (In 2010, we chose the Republican claim that the law was a "government takeover" as our Lie of the Year.) * The economic stimulus. In February 2009, Obama and the Democrats muscled through the $787 billion spending package to try to jump-start the economy. The program was about one-third tax cuts and two-thirds government spending on everything from clean energy initiatives to electronic speed-limit signs. It's true that government payrolls were stabilized or grew because of the new money, but it was nowhere near a government takeover of our private enterprise economy. * The Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP). When Obama took office, he inherited the TARP, the Bush administration's plan for stabilizing the economy. It was designed to prevent financial firms from collapsing by buying assets and stakes in the companies. In December 2008, President George W. Bush authorized use of the money for loans to U.S. automakers. Obama has emphasized he was not eager for the U.S. government to be involved in such efforts but that he felt they were necessary. "If there's one thing that has unified Democrats and Republicans, and everybody in between, it's that we all hated the bank bailout," he said in his 2010 State of the Union Address, adding that "if we had allowed the meltdown of the financial system, unemployment might be double what it is today. More businesses would certainly have closed. More homes would have surely been lost. So I supported the last administration's efforts to create the financial rescue program. And when we took that program over, we made it more transparent and more accountable. And as a result, the markets are now stabilized, and we've recovered most of the money we spent on the banks." Many Republicans opposed the TARP -- an initiative of a Republican administration -- because they felt it was too much government intrusion into the private enterprise system. This is the one area where you could even begin to make a case that the government was taking ownership, but as a percentage of the full U.S. economy, it was relatively small and temporary. So add them up, and it amounts to flimsy evidence to even begin to argue that the Obama is on a path toward socialism. "Socialism means public ownership of the means of production. Obama does not believe this. Therefore he is not a socialist," conservative economist Bruce Bartlett told PolitiFact in an e-mail. "Although it is true that the federal government did come to own some private businesses as a consequence of bailout policies initiated by the George W. Bush administration such as TARP, the Obama administration sold many of them -- such as its shares in GM -- as quickly as feasible. A true socialist would have held on to them." Dan Mitchell, a scholar on fiscal policy at the libertarian Cato Institute, says there are other words for Obama's expansion of government (he thinks fascism is a fair term), but that it's not accurate to call it socialism. Daniel N. Shaviro, professor of taxation at New York University Law School, said "it is a lie" to say Obama is a socialist. "If he is a socialist, so were Eisenhower and Bush Sr." Our ruling There are plenty of ways to have a meaningful, substantive conversation about the differences of the Republicans and Democrats in tax policy, economics and the role of government. But it's simply preposterous for Perry -- and Gingrich -- to refer to Obama's policies as socialism or to say he is a socialist. Obama's policies may have expanded government, but they don't justify this ridiculous hyperbole. We're reaching for the matches -- Pants on Fire!

pomt-07420	"Mickey Mouse was registered to vote (in Florida)."	false	/florida/statements/2011/apr/26/eric-eisnaugle/mickey-mouse-was-registered-vote-florida-republica/	A bill that would make major changes to state election law passed the Florida House 79-37 on April 21, 2011, but not before Republicans and Democrats argued over the intent of the 157-page bill. Democrats say the bill is an attempt to suppress the votes of minorities, women and young people -- in part because the bill eliminates a four-decades-old provision that allows voters who have moved or changed their last name to update their information at the polls on Election Day. Those voters would have to file provisional ballots that are reviewed after the election under the proposed law. Another sticking point with Democrats is that the bill requires third-party groups like the League of Women Voters to register with the state and to turn in signed voter registration forms within 48 hours instead of the current 10 days. But Republicans say the changes are to protect the state against possible voter fraud. "This is a great country. Our vote is precious, and we're going to protect it," said Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, sponsor of the bill, HB 1355. During the floor debate, Rep. Eric Eisnaugle, R-Orlando, more directly rebuffed the suggestion from Democrats that the legislation isn't needed and noted several instances of fraud. (You can watch Eisnaugle's comments by clicking here. He starts speaking about two hours and 28 minutes in.) "One of my colleagues suggested that we spent hours of time on a problem that doesn't exist, also suggesting that nothing in this bill helps people vote," he said. "Well, members, it doesn't take much to find the documentation of fraud that some third-party registration organizations have committed right here in Florida. Just go on Google, and go to the news section and you can find a pretty long list of articles documenting the fraud we have seen. We have seen allegations of fraud, (Florida Department of Law Enforcement) investigations. (We have seen) falsifying of hundreds of registrations, including the registration of an actor who was already deceased at the time. In another case, Mickey Mouse was registered to vote. "In yet another case, hundreds or thousands ... of students were registered to vote without their knowledge after they simply signed a petition, having no idea that their information was then going to be turned around and used to register their names on the voter rolls here in Florida. "If we don't take action to put an end to the fraud, our vote doesn't matter as much," Eisnaugle said. Eisnaugle made three different fraud claims, and we plan to touch on each in this fact check to see if they're true. But for the sake of the Truth-O-Meter, we're going to home in on the line that stuck out because of the absurdity of it, if true: "Mickey Mouse was registered to vote." Registered dead actor Eisnaugle said one case of fraud included the falsifying of hundreds of voter registrations, and the registration of an already dead actor. This story comes from South Florida before the 2008 presidential election and involves the now-defunct Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now -- or ACORN. Eleven people hired by ACORN to register potential voters near Homestead were accused of falsifying hundreds of voter registration applications. In this instance, it was ACORN who turned in the hired workers. ACORN officials noticed the discrepancies in the cards turned in by the suspects and contacted authorities. The group workers turned in 1,400 cards, of which 888 were found to be fraudulent. Included among the fraudulent voter applications -- deceased actor Paul Newman. Workers also filled out a voter application for singer James Taylor or filled out several cards for the same real voter, the Miami Herald reported after the fraud was made public on Sept. 9, 2009. Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle praised ACORN for assisting authorities, and told Fox News that no one voted in the election using the fraudulent voter applications. "We've been very aggressive about a lot of these cases," Fernandez Rundle said. "But we would not have known about these workers unless ACORN brought it to us. "It's really minor, ineffectual attempts (by the hired workers) to justify getting paid an hourly basis. It could not have impacted the voting process whatsoever. Nonetheless, we cannot turn a blind eye to this.'' Students duped The story of the students thinking they were signing petitions -- only instead to be registered to vote -- comes from the 2004 presidential election. In October 2004, the St. Petersburg Times published a story talking about instances on campuses across the state where students were unwittingly either being registered to vote, or were being signed up to vote as Republicans when they wanted to be registered as something else. The Times quoted officials at the Florida Department of Law Enforcement who said that 4,000 students may have fallen for the trick. The likely suspect, the Times reported, was a group hired by the National Republican Committee to register voters. The workers would have the students sign a petition to legalize marijuana or a petition urging stiffer sentences for child abusers. Then, workers would have students unknowingly fill out a second form registering them to vote as Republicans. Mindy Tucker Fletcher, a senior adviser to the Florida GOP, told the Times that it doesn't help the party to register Democrats as Republicans if they didn't then vote to re-elect George W. Bush. In 2008, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement also investigated the stories of two Orlando-area teens who received voter registration cards in the mail even though they were too young to vote. The girls said they filled out entry forms to win a riding lawn mower while at the mall, and that they think someone used their information to forge or create voter applications. The voter applications were stamped with ACORN symbols. Mickey Mouse Then there's Mickey Mouse, the cartoon face of the Disney empire, and apparently a Florida registered voter. (Take that, California!) It turns out Mickey did fill out a voter registration application in Orange County ahead of the 2008 presidential election. Mickey checked the box indicating that he was updating his voter registration information and was changing his name. According to the application, Mickey appears to have listed a birth date of Jan. 15, 2002, the address of "15 Ave 17 0922" in Orlando, and a zip code, 56812, that isn't on file with the United States Postal Service. The phone number -- with a 407 area code -- was disconnected when we called on April 22. Mickey's Social Security number started 123. Orange County elections officials rejected his application, which was stamped with ACORN's label. So Mickey was never officially registered to vote. ACORN officials told the St. Petersburg Times, in a story published in October 2008, that the group scanned suspicious applications and that they believe the Mickey Mouse application did not come from them. Florida law requires third-party groups like the now-defunct ACORN or the League of Women Voters to turn in every application to elections supervisors. The purpose is to prohibit a group from not turning in registrations it may not like because of a voter's party choice. Our ruling What's worth noting is that, in all three stories Eisnaugle cited, the fraud was exposed. The only real impact was that students in 2004 were registered as Republicans when they wanted to be registered as something else. It's also worth noting that it's unclear how HB 1355 -- had it been part of election law -- would have altered any of the above three scenarios. Here's what Lyndsey Cruley, a spokeswoman for House Republicans, told us in response to our efforts to contact Eisnaugle. "If you listen to Rep. Eisnaugle’s remarks in full, it is clear that his entire speech was directed only toward the actions of some third-party registration organizations," she said. "Rep. Eisnaugle cited accurate information that such a third-party registration organization fraudulently submitted a registration for Mickey Mouse. In doing so, he intended to illustrate the need for provisions included in HB 1355 that would identify and prevent potential voter fraud from illegal voter registrations by third-party registration organizations. "Currently, there is no mechanism to identify which groups or person is responsible for submitting fraudulent registration forms and this measure would correct that, adding an additional layer of accountability to our state’s elections process. In sum, although Rep. Eisnaugle’s remarks could be interpreted, if taken out of context, in two different ways, he clearly intended to demonstrate that some third-party registration organizations have committed fraudulent actions here in Florida." Cruley is right that the bill would require third-party groups like the League of Women Voters to identify voter registrations they submitted. But we're checking Eisnaugle's claim made on the House floor that Mickey Mouse was registered to vote. Mickey never got that far. Someone filled out an application for him, but the application included so many inaccuracies that -- even if mice were allowed to vote in Florida -- Disney's animated superstar would have had problems. To us, the application looks more like a dumb prank than attempted voter fraud. And it was rightly rejected by the elections supervisor. We rate this claim False.

pomt-15120	Says Scott Walker said "Labor unions don’t deserve to have a national holiday" due to their damage to the economy. And the holiday "should be replaced by Patriots Day, celebrated every year on 9/11."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2015/sep/10/facebook-posts/facebook-post-says-scott-walker-wants-end-labor-da/	We’re marking two special days this week -- Labor Day and Patriot Day, the official name given to the day of mourning that marks the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The two days -- and Republican presidential contender Scott Walker -- converged in a meme going around Facebook that one of our readers saw and asked us to check out. In it, a picture of Walker is accompanied by this quote: "Labor Unions don’t deserve to have a national holiday. They’ve done more damage to our economy than any recession ever did. Labor Day should be replaced by Patriots Day, celebrated every year on 9/11." The meme indicates Walker said this on Sept. 5, 2015. Only he didn’t. To be sure, Walker is no fan of organized labor, but there is no evidence he made such a statement. To the contrary, a closer look shows the meme was created by a group that mocks conservatives called "Stop the World, the Teabaggers Want Off." Dig even deeper and you find a disclaimer that says the site is meant to be satire. They’re old pros at creating this kind of stuff -- and having readers unwittingly pass it around as if it is the truth. This Walker-focused meme has been shared some 2,800 times on Facebook. The "Stop the World" site is not new to PolitiFact readers. Our partners in other states have reviewed other fake statements involving GOP presidential contenders. Marco Rubio: PolitiFact Florida looked at a quote attributed to U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida: "No, felons should not have their voting rights restored even after they have served their sentence." There was no evidence that Rubio had actually said the words attributed to him, although he has been critical about felons regaining voting rights. The claim was rated False. Ted Cruz: PolitiFact Texas looked at a meme that claimed U.S. Ted Cruz said this: "While there may have been an age difference, Josh Duggar’s transgressions are far less an affront to God than what gays do to each other." Duggar, a reality TV star, resigned from the conservative Family Research Council after reports that he had sexually assaulted several girls, including two of his sisters, when he was 14. PolitiFact Texas rated the claim that Cruz had made the comment Pants on Fire. The myth-busting site Snopes has looked at a number of other outlandish fake quotes attributed to conservatives, including Sarah Palin, "Duck Dynasty" star Phil Robertson and former GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney. All were made up. (Snopes has declared the Walker meme false.) Indeed, the group got more than the alleged Walker quote wrong. It also mixed up Patriot’s Day (April 19), which marks the first battles of the Revolutionary War, with Patriot Day, which is Sept. 11 -- the day of the terrorist attacks on the United States. Our rating A Facebook meme attributed a fake quote to Gov. Scott Walker saying Labor Day should be replaced by Patriots Day.

pomt-00824	Under current conditions, by 2023, the interest payments on the national debt will be $722 billion, larger than the projected defense spending of $696 billion.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/mar/27/tom-price/prices-budget-point-about-rising-deficits-money/	It’s budget time in the nation’s capital. And, as the GOP produces its first spending proposals since President Barack Obama took office, a metro Atlanta voice is central to the discussion. U.S. Rep. Tom Price, R-Roswell unveiled his 2016 budget resolution as House budget chair last week. It would reduce spending by $5.5 trillion in the next 10 years in a bid to produce a budget surplus by 2025. The House on Thursday narrowly approved a budget that follows much of Price’s blueprint but also adds $38 billion in war funding. The original plan, though, made it clear that even with attention to military spending, the focus would be spending cuts. "Under current conditions, by 2023, interest payments on the nation’s debt alone will be $722 billion," Price wrote in the budget blueprint. "That will be larger than (Congressional Budget Office’s) projected defense spending budget of $696 billion." Most budget watchers have played down those claims, since fiscal conservatives and defense hawks have just worked to pass a budget that opens up Senate negotiations over a so-called reconciliation package that can go after Obamacare. But is the Price blueprint right? Without spending reductions, will taxpayers be paying more to carry debt than to have a standing military? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check it out. Price cites the Congressional Budget Office for his projections. The CBO is a federal, nonpartisan agency that has provided Congress with budget and economic information since its creation in 1974. The agency publishes projections several times a year, based on its detailed formulas that look at current laws, historic spending, revenue trends and other previous projections. The figures that Price cites are in the January budget and economic outlook for 2015 to 2025. Based on information from December 2014, the report estimates that the nation’s debt will be about 2.6 percent of the Gross Domestic Product for the year. That’s the smallest deficit relative to the nation’s economic output since 2007 but just under the 50-year historical average of 2.7 percent of GDP. And, tucked into the tables that help examine the rising deficits are the exact numbers that Price cites. On page 13, a table of the agency’s budget projections shows an estimated $722 billion bill for 2023. Deeper into the report, on page 86, the report projects defense spending will total $696 billion. So is it settled? Not quite. First, it’s important to recognize that defense total is a projection based on the spending caps, or sequestration, in effect through 2021. Those cuts are what some of the additional funding restored in the House budget version approved this week. Looking at the CBO projections without the automatic spending reductions, defense spending in 2023 is forecast to be $752 billion – substantially ahead of the projected price tag on the nation’s debt. Then again, that is a short-lived balance. By 2024, even stopping sequestration on defense spending, the CBO projects $777 billion in interest payments and $771 billion on defense. Price has a point when raising concerns about the projected cost of our national debt. And using the CBO projections gives a broad credibility, given the agency’s reputation for high-level, nonpartisan analysis. But there are caveats, said Laura Wheeler, a senior research associate at the Center for State and Local Finance at Georgia State University. After all, the projections are not hard and fast expectations but highly refined estimates on known factors at a snapshot in time. When the January report was released, for instance, the calculations could not account for recent financial woes in Europe, which undoubtedly affect the U.S. economy, or the possibility that American troops could be sent abroad, Wheeler said. "Based on what we know is going to happen and what has already occurred by trend, this is what the future looks like," she said. "There is a lot that can change, especially in 10 years." The question then becomes whether defense spending is the yardstick to measure the nation’s rising deficits. That becomes a political discussion, with some favoring military spending as the benchmark and others looking instead at costs such as medical spending. Wheeler, an economist, said many outside analysts prefer to examine the debt level compared with the GDP. As the CBO report points out, the 2014 rate is expected to be just a tenth of a percentage point below the historic rate of 2.7 percent. By 2025, the CBO projects a steep increase, 4 percent of GDP. That goes back to Price’s point, that interest on our national borrowing is projected to grow faster than the economy. That could change, especially if the sluggish economic recovery ramps up. But the projected increases are enough to get people – read political leaders – concerned, Wheeler said. "This becomes a philosophical debate about how to best handle that concern and when it becomes a problem," Wheeler said. "This is a place to start that conversation." A big part of Price’s job, for Georgians and all Americans, is to frame that conversation. His first budget proposal claims without change, the nation will be paying more in interest on our debt than our military. His figures are based on the best-available data, which tries to project a decade out. Those projections can and will change, though how is impossible to know. The decision to compare military spending with debt is not a common way to benchmark projections. But even the broader comparisons Price could have made – about the share of the nation’s economic output being spent on interest payments – support that broader argument. We rate his claim True.

pomt-01725	"The per-pupil cost in the [Blackstone Valley Prep] Mayoral Academy far outweighs the per-pupil cost in Cumberland public schools."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/aug/07/ralph-mollis/ralph-mollis-says-pupil-costs-blackstone-valley-pr/	Charter schools have stirred national and local debate since the first ones opened in the 1990s. Supporters claim they provide greater options and promote higher achievement. Opponents claim many charters don’t measure up to those promised achievements, and strain municipal budgets. The issue arose during a July 10, 2014, "State of the State Debate" between two of the three Democratic candidates for lieutenant governor: Secretary of State A. Ralph Mollis and Cumberland Mayor Daniel J. McKee. (State Rep. Frank Ferri, also a candidate, did not participate.) The focus: The Blackstone Valley Prep Mayoral Academy. McKee is the current chairman of the academy’s board. Mollis, a charter school skeptic, focused on costs, saying, "The per-pupil cost at the mayoral academy far outweighs the per-pupil costs in Cumberland public schools." Mollis continued: "One of the major issues right now is what’s happening in public education -- that we’re not providing enough funds and resources into our public education system, that entities like the mayoral academies are taking money from our public school system …" Some background: Charter schools are independently run public schools that are granted greater flexibility in their operations, in return for greater accountability for performance. Mayoral academies are regional charter schools whose boards are chaired by a mayor. Blackstone Valley Prep was started in 2009 as "an intentionally diverse" network of tuition-free public schools. Chartered by the Rhode Island Department of Education (RIDE), Blackstone Valley Prep enrolls students from Central Falls, Cumberland, Lincoln and Pawtucket: There are currently some 1,000 students in grades K-8. A high school is set to open in the fall with 100 ninth-grade students. We started our fact-checking by looking at RIDE statistics. RIDE reports per-pupil costs for all public schools in the state by adding up total budgets and dividing by the number of students. It uses a "Uniform Chart of Accounts," a standardized method by which every district, public charter school and state-operated school tracks revenue and expenses the same way. RIDE says that allows "for an apples-to-apples comparison between districts." Contrary to what Mollis said, RIDE’s figures show that Blackstone Valley’s per-pupil costs were actually LESS than Cumberland’s in fiscal years 2012 and 2013. However, in fiscal years 2010 and 2011, -- the charter’s first two years -- Blackstone Valley’s costs were significantly higher. (The fiscal year runs from July 1 through June 30.) Here are the numbers: FY 2010: Cumberland $11,007. Blackstone Valley Prep: $15,664. FY 2011: Cumberland $10,905. Blackstone Valley Prep: $15,408. FY 2012: Cumberland: $12,294. Blackstone Valley Prep: $11,716. FY 2013: Cumberland: $12,280. Blackstone Valley Prep: $12,054. RIDE spokesman Elliot Krieger said the costs are "equalized," by subtracting capital costs and debt service from those who report it through the school budget - "the only fair way to compare districts." Krieger says, "Our pupil expenditure data does not support that [Mollis’] statement." That seems pretty straightforward, right? But when we asked the Mollis campaign to back up his statement, campaign manager Nicholas Cicchitelli directed us to RIDE "revenue-per-pupil" figures - not cost-per-pupil - as "black-and-white support" for Mollis’ claim. Cicchitelli said that’s a more valid figure to use because it "shows how much money taxpayers are actually paying per pupil to the Mayoral Academy vs. what they pay to Cumberland public schools per pupil." But hang on a minute. First, in the debate, Mollis said "cost per pupil," not "revenue per pupil." And second, revenues are actually "money coming in," versus expenditures - which is money spent. The revenue is from all sources - local, state, federal, and ‘other,’ such as grants and donations, says Krieger.(In May, for example, BV Prep received a $450,000 grant from Next Generation Learning Challenges to launch its high school this fall). Cicchitelli also said that Mollis did not use the term "per pupil expenditure" because RIDE "includes some things and excludes others which distorts the true cost. For example, debt service is manipulated … " Seeking clarity, we contacted the Cumberland School District. Alexander Prignano, district business manager, offered this view: "The latest RIDE numbers are right," he said. "They do show BV and maybe two others are lower [than Cumberland.] But to say that without looking behind the numbers is misleading." Prignano said per-pupil costs at charter schools are typically lower "because they don’t have the special ed population that a public school will have, and special ed students are very, very costly to educate." Another example: mayoral academies are exempt from the state’s pension system, he said. We asked Rhode Island Public Expenditure Council - an independent, nonprofit and nonpartisan public policy research and education organization - to weigh in. Executive director John C. Simmons said RIDE provided RIPEC with data for per-pupil expenditures and per-pupil revenue, "which allowed us to compare the two schools over time." "We would say you should look at the cost per student as opposed to where the money came from," Simmons said. He noted, for example, "You can get grants and contributions that are not taxpayer money." Simmons also said it’s not surprising that Blackstone Valley’s costs per pupil in its first few years were high because of the expense of starting a new school, spread out among relatively few students -- 76 in the beginning. And it’s not surprising that those costs "would decline rapidly as the number of students increases." Simmons said, "It looks like during the first two years of transition, Blackstone spent a considerable amount more [per pupil] than Cumberland did. When you look into the more norming years, Blackstone Valley spent less than Cumberland by a couple hundred dollars." Our ruling Ralph Mollis said: "The per-pupil cost in the Mayoral Academy [Blackstone Valley] far outweighs the per-pupil cost in Cumberland public schools." That’s a pretty sweeping claim. And it’s only true for the school’s first two years, when start-up costs, spread over a relatively small number of students, would be high. It’s not true for the more representative last two years, when the Academy’s per-pupil costs were lower, not higher. The efforts of the Mollis campaign to consider "revenue per pupil" didn’t sway us. It’s not the same thing and it’s not what Mollis said. Because Mollis’ statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-08989	Says Texas has one state inspector for every 4,500 oil and gas wells.	true	/texas/statements/2010/jul/15/jeff-weems/democrat-weems-says-texas-has-one-inspector-every-/	Seeking a seat on the Texas Railroad Commission, Houston lawyer Jeff Weems said the commission’s in charge of making sure a disaster like the BP oil spill doesn’t happen in Texas. The Democratic nominee went on to tell the United Auto Workers caucus at the party’s state convention June 25: "Right now, there is one inspector for every 4,500 wells. You can’t do that job." Understaffing in the extreme? We wondered if Weems got that right. In e-mails, Weems told us he heard there’s one field inspector for every 4,500 wells from Paul Whitehead, who works in a commission office in Midland. Weems said that's higher than the 1-for-3,300 ratio he got earlier from ProPublica, which describes itself as "an independent, non-profit newsroom that produces investigative journalism in the public interest." ProPublica published an article in December 2009 saying the Texas commission had 83 field inspectors, "meaning each person is responsible for almost 3,300 wells, many of them requiring several visits in a year." It quotes Weems saying: "It's one of the worst-kept secrets around the state that the wells that are ostensibly checked once a year aren't. They could double the number of inspectors and still be straining their staff to do their job." Whitehead referred us to the commission’s Austin headquarters where spokeswoman Ramona Nye confirmed that of late, there are 86 inspectors for 394,365 oil and gas wells, including 282,150 active wells. As of May 28, 2010, these included 740 bay and 341 offshore wells in state waters, which extend about 10 miles offshore. Overall, that makes the inspector/wells ratio about 1-to-4,586. Agency charts show the number of wells under the commission's watch is up 11 percent from Jan. 24, 2003. The commission’s executive director, John Tintera, told us that the commission has sought additional inspectors, with mixed results. The Legislature nixed a request for seven inspectors in 2003, he said, but in 2009 it OK’d two new pipeline inspectors and authorized four more well inspectors, contingent on revenue from fees deposited in the state's Oilfield Cleanup Fund. However, the money needed to make the hires did not accumulate. Nye said the agency hasn't decided whether to request funding for more inspectors from the 2011 Legislature. In an e-mail, Weems was critical of the current staffing level: "You cannot actively monitor that many wells - there is no way you can go by, inspect what is going on - check for leaks, condition of the premises, etc., except once every 3-5 years, and then only if you fly." The commission's spokeswoman, Nye, said inspectors drive to well sites instead of flying. Tintera told us every well isn’t inspected every year; instead, inspectors focus on wells where there’s greater production or environmental sensitivity. He initially indicated the commission has enough inspectors to fulfill demands: "What Texas needs is what we have." Tintera later said the commission would "welcome more resources, including inspectors. However, we recognize the budget constraints facing the state. Therefore the RRC prioritizes its inspections, uses outriders (inspectors who work from home) located near the oil fields they inspect to maximize efficiency, and has not included inspector positions in the hiring freeze that is currently at the agency." All in all? Weems accurately recaps the number of oil wells per inspector in Texas. His statement is True.	None	Jeff Weems	None	None	None	2010-07-15T06:00:00	2010-06-25	['None']

pomt-03468	"Rhode Island has a [inmate] recidivism rate of over 60 percent."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/jun/16/harold-metts/state-sen-harold-metts-says-more-60-percent-inmate/	Even a short prison sentence can resonate through a person's life for decades. In recent years, members of the General Assembly have proposed various bills intended to help reformed criminals avoid the stigma of their criminal record once they have completed their sentences at the Adult Correctional Institutions. One such bill passed the Rhode Island Senate on June 6, 2013. S-358, which is now before the House for consideration, would give the Parole Board the authority to issue a "certificate of recovery and re-entry" to any ex-convict who has paid all fines and other penalties imposed by a court and has exhibited good conduct for a certain period of time -- one year if he was convicted of a misdemeanor and three years if he was convicted of a felony. Think of it as a "diploma" for graduating from ACI-U. However, anyone convicted of a felony crime of violence or any ex-con with more than one felony on his record would not be eligible for a certificate. State Sen. Harold M. Metts, D-Providence, told the Senate, "When you think that Rhode Island has a recidivism rate of over 60 percent, imagine the amount of money we can save taxpayers if we opened up the door for people to get gainful employment so they that they wouldn't have to go back to crime." We wondered whether more than 60 percent of inmates actually get in trouble again and end up back in prison. After leaving a message for Metts to ask about his source, we called the Rhode Island Department of Corrections. Spokeswoman Susan Lamkins said the standard used there and at other prison systems is to count how many former inmates end up being sentenced for another crime and returned to prison within three years of their release. The department is in the midst of its latest analysis, looking at how many of the 3,699 inmates released from prison in 2009 -- the Class of 2009, as it were -- end up back in custody. According to the data from the first two years, the recidivism rate for those returning because they have been sentenced for a new crime is 42 percent. (When such a study was last done, with the Class of 2004, that recidivism rate at the two-year mark was 46 percent, so it seems to be declining. The rate for three years was 54 percent, closer to Metts’ "over 60 percent.") When we got through to Metts, he said his estimate was "probably an old number." He referred us to Nick Horton, program coordinator and policy specialist at Open Doors, a Providence organization that helps people who have been released from prison. He noted the 54 percent recidivism rate after three years from the study of inmates released in 2004 But Horton also focused on a very separate category in that study -- 64 percent of offenders released in 2004 ended up back at the ACI within three years because they had been rearrested, couldn't afford bail and were awaiting trial. But there’s a problem with that percentage: not all of those people were true recidivists, in the Corrections Department's definition. Some ended up being exonerated. Some received a sentence that didn't involve jail time. (In the most recent report, 50 percent of the Class of 2009 were brought back to prison to await trial.) Of course, any study that only follows released inmates for three years is going to underestimate the lifetime recidivism rate because, as Metts noted, it fails to account for criminal cases that aren't going to be resolved until after the three-year mark. "Those that are strong spiritually can last a little bit longer, but when you're out and you can't get a job because your record is haunting you, people lose hope," he said. "Even if I was wrong, 42 percent is still way too high and that's not helping the taxpayers. We need to change our public policy to allow people to reclaim their lives so that they can become productive members of society." Our ruling State Sen. Harold Metts said, "Rhode Island has a recidivism rate of over 60 percent." For better or worse, recidivism rates are usually calculated based on how many former inmates are found guilty of a subsequent crime and end up back in prison within three years. The most recent data from the Department of Corrections cover two years and the rate is 42 percent. The most recent study to look at a three-year period, which covered inmates released in 2004, put the rate at 54 percent. The only way to get above 60 percent is to use the older study and look at an entirely different category: the number of ex-convicts who were brought back to the ACI because they had been charged with a new crime or with violating their probation. But that percentage is flawed as well because it includes at least some people who would never have seen a jail cell if they had been able to afford bail. Metts offered his "over 60 percent" as a definitive statistic. It's not. Although most of the measures we saw offered a lower number, those studies only followed the former inmates for three years or less, an artificial cutoff that makes it easier to collect statistics yet doesn't reflect the fact that anyone who goes back to prison after three years is still regarded as a recidivist. The bottom line: the longer inmates are followed, the higher the percentages get. And they get close enough that we regard Metts' claim as Mostly True.

pomt-00157	Says a recent opioid bill that reached his desk had "very little Democrat support."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/24/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-opioid-bill-didnt-get-much-demo/	Did Democrats try to shirk efforts to pass a bill on opioids that President Donald Trump recently signed? Trump said they did at a rally in Lebanon, Ohio, on Oct. 12. He said, "I'll soon sign into the law the largest legislative effort in history to address the opioid crisis where just this year we got $6 billion from Congress — thanks to (Ohio Republican Sen.) Rob Portman and a lot of others — thank you, Rob — but Rob and so many others helped. Very little Democrat support." Was this a mostly Republican-backed bill? Not at all. In fact, it garnered as close as you can come to universal support in this politically polarized era. The bill offered such provisions as barring fentanyl from being imported by mail, expanding the ability of nurses to prescribe medication to counter opioid addiction, and enhanced access to treatment for Medicaid recipients. It was originally introduced in June by several House Republicans and Democrats. The Democrats included Reps. Peter DeFazio of Oregon, Richard Neal of Massachusetts, Frank Pallone of New Jersey, and Tim Walz of Minnesota. The initial version passed the House by a 396-14 margin and the equivalent version passed the Senate by a 99-1 margin. After the chambers ironed out their differences, the final version passed the House 393-8 on Sept. 28 and the Senate 98-1 on Oct. 3. (The only vote against the bill in the Senate — on both versions — was by a Republican, Mike Lee of Utah.) The bill then went to the president, but he hasn’t officially signed it yet. The New York Times called it "rare bipartisan accord." The bill’s bipartisan nature was among the top themes in news coverage. We reached out to the White House but did not hear back. Our ruling Trump said the recent opioid bill had "very little Democrat support." That couldn’t be further from the truth. Virtually every Democrat (and virtually every Republican) voted for the bill on the floor. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-05560	"Before this law, any group could go out anywhere, register voters, sit on the voter registration forms for unlimited amount of time."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/apr/05/lenny-curry/voter-registration-groups-registrations-lenny-curr/	The Republican-led Florida Legislature approved a controversial election law in 2011 that said third-party groups that collect voter registrations must submit them within 48 hours or face fines. Republicans said that the new rules were necessary to prevent fraud, while Democrats said it would suppress the minority vote. Civic groups including the Florida League of Women Voters are challenging the law. A March 2012 New York Times story stated that the law had curtailed voter registration drives in Florida by groups such as the League of Women Voters, Rock the Vote and on college campuses. Since the law took effect, 81,471 fewer Floridians registered than during the same period in 2008, according to the New York Times. It’s difficult to determine how much of the drop in registrations is due to the new law or to other factors, such as less excitement compared to the 2008 race. The new voter registration rule is not in effect in five counties, including Hillsborough County, because those counties require pre-clearance from the federal government under the Voting Rights Act. The day after the article, Florida Republican Party chair Lenny Curry discussed the new rules in an interview on MSNBC on March 28. Host Chris Matthews explained that "the new law dramatically narrows the window that third-party groups are given to submit completed voter registration forms -- without facing a fine, that is. Before the law, they had 10 days. Now we have 48 hours to bring those forms back in." Matthews asked Curry, "Is it reasonable to expect a person to show up within 48 hours with registration forms that they just had filled out say over a weekend?" Curry: "Absolutely. Again, it’s good governance. Before this law, any group could go out anywhere, register voters, sit on the voter registration forms for unlimited amount of time. The individual that registered to vote would have no idea whether or not their voter registration was submitted, and if the right party was submitted." Was Curry correct that before the law, third-party groups could sit on those completed forms for an unlimited amount of time? The 10-day rule The answer depends on whether we rely on a strict reading of the former law or the reality of its enforcement. The old law stated that third-party groups had to submit the registrations within 10 days. (That deadline could potentially be even shorter if election deadlines were approaching in less than 10 days.) But the law didn’t provide a method to track whether the third-party groups complied with that time restriction, said Chris Cate, a spokesman with the Florida Secretary of State. When third-party groups dropped off voter registration applications, the forms did not identify the groups. "They could turn them in a month late, but we wouldn’t know who turned in the forms," Cate said. "Though the law said 10 days, there was no way to know for sure that the groups had met that deadline. People ask how big a problem it was before the (new) law. We really don’t have a way to measure that. There was no way to track how many of these forms were coming in late." Although the old law stated that late registrations could result in fines for third-party groups, no group was fined, Cate said. Under the new law, third-party groups receive an identifying number, which they must place on the voter registration applications they submit. Applications collected by these organizations must be turned into the state Division of Elections or a county supervisor of elections within 48 hours or the next business day if the office is closed for that 48-hour period. Groups can meet the requirement by mailing in the forms. The new law includes fines starting at $50 for each application received after 48 hours and a maximum of $1,000 per calendar year per group. The amounts of the fines are the same as the old law but kick in after 48 hours rather than 10 days. (During the MSNBC interview, host Matthews and Judith Browne-Dianis, co-director of the Advancement Project, a group that fights for voting rights, said it was up to $10,000, which is inaccurate.) Since the new law went into effect in May 2011, the Division of Elections has sent 16 informational letters to third-party groups that didn’t follow the 48-hour rule and recommended that the attorney general fine three groups. There have been no fines as of early April 2012, according to attorney general spokeswoman Jenn Meale. Lee Rowland, an attorney representing the Florida League of Women Voters in its quest to halt implementation of the law, said that even under the old law, there was a mechanism for complaints. Any citizen who believed a community based group didn’t fill out a form in a timely manner could have filled out a complaint form. When the Legislature pursued the 48-hour window, supporters cited anecdotes about third-party groups submitting "dumps" of registrations, Rowland said. But they cited the same anecdotes in 2011 as they did when the Legislature approved the 10-day rule in 2005. After its original passage, the 10-day deadline faced a court challenge. In 2007, it was amended to impose a $1,000 cap on fines and was upheld by the courts. "It seems pretty clear to me the 10-day rule likely took care of any problems the Legislature was concerned about," Rowland said. Republican Party of Florida spokeswoman Kristen McDonald said that during the MSNBC interview, Curry was often interrupted and not given the opportunity to fully explain the context of his statement. "Despite what the law may have said as far as number of days, there was no mechanism or ability of the state to enforce that number of days," she wrote in an email. Our ruling Before the 48-hour registration law was imposed, Curry explained that "any group could go out, register voters, sit on the voter registration forms for unlimited amount of time." Actually, the prior law had a 10-day rule for turning in voter registrations. Curry has a point that the state didn’t enforce the law -- an explanation he originally omitted. The state could have instituted measures to enforce the 10-day rule, instead of moving to the stricter 48-hour rule. Curry's comment gives the impression there was no rule at all. If third-party voter registration groups were sitting on registrations for unlimited amounts of time, even before the new measure, they were breaking the law. We rate Curry's statement Mostly False.

pomt-10074	"The biggest job of the surgeon general is to translate health care and health care needs into plain English."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/13/howard-dean/surgeon-general-spokesman-public-health/	President-elect Barack Obama's widely reported intention to appoint Sanjay Gupta, a 39-year-old neurosurgeon and CNN reporter, as the nation's surgeon general has drawn flak from several directions. Gupta is known primarily for his work as a TV reporter, though he's clearly identified as a medical doctor. A number of commentators have attacked Gupta's health care reporting for criticizing Michael Moore's film Sicko in a segment on CNN. A blogger at Gawker joked that Gupta must have beat out Dr. Quinn Medicine Woman. Some advocates of the Commissioned Corps, a team of federal health workers led by the surgeon general, say the job should go to someone who rose through the ranks. Defenders of the choice, including former Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, Democratic National Committee chair Howard Dean, and the consumer advocates at the nonprofit Center for Science in the Public Interest, have cited Gupta's communication skills. Here's how Dean put it in a Jan. 7, 2009, appearance on MSNBC's Hardball : "I think he's a great appointment," Dean told host Chris Matthews. "I'll tell you why he's a great appointment. The biggest job of the surgeon general is to translate health care and health care needs into plain English that people can understand, ordinary people can understand. That's what Sanjay Gupta has been doing for a living for quite a while." Communication is indeed a major part of the job. Surgeons general have long held the symbolic post of the "nation's doctor," offering advice on smoking cessation, obesity, AIDS prevention and a host of other public health issues through speeches, news conferences, congressional testimony and formal reports. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, under which the surgeon general serves, lists this sort of public outreach as the first of seven official duties of the surgeon general. In congressional hearings about the nature of the position in 2007, former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop said "he or she should be the health educator for Americans par excellence." A subsequent surgeon general, David Satcher, said the office has evolved since its inception in 1873 but "what has not changed about the Surgeon General’s Office is its direct responsibility for communicating with the American people based on the best available science, and its responsibility for responding to public health emergencies." So yes, by job description, tradition and widespread consensus, the surgeon general is the medical communicator in chief, you might say. But that's not the whole truth. The surgeon general also oversees the Commissioned Corps of the U.S. Public Health Service, 6,000 uniformed public health workers assigned to other government agencies, such as the National Institutes of Health. His administrative duties over the corps are limited, to be sure, because the positions are funded and the officers overseen day-to-day by the heads of the agencies to which they're assigned. But he sets standards for the corps, has significant administrative responsibilities and serves as the group's titular leader. More significant is the surgeon general's customary responsibility to represent the federal government on various elite boards and commissions. Past surgeons general have sat alongside national and global health experts at the National Library of Medicine, the American Medical Association and the World Health Organization, for example. In these settings, medical gravitas would seem to matter far more than mass-communication skills. But most importantly, Dean glossed over a crucial component of the public outreach part of the job — you have to know what to say. Surgeon generals don't just present public health initiatives, they craft them. Surgeon generals' reports — the landmark example of which is Smoking and Health, the 1964 report in which the government first spelled out to the public that smoking causes lung cancer — are generally years in the making. "It's not like you just sit down and write this report," Richard Carmona, who served as the 17th surgeon general, from 2002 to 2006, said in a telephone interview. "They take a long time and they only happen if you have the credibility and knowledge to extract this information properly. You're working with people at the Centers for Disease Control, the National Institutes of Health, you're looking at heart science, clinical science — your credibility comes in. Your peers have to respect you and see you as a nonpartisan arbiter of the best science." Gupta is a practicing neurosurgeon and an assistant professor of neurosurgery at Emory University School of Medicine, and he writes a column for Time magazine in addition to reporting for CNN. We'll leave it to Congress and others to decide whether that qualifies him to be surgeon general. And if Gupta does get the position, he and Obama have a certain amount of latitude to make of it what they like. But being doctor to the nation has traditionally involved more than just advising it on health issues — you have to check up on it first. Surgeon general is a public health position, not a public affairs position. Communication may be the "biggest part of the job" in a sense, but many other medical and administrative skills are required. We find Dean's statement Half True.

pomt-13543	"All of Texas is conservative, except a little bit of Austin."	false	/texas/statements/2016/aug/26/sean-hannity/sean-hannity-incorrect-all-texas-conservative-save/	Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, took note of a brief protest during the Austin taping of his Aug. 23, 2016, interview of Donald Trump by characterizing the state’s politics. "All right," Hannity said amid shouts, "all of Texas is conservative, except a little bit of Austin." Without question, Austin largely tilts left. At the time Hannity spoke, Travis County had no countywide elected Republicans while its Texas House delegation consisted of five Democrats and one Republican. In 2012, President Barack Obama carried 60 percent of the county’s vote to Republican Mitt Romney’s 36 percent. We focused on Hannity’s larger point — that the rest of Texas is conservative. In Hannity’s favor: No Democrat has won statewide since 1994 (when Democrats won five of 10 statewide non-judicial races). Also, no Democratic presidential nominee has captured the state since Jimmy Carter edged Gerald Ford by 129,019 votes in 1976 (a November so long ago that Donald Trump was only 30 and and Hillary Clinton had just turned 29). Statewide in 2012, Romney beat Obama by more than 1 million votes, carrying 57 percent to Obama’s 41 percent, leaving Texas pretty darned red, per this Politico map: SOURCE: "Election Special, 2012 Texas Presidential Results," Politico, last updated Nov. 19, 2012 But contrary to Hannity’s statement, Austin wasn’t the only blue dot on the 2012 map. Obama won much of the traditionally stalwart-Democratic border region including El Paso County plus the urban counties of Bexar (home to San Antonio); Dallas; Harris (home to Democrat-dominant Houston); and Jefferson (home to union-strong Beaumont). Two years later, Republican Greg Abbott trounced Democrat Wendy Davis for governor, doing well nearly everywhere outside the Mexico border region. Politico’s map (below) shows that beyond border counties, Davis outpolled Abbott only in Travis and Dallas counties. SOURCE: "2014 Texas Governor Election Results," Politico, update Dec. 17, 2014 (accessed Aug. 25, 2016) Otherwise, meantime, Democrats show some local strengths--and not only in Austin or near Mexico. As of August 2016, when Hannity spoke, Dallas County’s judge (the county’s top executive position) was Democrat Clay Jenkins while five other countywide officeholders, including Sheriff Lupe Valdez, were Democrats, per the county’s Democratic Party. District Attorney Susan Hawk was the sole Republican in a countywide elected post. In contrast, neighboring Tarrant County, home to Fort Worth, remained a Republican stronghold; by our count, per a county Republican Party list, Republicans held all six countywide elected posts. Also, the state’s most-populous county, Harris, had just one Democrat in a major countywide post--Vince Ryan, the county attorney. Ryan won re-election in 2012 along with another Democrat, Sheriff Adrian Garcia. Garcia resigned in 2015 to bid for mayor and he was replaced with a Republican, Ron Hickman, who seeks re-election in November 2016. Bexar County, meantime, had a longtime Democratic leader as county judge, Nelson Wolff, as well as Democrats Albert Uresti, the tax assessor-collector, and Nicholas "Nico" LaHood, the county’s criminal district attorney. Then again, voters also had in place a Republican sheriff, Susan Pamerleau, seeking a second term in 2016; a Republican county clerk, Gerard "Gerry" Rickhoff, who’d held the office for more than two decades; and a Republican district clerk, Donna Kay McKinney. We also asked the state parties to assess Hannity’s claim, which by email Mike Joyce of the Republican Party of Texas called "fair." Manny Garcia of the Texas Democratic Party noted Democratic gains in some parts of the state and pointed out that when Texas voters participating in a June 2016 University of Texas poll were asked to place themselves on a seven-point scale running from extremely liberal to extremely conservative, 39 percent chose "in the middle." Otherwise, 18 percent self-identified as liberal, 44 percent as conservative. Our ruling Hannity said: "All of Texas is conservative except a little bit of Austin." If Hannity had solely singled out the state's many rural and suburban counties, he'd have a point.

pomt-09806	Health reform will "give every American the same opportunity" to buy health insurance the way members of Congress do.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/10/barack-obama/national-health-insurance-exchange-has-restriction/	President Barack Obama extolled the virtues of a national health insurance exchange in a speech to a joint session of Congress. "If you lose your job or change your job, you will be able to get coverage," Obama said. "If you strike out on your own and start a small business, you will be able to get coverage. We will do this by creating a new insurance exchange – a marketplace where individuals and small businesses will be able to shop for health insurance at competitive prices." Obama went on to compare this exchange to the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan, which is offered to all federal employees. (We've written about this plan previously.) "Insurance companies will have an incentive to participate in this exchange because it lets them compete for millions of new customers. As one big group, these customers will have greater leverage to bargain with the insurance companies for better prices and quality coverage. This is how large companies and government employees get affordable insurance. It's how everyone in this Congress gets affordable insurance. And it's time to give every American the same opportunity that we've given ourselves," he concluded. But saying every American will get the same opportunity that Congress has to purchase insurance is not correct. There are several key differences between the Federal Employee Health Benefits Plan and the national health insurance exchange. The biggest issue is that there are significant limitations on who gets to use the exchange. Right now, the House bill allows in individuals and people who work for small businesses. Pending legislation in the House says that only individuals and small businesses of fewer than 10 employees would be able to use the exchange during the first year, and only individuals and small businesses with fewer than 20 employees in the second year. In the third year, businesses are allowed in "based on the number of full-time employees of an employer and such other considerations as the Commissioner deems appropriate." This sounds like employers will gradually be allowed into the exchange based on size, as well as "other considerations as the (health exchange) Commissioner deems appropriate." But people who can get insurance through a large employer will not be eligible to purchase on the exchange if their employer offers a plan that meets minimum requirements for coverage. We should also add that many employers offer only a few choices of plan. Some only offer one plan. Federal employees, on the other hand, choose from an array of plans, with different levels of coverage. They are part the largest employer-sponsored program in the world, covering over 9 million employees, retirees, former employees, family members and former spouses, according to the Office of Personnel Management's Web site. To say, as Obama does, that "every American" could get similar coverage as Congress on the exchange is not accurate. People who can get insurance through work are specifically excluded under the House bill. Obama lays out the right categories of people who would be allowed to shop ont the exchange in the first part of his statement: people who lose coverage or who are part of a small business. But he crossed a line when he told Congress, "It's time to give every American the same opportunity that we've given ourselves." There are significant limitations on who will be allowed on the exchange. We rate his statement False.

pomt-10477	Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama want to raise capital gains taxes, which apply to home sales.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/16/chain-email/capital-gains-taxes-often-dont-apply-to-homeowners/	A chain e-mail accuses Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama of wanting sharp tax increases, while praising Sen. John McCain for holding the line. ( Click here to read the chain e-mail in its entirety .) The e-mail asserts that Clinton and Obama want to raise capital gains taxes and dividends taxes, as well as raise tax rates for all income levels . We'll look at the capital gains taxes claim here. So what is a capital gains tax? The Internal Revenue Service explains: "Almost everything you own and use for personal purposes, pleasure or investment is a capital asset." When you sell an asset for a profit, that profit margin is your capital gain, and the IRS taxes you on it. Capital gains taxes vary depending on the income level of the tax filer and the length of the investment, with separate tax rates for short-term vs. long-term capital gains. Here's what the e-mail says about capital gains taxes: "CAPITAL GAINS TAX MCCAIN 15% (no change) OBAMA 28% CLINTON 24%" "How does this affect you?" the e-mail asks. "If you sell your home and make a profit, you will pay 28% of your gain on taxes. If you are heading toward retirement and would like to down-size your home or move into a retirement community, 28% of the money you make from your home will go to taxes. This proposal will adversely affect the elderly who are counting on the income from their homes as part of their retirement income." The item lists 15 percent as the current rate, and that is a correct number for long-term capital gains for higher income brackets. Obama has said he would raise the capital gains tax rate to somewhere between 20 percent and 28 percent, depending on how much he needs to pay for his health care plan. (The long-term rate was generally 20 percent prior to the Bush tax cuts.) After we received this e-mail, Clinton addressed the capital gains tax in some detail at a debate in Philadelphia on April 16, 2008. "I wouldn't raise it above the 20 percent if I raised it at all," Clinton said, adding, "I'm going to have to look and see what the revenue situation is." We talked with a spokesman for a business-backed tax policy group and he said he expects either Democrat would raise the capital gains rate. "Unless they just go back on all their campaign promises to raise taxes on high-income people, these are the taxes that they're talking about," said William Ahern of the Tax Foundation, which advocates for a transparent, progrowth tax code. But there's another problem with the e-mail's statements, specifically the implication that all home sales are subject to the capital gains tax. Many home sales are exempt from the capital gains tax. As long as they meet rules requiring that they've lived in their home, homeowers don't have to pay the capital gains tax if the profits on their home are less than $250,000 for a single person or $500,000 for a married couple. The rule applies to workers and retirees alike, said Eric Toder, a tax policy expert with the Urban Institute in Washington, D.C. To summarize, the e-mail is right that Obama wants to raise the capital gains rate, though it pegs the high end of a range he's suggested. Clinton, meanwhile, would consider raising it to 20 percent, not the 24 percent stated in the e-mail. It's also important to note that because the tax code allows for significant capital gains on a homestead before capital gains taxes are levied, most homeowners are exempt. In the end, the e-mail's statements on the capital gains tax are more wrong than right; we rate it Barely True. Update: This statement has been updated to reflect comments the Democratic candidates made about the capital gains tax at a debate in Philadelphia on April 16, 2008. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-08161	Providence teachers "can go five or six years without an evaluation."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/dec/03/angel-taveras/taveras-says-providence-teachers-go-five-or-six-ye/	When Mayor-elect Angel Taveras takes over as Providence's chief executive next month, he will inherit the largest and one of the most troubled school systems in the state. Taveras, himself a product of the city's school system, promised during his campaign to push for the development of more rigorous teacher evaluations. In a post-election appearance on WPRI-12's "Newsmakers" last week, Taveras repeated that pledge. "With respect to teachers, we need to recruit the very best teachers, to give them the support they need and to evaluate them," he said. "Let me explain what I mean. Right now teachers can go five or six years without an evaluation. Five or six years! I was shocked to learn that when I was running for office. We're beginning to change that." Unlike the mayor-elect, we'll stop short of saying we were "shocked" to hear that. But, if true, it certainly seems infrequent, particularly for new teachers. Taveras' team didn't provide backup for his statement, so we consulted the Providence teachers contract, available online. We learned that as per the contract, non-tenured teachers, those who have been on the job fewer than three years, must be evaluated once a year by their school principal or another administrator. But Providence teachers automatically become tenured after three years and the vast majority of them -- 94.4 percent of the 1,939 teachers -- are tenured, according to the Providence School Department. For those teachers, the performance review timetable is less specific. The contract stipulates: "Tenured teachers shall be evaluated on a scheduled basis. The schedule shall be constructed by the Teacher Evaluation Committee." That committee, made up of district officials as well as union representatives, has long dictated that tenured teachers be evaluated every five years. That means that once a teacher receives tenure at three years, he or she is not reviewed again until his or her eighth year, then the 13th year and ongoing on a five-year cycle, said Thomas Ramirez, the assistant superintendent of human resources. District officials and Providence Teacher's Union President Steve Smith both say the five-year schedule is nearly always followed. The only exception would be if a principal determines that a particular teacher is struggling and needs a more immediate performance review. So Taveras' claim that teachers can go five years without an evaluation is accurate. Given the district's small number of untenured teachers, most do go that long. The mayor-elect stretches the numbers a bit, however, when he references the six-year figure. We find this statement to be Mostly True. But while we have your attention, we want to mention the larger context. Like Taveras, the teachers union and the district agree that the evaluation system needs improvement. Kim Rose, spokeswoman for the Providence schools, said the district believes teachers need to be evaluated more frequently and with "a more robust evaluation tool." Right now evaluations are more like brief snapshots of a teacher's performance. They typically involve one or more short classroom visits, but no formal analysis of the teacher's lesson plans, or of the performance of his or her students. Both the state Department of Education, led by Education Commissioner Deborah A. Gist and the teachers union have launched efforts to develop more rigorous review policies. The Rhode Island affiliate of the American Federation of Teachers has received multiple grants, including one from the federal government to help in its effort. Over the past several months, the two sides have been working together to merge their initiatives and have suggested they could unveil a shared evaluation model next year. Whether Providence moves forward with the change that stakeholders on all sides say they want will be, in part, up to Taveras. After months of critiquing the schools that educated him, the mayor-elect will soon have a direct hand in shaping the School Department that educated him. We'll be watching to see whether he makes good on those promises.	None	Angel Taveras	None	None	None	2010-12-03T00:01:00	2010-11-27	['None']
pomt-04300	Says Charlie Bass supports Paul Ryan plan that forces seniors to pay $6,400 a year more for health care so millionaires can pay less in taxes.	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2012/oct/31/house-majority-pac/does-supporting-ryan-budget-plan-mean-you-want-sen/	If there’s any doubt the role Nashua, NH will play in the upcoming election, look no further than Main Street. A recent campaign television commercial attacking U.S. Rep Charlie Bass, R-NH, features men and women holding handwritten signs up and down Main Street, quoting Bass calling GOP vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan’s Medicare plan "A great statement of principle." The advertisement was put out by The House Majority PAC -- not to be confused with The New Hampshire House Republican Victory PAC. The House Majority PAC is a committee "designed help win back the House Majority for Democrats," according to its website, and calls Bass out for voting for Ryan’s plan to "essentially end Medicare to give more tax breaks to millionaires." "Charlie Bass said, ‘I voted for Chairman Ryan’s plan because it is a great statement of principle,’" the narrator states. "Seniors would pay $6,400 a year more for health care so millionaires can pay less in taxes. That's Charlie Bass' great statement of principle." PolitiFact has heard similar claims about Ryan’s budget resolutions many times before. But we hadn’t examined whether those savings would go to bankroll tax cuts for millionaires. Even looking at the health care question alone can get tricky because some earlier, related claims reference Ryan’s plan for 2012, which was proposed in 2011. It is important to note the "Principle" ad revolves around a statement Bass made after he voted to support Ryan’s 2013 budget resolution, and cites a March 29, 2012 article in the Manchester Union Leader, although Bass did vote for Ryan’s plan in 2011. The Romney-Ryan Medicare plan PolitiFact has checked this claim through a President Barack Obama television advertisement that said Ryan’s plan could raise "future retirees’ costs more than $6,000," noting that Ryan released his initial Medicare plan in early 2011. Under this plan, Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services to one in which beneficiaries would be paid an amount by the government that they could use toward private insurance premiums, affecting people who today are under 55 only. The plan was approved by the GOP-controlled House before dying in the Senate. Ryan offered updated versions of the plan as part of his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal, with two key differences from the original. The newer version allows beneficiaries under 55 a choice -- they can use their payment to buy private insurance or for a plan that acts like traditional Medicare. Meanwhile, the size of the payment would be set by the market -- the price of the second-cheapest plan. So is the most recent Ryan plan also official policy for the Romney campaign? It appears to be. In an interview with a Green Bay, Wis., television station back on Aug. 15, Romney said, "Paul Ryan and my plan for Medicare, I think, is the same, if not identical -- it's probably close to identical." This history is important because of how opponent campaigns frame the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan in their ads. The $6,400 question Ads using the claim of a $6,400 increase in out-of-pocket costs cite a report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank. Here’s what the group said: "In 2022, the first year the voucher would apply, (the Congressional Budget Office) estimates that total health care expenditures for a typical 65-year-old would be almost 40 percent higher with private coverage under the Ryan plan than they would be with a continuation of traditional Medicare," center president Bob Greenstein wrote. "CBO also finds that this beneficiary's annual out-of-pocket costs would more than double — from $6,150 to $12,500. In later years, as the value of the voucher eroded, the increase in out-of-pocket costs would be even greater." The difference between $12,500 (the out-of-pocket costs under the Ryan plan in 2022) and $6,150 (the out-of-pocket costs that year under traditional Medicare) is $6,350, which is very close to $6,400. In an interview, Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, emphasized that the numbers his group used came from CBO, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, and that the center’s role was just to take the CBO analysis and make it "more understandable." In fact, different groups have made slightly different calculations of the out-of-pocket increase -- the Kaiser Family Foundation, for instance, tabulated the number to be $6,870 -- but the estimates we’ve seen are all in the same ballpark. But the problem is the CBO analysis, and the others built on those CBO numbers, refer to the original Ryan plan, not to the current one. The current plan is slightly more generous in how fast it allows subsidies to grow as health care costs increase, while still keeping spending lower than current projections. Ryan also made a number of other technical changes to address concerns that the credits wouldn’t keep up if medical costs kept going up and up. As we mentioned before, the amount a beneficiary receives, for example, would be based on the second least-expensive plan available on a Medicare exchange. That means while the traditional Medicare offering — if it’s more expensive than the second-least expensive plan — could cost seniors more out-of-pocket, it’s unlikely to cost them as much as estimates for Ryan’s earlier plan. "CBO has not analyzed the policies that might be implemented to produce such a path for Medicare spending, including a premium-support approach to Medicare of the sort that Chairman Ryan and other Members of Congress have recently discussed," CBO wrote earlier this year. The Obama campaign has said it would be happy to update its numbers if CBO or the Romney-Ryan campaign provided new data, but neither has. Peter Orszag, Obama’s former Office of Management and Budget director, recently wrote that "if Ryan believes that changes to his plan since (the original plan was released) would result in any different conclusions, he should request that CBO publish an updated analysis." There is one clue that the number wouldn’t be close to $6,400. A study published Aug. 1, 2012, in the Journal of the American Medical Association says that if Ryan’s plan had been in place in 2009, the cost of the second-cheapest Medicare Advantage plan (and thus the size of the premium support payment) would have been 9 percent less than traditional Medicare. That would have required an out-of-pocket payment for seniors who wanted to use traditional Medicare of $64 a month — which adds up to about $800 a year. Van de Water said one should specify which version of the Ryan plan they’re talking about if they’re going to speculate. But he did say that the Obama campaign’s decision to use the old numbers was defensible. "It also seems reasonable to cite the most recent available analysis" when Ryan has not provided enough detail to do a new one. How about those millionaires But what about the charge that Bass is supporting changes to Medicare so "millionaires can pay less in taxes"? For that portion of the claim, the House Majority PAC cited an April 2011 Wall Street Journal article about Ryan’s 2012 budget proposal, titled "GOP Aim: Cut $4 Trillion." They singled out this sentence: "Conservative activists who are familiar with the Ryan plan said they expect it to call for a fundamental overhaul of the tax system, with a 25% top rate for both individuals and corporations, compared to the current 35% top rate." They also pointed to another Center on Budget and Policy Priorities report, published a year later, titled "New Tax Cuts in Ryan Budget Would Give Millionaires $265,000 on Top of Bush Tax Cuts." The report cites Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center findings that say people earning more than $1 million a year would receive an average of $265,000 apiece in new tax cuts under Ryan’s plan, on top of the $129,000 they would receive from the Ryan budget’s extension of President Bush’s tax cuts. PolitiFact has found that there’s not a direct link between the proposed changes to Medicare and tax rates for the wealthy. They’re separate policy areas, and legislation affecting each area would typically be handled separately. Nevertheless, choices about spending and taxes are not entirely unrelated, given the imbalance in the federal budget in recent years and the significant debt that is building up, said Maya MacGuineas, president of the bipartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. PolitiFact asked her about the Democratic claims we’ve noticed this year in congressional races around the country, where ads claim that specific spending cuts "pay for" tax breaks for the wealthy. "It’s a huge fight over priorities and semantics," she said. "But it’s difficult to say that one is linked to the other." Still, she added, hard choices are ahead for the federal budget in terms of both taxes and spending. "No one should be talking about any tax cuts or spending increases until we have a plan to get the budget under control," she said. Our ruling: PolitiFact gave President Obama a Half True for an ad that would have been more accurate if it specified it referred to a previous Ryan plan for Medicare, rather than the current one. In The House Majority PAC’s case, it plays off a Bass quote about his support of the 2013 congressional budget plan, then uses calculations for the plan Ryan proposed the previous year. Bass did vote for both Ryan plans, but the 2013 plan lacks enough details to truly determine how much more money seniors may have to pay for Medicare. And where President Obama used the phrase "could" to cite cost increases by more than $6,000 -- giving his claim a little more wiggle room -- The House Majority PAC uses the phrase "would," taking the $6,400 estimation a step further because it implies greater certainty. On top of that, experts say it’s too difficult to determine how the Romney/Ryan proposed changes to Medicare have a direct link to the tax rates that would be set for the wealthy. We give them a Mostly False.	None	House Majority PAC	None	None	None	2012-10-31T17:58:38	2012-09-26	['None']
pomt-05230	Says he "cut the budget."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/jun/06/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-says-state-treasurer-he-cut-budget/	Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, the Republican hoping to unseat incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown from the U.S. Senate in November, makes at least five separate claims in a attacking Brown or promoting his own candidacy. Among the ad’s claims: Mandel "cut the budget." Cut the budget? How did Mandel cut it? Setting the state budget is the job of the governor and General Assembly. PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look and put the question to Mandel’s campaign. They backed up the statement by citing a report released by the treasurer's office last July after a self-described "top to bottom review" from his first six months in office. "By targeting waste and improving operations," it says, the treasurer’s office ended the 2011 fiscal year with a $400,000 surplus that was returned to the general fund. The general revenue fund operating budget for the 2012-13 biennium was reduced by $1.2 million, the report says. The reductions in expenses range from $2,000 that had been used for an outside contract for a plant-watering service to $850,000 saved by reducing budgeted full-time employees from 140 to 127. We looked at supporting documentation from the Legislative Service Commission and Office of Budget and Management, and at news coverage of treasurer's office operations. The coverage included reports that the treasurer’s overall budget had actually increased, from $38.3 million in fiscal 2011 to $41 million in 2012, the current fiscal year. Looking more closely, however, we found that the treasurer’s overall budget includes state funds and benefits programs administered by the treasurer's office. The general revenue fund total, the portion of the budget that covers operating expenses, does decrease from the 2010-2011 biennium to 2012-2013, according to the Legislative Service Commission. The amount appropriated by the General Assembly for operating expenses -- the spending over which the treasurer has the most direct control -- decreased from $8.2 million in fiscal 2011 to $7.7 in fiscal 2012 and 2013, according to the legislative Service Commission. So where does Mandel’s claim that he "cut the budget" rate on the Truth-O-Meter? His statement is accurate. His office finished the last fiscal year with a surplus and his office cited specific steps it took to spend less money. Also, the money appropriated for operating expenses for this fiscal year and the next fiscal year is reduced from the FY 2011 total. There is additional information, though, that provides clarification. As seen in the ad, some listeners might interpret his bare claim that he cut the budget as meaning he trimmed the state budget. Money for the state budget, including the treasurer’s office, is set by the General Assembly and the governor. And the overall total appropriated for his office in FY 2012 and FY2013, when including state funds and benefits programs administered by the treasurer's office, is actually greater than FY 2011. On the Truth-O-Meter, Mandel’s claim rates Mostly True.	None	Josh Mandel	None	None	None	2012-06-06T06:00:00	2012-05-23	['None']

In a back and forth with former labor secretary Robert Reich, Brazile said Congress created a policy that puts BP -- not the federal government -- in charge of the response. "The present spectacle of the Coast Guard asking BP to speed up this clean-up is absurd. I mean, the federal government needs to be in charge," Reich, a former Labor Secretary under President Bill Clinton, said. "The president needs to be in charge of this. Use BP's expertise. Use BP's resources. But the president must be in charge of all of this. Otherwise, he looks like he's just standing on the sidelines." "Well," Brazile said, "the administration has been constrained by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which basically gives the responsible party the lead role in trying to not only fix the problem, but contain the problem," Brazile responded. "That has been the problem from day one. They've waited for BP to come up with the answers, and we know that BP continues to mislead people." In this fact-check, we wanted to see if Brazile's interpretation of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 is right -- particularly when it comes to deciding who has the lead role. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 was passed in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez spill in Prince William Sound in 1989. The law was designed to better coordinate the government response to a major oil event, and to set penalties for companies responsible. It was approved by Congress and signed into law on Aug. 18, 1990. In general, it gives the president more authority in an oil event, not less. "When responding to a spill, many considered the lines of responsibility under the pre-OPA regime to be unclear, with too much reliance on spillers to perform proper cleanup," according to a Congressional Research Service report. "OPA strengthened and clarified the federal government's role in oil spill response and cleanup." The Oil Pollution Act included amendments to the Clean Water Act to provide the president three options in the wake of an oil event, the Congressional Research Service concluded. The president could: Perform cleanup immediately ("federalize" the spill); Monitor the response efforts of the spiller; Or, direct the spiller's cleanup activities. The Environmental Protection Agency describes the OPA this way: "The OPA improved the nation's ability to prevent and respond to oil spills by establishing provisions that expand the federal government's ability, and provide the money and resources necessary, to respond to oil spills." BP ultimately is liable for the cost of cleaning up the spilled oil. The Oil Pollution Act caps additional economic damages at $75 million, but BP has said it will pay all legitimate claims, and some Democrats in Congress want to lift the cap and apply it retroactively. President Obama has said he wants to update the laws to "make sure that the people in the Gulf, the fishermen, the hotel owners, families who are dependent for their livelihoods in the Gulf, that they are all made whole and that we are in a much better position to respond to any such crisis in the future." Still, under the law as it stands today, BP will be paying for the clean-up, and the federal government -- thanks to the OPA -- ultimately has authority over how the clean-up proceeds. We asked Brazile, a native of New Orleans who still has family living there, if there was something we were missing. Brazile said she was trying to point out that the Oil Pollution Act, and the options the president had, may have contributed to the federal government not taking the lead sooner. "The Administration had every reason to take the lead and not wait," Brazile said. "Perhaps they waited -- and I used the reference to the Act -- as one reason why they did not take the initial lead." Brazill also suggested her statement -- which was criticized by the conservative website Newsbusters -- was being used to score political points in the middle of a national crisis. Her first concern, she said, is that people in the Gulf states suffering get help. But in this case, her interpretation of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, is incorrect. She said the law "basically gives the responsible party the lead role in trying to not only fix the problem, but contain the problem." In fact, the Oil Pollution Act specifcially gives the federal government the authority to decide who's in charge of the clean-up -- the polluter or the government. The company, in this case BP, will pay for the clean-up response. But the federal government can give the orders if it chooses. We rate Brazile's statement False.

pomt-06892	"The deficit was on track to top $1 trillion the year I took office."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/27/barack-obama/obama-says-deficit-was-track-top-1-trillion-year-h/	In a televised address to the nation on July 25, 2011, to discuss the pending deadline on the debt ceiling, President Barack Obama laid out his version of how the deficit situation got to where it is. And Obama placed much of the blame at the feet of his predecessor, George W. Bush. "For the last decade, we’ve spent more money than we take in," Obama said. "In the year 2000, the government had a budget surplus. But instead of using it to pay off our debt, the money was spent on trillions of dollars in new tax cuts, while two wars and an expensive prescription drug program were simply added to our nation’s credit card. "As a result, the deficit was on track to top $1 trillion the year I took office." We've dealt with the "what-Obama-inherited" question before. Obama's suggestion that the deficit woes the country now faces are the result of Bush's tax cuts and an expensive prescription drug program -- rather than the recession -- is certainly debatable. But since many Republicans are blaming the problem on reckless spending by Obama, we decided to check his claim that "the deficit was on track to top $1 trillion the year I took office." In January, 2009, just prior to Obama being sworn in as president, the government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) released an estimate of the projected deficit for the 2009 fiscal year (which straddled both Bush's and Obama's terms). According to the CBO report, "The ongoing turmoil in the housing and financial markets has taken a major toll on the federal budget. CBO currently projects that the deficit this year will total $1.2 trillion, or 8.3 percent of GDP." The CBO cited a number of factors for why the federal fiscal situation would be "dramatically worse" in 2009 than 2008. According to the CBO, "A drop in tax revenues and increased federal spending (much of it related to the government’s actions to address the crisis in the housing and financial markets) both contribute to the robust growth in this year’s deficit. Compared with receipts last year, collections from corporate income taxes are anticipated to decline by 27 percent and individual income taxes by 8 percent; in normal economic conditions, they would both grow by several percentage points. In addition, the estimated deficit includes outlays of more than $180 billion to reflect the cost of transactions of the TARP." In addition, the CBO noted, as a result of the recession, the federal government boosted spending on programs such as those providing unemployment compensation and nutrition assistance. Again, this was the deficit projection for 2009 before Obama took office. The CBO acknowledged it might get worse. "That total ($1.2 trillion deficit), however, does not include the effects of any future legislation," the CBO noted. "Enactment of an economic stimulus package, for example, would add to the 2009 deficit." As we know, of course, the Democrat-controlled Congress did pass a massive economic stimulus package. And, in fact, due in large part to the stimulus, the actual deficit for 2009 ended up about $200 billion more than the CBO projected in January 2009. An April study from the Pew Charitable Trust found that a combination of factors -- increased government spending, tax cuts and the economic downturn -- were mostly to blame for the large budget deficits. But Dean Baker, a liberal economist and co-director of the center for Economic Policy Research, argued in a piece published on the Huffington Post on July 27, 2011, that it's really the recession, and not any policy decisions from the Bush presidency, that are to blame for the unsustainable deficit projections. If the unemployment rate returned to the 4.7 percent rate of 2007, he wrote, the bulk of the deficit would disappear. To lay the budget crisis on Bush tax cuts is misleading, Baker wrote. "In its budget projections from January 2008, the last set before the impact of the collapse of the housing bubble was clear, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projected a deficit of just $198 billion for 2009," Baker wrote. "This is less than one-fifth of the 'on track to top $1 trillion' figure that President Obama gave in his speech. This is a serious error. Rather, Baker wrote, "It was the recession, and the response to it, that pushed the deficit in 2009 from the $198 billion projected by CBO to the over $1 trillion noted by President Obama in his speech." "No one can justify wasting money on wars that should not have been fought, giving away tax breaks to people who don't need them, or deliberately designing a prescription drug benefit so that it needlessly hands hundreds of billions of dollars to drug companies and insurers," Baker wrote. "But even with all of this waste, the deficit was still not out of control." We're not going to wade into the debate over how much of the deficit to assign to Bush or Obama's policies. Obama may be laying too much blame for the deficit crisis on Bush policies, and not enough on the recession. But the economic downturn was in full bloom when Obama took office and he is correct that before he enacted any policies as president, the CBO projected a 2009 deficit of $1.2 trillion (as well as significant projected deficits in years to come as well). We rate his statement True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2011-07-27T15:56:19	2011-07-25	['None']
pomt-10044	"The Obama Administration wants to have soldiers and officers pledge a loyalty oath directly to the office of the President, and no longer to the Constitution."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/feb/11/chain-email/bloggers-military-oath-bogus/	Two weeks ago, Matthew Avitabile, a 22-year-old grad student in upstate New York, decided to write a tongue-in-cheek blog item that said President Obama wanted soldiers to stop taking an oath to the Constitution and instead pledge their loyalty to the president himself. Under the fake name Michele Chang — a name he dreamed up because he had just been talking to someone named Michele — Avitabile wrote a bogus news story that quoted a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs saying, "The president feels that the military has been too indoctrinated by the old harbingers of hate: nationalism, racism, and classism. By removing an oath to the American society, the soldiers are less likely to commit atrocities like those at Abu Ghraib." Avitabile labeled it satire in a note beneath the story, but in the superheated world of political blogs, where passions often run faster than reason, that wasn't enough. The label got left off and his bogus story was quickly copied and pasted on blogs, zapped around the country through chain e-mails, and discussed in YouTube commentaries. Many people didn't bother to verify it and responded with comments of outrage. " Who does this megalomaniac think he is?" someone commented on the Web site Digg. "Good g*d---Obama is an egomaniac like we've never seen before. Another Hitler on the rise. This guy is just trashing everything the Consitution stands for," wrote someone named Kitty on the blog Tree of Liberty. Someone identified as bill122460 posted a commentary about it on YouTube titled " OBAMA S HITLER OATH THIS IS MESSED UP ." "He don't belong in office," bill122460 said in the five-minute commentary. "End of story." He added that it was "a Hitler oath. I told you! Welcome to the United States of Nazi Germany!" It's clear that bill122460 and many other people didn't know it was satire. Some of the blog postings referred to Michele Chang as if she were a well-known (and real) writer. "Michele Chang: bama wants to have soldiers and officers pledge a loyalty oath directly to bama, not the Constitution," said one. Some blogs were eventually corrected, or people posted comments that said the article was a fake, but others still carry the fake article. Brent Johnson, a radio host who posted the item on his Voice of Freedom blog, said he posted it without verifying it because "This is one of those stories where, if it is true, is so, so serious. It’s the kind of thing people need to know about in the chance it is true." But now that Johnson has heard it is a satire, he said he will revise or remove the item. Avitabile, a Republican who had previously poked fun at Obama with a tongue-in-cheek article that said scientists had determined that he was "genetically superior," is thankful for all the traffic it generated for his blog Jumping in Pools. In the past he was lucky to get 1,000 hits on a story, but this one got more than 50,000. Yet he's disappointed that so many people published his work without verifying it. "Out of the 50,000 who looked at it, only three had the good sense to contact me and see if it was true," he told us (PolitiFact was one of the three). Avitabile described himself as a moderate Republican — "I'm pro-gay rights, pro-wind energy" — but said he was surprised that so many in his party had such negative feelings about Obama. "People wanted to believe this about the president so bad, that he would really go toward a dictatorship so much that they would go with it without checking it," he said. Indeed, we all know that passions run high in politics, but it's remarkable to us that so many people would pass along something that is so obviously ridiculous without verifying it. But we should have expected this. During the campaign, we found people were passing along e-mails claiming that Obama wanted to adopt the Coke theme song as the National Anthem . So now, as we did for that one, we've got to set the meter ablaze. And this claim is not just Pants on Fire wrong. It's a reminder that if you get something shocking in your inbox, you should check it out before you pass it along.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2009-02-11T15:11:49	2009-01-30	['None']
pomt-03821	Said the year before he took office, the state lost 119,000 private-sector jobs, labeling them "Corzine jobs losses of 2009."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/mar/21/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-119000-private-sector-jobs-l/	Jon Corzine may be nearly four years removed from the governor’s office, but that hasn’t stopped Chris Christie from invoking the Democrat’s name when he wants to make a point about how far New Jersey has come since Corzine left government. Christie brought up his name in a keynote address on March 6 to the commercial real estate development association at the Sheraton Edison Hotel Raritan Center, where he talked about how many private-sector jobs the state lost during Corzine’s last year in office. Christie said the year before he took office, the state lost 119,000 private-sector jobs, labeling them "Corzine jobs losses of 2009." Christie’s number is in the ballpark. Let’s explain how job gains and losses are measured before we look at the Republican governor’s numbers and whether Corzine is truly to blame for those lost jobs. First, we review data that is seasonally adjusted, meaning the data takes into account those jobs that result from seasonal hiring patterns. When looking at annual data, we review December over December to get the most accurate picture of employment for that 12-month period. Now let’s look at numbers from both the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development. Both agencies show New Jersey had 3,209,900 private-sector jobs in December 2009. A year prior, the state had 3,325,600 private-sector jobs. That’s a net loss of 115,700 jobs. Joseph J. Seneca, an economics professor with the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, agreed with that figure. It’s worth noting that in other fact-checks about private-sector job gains and losses in New Jersey, Christie had cited a figure of 117,000. By either measure, Christie’s numbers are off a bit. One reason is that the BLS has "benchmarked" its numbers, according to the state Labor Department. "Benchmarking at BLS has taken place, which is a backward look at the numbers and adjustments based on newer, fuller data," Labor Department spokesman Brian Murray explained in an e-mail. "It is done annually, and the look back goes anywhere from two years to further back." BLS spokeswoman Stacey Standish confirmed how benchmarking works. Next, we need to determine whether Corzine really is to blame for those lost jobs. Let’s point out that the first half of 2009 – Corzine’s last year in office – was marked by recession. The National Bureau of Economic Research, a private nonprofit research group, has said the ‘Great Recession’ began in December 2007 and ended in June 2009. Lingering effects from the economic slowdown, however, have continued. Also, as economic experts have told us for previous and similar rulings about private-sector job growth in New Jersey, the governor not only can’t take all the credit for job gains, he can’t pin blame for loss solely on another administration when there are other factors at work. Christie spokesmen Michael Drewniak and Kevin Roberts did not return a request for comment. Our ruling Christie said the year before he took office, the state lost 119,000 private-sector jobs, labeling them "Corzine jobs losses of 2009." Christie is off a bit, since data from the BLS and state Labor Department show that New Jersey lost 115,700 jobs from December 2008 to 2009 – a period marked by the height of the recession, and something that economic experts have told us cannot be blamed solely on one person. Since the governor’s number is off slightly and the claim implies that Corzine is to blame for those job losses, we give Christie a ruling that he’s had before on these types of fact-checks: Half True.

pomt-10497	As first lady, Clinton would travel to places that were "too small, too poor or too dangerous" for the president.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/04/hillary-clinton/she-was-no-emissary-to-the-obscure/	Right before delivering a speech on Iraq policy at George Washington University on March 17, 2008, Hillary Clinton reflected on her days traveling as first lady. It was then that she said she remembered landing under sniper fire in Bosnia, a claim that's been widely debunked. (Including by us: We called it a Pants on Fire fib.) She also said, "There was a saying around the White House that if a place was too small, too poor or too dangerous, the president couldn't go, so send the first lady, and that's where we went." We analyzed Clinton's international travel based on recently released White House schedules, interviews with traveling companions and scholars, as well as news reports from those trips. We found that Clinton went to many places that were large, wealthy and safe. We documented travel to 82 countries, and the top 10 list looks like an itinerary any travel agent could sell. Our analysis showed that when Hillary Clinton traveled without her husband during the eight years she was first lady, she spent the most days in these countries: Morocco 7 Austria 6 India 6 Italy 6 Switzerland 6 Turkey 6 Czech Republic 5 Egypt 5 Israel 5 Poland 5 They may not be the top NATO allies, but we can't consider any of these countries to meet the trifecta of small, poor and dangerous. Yes, she did go to places like Iceland (pretty small), Eritrea (poor) and Bosnia (arguably dangerous at the time she visited). But her travel itinerary is hardly a tour of the world's most obscure countries. Rather, her travels tended to emphasize stable allies of the United States, many of which are quite populous. To view our interactive map of Clinton's foreign trips as first lady, click here. When she traveled with President Clinton, her schedule may have been a little more glamorous, with more time spent in France, England and Russia. But her solo itinerary was no tour of tiny, dangerous places. So we find her statement to be Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2008-04-04T00:00:00	2008-03-17	['Bill_Clinton']
pomt-07995	"Recent studies have confirmed that any academic benefits of government funded preschool disappear by the fourth grade."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/16/glenn-grothman/wisconsin-state-sen-glenn-grothman-says-recent-res/	On Dec. 21, 2010, the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction issued a news release celebrating the expansion of 4-year-old kindergarten. The programs are now part of 85 percent of the state’s school districts. In all, 41,176 state children are enrolled in 4-K programs offered by 350 school districts and 84 private schools through the parental choice program. State Schools Superintendent Tony Evers attributed the growth to the fact "school districts know the value of early education for young children." On Dec. 29, 2010, state Sen. Glenn Grothman, R-West Bend, issued his own take. He believes school districts use 4-K to pad their budgets with additional state aid and that the programs are a pet project of the teachers’ unions. He urged Republican Gov. Scott Walker to "immediately announce he will not provide any more money for four-year-old kindergarten." Grothman said it was critical that Walker act soon because the Madison school district is adding 4-K in 2011, a move he says will cost $10 million a year in state aid. In the release, Grothman said there was a "lack of any credible evidence that 4-K programs are beneficial to young children." He added: "Recent studies have confirmed that any academic benefits of government funded preschool disappear by the fourth grade." Welcome to the latest installment of the kindergarten wars, where students, parents, academics, policy groups and politicians of all stripes mix it up like, well, kids in one of those play areas filled with plastic balls. We asked Grothman to back up his statement, which presents the value of 4-year-old kindergarten as a settled issue, one "confirmed" by the studies. He pointed us to a 2006 report by the "free-market" Pacific Research Institute, a 2006 report by the libertarian Reason Foundation, and a Dec. 20, 2010, e-mail from Reason Foundation staffer Lisa Snell that summarized programs around the country and included a transcript from an Oklahoma City television news report. The studies are from 2006, which is not all that recent. And both are from groups that come at issues from a particular point of view, not independent academic researchers. Let’s take a look. The Pacific Research Institute report was commenting on a ballot proposition in California that would give students a year of voluntary 4-K in public schools. It concluded: "Given the empirical holes that exist in the evidence for universal preschool, it would seem premature in the extreme to entrench an untested, expensive program, run by poorly performing government bureaucracies, into the state constitution." The Reason Foundation report cited a National Center for Educational Statistics study of 22,000 children and said it found "no lasting reading, math, or science achievement differences between children who attend half day and full-day kindergarten." It concluded: "We find widespread adoption of preschool and full-day kindergarten is unlikely to improve student achievement." The e-mail from Snell, one of the authors of the Reason Foundation’s study, noted that Oklahoma's fourth-grade reading score in 1998, when it adopted universal preschool, was 219. Her comments noted: "Last year, it had dropped to 217 -- three points below the national average. Similarly, its math score was at par with the national average in 2000. Last year, it had dropped two points below. Since employing universal preschool, not only is Oklahoma doing worse compared with the nation -- but also its own prior performance." Now a broader view. The 4-K programs in question have been around for decades. A rudimentary review shows they have been studied at length. We found a huge body of research -- including entire academic institutes and researchers at politically oriented think tanks -- devoted to the subject. We are not trying to settle the question of whether the programs are good or bad for performance of young students. We are looking at Grothman’s claim that the recent studies effectively close the debate on the question. We turned to several national experts, including Steve Barnett, director of the National Institute for Early Education Research, based at Rutgers University. According to that group’s website, Barnett: "reviewed 22 long-term studies of the effects of preschool in a 1993 article entitled Does Head Start Fade Out? Each study followed children from preschool until at least 3rd grade. Results from these studies show that initial gains in children's IQ scores tended to disappear over time. However, gains in graduation rates, as well as declines in special education placements and grade retention, were maintained." Barnett added: "There is considerable evidence that preschool programs of many types -- including Head Start -- have persistent effects on academic ability and success. There is no convincing evidence that these effects decline over time." A summary of recent research on 4-K programs by the institute cites 20 academic reports and studies. It makes no mention of work conducted by the Reason Foundation or the Pacific Research Institute. Another study, which looked at 123 comparative studies of early childhood interventions, concluded: "significant effects were found in this study for children who attend a preschool program prior to entering kindergarten. Although the largest effect sizes were observed for cognitive outcomes, a preschool education was also found to impact children’s social skills and school progress." Finally, an Education Week commentary by Nobel Prize winning University of Chicago economist James Heckman, who was part of a pre-kindergarten study, concluded: "I now believe that early interventions with children are not so productive if they are not followed up with ongoing investments in children during their elementary and secondary school years. Instead, we need to invest early in children — and not stop. And by ‘invest’ I do not simply mean that government should be pumping money into new social programs for disadvantaged youths." OK, time for recess. The debate over 4-K is about more than whether kids benefit in their later schooling. It’s about money, politics, social agendas and more. For support of his position, Grothman said recent reports "confirm" that academic benefits are soon lost. Some studies reached that conclusion. But Grothman is citing one small portion of a much broader debate and declaring the whole matter settled when there is considerable evidence on the other side. We rate Grothman’s statement False.

pomt-10482	Obama supports "teaching schoolchildren — in 2nd grade, no less — about homosexual relationships."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/15/focus-family-action/one-comment-does-not-a-platform-make/	A letter from the conservative group Focus on the Family Action makes a multifaceted attack on Sen. Barack Obama in an attempt to portray him as someone who would be "the most left-wing president in our nation's history." The article, written for the organization's Web site and widely circulated via chain e-mail, tries to paint Obama as bad for families, accusing him of everything from trying to further "the homosexual agenda" to being soft on the war against terrorists. Focus on the Family Action is the lobbying arm of Focus on the Family, an organization founded by evangelical Christian Dr. James Dobson. One of the claims in the article, written by Tom Minnery, senior vice president of Focus on the Family Action, states: "Then there's his support for teaching schoolchildren — in 2nd grade, no less — about homosexual relationships." This is a reference to a question that was asked in a Democratic debate in New Hampshire in September 2007. During the debate, Allison King of New England Cable News talked about a controversial fairy tale about a prince who marries another prince that was taught to a second-grade class in Massachusetts. The Dutch tale, called King and King, is about a prince whose mother pressures him to find a princess but who ends up falling in love with and marrying a princess' brother. Two parents filed a lawsuit, saying they were upset that a book with homosexual themes was taught to their 7-year-olds without alerting them first. The lawsuit was dismissed. King asked if the Democratic candidates would be comfortable having the story read to their children as part of their school curriculum. The question was first put to Sen. John Edwards, who responded, "Yes, absolutely." Edwards went on to say that he wants his children to understand the discrimination that gay and lesbian couples face. Asked how he felt about it, Obama responded, "You know, I feel very similar to John. You know, the fact is my 9-year-old and my 6-year-old I think are already aware that there are same-sex couples. My wife and I have talked about it. One of the things I want to communicate to my children is not to be afraid of people who are different, because there have been times in our history where I was considered different, or Bill Richardson was considered different. "And one of the things I think the next president has to do is to stop fanning people's fears. If we spend all our time feeding the American people fear and conflict and division, then they become fearful and conflicted and divided. "And if we feed them hope and we feed them reason and tolerance, then they will become tolerant and reasonable and hopeful." Minnery said that means Obama supports teaching about homosexuality in elementary schools. "That's obviously the agenda of that book," Minnery said. "If you assent to teaching that book, you assent to that agenda. It's the same thing. They didn't say, 'I'm no longer speaking as a Democratic candidate.' " Obama's campaign did not respond to questions about the Focus on the Family Action statement. But there's nothing in Obama's stated education platform that speaks to any initiative to require or encourage teaching second-graders about homosexuality. In fact, the question in the debate was whether the candidates would be comfortable if that book was taught to their child in school. Obama said he would be okay with it. Focus on the Family's statement is a stretch at best. We rate the statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published.

At her weekly press conference, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., made the case for reauthorizing the Children’s Health Insurance Program, or CHIP, for as long as possible. CHIP provides health coverage to certain low-income children and pregnant women whose family income levels are above the threshold to obtain Medicaid coverage. It is funded jointly by the federal government and the states. In 2016, CHIP served 8.9 million beneficiaries. The reauthorization "should have been done in September, first of all," Pelosi said in her Jan. 18, 2018. "Second of all, we wanted 10 years … which, by the way, saves $6 billion." Republicans, she added, rejected a 10-year reauthorization. "Doing it for six years saves $1 billion. That's good," she said. "Doing it 10 years, saving $6 billion is better. In fact, it's best." A few days later, after government funding had lapsed, lawmakers decided to include a six-year CHIP reauthorization in the bill that reopened the government. We were struck by Pelosi’s claim that a federal program to provide health coverage for 8.9 million children and pregnant women could actually save the government money, rather than costing it. So we took a closer look. When we contacted Pelosi’s staff, they pointed us to a Congressional Budget Office analysis of the pending reauthorization bill that had been released the previous day, Jan. 17. CBO is Congress’ nonpartisan arbiter of projected costs of legislation. CBO said that a six-year CHIP reauthorization would produce an additional $8.204 billion in revenue, but only $7.223 billion in additional costs. That means a cumulative savings of $981 million, or nearly $1 billion. (It’s in the chart on page 4 here.) As for a 10-year reauthorization, Pelosi’s office pointed us to a Jan. 11, 2018, CBO analysis. The report projected a 10-year reauthorization "would decrease the deficit by $6 billion over the 2018-2027 period." So Pelosi was correct on the numbers. The broader question: Why does CHIP save the government money? In short, it’s because the alternatives cost more. According to CBO, "extending funding for CHIP for 10 years yields net savings to the federal government because the federal costs of the alternatives to providing coverage through CHIP (primarily Medicaid, subsidized coverage in the marketplaces, and employment-based insurance) are larger than the costs of providing coverage through CHIP during that period." "It’s a very popular program across party lines, and the CBO score had it saving money," said Linda Blumberg, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who studies health care policy. Our ruling Pelosi said that reauthorizing the Children’s Health Insurance Program "for six years saves $1 billion" and that doing it for 10 years saves $6 billion. CBO analyses back up Pelosi’s numbers. Because the reauthorization of CHIP would essentially take the place of more expensive programs, doing so would eventually net savings for the government.

pomt-05904	"United States of America is twenty-sixth in school performance in the world."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/03/jim-whelan/united-states-ranks-26th-school-performance-world-/	New Jersey students may perform better than their counterparts in many other states, but from a global perspective, students across the United States are falling behind. State Sen. Jim Whelan (D-Atlantic) raised that point during a Jan. 9 debate on the Senate floor about the Urban Hope Act. That legislation, passed by the Legislature and quickly signed into law by Gov. Chris Christie, allows nonprofit entities to build and run schools in three failing districts. Before casting his vote in favor of the bill, Whelan told his fellow legislators that "we’ve got to change the conversation" and consider a longer school year. "Let’s look where we are in the world. We’re twenty-sixth," said Whelan, a teacher in Atlantic City. "United States of America is twenty-sixth in school performance in the world." PolitiFact New Jersey found the numbers that back up Whelan’s statistic, but due to the margins of error attached to the average test scores, the 26th ranking may not be completely accurate. Let’s explain the test we’re talking about. The test -- known as the Programme for International Student Assessment, or PISA -- is overseen by the Paris, France-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The test assesses 15- and 16-year-olds for reading, math and science. The PISA was administered in 65 countries or economies in 2009, and another 10 participants in 2010. Of those 75 participants, the United States ranks 26 when the mean scores in the three subject areas are averaged out. Anthony Jackson, vice president for education at Asia Society, a global educational organization, said in an email that such a composite ranking gives a "broader sense of how student performance in the US (or any nation) compares with that of other nations beyond its performance in any one subject area." Andreas Schleicher, head of the OECD's Indicators and Analysis Division in the Directorate for Education, told us averaging the scores is acceptable, but he cautioned: "I would still not call this ‘overall performance’ since there are a number of school subjects not measured by PISA (e.g. history, geography or music)." But rankings may not be as clear-cut when factoring in the margins of error attached to the average scores. Those margins of error make it difficult to rank countries for both the individual subject areas as well as the composite averages, according to Dana Kelly, co-national project manager of PISA in the United States. "It may appear that the U.S. average is lower (or higher) than another country when actually there is not a measurable difference in the average scores," Kelly said in an email. "Likewise, countries ‘above’ us may not have measurably different average scores from each other so (it) gets even more difficult to figure out where we are in a ranking." "We understand that people want to know where the US stands, but ranking is just tricky," Kelly added. Beth Schroeder, Whelan’s chief of staff, defended the senator in an email: "The point Senator Whelan was trying to make still stands. By any measure, the United States is lagging behind the rest of the world in school performance. Whether we’re 26th or some other rank once you factor in the margin of error, we should be striving to have the best educational system in the world, and shouldn’t settle for anything but first." Our ruling During a debate on the Senate floor, Whelan claimed the "United States of America is twenty-sixth in school performance in the world." Based on the most recent international assessments, the senator’s statistic is on target. After averaging out the mean scores in reading, math and science, the United States ranks 26 out of 75 participating countries or economies. But since those mean scores are subject to margins of error -- which could alter the rankings -- we rate the statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-13764	Says Hillary Clinton "wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/21/donald-trump/despite-new-adverb-trumps-claim-about-clinton-want/	In officially accepting the GOP presidential nomination, Donald Trump tried to finesse one of his favorite but false attacks on the campaign trail: "My opponent wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment," Trump said July 21 in Cleveland. It’s nice that Trump added the word "essentially," but the charge is still not without faults. When we last looked at the claim, we found no evidence that Clinton has ever said she wants to repeal or abolish the Second Amendment. She has called for stronger regulations, but continuously affirms her support for the right to bear arms. However, gun rights advocates argue that it’s reasonable to infer from a few comments that she wants to roll back the Second Amendment as it’s currently interpreted. Straight shooting on the campaign trail In both her 2008 and 2016 White House bids, Clinton has called for more gun control all the while saying she "believes in the Second Amendment." Here are a few examples of comments she’s made: • January 2008, Democratic presidential debate: "I believe in the Second Amendment. People have a right to bear arms. But I also believe that we can common-sensically approach this." • August 2015, in response to the on-air murders of a news crew in Virginia: "We are smart enough, compassionate enough to balance legitimate Second Amendment rights concerns with preventive measures and control measures, so whatever motivated this murderer ... we will not see more needless, senseless deaths." • January 2016, on Twitter: "Nobody's attacking the Second Amendment. We can protect Americans' rights — and also protect families from gun violence. #GOPdebate" • June 2016, on ABC’s This Week: "I believe we can have common-sense gun-safety measures consistent with the Second Amendment." (More on this later.) Setting aside the bulk of Clinton’s comments on protecting the Second Amendment (examples here, here, here, here, here and here), we’ll now go over three points that some gun rights advocates and experts say gives Trump’s charge some credence. Smoking guns? Clinton riled the gun lobby with two eyebrow-raising comments last fall and one from this spring. Clinton said in October 2015 a national gun buyback program like Australia’s compulsory program was "worth looking into." After a gunman killed 35 people in Port Arthur, Tasmania, in 1996, Australia banned semiautomatic and automatic weapons and enacted a mandatory buyback of the newly prohibited guns. That program is "incompatible with private ownership of guns," Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, told us in May. (The National Rifle Association shares this view.) The full context of Clinton’s response, however, suggests she may have misspoken or not fully understood Australia’s program, as she also evoked voluntary buybacks as potential models for a U.S. program. Second, Clinton said in a leaked recording of a private fundraiser that she thinks the Supreme Court "is wrong on the Second Amendment," referring to its landmark ruling in District of Columbia vs. Heller. In a 5-4 decision, the Court struck down Washington’s handgun ban and recognized that the Second Amendment applies to the individual’s right to bear arms. Experts who support gun rights told us undoing Heller basically ends the Second Amendment as currently interpreted. They pointed out that former Justice Department officials under President Bill Clinton and his appointees Stephen Breyer and Ruth Bader Ginsburg argued in Heller that gun regulations do not violate the Second Amendment because it primarily pertains to a well-regulated militia, not the individual right to bear arms. Clinton, in her June interview on This Week, added fuel to the fire when she appeared to talk about the individual right as a hypothetical. "Do you believe that their conclusion that an individual's right to bear arms is a constitutional right?" host George Stephanopoulos asked. "If it is a constitutional right, then it, like every other constitutional right, is subject to reasonable regulation," she responded. "And what people have done with (the Heller) decision is to take it as far as they possibly can and reject what has been our history from the very beginning of the republic, where some of the earliest laws that were passed were about firearms." The NRA and voices on the right seized upon these comments as proof that Clinton doesn’t really believe in the individual right to bear arms. But that ignores what she said immediately after: "So I think it's important to recognize that reasonable people can say, as I do, responsible gun owners have a right — I have no objection to that. But the rest of the American public has a right to require certain kinds of regularity, responsible actions to protect everyone else." UCLA Second Amendment expert Adam Winkler, meanwhile, said that the accuracy of Trump’s charge depends on Clinton’s grounds for rejecting Heller. (According to news reports from the 2008 election, she supported Washington’s handgun ban.) "If she thought the reasoning was wrong, but the result right, then she would fit in with a number of strong pro-gun advocates," he said. "If, however, she thought there should be no protection for gun rights, then Trump's claim comes closer to the truth." The Clinton campaign previously told us Clinton "believes Heller was wrongly decided in that cities and states should have the power to craft common sense laws to keep their residents safe." This suggests Clinton disagrees with the court declaring the district’s ban on handguns unconstitutional, not necessarily the individual right itself — a position that’s more or less in line with the George W. Bush administration’s position on Heller of recognizing the right but allowing reasonable curtailment. Our ruling Trump said, "My opponent wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment." The addition of the word essentially doesn’t change the accuracy of this claim. We found no evidence of Clinton ever saying verbatim or suggesting explicitly she wants to abolish the Second Amendment. The bulk of her comments suggest the opposite: She wants to enact stricter gun control, but has no objection to responsible gun ownership. Gun advocates say Trump’s claim is backed up by Clinton’s openness to a gun buyback program and her disagreement with a Supreme Court decision on the Second Amendment. But whether or not these cherry-picked comments actually reveal Clinton’s intentions is a matter of interpretation. We rate Trump’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/85ef6fa9-d3d9-4a5f-afd2-40af77b1eb94	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-07-21T23:23:50	2016-07-21	['None']
pomt-13219	The stories from women saying he groped or forced himself on them "largely have been debunked."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-reports-sexual-assault-him-have-/	Republican nominee Donald Trump said at the third and final presidential debate that allegations from nine women that he groped or kissed them without their consent have been debunked. "Nobody has more respect for women than I do — nobody," Trump said. "And frankly, those stories have been largely debunked." Have they? We decided to look into Trump’s claim. What we found is that while some accounts have been challenged, none have been shown to be untrue by any objective measure. We’ll discuss the situation surrounding each accuser. Jessica Leeds Leeds told the New York Times that in the 1980s, Trump groped her during an airplane flight to New York. According to the New York Times, Leeds "told the story to at least four people close to her, who also spoke with The New York Times." The Trump campaign offered a contrary account from a man who said he was on that flight. Anthony Gilberthorpe told the New York Post that Leeds was the one who was being flirtatious and that he saw nothing inappropriate. Gilberthorpe has a checkered past involving his revelation that he procured young boys for high-ranking British politicians, but more importantly, he told the Post he has no evidence to support his story. Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson challenged Leeds’ story on the grounds that the airplane Pierson said Leeds flew in didn’t have armrests as Leed’s described. No one knows what sort of plane Leeds was in. For the most part, it’s word against word. Mindy McGillivray McGillivray told the Palm Beach Post that in 2003, Trump grabbed her behind at a Mar-a-Lago concert. McGillivray was assisting photographer Ken Davidoff. Davidoff told the Post reporter he "vividly remembers when McGillivray pulled him aside moments after the alleged incident and told him, ‘Donald just grabbed my ass!’ " The counter information comes from the conservative website thegatewaypundit, which claims that there was no concert on the day Davidoff said. But the website asserts that without proof. Even if the photographer got the date wrong, and there’s no proof that he did, that doesn’t debunk the allegation. Natasha Stoynoff Stoynoff wrote in People magazine that during a pause in a 2005 interview with Trump and his wife Melania, Trump and she were alone in a room briefly where he forcibly kissed her. She told a co-worker, friends and family soon after the event happened but did not include it in her article. The counter information comes from Trump’s former butler Anthony Senecal who told the Palm Beach Post that "it never happened." Melania Trump also disputes later meeting Stoynoff on the street as Stoynoff said. Again, we have the confirmation of Stoynoff’s friends, and at most, it’s her word against Senecal’s. Summer Zervos Zervos was a former contestant on Trump’s reality show The Apprentice. She said she went to Trump’s golf course in Palos Verdes, Calif., in 2007 to apply for a job and Trump forcibly kissed her and groped her. In a news conference, a social worker said that Zervos told her about the encounter in 2010, years before Trump announced his presidential bid. Trump posted on Facebook that he never met Zervos at a hotel and that she stayed in touch with him. Trump wrote that as recently as April this year, she invited him to come to her restaurant in California. Also, Zervos’cousin said she only had good things to say about Trump. Trump’s account raises questions about Zervos’ contact with him, but it does not rebut her claim. Claims from other women There are five other women who say that Trump groped or kissed them without their consent. They are Cassandra Searles, Rachel Crooks, Kristen Anderson, Jill Harth and Temple Taggert McDowell. We found no evidence to undermine their claims other than Trump’s own denials. We asked the Trump campaign to send us details that would disprove the women’s accounts and did not hear back. Our ruling Trump said that the stories of him groping or forcing himself on women "have been largely debunked." His campaign offered no evidence of that. We found that five of the nine stories have not been independently disputed. Of the remaining four stories, the women told friends, family or colleagues at the time, which provides some support. On the flip side, there is the account of Trump’s former butler and a man who acknowledges that he has no proof of his version of events. While some of the women’s stories have been questioned, not one has been conclusively debunked, and the majority of the stories haven’t been challenged by any facts other than Trump’s denials. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fa622a1b-1c53-4b62-b3ec-629c8a468bc5	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-10-20T01:48:46	2016-10-19	['None']

pomt-08525	Ron Klein "sponsored an amendment that specifically allows price gouging."	false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/05/we-love-usa-pac/pac-claims-kleins-amendment-would-allow-price-goug/	A political action committee entered the fray between U.S. Rep. Ron Klein, D-Boca Raton, and his Republican challenger Allen West. The "We Love USA" PAC is not in love with Klein -- the group's website features an image of Klein dangling from puppet strings being directed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The entrance of a PAC isn't surprising in this big-money District 22 battleground in South Florida. When we first spotted the website on Sept. 24, 2010, it had a video posted called "Klein passing gas." A few days later we found the same video on YouTube though the date was June 18, 2008 -- during Klein's previous re-election bid when he also faced West. The 1-minute, 16-second video focuses on gasoline prices. Near the start, text on the screen states, "While the prices at the pump are skyrocketing, Ron Klein speaks strong..." The video shows an undated clip of him apparently speaking on the House floor about giving the Federal Trade Commission "the authority to crack down on the people who price gouge." Then the text says "But Klein lies! ... Ron Klein sponsored an amendment that specifically allows price gouging." We wanted to know, did Klein sponsor an amendment related to gas prices that "specifically allows price gouging"? In South Florida, with limited public transportation options, residents rely heavily on cars -- so gas prices matter to many voters. And in a region prone to gas shortages caused by hurricanes, we're sensitive to the issue of gouging. The video mixes narration, text and photos. The images show a gas station with prices as high as $5.199 a gallon and a blurry image of Klein in front of another station. The text cites an amendment to H.R. 3355 offered by Klein on Nov. 8, 2007, and claims it was "to modify the instruction prohibiting price gouging by replacing it with language discouraging price gouging, thereby legalizing price gouging." It continues: "Middle-class families and their increasingly tight budgets need relief. Not more lies and broken promises. Floridians are paying twice as much at the gas pump as when Ron Klein came to office in 2006... Every time we pump gas into our car or truck, we should remember that Ron Klein allows price gouging!" In the background, Gwen Stefani's sultry voice can be heard singing the hit single "Don't Speak" by No Doubt. First, some background -- and we could find little -- about We Love USA. The group's website states that the PAC was set up on Sept. 23, 2010, and that "Our core mission is simple; showing the voters how the candidates have voted during the Obama administration. Those in Congress who voted with Pelosi on every single important bill are trying to hide their record thru negative attacks and denial of their near unanimous voting with her. We will do our best to not let the voters forget where these politicians stand on the issues." FEC reports show that the PAC filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission Sept. 21 and lists Nancy Watkins, of the accounting firm Robert Watkins and Company in Tampa, as the treasurer. The PAC filed an FEC report Sept. 28 showing it had spent $62,652 on advertising. In an interview with the Miami Herald editorial board Sept. 27, both West and Klein said that they had nothing to do with the PAC. The PAC responded to e-mails about the gas video but not about the PAC itself. Nor did anyone return phone calls. About three hours after our first e-mail Sept. 27 asking about the gas video, the PAC responded that it had taken down the video. "Thank you for bringing to our attention that we should provide links to fact check our videos and statements we place on this website,'' said the e-mail signed "Media Relations." "We have pulled the video 'Ron Klein Pass Gas' as it stated that Ron Klein came to office in 2006. In 2006, Ron Klein became Congressman-Elect, and officially took office in January 2007. Because of this oversight, we have decided to take the video off of the website." But the PAC still stood behind the claim about price gouging, and Mark Laffler of We Love USA e-mailed us the amendments cited in the ad. Let's look at H.R. 3355. The bill, sponsored by Klein in 2007, was called the "Homeowners Defense Act of 2007." The bill was to provide federal support for state-sponsored insurance programs to help homeowners facing natural catastrophes such as hurricanes. On Nov. 8, 2007, U.S. Rep. Ginny Brown-Waite, a Republican who represents west-central Florida, introduced an amendment to "prohibit price gouging in any disaster area located within the State." The amendment defines price gouging as: "providing of any consumer good or service by a supplier related to repair or restoration of property damaged from a catastrophe for a price that the supplier knows or has reason to know is greater, by at least the percentage set forth in a State law or regulation prohibiting such act (not withstanding any real cost increase due to any attendant business risk and other reasonable expenses that result from the major catastrophe involved), than the price charged by the supplier for such consumer good or service immediately before the disaster." Klein responded with his own amendment to strike "prohibit" and insert "discourage." He wanted to soften that price-gouging language because he didn't want to set up a barrier to many states joining the national disaster consortium. The overall bill passed the House, 258-155, on Nov. 8, 2007, but stalled in the Senate. The Homeowners Defense Act of 2010, H.R. 2555, sponsored by Klein is pending. That doesn’t make Klein soft on gasoline price gouging though. We found three laws he voted for that were specifically aimed at prohibiting gas price gouging or limiting gas prices: • Klein was one of 125 co-sponsors and voted for the "Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act" H.R. 1252 in 2007. It would have made it illegal during an emergency to sell gas at an excessive price. That bill stalled in a Senate committee. A related bill, H.R. 6346 the Federal Price Gouging Prevention Act in 2008, failed to become law though Klein did vote for it. • Klein voted for the Gas Price Relief for Consumers Act of 2008 H.R. 6074, which would have made it illegal for foreign states to act together to limit the production of gas or set the price. The related Senate bill S. 879 had hearings but no vote. • Klein voted for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve Fill Suspension and Consumer Protection Act of 2008 H.R. 6022. It passed and "directs the Secretary of the Interior to suspend petroleum acquisition for the Strategic Petroleum Reserve through the royalty-in-kind program" through the end of 2008. Pelosi called for the move to bring down gas prices. This bill was signed into law by President George W. Bush on May 19, 2008. We also wanted to check the ad's claim that gas prices doubled during Klein's tenure in Congress. The PAC, in an e-mail, wrote that the price of gas doubled in 2008 and sent us a link to GasBuddy for historical gas prices in Miami -- which is outside of Klein's Congressional district. We contacted AAA and asked for gas prices for January 2006, January 2007 and the most recent month available in 2010 for Fort Lauderdale -- part of the city lies within the district. AAA’s chart showed a gallon of unleaded gas cost $2.3855 in January 2006, $2.3074 in January 2007, and $2.7175 in September 2010. AAA figures show the average price rose to more than $4 in 2008 in Fort Lauderdale, though the peak was still more than 50 cents short of doubling from the start of Klein’s term. Let's review: the We Love USA PAC had a video on its website that stated "Klein sponsored an amendment that specifically allows price gouging." Klein's amendment was to change the wording from "prohibit" price gouging to "discourage." The PAC interprets "discourage" to mean "specifically allows," which is a stretch. Further, the video suggests to the viewer that the amendment was about gas prices -- but the bill was about homeowners insurance and property damage. We rate this claim False.

pomt-06156	Says Texas did not bail out a loan program he oversaw as state agriculture commissioner.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2011/dec/18/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-loan-program-he-oversaw-wasnt-bail/	In the Dec. 15, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Iowa, Texas Gov. Rick Perry was asked to account for a loan program he oversaw as the state’s agriculture commissioner, the elected post he held from 1991 through 1998. Neil Cavuto of Fox News noted that Perry wants Congress to stop spending so much. "But as Texas agriculture commissioner, you oversaw a loan guarantee program that, as the Austin American-Statesman reported at the time, had so many defaults that the state had to stop guaranteeing bank loans to start-ups in the agribusiness, and eventually bailed out the program with the taxpayer money," Cavuto said. "So aren't you guilty of the same behavior you rail against as a presidential candidate?" Perry replied: "Number one, don't believe everything you read in the Austin American-Statesman. And the second side of it is, we had that program put in place, and the state did not bail (it) out; those programs worked as they were supposed to work. Just like in any bank or any business, you are going to have some that fail." No bailout? As agriculture commissioner, Perry oversaw the Texas Agricultural Finance Authority, which was created in 1987. The authority was launched to boost the agricultural economy by selling state-backed bonds to guarantee bank loans to entrepreneurs who could not get commercial loans. The goal was to create small businesses and jobs by processing — rather than simply growing — Texas agricultural products. A revamped version continues today. The authority’s Agricultural Loan Guarantee program provides loan guarantees to lenders for eligible applicants who wish to establish or enhance their farm and/or ranch operation or an agriculture-related business. According to the Texas Department of Agriculture, applicants may seek a loan of any amount from their local lender, but the guarantee may not exceed $750,000 or 70 percent of the loan amount, whichever is less. Other offerings include a young farmer grant and interest-rate reduction programs. From 1997 through 1999, the Texas state auditor alerted officials to problems in the program, with the problems growing each successive year. Responding to the first hint of problems, Perry said the program was positioned to thrive. In a Jan. 15, 1998, guest column in the Amarillo Daily News, Perry said the program was "on solid footing with a positive balance projected by 2010." He noted too that the loans were funded by debt — commercial paper: "No taxpayer money has ever been used to make TAFA loans." In May 1999, though, the auditor’s office warned that if the program’s loan-guarantee program did "not improve its financial position, appropriations may be required in the future to meet its general obligation debt." The auditor said the loan-guarantee program had a "negative fund equity" of $6.9 million through August 1998 because 22 of 83 loans had defaulted since 1993. "An additional $4.5 million, associated with loans currently in default, may have to be written off," the auditor said. "Because it provides loans that otherwise would not be made, the authority has had difficulty attracting good loans to act as a buffer against its riskier loans," the auditor said. "A certain volume of good loans is needed to ensure that losses are offset and that the programs are self-sustaining; however, the authority has not yet developed financial projections to identify that volume." As bad debt accumulated, the agency in 2002 put a moratorium on new loans in five of eight TAFA programs. As of the end of August 2008, the agency later reported, TAFA had $25 million in outstanding debt with only $6.4 million in loans and $4.1 million in cash available to service the debt. In 2009, the agency asked the Texas Legislature to pay off the loan guarantees with a $14.7 million appropriation. An April 24, 2009, Statesman news article says the authority’s bad loans had been pronounced uncollectable. At the time, Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples told the newspaper in an interview that the authority had distributed about $82 million in loans through the program’s suspension in 2002. Some loans worked out, Staples said, and a study showed the program had created jobs, but Staples acknowledged that the $14.7 million in defaults -- about 18 percent of the total amount lent -- represented a dismal track record. "It's bad," Staples said. "Unfortunately, taxpayers are on the hook for something that happened as long ago as 1987." According to records, the authority’s first bad loans were written off in August 1995. Twenty-nine of 102 guaranteed loans defaulted, almost all of them during Perry's tenure, according to the records, which were provided to the Statesman by the agriculture department. As governor, Perry signed the program’s infusion of aid into law by approving the 2010-11 state budget sent to him by lawmakers. A provision specifies that $14.7 million is appropriated to "retire the debt of the Texas Agricultural Finance Authority," which was restructured by a separate measure. We asked Perry’s campaign about his no-bailout debate statement and didn’t hear back. Asked to describe the 2009 spending, Bryan Black, a spokesman for the agriculture department, called the action a "one-time state appropriation to pay off the debt." Our sense? Taxpayers picked up built-up costs that otherwise could not be covered. It seems reasonable to call that expenditure a bailout. Further, Perry’s contention there was no bailout runs counter to his signing the spending into law -- making his debate claim ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-12827	Says Melania Trump’s security detail at Trump Tower costs more than the annual budget for the National Endowment for the Arts.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/08/social-media/does-melania-trumps-security-detail-cost-more-fede/	Grumbling about the first family’s taxpayer-funded trips and expenses is a time-honored political tradition, no matter the party of the president. Former President Ronald Reagan's two-week stay in Santa Barbara, Calif., ran up a Air Force One tab of at least $250,000 in 1981. President Barack Obama’s golf getaways were the subject of constant conservative consternation. Enter President Donald Trump, the tweeter in chief. People are turning to Trump’s favorite social medium to complain about tax dollars spent protecting first lady Melania Trump and son Barron, who still live in Trump Tower in New York. One common comparison we’ve seen says that Melania Trump’s security detail at Trump Tower costs more than the annual budget for the National Endowment for the Arts, which the administration reportedly has considered eliminating altogether. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com We wanted to know how the argument held up. Problem is, there’s no good number for how much Melania Trump’s New York security detail costs. We’ll start with what we know: The National Endowment for the Arts’ budget was a little under $148 million for fiscal year 2016, and it’s requested a budget of about $150 million for fiscal year 2017, according to its website. To top the 2016 amount, Melania and Barron would need to stay at Trump Tower for an entire year with a detail costing more than $405,000 a day. To beat the 2017 budget request, the security costs would need to exceed $410,000 a day. During the transition period, the city took on most of the cost of protecting the Trumps in New York. A spokesperson for New York mayor Bill de Blasio told us Donald, Melania and Barron Trump ran up a $37 million bill for security from Election Day to the inauguration Jan. 20. (De Blasio has requested the federal government reimburse his city for security costs, and Congress has doled about $7 million.) In comparison, the city of Chicago spent at least $2.2 million to protect Obama’s home in Chicago from his election in November 2008 to his inauguration in January 2009, the Chicago Tribune reported. CBS’ New York affiliate reported, based on anonymous sources, that the city spends $500,000 a day to protect Trump Tower when the president is there, but less when it’s just Melania and Barron. That figure, de Blasio spokesperson Freddi Goldstein said, likely refers to the daily cost of security ($37 million divided by 74 days). But the mayor’s office has yet to complete an estimate for the cost of the first lady and Barron’s security detail alone, and believes it’ll be less than $500,000 a day. Goldstein told us even if the president were visiting New York, the price tag would likely be less today as much of the activity outside Trump Tower has dissipated since the first months of his election. Trump told reporters in November that his wife and youngest son would join him at the White House "very soon, after he’s finished with school," which indicate a mid-year move. The White House said this month that Melania Trump will move to the White House at the end of the school year and split time between New York and Washington. Our ruling Social media posts say Melania Trump’s security detail at Trump Tower costs more than the annual budget for the National Endowment for the Arts. That’s a flawed projection based on incomplete data. It assumes that Melania and Barron Trump will stay at Trump Tower the entire year, racking up a security bill of more than $410,000 a day, every day. But officials say the Melania Trump and her son intend to move to the White House at the end of the school year and split time between Washington and New York. What the first family will actually do we don’t know. But neither do bloggers. They should back off this claim until there is more data. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-11044	Says he "actually wrote the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s coast."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/jun/29/bill-nelson/did-bill-nelson-write-bipartisan-law-makes-it-ille/	A new ad in Florida’s hotly contested Senate race portrays a clear distinction between Democratic incumbent Sen. Bill Nelson and Republican opponent Gov. Rick Scott when it comes to their record on offshore oil drilling. The ad accuses the term-limited governor of supporting offshore drilling even after the BP oil spill and claims that Scott’s January meeting about drilling with Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke was nothing more than a "political stunt." Then the ad by Nelson shifts to his record. "Bill Nelson actually wrote the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s coast," the text on the screen says. We’ve already taken a close look at Scott’s record on oil drilling when we gave him Full Flop in January. We found that Scott clearly campaigned in 2010 on expanding oil drilling. But that changed around the time of the meeting with Zinke. This time, we wanted to hone in on Nelson’s legislative record. Did Nelson actually write the law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s coast? Environmental experts said Nelson deserves credit for protecting Florida’s Gulf Coast, but the legislation that actually was signed into law didn’t have Nelson’s name on it. Still, based on news reporting at that time, it was clear that Nelson’s bill (and the Republican who co-sponsored it) was the inspiration for the law that enacted a moratorium on drilling on the Gulf Coast. The evidence In 2006, Nelson teamed up with former Florida Republican Sen. Mel Martinez to cosponsor a piece of legislation known as the Permanent Protection for Florida Act of 2006 (S.2239). That bill aimed to prohibit offshore drilling on the outer Continental Shelf near Florida. Specifically, the bill put a moratorium on issuing a lease for the exploration, development, or production of oil, natural gas, or any other mineral off much of the coast of Florida until June 30, 2020. Frank Jackalone, the director of Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, praised Nelson and Martinez when the bill was introduced. (The Sierra Club endorsed Nelson). "Last week our Florida senators introduced legislation that would head off these threats by providing permanent protection for Florida’s coasts and extended protection for the remaining moratoria areas," Jackalone said in a speech he gave at the time "... He and Senator Nelson have given us a wonderful example of bipartisan leadership that puts Florida’s economy and environment first." That bill was introduced in the Senate but did not get a hearing and never made it to law. So can Nelson really take credit for signing the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s coast? Although Nelson and Martinez’s legislation was not signed into law, similar ideas were included in a section of another bill known as the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 (S.3711), which was sponsored by former Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. That bill enacted a moratorium on drilling within 230 miles of Tampa Bay and 125 miles from the Panhandle until June 2022, among other things. It was signed into law Dec. 20, 2006. The bill didn’t have Nelson’s name on it, but each bill aimed to protect Florida’s Gulf Coast for oil drilling by placing a moratorium on issuing a lease for the exploration, development, or production of oil, natural gas, or any other mineral. Alyson Flournoy, a law professor at the University of Florida, said that if the language of Nelson’s bill was included in the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, we would treat Nelson as the author of that part of the law. Taking a closer look at the text We compared the text of Nelson and Martinez’s bill with the text from the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 to get a better look at the similarities between the two measures. The language in the 2006 Energy Act is not a carbon copy of Nelson’s bill, but conveys very similar ideas, especially about where drilling would be prohibited. For example, Nelson and Martinez’s bill defined the area off limits as the Florida exclusion zone. That area included: 25 miles west of the Military Mission Line, 150 miles off the Florida Panhandle, including the area commonly known as the "Stovepipe’" in the Gulf of Mexico, and 150 miles off the Florida east coast. The Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 enacted the moratorium on any area east of the Military Mission Line in the Gulf of Mexico; any area in the Eastern Planning Area that is within 125 miles of the coastline of the State of Florida and part of the Central Planning Area that is in middle of the Gulf of Mexico. So, Nelson’s bill isn’t the exact same language, but newspaper outlets at the time said that Nelson and Martinez worked together to make sure the Gulf of Mexico was protected from oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006. "Florida's U.S. senators, Democrat Bill Nelson and Republican Mel Martinez, had helped craft the bill, and both voted for it this morning," the St. Petersburg Times wrote in 2006. "Martinez, who negotiated the measure with input from Nelson, rebuffed suggestions that the delegation could successfully maintain its 'no drilling' stance," the Miami Herald wrote after the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act passed the House. Days before the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006 was signed in to law. Martinez attended a press conference to speak about it. "Nelson and I, both from Florida, have had longstanding concerns about protections we felt were necessary for Florida's fragile environment and also because of our very strong economies derived from tourism, that our coastal waters and beaches be protected," Martinez said. "For that reason, the features of this bill that are attractive to us is the zone of protection that it creates for Florida along the Gulf Coast while at the same time permitting this very important additional exploration to take place." Environmental experts agreed that Nelson deserves credit for writing the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s Gulf coast. "Nelson out of anybody has the right to brag about being the gatekeeper on the Eastern Gulf," said Julie Wraithmell, the executive director of Audubon Florida. "If it wasn’t for him, we really would have struggled." Our ruling A campaign ad paid for by Nelson said he "actually wrote the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s coast." The ad writers should be more careful with their language. Nelson co-sponsored legislation in 2006 that would have banned drilling off Florida’s coast. That measure was never signed in to law, but similar ideas were included in the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act of 2006, which, among other things, enacted a moratorium on drilling 125 miles of the eastern portion of the Gulf of Mexico until June 2022. According to news reports at that time, Nelson and Martinez negotiated and worked to make sure Florida’s Gulf Coast was protected under with the 2006 act. And even though the law was not an exact copy, environmental experts agreed that Nelson deserves credit for writing the bipartisan law that makes it illegal to drill off Florida’s Gulf coast.

pomt-06810	"We're inches away from no longer having a free economy."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/12/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-gets-another-pants-fire-saying-were-in/	During the Republican presidential debate in Ames, Iowa, on Aug. 11, 2011, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney revived a line he first used in his June 2, 2011, presidential announcement at a farm in Stratham, N.H. Decrying the growth of government as a share of the economy, Romney said in Ames, "We're inches away from no longer having a free economy." We gave Romney a Pants on Fire when he first used the line -- when his exact wording was, "We are only inches away from ceasing to be a free market economy" -- and we see no reason to change that ruling. Separately we'll be checking the lead-in to this comment that Romney used in Ames -- that "back in the days of John F. Kennedy, the federal government took up, along with the state and local governments, 27 percent of the economy. Today, government consumes 37 percent of the economy." But here, we’ll recap our analysis of his claim that "we’re inches away from no longer having a free economy." As we indicated in June, we at PolitiFact tolerate a bit of hyperbole from politicians on all sides when they’re trying to make a point. So we’re not literally using a ruler to measure distances here. However, we decided that the underlying question -- whether the United States could really be approaching socialism -- is a fair one to analyze. Here are some of the statistics to consider: Government spending. On the suggestion of several economists, we took the figures for government expenditures (which includes all levels of government) and divided them by the national gross domestic product for the years 1996 through 2010. For more than a decade, government spending as a percentage of GDP was quite stable, bouncing between 30.4 percent and 32.9 percent. For the last few years, that percentage has indeed gone up -- to roughly 38 percent in both 2009 and 2010, which is within striking distance of the 40 percent Romney cited. Bruce Bartlett, a former official in the administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, said that Romney is "implying that the temporary increase in spending from (Obama’s stimulus bill) and the consequences of the recession are permanent," Bartlett said. Other economists noted that government’s footprint in GDP started growing in 2008 -- under Bush, not Obama -- because that’s when the recession began to hit. And even if the government share of GDP is close to 40 percent, would that be a catastrophe for economic freedom? Most of the experts we spoke to scoffed at the suggestion. "It has long been the conservative view that there is only so much freedom out there and if government grows in size then this necessarily diminishes freedom," Bartlett said. "Thus if spending is 25 percent of GDP, then we are three-quarters free, and if it grows to 40 percent, then we have lost 15 percent of our freedom and are only 60 percent free. This, of course, is nonsense, because it implies that the greatest freedom exists in anarchy … and that freedom is the only thing anyone cares about." Here are a few other statistics to consider. Taxes. Taxes offer another measure of government involvement into the economy. According to the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax policy, the total federal, state and local tax burden has been falling -- not rising -- in recent years. Every year, the group computes a national figure for all levels of taxation as a share of national income. The data shows that the tax burden has fallen modestly in recent years, from 31.2 percent in 2006 to 27.2 percent in 2011. And as we concluded in a separate fact-check, the U.S. tax burden isn’t just hovering around a historical low -- it’s also low compared to other advanced industrialized nations. In a 2006 international comparison, 25 nations had a higher percentage of taxes compared to GDP than the U.S., while just four -- Mexico, Japan, Korea and Turkey -- had a lower percentage. Regulation. "One loses being a free market economy not so much, or not solely, because of the level of spending and taxation, but also by the level and reach of government regulation, and by the distortions to choices that arise through government policy -- think of tax rules that discourage some behaviors and investments in favor of others," said J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation. Tevi Troy, a senior fellow at the conservative Hudson Institute, said that bailouts for Wall Street and U.S. automakers (approved under Bush and continued under Obama) and the increasing government oversight over the health care sector (approved under Obama) represent nearly unprecedented willingness by the government to intervene in the economy. (Supporters, of course, counter that all but the health care intervention were intended to be temporary and came in response to a dire situation.) However, there’s strong evidence undercutting Romney's claim that comes from, of all places, the conservative Heritage Foundation. Heritage published an economic freedom index for 2011 -- an international ranking of nations using a combination of 10 types of statistics, covering business freedom, trade freedom, fiscal freedom, government spending, monetary freedom, investment freedom, financial freedom, property rights, freedom from corruption and labor freedom. Certainly, different groups could measure freedom differently. But let’s look at what Heritage concluded. The U.S. ranked ninth out of 179 nations on the list, with a score that placed it near the top of the "mostly free" category. The only nations to be considered more "free" than the U.S. were, in descending order, Hong Kong, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Switzerland, Canada, Ireland, and Denmark. If the results of this study -- which, we’ll remind readers, was produced by a staunchly conservative think tank -- suggest that the U.S. is on the verge of socialism, then Lenin must be partying in his mauseoleum. For the U.S. to fall into the "mostly unfree" category, which is only the third-lowest category in the study, it would have to drop a whopping 83 slots, to a perch below such nations as Albania, Rwanda and Kazakhstan. We did hear one argument that provided a measure of support for Romney’s position -- but only in a backhanded way. Eugene Steuerle, an economist with the Urban Institute, a think tank that does economic and social policy research, said Romney’s comparison is imperfect because over the past century, there really hasn’t been a golden age in which the economy was genuinely unfettered, so the U.S. really couldn't be inching away from such an age. "We’ve been a mixed economy for a long time," Steuerle said. "The ‘free market’ is a somewhat vague term. Technically, a Federal Reserve system and an antitrust division of the Justice Department interfere with a totally free market economy, yet they may promote a competitive economy." So where does this leave us? It’s true that the government’s footprint on spending has grown over the past few years, due in large part to the recession. But while the statistics show that the government continues to have a large influence on the economy, there is little indication that the government’s role has risen dramatically enough over the past few years to threaten the kind of free market that the U.S. has operated under in recent decades. And international comparisons show that the U.S. ranks low in both total tax burden and high in economic freedom -- at least as measured by a prominent conservative think tank. In June, we found this claim ridiculous. In August, we still do. Once again, we rate Romney's statement Pants on Fire.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-08-12T11:12:44	2011-08-11	['None']

By contrast, I think most of the people in the very good drug court program — the graduation rate’s like 53, 55 percent. The point of that is that drug courts are working for veterans."	mostly true	/missouri/statements/2017/oct/21/eric-greitens/greitens-mostly-right-veterans-treatment-court-gra/	In his August Facebook Live video, Gov. Eric Greitens encouraged viewers to submit their questions. One viewer asked, "What do we do for our veterans except use them as our reason to get mad when it fits our agenda?" In response, Greitens touched on providing jobs for veterans, in addition to citing the rate of veterans graduating from treatment courts in Missouri. "Our veterans in our veterans court, are graduating — 73 percent of our veterans are graduating from drug courts," Greitens said. "By contrast, I think most of the people in the very good drug court program — the graduation rate’s like 53, 55 percent. The point of that is that drug courts are working for veterans." We were wondering: Are 73 percent of veterans graduating from treatment courts? While we never heard back from Greitens’ spokesman, a Supreme Court of Missouri spokeswoman pointed us in the direction of where those numbers came from. Treatment courts According to the Missouri Courts website, treatment courts began as a way to battle increasing substance abuse problems. Treatment courts have existed in Missouri for nearly 25 years. The first treatment court was started in 1993 in Jackson County. Legislation in 2013 established the first veterans treatment courts programs, which "are hybrid drug and mental health court dockets that use the treatment court model to serve veterans struggling with addiction, serious mental illness and/or co-occurring disorders," according to a treatment courts fact sheet. As of August 2017, there were 147 treatment court programs throughout the state. Of those, 12 are veterans treatment courts, with the remaining being adult, juvenile, family and DWI courts. Veterans can be accepted into treatment courts for drug-involved offenses and DWI offenses, Beth Riggert, communications counsel for the Supreme Court of Missouri, wrote in an email. The numbers According to the treatment courts fact sheet, "The graduation rate for all programs in fiscal 2017 exceeds 61 percent." However, the most recent data on veterans treatment courts is from calendar year 2016, Riggert said. In that time frame, there were a total of 247 veterans participating in veterans treatment courts in the state, Riggert said. However, because the program is rolling, only a total of 82 veterans exited the program in 2016. Of those, 60 successfully graduated the program and 22 did not. That translates to a success rate of 73.17 percent, or just about what Greitens said. Since 2011, the graduation rate from veterans treatment courts has steadily been increasing as more veterans have gone through the program. Greitens also said, "By contrast, I think most of the people in the very good drug court program — the graduation rate’s like 53, 55 percent." Because we were unable to reach Greitens’ spokesman for comment, we are unsure which specific treatment courts program Greitens was referring to when he said "the very good drug court program." However, Riggert elaborated on the graduation for other treatment court programs. In the same period, the graduation rate from adult drug courts was 52 percent, and the graduation rate from DWI courts was 90 percent, Riggert said. While Greitens is correct that the veterans treatment courts’ graduation rate was higher than some, such as the adult drug court’s rate, it is still not as high as the DWI court’s graduation rate of 90 percent. However, Riggert said it may not be accurate to compare graduation rates between treatment courts to prove one program’s success. "The various types of treatment court programs are distinct, and so it is not helpful to try to make a side-by-side comparison," Riggert said. While 73 percent of veterans exiting the program did graduate in 2016, it is unclear how many veterans who graduate from the program have to return for additional treatment. "Because veterans treatment courts are relatively new, we do not yet have sufficient quantifiable data from which to determine recidivism rates for these programs," Riggert said. Our ruling Greitens said, "73 percent of our veterans are graduating from drug courts. By contrast, I think most of the people in the very good drug court program — the graduation rate’s like 53, 55 percent. The point of that is that drug courts are working for veterans." While the overall numbers are small, Greitens is correct that in 2016, 73 percent of veterans successfully completed treatment court. Over the same time period, the overall graduation rate from adult treatment court was 52 percent, officials say. However, officials also pointed out that the two programs are not identical, which makes comparing them imprecise. In addition, while graduation rate is one measurement of success, it’s not the only one, and as Riggert noted, veteran treatment courts are so new that no data on recidivism rates have been collected.

pomt-08453	Georgia lawmakers balanced the budget without raising taxes on residents.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2010/oct/15/casey-cagle/cagle-budget-claim-gets-scrutiny/	There are some things you just don't do if you want to be considered a conservative politician. Raising taxes is at the top of the list. Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle has proudly told audiences that Georgia leaders, amid one of the worst economic periods in American history, passed a budget this spring without raising taxes. Cagle, a Republican running for re-election, bragged about this at a Sept. 4 GOP rally in Carroll County, giving some of the credit to Gov. Sonny Perdue. "[Perdue] was able to help us balance the budget without raising taxes on the residents of Georgia," Cagle said, according to the Times-Georgian newspaper in Carrollton. Some AJC PolitiFact Georgia readers have questioned the claim in recent weeks and asked us to check it out. Carol Porter, Cagle's Democratic opponent in the Nov. 2 election, cut a television commercial this week calling out her opponent. "Casey Cagle raised our taxes during a recession," a voice says over ominous music. There are three main points of debate about Cagle's statement. The first is centered on House Bill 1055. It is 84 pages of legalese that raises fees on many items. Most are for services not used by the average Georgian, such as the licensing fee for a fertilizer distributor. Some, however, included the annual fee to register a business in Georgia, the cost for a personalized license plate and fees to run a child care business. Combined, the fee increases are estimated to collect an additional $90 million over a year. Some say a fee increase is simply a politician using a different word for a tax increase. Others disagree. It's a longtime argument. Webster's defines a tax as "a charge, usually of money, imposed by an authority on persons or property for public purposes." Webster's says a fee is "a sum paid or charged for a service." University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock considers a fee as the cost for a service people can choose to use or not. He contends a tax is for a service that serves a general purpose, such as public schools or roads. Kelly McCutchen, president of the Georgia Public Policy Foundation, a conservative think tank, defines a fee as a charge that covers the cost of providing a service. He says a tax is when the government collects revenue that is greater than the cost of providing the service. Under those definitions, we're not convinced these fee increases constitute a tax increase. The second area of disagreement concerns a proposal near the bottom of HB 1055. It requires hospitals to give the state 1.45 percent of their net patient revenue, which is estimated to total about $200 million a year. Many fiscal watchdogs called it the "hospital bed tax." The debate about it was "polarizing," recalled Josh Culling of Washington, D.C.-based Americans for Tax Reform. Perdue wanted the bed charge and got into a verbal battle with ATR, which opposed the idea. The earlier version of the bill, which was passed by the Georgia Senate, which Cagle leads, caused such conflict within the GOP that Sen. Preston Smith of Rome said he was ousted as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee over his opposition to the legislation. Smith called it a tax increase. McCutchen and others argue hospitals will pass the cost on to patients, and in this case, the patient is paying more than the cost of the service. Cagle spokesman Ben Fry disagreed. He said the legislation isn't a tax increase because the money is used to collect more money from the federal government to fund the state's Medicaid insurance program for low-income Georgians. Fry also notes the charge is set to expire by July 2013 and the bill includes a provision to gradually eliminate the small state property tax by 2016 and provide tax reductions on retirement income. The Cagle spokesman reminded us of a front-page headline in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that called the legislation a "tax break." Fry also showed us a statement by Americans for Tax Reform, which is best known for its pledge that many politicians eagerly sign during campaign season committing not to support any bill that increases total taxation. "When fully phased in, with the hospital bed tax expiring in three years and the statewide property tax completely eliminated in 2016, HB 1055 represents a net revenue reduction for the state -- and a net tax reduction for Georgia citizens," the ATR statement said. ATR's Culling said of the legislation: "There was a tax increase, but it was offset by the other cuts." Smith told reporters from the AJC and Channel 2 Action News in an April interview that he wasn't sure about the likelihood of those cuts. "The tax increase is certain and it's immediate," the lawmaker said. "The so-called tax decreases that were in the original bill are contingent, they're not certain and they're some point in the future." Still, it seems like a stretch to us to equate the indirect passing along of a hospital surcharge to patients with a tax increase "on residents." The third argument concerns the Homeowner's Tax Relief Grant program. The state program gave Georgia homeowners between $200 and $300 to offset their property taxes, which cost the state about $428 million a year, about 2 percent of Georgia's budget. The Legislature didn't continue the program this year. Leaders in Georgia's 159 counties, beset by their own budget problems, said they could not cover the costs either. State lawmakers did not include the grant during this year's legislative session for the fiscal year that began July 1. Democratic Party leaders in the Georgia Legislature such as Dubose Porter, the husband of Cagle's Democratic opponent in the lieutenant governor's race, Carol Porter, argued to keep the grant. In her TV ad, Carol Porter has criticized Cagle for not continuing the grant. Cagle told the AJC in 2008 that he wanted to continue the grant, but Fry doesn't agree with those who say not funding the grant program equates to a tax increase. Alan Essig, executive director of the liberal-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, also believes it is not accurate to say not providing the credit is a tax increase. "What was taken out of the [state] budget was an appropriation," said Essig, a former state budget analyst. "It was a local tax that you give a credit to." Clint Mueller, the legislative director for the Association County Commissioners of Georgia, agreed. "They didn't force the [property tax] rate to go up," he said of the Legislature. "It was the elimination of the credit. ... Technically, it's not a tax increase." Still, the bottom line is that many Georgia homeowners will pay more for their property taxes. We found this the most persuasive argument. So where does that leave us? It's clear that there was no direct, across-the-board tax increase on Georgians. Some of the discussion turns into a semantic debate concerning what's a fee and what's a tax -- and whether there's truly a difference. We won't be able to settle that here. On the tax relief grant, while its demise wasn't technically a tax increase, the effect is that Georgia property owners are paying more. In all, we found Cagle's statement accurate but needs clarification on the tax relief grant. By the definition of our Truth-o-Meter, that rates as Mostly True.

pomt-04689	The stimulus program "cut taxes for 95 percent of the American people."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/06/bill-clinton/clinton-says-obama-cut-taxes-95-percent-people-thr/	Update, Sept. 6, 2012, 10:43 a.m.: When we first posted this item, we did not address the distinction between all Americans and all American workers. Our report now addresses that difference, and we have changed the rating from True to Half True. In making the case for President Barack Obama’s re-election, former President Bill Clinton vouched for job creation under Obama’s reign despite the "deeply damaged economy" he inherited. Clinton singled out Obama’s 2009 economic stimulus program, known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, as a positive step for the economy. "In 2010, as the president's recovery program kicked in, the job losses stopped and things began to turn around," Clinton said in his keynote Democratic National Convention speech. "The Recovery Act saved or created millions of jobs and cut taxes -- let me say this again -- cut taxes for 95 percent of the American people." Clinton borrowed this factoid from the man of the week, who made it part of his 2008 campaign and bragged about it in his 2010 State of the Union speech. That night, Obama said, "We cut taxes. We cut taxes for 95 percent of working families." PolitiFact rated that claim True. Here’s why: The stimulus included tax cuts for many Americans, including a broad cut known as "Making Work Pay" intended to offset payroll taxes, which are automatically taken out of most workers’ paychecks and are not refundable. Because of the stimulus, single workers collected a $400 tax credit, and working couples got $800. The credit didn’t come in the form of a check; it worked out so that most workers had about $400 less in federal income taxes withheld from their paychecks. The result mostly mirrored what Obama promised he would do on the campaign. Obama pledged tax cuts of $500 for each worker and $1,000 for working couples. We rated the promise a Compromise on our Obameter because the resulting tax cut was a little lower than what Obama wanted. Ahead of the 2008 election, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center analyzed the effects of Obama’s tax proposals for workers. The center determined about 95 percent -- more precisely, 94.3 percent -- of tax filers would receive a tax cut under Obama's plan based on the tax credit to offset payroll taxes. The 5-percent sliver of workers who wouldn’t qualify included couples who make more than $250,000 or a single person making over $200,000 The tax cut expired at the end of 2011. Obama won another round of tax cuts for most workers in a December 2010 tax deal with Republicans in Congress. Those tax cuts -- worth about 2 percent a week -- expire in 2013. However, Clinton left out an important qualifier: It’s a tax cut for 95 percent of working families. Not everyone works -- think seniors or the unemployed, for example -- and when you account for those people, the percentage of people who get a tax cut drops to approximately 75 percent. That’s still tax cuts for many Americans, but not close to the 95-percent range. We rate Clinton’s statement Half True.

pomt-03146	"One out of every three students currently today is ready for college before they go there."	false	/florida/statements/2013/sep/11/will-weatherford/weatherford-misstates-rate-states-college-ready-gr/	Even though Florida’s graduation rate is much better than it used to be, there is still room for improvement in terms of college readiness, House Speaker Will Weatherford said. Just one in three students is ready for college when he or she graduates high school. "That’s a problem, that’s a real problem," Weatherford said Sept. 10 as the guest speaker at a Suncoast Tiger Bay luncheon. "So while we’re having this debate about Common Core, and the grading system, and how much we pay our teachers, and how we should assess our students’ performance, just remember that one out of every three students currently today is ready for college before they go there." Weatherford earlier joked about intense PolitiFact coverage of "every word that comes out of my mouth," so we knew his team would not be surprised by us asking for backup of his claim that "one out of every three students currently today is ready for college before they go there." Weatherford spokesman Ryan Duffy responded to our inquiry on Twitter, directing us to Florida Department of Education data for the percentage of 2011 public high school graduates who took the SAT, ACT or CPT and scored at or above college-level scores. The state average was 64.7 percent. As Miami Herald political reporter Marc Caputo pointed out, that actually means two out of every three high school students graduates public school college-ready. Not one in three, as Weatherford said. Duffy acknowledged the flub. He insisted Weatherford has cited the statistic correctly in the past. Our ruling For us, the facts here aligned pretty easily (thanks, Twitter). Weatherford said one in three Florida students graduates high school prepared for college. Based on Florida Department of Education data, it’s two in three. We rate Weatherford’s claim False.	None	Will Weatherford	None	None	None	2013-09-11T14:32:32	2013-09-10	['None']
pomt-08927	The "state bureaucracy" Jane Norton managed "grew by $43 million in just three years."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/26/americans-job-security/jane-nortons-public-health-and-environment-departm/	An ad from a third-party group has Jane Norton blasting back and blaming her opponent in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Colorado. "Seen those TV ads attacking me? They're paid for by a shady interest group doing the bidding of Ken Buck," she said in reaction to the ad paid for by Americans for Job Security. "You'd think Ken would be man enough to do it himself." Norton says in the ad. "Here's the truth: In state government, I cut budgets, cut programs and reduced staff," Norton continues. "Ken Buck's Office? His spending skyrocketed by 40 percent. We need a senator who's actually cut spending, and has the backbone to stand her ground." The "shady interest group" Norton refers to is an outfit called Americans for Job Security. Here's their ad: "Our country is at the brink," a narrator says. "Colorado families and workers need relief -- yet Jane Norton supported the largest tax hike in Colorado history, costing us billions. And Jane Norton's record on government spending? The state bureaucracy she managed grew by $43 million in just three years. Record taxes and reckless spending has cost Colorado jobs. Call Jane Norton, tell her no more tax hikes and big government spending." Norton is a former lieutenant governor who got early backing from national Republican Party leaders. Buck, on the other hand, is the Weld County District Attorney and a former U.S. attorney and has received backing from the tea party movement. There are a lot of facts to sort through here. In this report, we're fact-checking the claim about Norton growing state bureaucracy; we also fact-checked whether she supported "the largest tax hike in Colorado history." And we're examining Norton's charges against Buck in still another report. Americans for Job Security said that "the state bureaucracy she managed grew by $43 million in just three years." The group -- a business league that's not required to disclose its donors -- based its claims on Norton's tenure as executive director of the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment from 1999 to 2002. Norton was appointed by then Gov. Bill Owens, also a Republican. The department is in charge of public health, as well as things like air quality and nursing home regulations. Under Norton's tenure, the budget did grow from $226 million to $269 million. But most of that increase came from federal funds or cash funds from things like user fees. State funds to the department increased for a few years but then declined. Over Norton's entire tenure, state funding dropped from $23.7 million to $16.2 million. Finally, we should note that some people don't believe a state agency director has that much control over the amount of money an agency receives from the state. The reduction in state funding was part of large-scale budget cutting during a year of low tax revenues, according to a review of Norton's tenure at the Public Health and Environment Department in the Denver Post. The Americans for Job Security ad said that "the state bureaucracy she managed grew by $43 million in just three years." The ad leaves out the fact that state funding was lower at the end of her tenure than it had been at the beginning. So we rate its claim Half True.

pomt-10244	When Sarah Palin was in government, Barack Obama was a community organizer.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/31/john-mccain/palin-was-a-sports-reporter-when-obama-was-organiz/	The day after John McCain selected Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to be his running mate for the presidential campaign, McCain defended his pick from questions about her experience. Chris Wallace, who interviewed McCain on Aug. 30, 2008, for Fox News Sunday , asked McCain several questions about why he selected Palin. Here's one exchange: Wallace: "Senator, you talked about her years of experience. Ten of those years were as a city councilwoman and mayor of a town of 9,800 people. And in terms of foreign policy, in March of 2007, two months after the surge had started, she was asked about it, and she said: 'I've been focused on state government. I haven't focused on the war in Iraq.' Understandable for a governor; not understandable for a vice president." McCain: "Well, by the way, also she was a member of the PTA. I think it's wonderful. But the point is she has been to Kuwait. She has been over there. She has been with her troops, the National Guard that she commands, who had been over there and had the experience. I'm proud of her knowledge of these challenges and issues. And of course, as governor she has had enormous responsibilities, none of which Sen. Obama had. When she was in government, he was a community organizer. When she was taking tough positions against her own party, Senator Obama was voting 'present' 130 times in the state legislature, on every tough issue whatever it was, while she was taking them on. That's the kind of judgment that I'm confident that we need in Washington." We examined Obama's "present" votes in an article when the issue came up during the Democratic primary . It's true that Obama cast roughly 130 present votes from more than 4,000 votes cast during his time in the Illinois legislature. It's also true that Palin earned experience as a governor that Obama doesn't have, but then McCain doesn't have that, either. Here, we'll look at McCain's claim that Palin was in government while Obama was a community organizer. Palin and Obama are fairly close in age, only 2 years apart. As of this writing, Palin is 44 and Obama just turned 47. According to her biography from the Alaska governor's office, Palin graduated from the University of Idaho in 1987 with a degree in communications-journalism. She then worked as a television sports reporter from 1987 to 1989, according to the Almanac of American Politics. Her sports reporting career was at Anchorage's NBC affiliate KTUU, a fact the station noted in its biography of Palin, who then used her maiden name of Heath. Palin first took elected office in 1992 when she was elected to the city council of Wasilla, a town of 5,469, according to the 2000 U.S. Census. Obama, meanwhile, graduated from Columbia University with his bachelor's degree in 1983. He worked briefly for a business research firm before moving to Chicago to become a community organizer. He worked as a community organizer from 1985 to 1988 before leaving Chicago to attend Harvard Law School in 1988. In 1992, Obama had finished his law degree at Harvard and was directing a statewide voter registration drive. His work there earned him a mention in the annual "40 under 40" list published by Crain's Chicago Business to recognize the city's young leaders. Crain's credited him and a staff of 10 with registering 150,000 new voters. After the drive ended in November 1992, Obama went on to join a Chicago law firm and finish his memoir Dreams From My Father, which was published in 1995. He was elected to the Illinois legislature in 1996. When Obama talks about his days as a community organizer, he usually is referring to the work he did prior to law school, most notably organizing the community around Atgeld Gardens on the issues of asbestos removal from public housing. For McCain's statement to be true, you would have to consider Obama's voter registration drive work to be community organizing — an arguable point. In addition to that, municipal elections in Wasilla in 1992 were held in the first week in October, so at most Palin had won office for a month while Obama was a community organizer by an arguable definition. Because Obama's best-known days as a community organizer were prior to his graduation from Harvard Law School, from 1985 to 1988, and during those years Palin was graduating from college and working as a sports reporter, we rule McCain's statement False.

pomt-11454	The flu shot is "designed to spread cancer."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/09/meddaily/no-flu-shot-was-not-designed-spread-cancer/	Amid a severe flu season, an inaccurate story on Facebook said that the flu shot is laced with cancer-causing ingredients but provided no credible evidence. "Doctor blows whistle on flu shot: ‘it’s designed to spread cancer,’" said a Feb. 28 headline on Meddaily, an alternative medicine website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We interviewed scientists who disputed the claim that the flu shot is linked to cancer. The story largely focuses on comments by Dr. John Bergman. We were unsuccessful in reaching Bergman. We messaged him on Facebook and received an automated message back that he no longer answers private messages. We searched for any credible newspaper articles that quoted a Dr. John Bergman about flu shots and found nothing. Meddaily wrote that Bergman "has revealed the influenza vaccinations being used to combat the latest H3N2 strain, are virtually ineffective and being forced onto the public through fear tactics to spread cancer." Meddaily also links to a video that has circulated for years by Dr. Joseph Mercola, who argues that the flu vaccine is ineffective. Mercola has been criticized by scientists and federal agencies for many years. The Meddaily article offers no credible evidence that the flu shot causes cancer. We sent the Meddaily article to three well-respected scientists who agreed the claims about the flu shot having "cancer-causing ingredients" or being "designed to spread cancer" were wrong. "What does this even mean?" said Aaron Carroll, a pediatrics professor at Indiana University. "Wouldn’t you need evidence that it’s ‘designed to spread cancer’ to make such a claim? I mean, you’d have to think the absolute worst about humanity, including pediatricians, to believe that." William Schaffner, an infectious disease specialist at Vanderbilt University, said that about 120 million to 150 million doses of the flu vaccine are given in the United States alone, in addition to millions of doses in other countries. "Would the World Health Organization be promoting a cancer-promoting product? No," he said. U.S. Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a Feb. 26 statement that the flu this year has "resulted in a record number of hospitalizations." The federal government continues to research why the effectiveness is lower this year, however, a preliminary finding suggests the cell-based influenza vaccine might be somewhat more effective than the egg-based vaccine. The overall estimated effectiveness of the 2017–18 seasonal influenza vaccine for preventing medically attended, laboratory-confirmed influenza virus infection was 36 percent, as of mid February. The CDC continues to recommend the flu shot because it can prevent some infections with currently circulating flu viruses. "Even with current vaccine effectiveness estimates, vaccination will still prevent influenza illness, including thousands of hospitalizations and deaths. Persons aged ≥6 months who have not yet been vaccinated this season should be vaccinated," the CDC wrote in February. Meddaily stated that the flu shot is "designed to spread cancer." Experts say this claim is nothing more than a ridiculous conspiracy theory. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.

pomt-07112	"Janice Hahn hired hard-core gang members with taxpayer money to be 'gang-intervention specialists.' She even helped them get out of jail, so they could rape and kill again."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/20/turn-right-usa/video-accuses-janice-hahn-hiring-gang-members-taxp/	It has been called one of the most offensive political videos ever. It has been denounced as vile, racist and sexist. So, naturally, it went viral on YouTube. It's only been up a few days, but as of June 17, 2011, the video attack on Los Angeles Councilwoman and Democratic congressional candidate Janice Hahn -- over her support for gang-intervention programs that use former gang members -- had already been viewed a half million times. What's all the hubbub? The video features a woman dancing on a stripper pole as two rappers hold guns and grab money out of her hot pants. "Give us your cash b--ch, so we can shoot up the streets. Give us your cash b--ch, so we can buy some more heat," they sing. When the woman turns around, there's a demonic version of Hahn's face superimposed. Putting aside the offensive images in the video, we wondered about the claim at the heart of the attack. It comes via a voiceover at the start of the video: "In an insane effort to reduce gang violence, Janice Hahn hired hardcore gang members with taxpayer money to be 'gang-intervention specialists.' She even helped them get out of jail, so they could rape and kill again." We spoke with the video's unapologetic creator, Ladd Ehlinger, who specializes in viral political videos. Remember the campaign video for Alabama Agriculture Commission candidate Dale Peterson, the rifle-toting cowboy who called his opponent a dummy? Then there was the one from congressional candidate Rick Barber where he had a fictitious conversation with several of the Founding Fathers, ending with George Washington saying through gritted teeth, "Gather ... your ... armies." And we can't forget the one that cast Nancy Pelosi as the Wicked Witch of the West. All Ehlinger. "I think it's only offensive to people who don't have a sense of humor," Ehlinger told us. Critics may call his latest video over-the-top, he said, but it drew attention to a piece of Hahn's record the media was ignoring. It's true that Hahn, whose district encompasses some gang-ridden neighborhoods of Watts, has been an active advocate for gang prevention programs that include the controversial practice of hiring ex-gang members to act as go-betweens for law enforcement, community activists and gangs. The issue, though, is whether Hahn hired these gang-intervention specialists with taxpayer money and even helped get some of them out of jail. The allegation is based largely on a 2008 Fox 11 (Los Angeles) story in which investigative reporter Chris Blatchford reported that anti-gang money was going to the gangsters themselves. In the Fox story, Watts gangster Steven Myrick is seen in a 2006 police video claiming that he "worked for" Janice Hahn and "that's why I'm out (of jail) right now. Miss Hahn got me out like three weeks ago." Myrick was released after an arrest for indecent exposure. He was later tied to a 2000 rape and robbery of a woman at gunpoint and was sentenced to life in prison. The Fox report includes several other examples of men hired as gang-intervention specialists, paid through programs sponsored by the city, who were still actively involved in gang activity. In the Fox report, Hahn defended the use of "gang-intervention specialists," saying, "I do know that it takes a different kind of person to be able to speak the language that convinces the shooters to not retaliate. And that's what we've achieved." Blatchford asked if that was like making a deal with the devil. "I see it as keeping the peace in a community that has been plagued with violence," Hahn said. Asked about the use of convicted criminals as gang-intervention specialists, Hahn responded, "I think you're saying some of these people have been part of the problem in the past. Well, I'm here to say they're part of the solution now. And I think that's positive." Two weeks after the Fox 11 report, the Torrance, Calif., Daily Breeze published a story that purported to largely debunk the Fox story. Reporter Gene Maddaus wrote that a review of the Fox report "found major flaws that undermine its central allegations. Most notably, records and interviews show that the gang-intervention workers identified in the report have not received city funding. Additionally, a convicted rapist was wrongly identified as a gang-intervention worker, and Hahn was mistakenly accused of providing funds directly to gang workers." According to the story, Myrick, who was featured prominently in the Fox report, "attended a few task force meetings and took an interest in facilitating peace between gangsters. At one point, he was arrested for violating an order to stay out of Imperial Courts [housing project], and his wife came to a meeting to urge Hahn to help get him out." "The only thing I've ever done is call and ask what the basis of an arrest was," Hahn told the Daily Breeze. "I never called to get anyone out of jail." According to the Daily Breeze, "Myrick was released and apparently believed that Hahn had pulled strings for him. He was arrested again a few weeks later, in March 2006, on a 'cold hit' from a 6-year-old rape case." Despite Myrick's claim that he was getting paid to help facilitate nonviolence, the Daily Breeze reported it could find no evidence that Myrick was paid as a gang-intervention specialist, nor that he ever received city funds. Other gang-intervention specialists mentioned in the Fox story were reported to have been paid through an organization called Unity One, which the Daily Beeze noted is almost entirely funded with private sources. The story noted that Unity One did receive $60,000 a year from a subcontract with the Toberman Settlement House, with money that originated from the city's Community Development Department. But, the story noted, records showed the the funding went to pay Unity One's president and program manager, and "Hahn did not obtain that money for Unity One." We spoke to Cornell Ward, executive director of Unity One, who acknowledged they do hire ex-gang members to act as gang-intervention specialists. But he said Unity One does not get government funding, and he dismissed the idea that Hahn ever directed any city funds to hire gang-intervention specialists. "She didn't give them a dime," Ward said. "She didn't give us one red cent." When we contacted Hahn's campaign, spokesman Dave Jacobson reiterated the point that Hahn did not "directly" fund gang-intervention specialists. Bu that doesn't mean city money doesn't filter to them. "She (Hahn) did not hire any gangsters," said civil rights lawyer and gang expert Connie Rice. "The city doesn’t pay the intervention specialists directly." Rather, Rice said, city funds go to agencies like hers, the Advancement Project in Los Angeles, which then go out and hire intervention specialists. And, she said, it works: violence is down. That's why city and county law enforcement agencies routinely work with organizations that hire former gang members to "interface" with the gang community, she said. "We have to engage with the people doing the damage," said Rice. "Do we talk to actual gangsters, yes," Rice said. "We ask them not to shoot kids. This is the reality. We're trying to save lives, not score political points. It's smart policy." Is it controversial? Sure, Rice said. And sometimes some of the people hired for gang-intervention work "mess up." Those found to be abusing the system are cut off, she said. That doesn't mean the program isn't working, she said. "You can throw stones at that," Rice said, but the reality is "when you go into gang-controlled hot spots, you have to deal with the gangs. People don't understand what we're facing out here. In our hots spots, we still have the OK Corral." Watts is one of the most dangerous places in the country, she said. And it's in Hahn's district. "As a councilwoman, she had to do something," Rice said. We asked Hahn campaign spokesman Jacobson whether, if the city pays money to agencies that, in turn, hire ex-gang members as gang-intervention specialists, isn't that the same thing as them being paid with taxpayer money? "The city funds are used to fund a three-pronged approach to fight the war on gangs," Jacobson responded by e-mail. "That includes funding gang prevention, suppression, and intervention services. In the past couple years, the rules about who gets money have become much, much stricter. And funds do not go to organizations unless they can show that their staffers are not involved in gangs and have gone through a rigorous training program on how to be an effective part of community policing." So what about the charge that Hahn "even helped them get out of jail, so they could rape and kill again." The only evidence that she intervened in that way comes from Myrick's taped statements to police. Myrick certainly suggests she did. "The entire Fox story was based on statements made by desperate criminal gang members who would say anything to avoid going to jail," Hahn said at the time. "I have never paid these gang members, never had them work for me, nor have I ever helped them to get out of jail." Said Fox reporter Blatchford: "We stand behind everything in our report." We should note that Hahn has since filed a complaint with the Federal Elections Commission alleging the political action committee that paid for the video, Turn Right USA, is connected to the campaign of her Republican opponent. Both Hahn's opponent in the congressional race and Ehlinger vehemently deny that. Republican Craig Huey, who will face Hahn in a July 12 special election, released a statement condemning the ad, saying it was not authorized or affiliated with his campaign. "The ad is blatantly racist and sexist, and neither racism nor sexism has any place in the public sphere," Huey stated. According to its website, Turn Right USA is "a non-connected, expenditure only political action committee (SuperPAC), definitely not authorized by any candidate or candidate’s committee." Talking Points Memo reported that the group's treasurer said he may resign because, "I just don't approve of that video." For his part, video creator Ehlinger isn't backing off one inch. He said the allegation about Hahn getting gangsters out of jail early comes right from the mouth of Myrick, who is serving a life sentence for rape and robbery. Said Ehlinger: "I'm going to take him at his word. I trust Myrick's word over Janice Hahn's. And you should, too." He added that Hahn is simply hiding behind the fact that she (and the city) didn't give money directly to former gang members. "No one ever said Hahn pulled money out of her purse and paid them," he said. But the city paid third-party programs that paid these intervention specialists, he said. It may be one step removed, he said, but it amounts to the same thing. Rice says she welcomes a public dialogue about the controversial practice of using former gang members as intervention specialists. But this video, which she said was made by "lazy political assassins," is not the right way. "I don't understand why we have to look at it through this false lens that these propagandists ginned up," Rice said. If a "vile, sexist and misogynistic" video is the only way to get enough attention to have serious discussion about the issue, she said, "that's bad news for constitutional democracy." We're not going to debate the methods people use to get out their political message these days. The reality is that viral political videos, like chain e-mails, often reach a large audience and leave an impression. So what is the truth? We think the onus falls on the folks making the claim to back it up, and the makers of the video produce no hard evidence to support it. There's ample evidence that Hahn has been an advocate of programs that use ex-gang members as intervention specialists. And while the city does not fund these intervention specialists directly, it funds agencies that do. Still, it's a stretch to say "Janice Hahn hired hard-core gang members with taxpayer money to be 'gang-intervention specialists.'" That suggests she selected the ex-gang members tapped to be intervention specialists or that she paid them herself, and there's no evidence of that. We also think it's a stretch to accuse Hahn of getting gangsters out of jail based solely on the comments of one gang member facing serious criminal charges. Hahn acknowledges she made a call to to find out the basis for Myrick's arrest. Perhaps that was interpreted by Myrick or police as Hahn intervening on his behalf. Other than Myrick's hearsay declaration, however, the video and its producer present no proof that she did. That's not good enough to give it credibility. We rate the claim False.

pomt-01105	The cheerleaders for the Dallas Cowboys have "entertained more troops in the world than Bob Hope."	false	/texas/statements/2015/jan/09/jerry-jones/jerry-jones-says-dallas-cowboy-cheerleaders-have-e/	Jerry Jones said the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders have outflanked one of the country’s most-traveled actor-comedians. Jones, who owns the football team, spoke to ESPN’s Mike and Mike on Jan. 8, 2015, in the Dallas-area studio where the cheerleaders practice, according to a blog post by the Dallas Morning News. Opening the 15-minute interview, which aired the next morning, Jones stressed the location, saying: "We’re sitting here in the area where the cheerleaders perform. I’ll get my little plug in there." Then Jones said: "They’ve entertained more troops in the world than Bob Hope." Now this isn’t politics. But Jones made his claim in Texas and the late Hope, friend to presidents and world leaders, would surely holler for the Truth-O-Meter if he could, maybe waving a golf club. Hope and the troops Over decades, often around Christmas, Hope flew the globe to put on shows for U.S. troops. In his later years, the shows were taped as TV specials. According to a web page for the USO, the nonprofit dedicated to lifting the spirits of troops, Hope performed his first USO show in California in May 1941. "Hope entertained" with the USO "until December 1990, when he brought laughter and Christmas cheer to troops participating in Operation Desert Shield in Saudi Arabia and Bahrain on his final USO tour," the page says. A USO timeline, on another web page, says in the entry for 1943: "Over the course of his career, Hope appeared in or hosted almost 200 USO performances, including annual Christmas tours for 35 consecutive years." Hope's run with the USO nearly reached 50 years. By telephone, though, USO spokeswoman Gayle Fishel said she was uncertain the organization had a tally of the number of troops Hope ultimately entertained. Maybe millions? A 1997 congressional resolution, deeming Hope an honorary veteran of the U.S. Armed Forces, said that during "World War II, the Korean Conflict, the Vietnam War, and the Persian Gulf War and throughout the Cold War, Bob Hope traveled to visit and entertain millions of United States service members in numerous countries, on ships at sea, and in combat zones ashore." Responding to our inquiry by email, James Hardy, producer for Bob Hope Enterprises, Inc., pointed out an Air Force web page stating: "For more than 50 years, Bob Hope entertained men and women of the U.S. Air Force and the other services at home and overseas, in peace and in war. At least 10,000,000 G.I.s benefited from his efforts." Hardy said Hope routinely did 150 shows during a USO tour. Cheerleaders and the troops Dallas Cowboys officials replied to our query about Jones’ statement by noting the cheerleaders have been doing performance tours in coordination with the Department of Defense since a 1979 tour in South Korea. A page in the Cowboys media guide, emailed to us by the team, states the cheerleaders’ Show Group has made "more international tours with the USO than any other entertainment group. They bring their own special brand of goodwill and gratitude to the men and women in the military, traveling to locations as diverse as Iraq, Bosnia, Afghanistan, Cuba, Korea and the Persian Gulf." Through 2014, the team told us, the cheerleaders had teamed up the government 78 times "to boost the morale of the men, women and families of our U.S. military at hundreds of bases and outposts around the world." Separately, USO spokeswoman Sharee Posey emailed that since 2002, the Cowboys cheerleaders had entertained more than 198,000 troops and military families. Posey said USO does not have information on Hope's appearances. We pressed Dalrymple on how Jones concluded the cheerleaders had entertained more troops than Hope. Spokesman Rich Dalrymple replied that the team hasn’t laid claim to the cheerleaders entertaining more troops than Hope. But Jones did, yes? "Evidently he did not have his facts correct, which is my fault, so you can blame me," Dalrymple said by email. Our ruling Jones said the cheerleaders for the Dallas Cowboys have "entertained more troops in the world than Bob Hope." The cheerleaders may be outpacing other groups in USO tours, having toured nearly 80 times. But it looks like Hope, who died at 100 in July 2003, performed before more troops, given that he had nearly 200 USO swings. We rate Jones' claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

UPDATE, 4 p.m., Jan. 13, 2015: We updated this story Jan. 12, 2015, to correct the spelling of a USO official's name and to fold in that group's count of the troops entertained by the Cowboys cheerleaders since 2002.

pomt-00919	More than 1 million Texans live without affordable health care because Rick Perry failed to "partner with the Legislature to find a Texas solution to closing the coverage gap."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/mar/01/texas-democratic-party/texas-democrats-say-rick-perry-left-more-1-million/	By not teaming with legislators, Rick Perry left many Texans without reasonable health care, a Democratic group says. The Texas Democratic Party popped this claim a day after the former governor and 2016 Republican presidential prospect told New Hampshire residents: "People criticize us for having a large number of uninsured. That’s what Texans decided they wanted. They did not want government forcing everyone to buy insurance." According to a Dallas Morning News blog post datelined Bedford, N.H., Perry was referring to Texas’ refusal, under his leadership, to create an insurance marketplace--leaving it to the federal government to do so--or to expand Medicaid as permitted under the federal Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare. Javier Gamboa, the Democratic Party’s spokesman, reacted in a Feb. 12, 2015, press release: "Perry should be ashamed of himself for saying that the people of Texas did not want increased coverage and expanded access to healthcare. More than one million hardworking Texans are living without affordable care because of his failure to partner with the Legislature to find a Texas solution to closing the coverage gap." Is all of this so? Perry and legislators Perry won his last term as governor in 2010, the year the then-Democratic-controlled Congress and President Barack Obama agreed to mandate health coverage for most Americans. The law also permitted states to widen access to Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance, with Uncle Sam covering related costs for three years. But Perry was adamant about Texas not expanding; in July 2012, he rejected the deal, calling the offer a brazen intrusion into state sovereignty. And in 2013, the Republican-led Legislature, in accord with Perry, "shot down federal efforts to cover uninsured, low-income Texans by expanding access to Medicaid," according to a May 2013 Austin American-Statesman news story. Texans in the 'coverage gap' So what is this "coverage gap" and how many Texans fall into it? In 2014, uninsured Texans earning 100 to 400 percent of the federal poverty level began to be offered subsidies to help buy insurance on an online healthcare exchange or marketplace. However, as the Statesman story said, Texas adults living below the poverty line—then $11,170 for an individual, $19,090 for a family of three—won no change in access. Some 947,000 uninsured Texas adults were living below the poverty line at the time, the story said. Varied estimates Mindful that figure is years old, we hunted fresh data. Replying to our requests for elaboration, the Democratic spokesman, Gamboa, pointed out news stories, including a January 2015 Associated Press news story stating: "Texas leads the nation in uninsured, with nearly a quarter of the state’s population—6.4 million people—lacking health insurance." That story said the Obamacare law "mandates expanding Medicaid to residents with incomes less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level, but a Supreme Court ruling left expansion up to each state and Texas said no. "That created a ‘coverage gap’ of more than 1 million Texans who aren’t poor enough to qualify for Medicaid," the story said, "but don’t earn enough to receive the law’s new subsidized health insurance." But there also are other estimates. In particular, Anne Dunkelberg of the Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for low-income residents, initially nudged by email that according to the center’s interactive Health & Wealth County Checkup website, nearly 1.2 million to nearly 1.3 million Texans fit the coverage gap. Drawing on an October 2013 report from the Kaiser Family Foundation, itself rooted in Census Bureau surveys asking whether respondents had health insurance, the center reached a rough estimate of 1,151,410 to 1,208,090 Texans in the coverage gap. The foundation is a nonpartisan health policy research group, Also, the center notes, a February 2014 report by the Urban Institute, limited to estimates for major urban counties, supports the estimate of 1,293,100 Texans in the coverage gap. A November 2014 analysis Most recently, a November 2014 Kaiser report said that in states that do not expand Medicaid, many adults fall into a ‘coverage gap’ of having incomes above Medicaid eligibility limits but below the lower limit for Marketplace premium tax credits," meaning the Obamacare subsidies. The report, starting from the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey results for 2014, offered this illustration of its estimated nearly 4 million citizens in the gap--one quarter of them, or 948,000, living in Texas--who would have been newly eligible for Medicaid if their state had expanded coverage: Source: Report, "The Coverage Gap: Uninsured Poor Adults in States that Do Not Expand Medicaid – An Update," Kaiser Family Foundation, Nov. 12, 2014 (accessed Feb. 24, 2105) By email, Kaiser spokesman Chris Lee told us the 948,000 figure was the organization’s latest estimate of Texans lacking insurance who would be eligible for Medicaid if Texas agreed to expand access. Experts told us there is one other way to use Census Bureau surveys to estimate Texans in the coverage gap. By email, a bureau demographer, Carla Medalia, guided us to results from the 2013 American Community Survey indicating that nearly 1.4 million Texans aged 18 through 64 were uninsured and living below the poverty level--meaning they weren’t eligible either for Medicaid in Texas or for Obamacare subsidies; they’re potential gappers. Dunkelberg cautioned, though, that the bureau figures don’t filter out residents living in the country without legal authorization or legal immigrants here less than five years; members of both subgroups would be ineligible for Medicaid. On balance of late, Dunkelberg said, she’s been saying around 1 million Texans fall into the gap. Affordable care? Next, we wondered if individuals in the gap live without affordable care, as the Democrats said. Nationally, the Kaiser report offered its read of what kinds of Americans fit the coverage gap. "While nearly half of people in the coverage gap report that their health is excellent or very good, nearly a fifth (18%) report that they are in fair or poor health," the report said. "These individuals have known health problems that likely require medical attention." The report also recapped whether individuals in the gap otherwise reported having access to coverage, perhaps through a family member’s job. "The work status of people in the coverage gap indicates that there are limited coverage options available for people in this situation," the report said. "Two-thirds (66%) of people in the coverage gap are in a family with a worker, and 54% are working themselves," the report said. "While workers could potentially have an offer of coverage through their employer, the majority of workers in the coverage gap (51%) work for small firms (<50 employees) that will not be subject to ACA penalties for not offering coverage. Further, many firms do not offer coverage to part-time workers. A majority of workers in the coverage gap also work in industries with historically low insurance rates, such as the agriculture and service industries. More than a third (34%) of adults in the coverage gap are in a family with no workers." Our ruling The Democratic Party said more than 1 million Texans live without affordable health care because Perry failed to "partner with the Legislature to find a Texas solution to closing the coverage gap." Per the latest estimates, it’s safe to say around a million Texas adults fall into the coverage gap for making too little money to qualify for insurance subsidies and also remaining ineligible for Medicaid unless Texas expands access as encouraged by the Obamacare law and rejected by Perry and the state’s ruling Republicans. Less certain is what kind of care is available to those people in the gap and how affordable it might be for them. We rate this statement, which lacked clarification, Mostly True.

pomt-01570	"Under Rick Scott, homeowners are paying higher (home insurance) premiums for less coverage."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/sep/10/charlie-crist/homeowners-are-paying-more-less-insurance-coverage/	It didn’t take long for Charlie Crist to fire a major volley in the battle for the governor’s mansion, taking aim at incumbent Rick Scott’s record on homeowner’s insurance. Soon after the August primary, Crist outlined a plan to "reverse Ricks Scott’s hikes to property insurance." The Sept. 4 document compared the new Democrat’s record on the issue to Scott’s, saying the cost-to-benefit ratio has been going in the wrong direction. "During Scott’s tenure, premiums rose while the amount of coverage declined," Crist’s plan read. "In other words, under Rick Scott, homeowners are paying higher premiums for less coverage." The insurance market has been on a rollercoaster ride the past decade, with consumers reeling from the highest costs for homeowner’s insurance in the nation. Are homeowners paying more for less coverage under the current Republican governor? It’s PolitiFact Florida’s policy to check the paper trail very carefully. A familiar pledge Crist is no stranger to making insurance rates a campaign issue. When he campaigned as a Republican in 2006, he pledged to bring rates down after eight hurricanes hit the state in 2004 and 2005, catapulting premiums ever higher. He followed through on a promise to call a special session of the Legislature in January 2007. The result was HB 1A, which expanded state-sponsored reinsurance (essentially insurance for insurers) for private carriers and froze rates for Citizens Property Insurance Corp., the state-run insurer of last resort. Because private insurers began charging such high premiums, Citizens had taken on some 400,000 more policies between 2004 and 2007, for a total of 1.2 million properties covered as private insurers looked to reduce their exposure in Florida. Industry experts warned that a major side effect of expanding Citizens was that the company would not be able to pay claims in the event of a direct hit by a hurricane, resulting in a statewide assessment on all policies. The rate freeze eventually stretched on until 2009, when Crist signed HB 1495, which passed the Legislature with strong support. That law allowed rate increases of up to 10 percent to help Citizens become actuarially sound. Florida’s insurance rates began another upward climb under Crist, despite no direct hits from hurricanes since 2005. Scott came into office in 2011 looking to reduce the high number of Citizens policies by turning to the private insurance market. His first year, he signed SB 408, which insurance companies and business groups praised. This is the bill Crist blames for rising premiums and reduced coverage; Crist vetoed a similar bill near the end of his term. Critics warned the legislation was bad for consumers because it allowed a reduction in overall coverage limits, shortened the window for filing sinkhole and storm-related damage claims, and limited claims for damage caused by sinkholes to primary structures, among other things. SB 408 also made carriers file requests with the regulation office for rate increases up to 15 percent to account for higher reinsurance costs. The law also allowed insurers to pay back some claims at actual cash value -- the cost of the insured dwelling minus depreciation -- instead of replacement value, depending on the policy. By the following year, Citizens began limiting coverage on most policies to the primary structure, leaving out things like gazebos, awnings, carports and pool enclosures. That was something private insurers had been doing since Hurricane Wilma in 2005. We took a look at average premiums for all private homeowners insurance policies over the last eight years. (Crist’s plan referred to all these years except 2014’s first quarter totals, as well, which the state’s Office of Insurance Regulation said were accurate). Total exposure is the amount both private companies and Citizens were liable to cover, while total premiums paid is the amount all policies collected in premiums. The state maintained a steady run of roughly 6 million total policies during this time period: Year/governor Average premium Total exposure Total premiums paid 2007/Crist $1,679 $1.82 trillion $9.6 billion 2008/Crist $1,463 $1.9 trillion $8.6 billion 2009/Crist $1,421 $1.9 trillion $8.3 billion 2010/Crist $1,518 $1.88 trillion $8.8 billion 2011/Scott $1,608 $1.88 trillion $9.3 billion 2012/Scott $1,670 $1.83 trillion $9.6 billion 2013/Scott $1,732 $1.82 trillion $10 billion 2014/Scott* $1,741 $1.68 trillion $9.5 billion * as of March 2014, excludes State Farm The chart shows that premiums dropped the first year after Crist took office, even while more coverage was in force. Premiums went up and exposure went down in 2010, Crist’s final year in office, but the trend really took off after Scott took office. Premiums continued to rise while exposure fell by some $200 billion. Scott’s aim was to shrink Citizens, and that’s what happened (his campaign promise to make Citizens "actuarially sound" is on our Scott-O-Meter). The state insurer slimmed down by more than 400,000 policies, largely by "taking out" customers, in which private insurers assumed coverage at slightly different terms. While customers were allowed to refuse the switch, the new policies often were less expensive than Citizens policies, with marginally better terms. On Sept. 4, the same day Crist released his plan to lower insurance rates if elected, the state Office of Insurance Regulation authorized 14 insurers to assume up to more than 425,000 Citizens policies, further shrinking the state’s pool of customers and reducing the company’s risk. It is the single largest authorized removal since Citizens was formed in 2002, although far fewer than that are likely to move to private insurers. There’s no question SB 408, passed under Scott, allowed rates to increase and coverage to be restricted, because that’s what it was supposed to do, according to Citizens media relations manager Michael Peltier. He told PolitiFact Florida that changes in sinkhole coverage were necessary because of a dramatic increase in claims that often were fraudulent. The problem hadn’t been addressed and was increasingly becoming an issue after those historic hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005, leading to the 2007 legislation that froze rates. "The rates have been raised since (SB) 408 and there have been more stricter policies since (SB) 408, but those are making up for prior deficits," Peltier said. He said now that rates have gone up and exposure has gone down, the company is in a much better position. It’s not all rosy, however, because some customers still cannot afford the coverage they need, since sinkhole coverage is not a part of a base policy. The entire insurance industry has insisted there are many other factors forcing continued rate increases, such as reinsurance costs and payouts for other claims beyond hurricane damage. For example, State Insurance Consumer Advocate Steve Burgess said, companies have pointed to a recent spike in claims on homeowners policies over water damage. Reports have surfaced of attorneys convincing contractors they were being shortchanged by insurance companies to repair damage from leaky pipes and floods. Data from the National Association of Insurance Commissioners in 2013 ranked Florida as having the most expensive homeowners insurance in the nation. Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty said in a January 2014 report that after years of double-digit increases, a half dozen top insurers suddenly had sought or approved cutting future premiums between 2.4 and 9.2 percent. Companies that had initially wanted increases reversed themselves when their savings on reinsurance came to light. Citizens in August also asked for a 2015 rate cut for about 70 percent of its customers.The state approved a slightly larger break than what was requested in September, and Citizens had to back off a plan to raise sinkhole rates in Hernando County. Peltier said the drop in exposure, the terms of 408 and the recent lower cost of reinsurance all helped bring about the lower premiums. The lack of hurricanes since 2005 has been a big help, as well. "It’s taken time," Peltier said. "Since (SB) 408 has had such an effect on our claims, we can’t project what our losses are going to be. We’ve had to wait." Our ruling Charlie Crist said "under Rick Scott, homeowners are paying higher premiums for less coverage." He was referring to a controversial bill Scott signed in 2011, right after taking office, that made a host of changes to the insurance industry and allowed rates to go up. The insurance industry says these changes were necessary to remain solvent after dealing with a host of factors, including two very active hurricane seasons, a jump in sinkhole claims and high reinsurance costs. Those issues have since ebbed, and many policyholders should now enjoy a small break on premiums. Rates have been rising since Crist’s last year in office, in part because companies sought to catch up from limits placed on them by his 2007 legislative push after premiums rocketed out of control. That’s a bit of additional information Crist didn’t include in his attack on Scott, but his statement is still accurate. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-00283	Says "Christine Blasey Ford’s letter to Sen. Dianne Feinstein revealed to be a total FAKE… contains 14 glaring errors that could only be committed by a poorly educated writer." ​	pants on fire!	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/sep/28/blog-posting/no-christine-blasey-fords-letter-wasnt-written-som/	Members of the Senate Judiciary Committee questioned many aspects of sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh during the hearing on Sept. 27. However, the authorship of the initial letter outlining one accusation was not in dispute. Christine Blasey Ford wrote a confidential letter to her congresswoman over the summer saying she was sexually assaulted by Kavanaugh while the two were in high school. The committee’s top Republican Sen. Charles Grassley released that letter publicly on Sept. 23. Ranking committee member Sen. Dianne Feinstein sent him the letter Sept. 20. Some websites have questioned the letter’s legitimacy, saying Ford did not author the letter. Ford has now testified under oath that she did. The blog Natural News makes the claim, saying the letter contains "14 glaring errors that could only be committed by a poorly educated writer." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Ford is a California psychology professor who says Kavanaugh assaulted her at a party in 1982. The blog says that because Ford is an academic, grammatical errors in her letter indicate she did not write it. Some of these "errors" in the letter nitpick word choice. The blogger points out phrases like "the two scrapped with each other" and "I feared he may inadvertently kill me" as examples of poor or odd phrasing. Other "errors" could be due to copying procedures. An "I" toward the end of the document has a blur that makes it look lowercase. A line of text is stretched larger than other lines in the scan. The blogger points to the warp as an attempt to alter the content of the letter because that line has Kavanaugh’s name in it. Kavanaugh is named several other places in the letter without any text warping. Another of the "errors" is that Ford uses the phrase "opportune moment." The blogger says that wording "indicates a low-level writer attempting to sound sophisticated." That’s an unfounded opinion, not an error. This isn’t the first time Natural News has made ridiculous claims related to Ford’s credibility or motives. We gave the blog a Pants on Fire rating for a claim that Ford came forward to "protect abortion industry profits." This isn’t any less absurd. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-00895	The infant mortality rate is 15 percent higher in states with right-to-work laws.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/mar/05/julie-lassa/julie-lassa-says-infant-mortality-rate-15-percent-/	The arguments against right-to-work legislation usually focus on economic matters. Supporters say such a law will make a state more friendly to business; opponents say it will reduce the strength of unions, and depress the state’s wages and incomes. The Republican-pushed bill, which prohibits employers from signing contracts with unions that require employees to pay union dues, was fast tracked in the Legislature and is expected to reach Gov. Scott Walker’s desk by March 6, 2015. When the state Senate debated the right-to-work bill Feb. 25, 2015, state Sen. Julie Lassa (D-Stevens Point) criticized the measure with the wages-and-income argument -- then she took it a step further. Said Lassa: "Families in right-to-work states are less likely to have health insurance, and the infant mortality rate is 15 percent higher than in other states." Wait. Babies are at greater risk of death in right-to-work states? Looking at the evidence When we asked Lassa for her evidence, her staff pointed to a Jan. 23, 2015 report by the liberal Economic Policy Institute written by Gordon Lafer, a political economist at the University of Oregon. His report says that by a number of measures -- including infant mortality rates -- Wisconsin fares better than the 24 states with right-to-work laws. And he says right-to-work states are worse off than those without such laws. For infant mortality numbers, Lafer relies on data from 2010 collected by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. To do the right-to-work comparison, he added up the infant mortality rates in those states and divided by 24, to get 6.7 deaths per 1,000 births. The same approach for the other states found 5.8 deaths per 1,000 births. The difference is 15 percent. But simply adding up the rates and dividing by the number of states isn’t an accurate method because the calculation could be skewed by states with relatively more or fewer births and deaths, said Geoffrey Swain, medical director and chief medical officer for the City of Milwaukee Health Department, and an expert on infant mortality. His office provided the raw data from the CDC for births and infant deaths for 2012, the most recent year available. Using those numbers, right-to-work states had 6.48 deaths per 1,000 live births, while the remaining states (and the District of Columbia) had 5.54. The difference under this approach is actually larger -- 16.97 percent. So, Lassa is about right when it comes to the numbers. But she linked the number to right-to-work status, suggesting there is a causal relationship: One leads to the other. That’s a lot less clear, and it depends on the impact the law would have on the state’s economy, income and wages. And, of course, the sides disagree on that front. A study prepared for the conservative Wisconsin Policy Research Institute by Ohio University economist Richard Vedder argues that right-to-work laws added "about six percentage points to the growth rate of RTW states from 1983 to 2013. With such a law, Wisconsin’s per capita personal income growth of 53.29 percent would have been, instead, about 59.29 percent." Translated: right-to-work boosts the economy and wages. Lafer’s report comes to a much different conclusion. His study says right-to-work "is associated with lower wages and benefits for both union and nonunion workers. In a RTW state, the average worker makes 3.2 percent less than a similar worker in a non-RTW state." He also said average household income in right-to-work states is $6,430 less than in states without such laws. Of course, it’s impossible to predict how the law will affect jobs and wages in Wisconsin. The linkage Lafer -- and Lassa -- make also is based upon the idea that infant mortality rates are themselves correlated with poverty and other factors. Swain noted that a 2012 study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found that there was an improvement in key factors affecting infant mortality when the federal earned income tax credit -- targeted at low income people -- was expanded. Putting a relatively modest amount of money in the hands of the most needy helped, Swain said. "These people are living on the margins and giving them a little more (income) would make a difference," Swain said. Therefore, he said, "it’s likely that lower wages are going to lead to worse outcomes." For their part, CDC officials say they "haven’t investigated the association between wages (or right to work states) and infant mortality." Our rating Lassa says right-to-work states have higher infant mortality than states without such a law. She’s right on the raw numbers. But there are many more factors at work -- some of them are vigorously disputed -- when it comes to how such laws affect wages, incomes and especially lower income people whose babies are more at risk. That’s simply not settled. Over the years, we have examined a series of claims that take a wage or job related statistic and say it is either better or worse in a right-to-work state. Generally, we have rated these Half True -- the statistic is right, but there is no clear evidence of a causal relationship. That fits here as well.

pomt-03997	"The brutal fact is, when it comes to education, America is slipping" behind other nations.	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2013/feb/08/bob-mcdonnell/mcdonnell-says-us-education-slipping-behind-other-/	For the good of the state and the good of the nation, Gov. Bob McDonnell has asked the General Assembly to approve a package of education reforms this winter. "The brutal fact is, when it comes to educating our young people, America is slipping," McDonnell said in his State of the Commonwealth address on Jan. 9. "While Virginia's schools rate well nationally, according to the Program for International Student Assessment, the United States now ranks 14th in reading, 17th in science, and 25th in mathematics." he added. "This is unacceptable. Those are not grades that we want to put on the national refrigerator." We checked whether the U.S. really is slipping in world education rankings. McDonnell made the claim while urging lawmakers to approve his education agenda that would grade all public schools and empower the state to take over schools that receive failing marks. The international assessment test McDonnell cited is a two-hour exam given to a representative sample of 15-year-olds in an increasing number of nations. The testing started in 2000 and has been given every three years to measure literacy in reading, math and science. The results show the average scores, weighted for demographics, in each country. Most of the 34 member nations belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- an industrialized group of mostly Western European and North American countries -- participate each testing cycle. A smattering of other countries, such as Russia, Indonesia and Brazil, and regional educational systems in China also take part. In 2000, 32 countries participated. That grew to 65 nations in 2009, the most recent test year with published results. Let’s look at the United States’ rankings, as reported by the National Center for Educational Statistics: Reading *In 2000, the U.S. was 15th among 28 OECD countries and 15th of 32 total nations. *In 2003, 15th among 30 OECD countries and 18th among 41 overall. *In 2006, U.S. scores were not tabulated because of a printing error in the test books. *In 2009, tied for 12th among 34 OECD countries and was 15th among 65 total nations. Science *In 2000, the U.S. was 14th among the 28 OECD countries and 14th of 32 total nations. *In 2003, 19th among 30 OECD countries and 22nd among 41 overall. *In 2006, 21st among 30 OECD countries and 27th among 57 overall. *In 2009, 17th among 34 OECD countries and 23rd among 65 overall. Math *In 2000, the U.S was 18th among 28 OECD countries and 19th of 32 total nations. *In 2003, 24th among 30 OECD countries and 27th among 41 overall. *In 2006, 25th among 30 OECD countries and 35th among 57 overall. *In 2009, 25th among 34 OECD countries and 31st among 65 overall. Now, let’s take a look at the actual test scores over the last decade, which were calculated on a scale from 0 to 1,000. We can compare the average score of U.S. students to those of all students from OECD nations. The National Center for Educational Statistics does not compute a worldwide average that includes every single nation that participates in the test. In reading, the U.S. average was 504 in 2000, 495 in 2003 and 500 in 2009. Results, as we noted, were not tabulated in 2006. The OECD average was 500 in 2000, 494 in 2003 and 493 in 2009. In science, the U.S. average was 499 in 2000, 491 in 2003, 489 in 2006 and 502 in 2009. The OECD average was each year was either 500 or 501. In math, U.S. students scored 493 in 2000, 483 in 2003, 474 in 2006 and 487 in 2009. The OECD average was 500 for the first two tests, followed by 498 and 496. What conclusions should be drawn from this data? Experts said the results do not show a decline in America’s education standing, but a solid, middle-of-the pack position. "The pattern of scores over the years shows that we’ve held fairly steady," said Robert Pianta, dean of the Curry School of Education at the University of Virginia. Tom Loveless, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who studies international testing, said scores bounce around routinely, but the long-term trend is positive in American education. The U.S. participates in several international tests and typically scores in the the middle or just above the middle of the pack. "All these tests measure different things, but they all confirm that education is improving, it could be improving faster and there is more room for improvement, but we’re definitely not in decline," he said. "The idea that any of these tests are saying that American education is in decline is false." McDonnell is hardly the first politician to claim the U.S. education system is slipping in status. Mitt Romney, the Republican candidate for president last year, cited the same statistics and said the country has "fallen way behind." And in 2009, President Barack Obama said that "we have let our grades slip" and "other nations outpace us." Loveless says it’s simply not the case. "The first international test was given in 1960 to 12 countries and the U.S. came in 11th out of 12," he said. "We’ve never done well on these tests." Loveless said the U.S. -- unlike some of the nations with top test rankings -- tends to prize well-rounded students by teaching many subjects, encouraging extracurricular activities and social interaction at school. We asked McDonnell’s office if it had any further explanation of the governor’s statement. "In the past decade, the United States has not ranked among the top 10 countries in reading literacy, science literacy or mathematics literacy," Paul Logan, deputy director of communications, said in an email. "The governor believes that every year we lag behind other countries in education is a year in which we are slipping in our ability to compete for the jobs of the 21st century." Our ruling McDonnell said that "when it comes to educating our young people, America is slipping" in worldwide rankings. The international test results he referred to have been administered every three years since 2000. There’s a tiny element of truth to McDonnell’s claim: America’s math standing dipped last decade when compared with other nations in the OECD. But even that overlooks the fact that U.S. math scores, after a mid-decade drop, rebounded in 2009, when the last test results were published. And when all countries that took the exam in 2009 are considered, the U.S. ranked in the top half in math for the first time. McDonnell ignored critical facts that paint a different picture of America’s performance. During the last decade, the U.S. edged up in the rankings on reading and remained at the 50th percentile in science among OECD nations. "Slipping" implies lower scores and rankings. That’s not the case. The U.S. has never ranked near the top in education test scores and, with a possible exception for math, has not lost ground to other countries. We rate McDonnell’s claim Mostly False.	None	Bob McDonnell	None	None	None	2013-02-08T15:27:09	2013-01-09	['United_States']
pomt-13584	"While introducing Donald Trump, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani omitted the September 11, 2001, strikes as a ‘successful’ terrorist attack during the eight years before President Obama’s 2008 election."	true	/california/statements/2016/aug/18/john-burton/top-california-democrat-seizes-911-omission-donald/	California Democratic Party Chairman John Burton seized on a major gaffe this week by former New York City mayor and Donald Trump backer Rudy Giuliani. Giuliani, as he introduced Trump during an August 15 speech in Ohio, claimed radical Islamic terror attacks started in the United States under President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and not under President George W. Bush. "By the way, under those eight years before Obama came along, we didn’t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States," Giuliani said. "They all started when Clinton and Obama got into office." Former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani speaks at a rally for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.​ He makes his omission at the 1:00 minute mark. PolitiFact, citing the huge omission of the September 11, 2001 terror attacks, rated Giuliani’s claim False. Burton jumped on Giuliani’s statement a day later, saying: "Yesterday while introducing Donald Trump, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani omitted the September 11, 2001, strikes as a ‘successful’ terrorist attack during the eight years before President Obama’s 2008 election. Mayor Giuliani must be spending so much time with Trump that he’s unable to tell truth from fiction." We are relying on the national PolitiFact team’s reporting below to examine the accuracy of the portion of Burton’s statement about Giuliani’s major omission, which appears unassailable. Giuliani’s omission Giuliani, warming up the crowd for Trump’s counter-terrorism speech, appeared to forget one of the defining moments of modern U.S. history and his own political career: the Sept. 11 attacks. The Republican former mayor of New York City during 9/11 was widely lampooned (following the omission) for suggesting that terrorist attacks on U.S. soil were unique to Barack Obama’s presidency. But many media reports left out the beginning of his speech, when he talked at length about 9/11. He recounted how it was the "worst foreign attack in our history since the War of 1812" and how Trump’s running mate, Mike Pence, visited "Ground Zero when we were in desperate need of help." Still, Giuliani seemed to throw everything he had just said out the window: "By the way, under those eight years before Obama came along, we didn’t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States. They all started when Clinton and Obama got into office." Back in 2010, Giuliani made a similar gaffe when he claimed, "We had no domestic attacks under (President George W.) Bush." He later apologized for misspeaking and not adding the words, "since Sept. 11." Giuliani apparently made the same mistake again, telling the New York Daily News that he was just using "abbreviated language." But even barring 9/11, Giuliani is omitting several successful attacks on U.S. soil. Some are undoubtedly jihad-linked while the connection to "radical Islamic extremism" is murkier in others. The New America Foundation, for example, compiles a comprehensive list of terrorist plots, but its definition of "violent jihadist attacks" does not necessarily match up with law enforcement classification. That’s because strict definitions like "hate crime" or "terrorist attack" may be useful for prosecuting cases, but they may cloud the public’s understanding of what the attack was and what motivated the crimes — "questions to which answers are rarely linear or packaged into a neat explanation," said Albert Ford, a research assistant at New America. That being said, let’s go through successful attacks on U.S. soil in which ideology played some role. 2002 Los Angeles Airport shooting On July 4, 2002, Hesham Mohamed Hadayet opened fire at Los Angeles International Airport, killing two and injuring four. Hadayet, a 41-year-old Egyptian national, died after being shot by an airport security guard. Prior to his immigration to the United States, Egyptian authorities accused him of belonging to the terrorist organization, Al-Gama'a al-Islamiyya (though he denied this charge). The FBI concluded that Hadayet’s killing spree was a terrorist act, but he acted alone and hoped to influence U.S. government policy toward Palestine. 2002 Beltway snipers In October 2002, John Allen Muhammad and his accomplice, 17-year-old Lee Boyd Malvo, randomly gunned down 10 people in Washington. They were arrested by police and SWAT officers on Oct. 24. The snipers’ motives were myriad. Malvo drew sketches depicting his acts as jihad and testified that Muhammad, a member of the Nation of Islam, lectured him on the religion. He also said Muhammad wanted to start a revolution over "the continued oppression of black people." A Virginia court found Muhammad guilty of engaging in an act of terrorism, and the incident is listed as a major terrorism case on the FBI’s website. Muhammad was executed in 2009 and Malvo is currently serving a life sentence. 2006 Seattle Jewish Federation shooting On July 28, 2006, Naveed Afzal Haq killed one woman and injured five others at the Jewish Federation of Greater Seattle. A witness told the Associated Press that Haq declared himself "a Muslim American, angry at Israel" before opening fire. FBI officials said he was not acting part of a terrorist group, but "acting out some kind of antagonism toward this particular organization." The attack was ultimately classified as a hate crime by the county prosecutor. In 2014, however, the City of Seattle included the shooting as an example of an incident that fits "into the terrorist mold" while the New America Foundation lists it as a "violent jihadist attack," because Haq claimed to be motivated by opposition to U.S. actions. 2006 University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill attack In March 2006, UNC graduate Mohammad Reza Taheri-azar drove an SUV onto campus, injuring nine pedestrians. He turned himself in following the attack and sent several letters to UNC’s student newspaper from jail declaring his intentions to exact revenge for Muslims. "I was aiming to follow in the footsteps of one of my role models, Mohammad Atta, one of the 9/11/01 hijackers, who obtained a doctorate degree," he wrote in one letter. UNC students were divided over whether Taheri-azar’s actions constituted an act of terror. The FBI declined to comment on whether it was investigating links to terrorism, the New York Times reported in 2006. PolitiFact’s ruling on Giuliani’s claim Moments after mentioning 9/11, Giuliani said, "Under those eight years before Obama came along, we didn’t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attack in the United States." Since then, there have been four successful plots on U.S. soil that were declared by the FBI to be terrorist attacks or whose perpetrators claimed to be motivated by ideology or anti-U.S. sentiments. Reasonable people can disagree over the definition of jihad-inspired terrorism, but Giuliani is taking things too far by omitting all of them. We rate his claim False. PolitiFact California’s ruling on Burton’s claim California Democratic Party Chairman John Burton said Giuliani omitted the 9/11 attacks as "a ‘successful’ terrorist attack during the eight years before President Obama’s 2008 election." Giuliani’s remarks were captured on video and clearly show he left out the 9/11 attacks. Based on this video and PolitiFact’s reporting about terror attacks that took place under President Bush, including 9/11, we rate Burton’s claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-09881	Only 15 percent of drug users are African-American, yet 74 percent of all drug offenders sentenced to prison are black	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/28/arianna-huffington/arianna-huffington-calls-drug-imprisonment-rates-b/	In another example of how the arrest of African-American scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. has driven pundits to talk about issues of race and crime, Arianna Huffington, the founder of the liberal Huffington Post news Web site, offered some statistics about race, drug use and incarceration during a July 26, 2009, roundtable on ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos . Huffington said, "It is really stunning that only 15 percent of the total drug population — drug offending population is African-American. And yet you have 74 percent of them who wind up in jail." A staffer for Huffington clarified her point: African-Americans make up 15 percent of drug users, but 74 percent of drug offenders sentenced to prison. Her comment echoed longstanding calls by critics of U.S. drug policy and criminal sentencing guidelines. These critics have argued that blacks are unfairly targeted by U.S. drug laws as well as the ways those laws are enforced. So we decided to dig into Huffington’s numbers to see if they were correct. An aide to Huffington said her numbers came from a 2006 ACLU report, "Cracks in the System: Twenty Years of the Unjust Federal Crack Cocaine Law," and she did indeed report the numbers correctly from that study. The ACLU, in turn, footnoted those numbers to a fact sheet posted by a group called the Interfaith Drug Policy Initiative. When we checked that group’s Web site, however, we could not find any further footnoting for the statistics. So we decided to look at the raw federal data ourselves. To determine whether blacks account for 15 percent of drug users, we first turned to the 2005 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, released by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. That study is considered the most reliable in the field, though experts say it probably undercounts harder-core addicts who cannot be reached by survey takers. Among other things, the study quantifies the rates of illicit drug use by different racial and ethnic groups. The drugs studied include marijuana, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogens and inhalants, as well as the nonmedical use of prescription drugs. The numbers do not include tobacco or alcohol. According to the survey, 9.7 percent of blacks, 8.1 percent of whites and 7.6 percent of Hispanics reported using illicit drugs within the prior month. To convert these figures into something comparable to what Huffington said, we cross-referenced these drug-use rates to the current populations of each ethnic group, according to the Census Bureau. Our calculations showed that 70 percent of drug users are white, 14 percent are black and 13 percent are Hispanic. On this fact, then, Huffington was very, very close. She wasn’t as accurate, however, on the second half of her assertion, that 74 percent of all drug offenders sentenced to prison are black. To verify her number, we turned to "Prisoners in 2007," a report by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, which is the statistical arm of the U.S. Department of Justice. That report offered estimated figures for offenders sentenced to state prison for drug violations: 113,500 blacks, 72,300 whites and 51,100 Hispanics. On a percentage basis, this means that 29 percent of inmates for drug offenses were white, 20 percent were Hispanic and 45 percent were black — well under the 74 percent level asserted by Huffington. In the federal system, the percentages are lower still for African-Americans. According to the U.S. Sentencing Commission, for fiscal year 2008, there were 25,273 federal sentences for drug offenses. Of that number, African-American prisoners didn’t even account for the highest percentage among the three biggest groups. Hispanics led with 40 percent, followed by blacks at 31 percent and whites at 25 percent. One drug policy expert we contacted, Beau Kilmer of the RAND Corp., said our calculations were sound, though he added that Huffington’s comparison of drug use and incarceration has some logical holes. "We have to realize most drug use is marijuana, and that’s not the reason why people are going to prison — it’s the harder drugs," Kilmer said. Ultimately, Huffington was right about one number and quite a bit off with the other. However, even at the much lower rates of incarceration we found, black Americans — who account for about 13 percent of the U.S. population — are still imprisoned for drug offenses at wildly disproportionate rates. So we rate this statement Half True.	None	Arianna Huffington	None	None	None	2009-07-28T17:51:27	2009-07-26	['None']

pomt-08264	Grocery prices "have risen significantly over the past year or so."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/nov/10/sarah-palin/whos-right-food-inflation-sarah-palin-or-wall-stre/	Almost anything Sarah Palin says on her Facebook page draws attention -- especially if someone thinks she's got it wrong. And that's exactly what's happened in the past few days. It all began Nov. 7, 2010, when the National Review Online published an advance version of a keynote address Palin was preparing to give to a trade-association convention in Phoenix. Her comments were pegged to the Group of Twenty Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors economic summit in South Korea, at which a central point of discussion was expected to be a Federal Reserve bond-buying proposal called "quantitative easing," or "QE2" for short. Palin warned that the U.S., specifically Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, "shouldn't be playing around with inflation." She explained part of her reasoning this way: "All this pump priming (by the Fed) will come at a serious price. And I mean that literally: Everyone who ever goes out shopping for groceries knows that prices have risen significantly over the past year or so. Pump priming would push them even higher." This triggered a response from an economics blogger at the Wall Street Journal, Sudeep Reddy. In a Nov. 8, 2010, blog post, Reddy wrote that inflation generally, and food inflation specifically, are actually quite low right now. Here's part of what Reddy wrote: "Grocery prices haven't risen all that significantly, in fact. The Consumer Price Index's measure of food and beverages for the first nine months of this year showed average annual inflation of less than 0.6 percent, the slowest pace on record (since the Labor Department started keeping this measure in 1968). Even if you pick a single snapshot — say, September's year-over-year increase in prices — that was just 1.4 percent, far better than the 6 percent annual increase for food prices recorded in September 2008. "The overall consumer price index was up 1.1 percent in September from a year earlier. Apart from September 2009 (when prices were down 1.3 percent), that was the slowest annual inflation rate for September since the early 1960s. That's not strong evidence to argue about rising prices today." The same day, Palin fired back via Facebook. She titled her post, "Do Wall Street Journal Reporters Read the Wall Street Journal?" "Really?" Palin wrote. "That's odd, because just last Thursday, November 4, I read an article in Mr. Reddy's own Wall Street Journal titled 'Food Sellers Grit Teeth, Raise Prices: Packagers and Supermarkets Pressured to Pass Along Rising Costs, Even as Consumers Pinch Pennies.' The article noted that 'an inflationary tide is beginning to ripple through America's supermarkets and restaurants. … Prices of staples including milk, beef, coffee, cocoa and sugar have risen sharply in recent months.' Now I realize I'm just a former governor and current housewife from Alaska, but even humble folks like me can read the newspaper. I'm surprised a prestigious reporter for the Wall Street Journal doesn't." Ouch. So, on Nov. 9, Reddy replied to Palin in another blog post. Reddy reiterated the statistics he had cited earlier, then added some additional detail. "While some items in the shopping cart have risen in price (ground chuck beef is up 4.8%) and others have decreased (bananas are down 5.3%), overall food price inflation has been historically low for the past year. This is not surprising. Weak demand, high unemployment and thrifty shoppers have led retailers to keep many prices from rising despite the rising cost of some commodities, including coffee and sugar. The Nov. 4 Wall Street Journal article noted, in its first sentence, 'the tamest year of food pricing in nearly two decades.' It does indeed report that supermarkets and restaurants are facing cost pressures that could push their retail prices higher -- but it hasn't happened yet on a large scale. Critics of the Fed's quantitative easing policy are focused primarily on concerns about potential future inflation." Clearly, sorting all this out sounds like a job for PolitiFact. We first turned to the Consumer Price Index, or CPI, the most widely used statistic to measure inflation. During the 12-month period ending in September 2010, we found that the CPI showed food costs rising 1.4 percent -- exactly as Reddy said they did. For some historical context, we also looked back a couple years. We found that for the year ending in September 2009, food prices dropped two-tenths of 1 percent; for the year ending in September 2008, food prices rose by 6 percent; and for the year ending in September 2007, food prices rose by 4.4 percent. So 2009 and 2010 have indeed been years of relatively low inflation for food. (Here's a chart Reddy provided us showing some of the data he used.) In the meantime, we also looked at additional data. One database we used comes from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, a division of the U.S. Commerce Department. BEA produces a table that shows monthly, quarterly and annual prices for consumer products. One of the categories BEA tracks is food. (The differences between the data sets we used are of interest only to deep-in-the-weeds statisticians; we'll just say that all the databases cited here are considered trustworthy.) We compared food prices in the first quarter of 2009 with food prices in the first quarter of 2010 and found that they had declined 0.9 percent during that period. Making the same comparison for the second quarter of both years showed an increase of 0.2 percent, and a comparison for the third quarter showed an increase of 0.9 percent. These sounded like modest increases to us, but we confirmed that by comparing them to the historical trends in BEA's data. Looking at the past decade of year-to-year price changes, we found that annual food inflation averaged about 2.7 percent a year. The annual increases varied from 1.3 percent to 6 percent. In other words, so far so good for Reddy's critique of Palin: We found no sign that grocery prices "have risen significantly over the past year or so." Still, there are two other points worth making. One point (also mentioned by Reddy) is that certain grocery items increased faster than others -- and that included some staples. CPI data showed that the price of butter increased by 19.1 percent during the 12 months ended Sept. 30, 2010, while the price of bacon rose by 15.7 percent, lamb increased by 9.4 percent and milk increased by 8.3 percent. Meanwhile, BEA statistics show that certain broad food categories rose faster than the food-sector average: a 3.4 percent increase for meats and poultry, a 3.4 percent bump for milk, dairy products and eggs; and a 2.8 percent hike for sweets and sugar. All of these items, in other words, rose a whole lot faster than food inflation generally. And it's simply human nature for a consumer to feel like prices are rising quickly if you have to pay increases like that every time you enter the checkout line. As long as you're paying through the nose for milk, the brain tends to forget that the dried lentils you just bought are down 5.5 percent, and the peanut butter you just bought is down 5.1 percent. The second point is that even if food prices are flat or rising slightly, Americans are living through a period of stagnating or contracting incomes, which means even slowly rising prices hurt. The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service assembles a table detailing "food expenditures by families and individuals as a share of disposable personal money income." The table essentially shows what percentage of their income families are paying for food. In total, Americans tend to spend about 11 percent to 12 percent of their income on food, with a small majority spent on food at home and the rest spent at restaurants. Over the last three years, the food-at-home portion of that spending -- the only part relevant for judging Palin's statement -- rose from 6.4 percent in 2007 to 6.5 percent in 2008 to 6.8 percent in 2009. The reason that families are paying a larger share of disposable income for food had little to do with food prices and a lot to do with contracting incomes. For the first time since at least 1959, "disposable personal money income" dropped between 2008 and 2009, by 1.3 percent. Because food is more of a necessity than many other consumer items, that budget line ended up taking a larger share of many families' shrinking incomes. Neither of these two factors support Palin's claim that grocery prices "have risen significantly over the past year or so." Strictly speaking, grocery prices have generally risen at historically sluggish rates during the period Palin is talking about. However, important food categories, including meat and dairy products, have risen at much faster rates. And in a time of shrinking family incomes, Americans are indeed paying slightly more for food as a percentage of their income. These two additional pieces of information make Palin's observation about grocery prices understandable, even if it isn't borne out in the most widely tracked statistics. So we rate her statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05340	"When we took office, let me remind you, there was virtually no international pressure on Iran."	false	/georgia/statements/2012/may/14/joe-biden/biden-obama-exerting-more-pressure-against-iran/	Vice President Joe Biden has been making a lot of news lately and his recent visit to the Atlanta area was no exception. Biden came to Sandy Springs to give a speech at the national convention of the Rabbinical Assembly, an influential group of about 1,600 rabbis. The Middle East, of course, was a main topic of the vice president’s speech. In particular, Iran, a perennial threat to stability in the region. "When we took office, let me remind you, there was virtually no international pressure on Iran," Biden said. "We were the problem." Some conservatives, who accuse the Obama administration of being apologists for America, responded quickly to Biden’s line that "we were the problem" -- an apparent shot at George W. Bush’s administration. One writer for the right-leaning National Review wrote an article arguing the vice president was wrong about the lack of international pressure on Iran prior to Democrat Barack Obama becoming president in 2009. "[T]hroughout President Bush’s final year in office, diplomatic efforts generated new levels of pressure on Tehran," the Review article reported, referring to the Iranian capital. So who’s right here? Bush, a Republican, was worried about Iran, but his attention in the Middle East was primarily focused on Iraq and Afghanistan, countries where he ordered U.S. troops in military conflict. Obama has made ending combat in Afghanistan and Iraq among his top policies in the region. He’s also turned up the heat on Iran, which is said to be on the verge of developing nuclear weapons. Since 2010, the United States and most of the world’s leading powers have approved several sanctions on Iran. Economic data on Iran is difficult to find, but there is consensus that United Nations sanctions and other forms of punishment are making an impact. The international pressure on Iran includes: an expanded arms embargo. tighter sanctions on groups and individuals associated with the Iranian nuclear program. banning Iran from any activities related to ballistic missiles. a European Union embargo on Iranian oil. According to U.S. Treasury and State Department officials, at least 80 major banks had committed not to finance exports to Iran or to process dollar transactions for Iranian banks. China and Russia, world powers who sometimes stray from the U.S.A.’s international game plan, have participated in varying degrees on pressuring Iran. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in late 2011 before Parliament that the current sanctions campaign was "the heaviest economic onslaught on a nation in history." Okay, it appears the world is making life more difficult for the Iranian regime in the last two years. But what about Biden’s argument that the international community wasn’t as tough on Tehran before Obama took office. Kyle Beardsley, an Emory University assistant professor with vast expertise on such matters, pointed out that as the National Review said, there were several United Nations resolutions against Iran during the latter years of the Bush administration. The U.N. efforts during the Bush years included: Resolution 1737, passed in 2006, which banned trade with Iran in all items, materials, equipment, goods and technology that could contribute to the country’s development of nuclear-weapon delivery systems. Resolution 1747, adopted in 2007, which banned the country’s arms exports and restricted the travel of additional individuals engaged in Iran’s nuclear activities. Resolution 1803, approved in 2008, which froze the assets of people involved in the nuclear program. He did add that the Obama administration has tried to apply more pressure on Iran because there is greater willingness on the part of Europe and other key states to implement tougher sanctions. "It is true that multiple Security Council resolutions were passed during the Bush administration, but they only targeted specific individuals and companies involved in the Iranian nuclear program," Beardsley, whose research includes the influence of U.N. Security Council resolutions, told us via email. "In contrast, U.N. Resolution 1929 (2010) imposes more general sanctions on Iranian arms, and the E.U. decided this year to impose an embargo on Iranian oil. A number of other countries have also increased their own bilateral sanctions against Iran in recent years." Biden would have had a strong case for high marks on the Truth-O-Meter if he said what appeared to be his main point: the Obama administration has prodded the rest of the world to be tougher on Iran. But there is a disconnect with what the vice president actually said and U.N. resolutions passed against Iran during the Bush administration. The resolutions seem to be a little more than "virtually no international pressure on Iran." We rate Biden’s statement False.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2012-05-14T06:00:00	2012-05-08	['Iran']

pomt-01374	Says Charlie Crist "voted against minimum wage when he was in the Senate."	false	/florida/statements/2014/oct/16/rick-scott/scott-accuses-crist-voting-against-minimum-wage-hi/	Gov. Rick Scott was sure to bring allegations that Charlie Crist has changed positions to Wednesday night’s debate in Davie, including the new Democrat’s stance on raising the minimum wage. After former Gov. Crist said he supported raising the minimum wage to $10.10, echoing a plan by President Barack Obama, Scott attacked the newly minted Democrat. "He voted against minimum wage when he was in the Senate," Scott said. "He didn’t think it was the right thing to do, so he voted against it." We’ve looked into Crist’s record before on the minimum wage. There’s some evidence that earlier in his career, Crist opposed raising the minimum wage. But there’s no evidence to show that Crist voted on the minimum wage when he was a state legislator. When the Republican Party of Florida accused Crist earlier this summer of voting against a minimum wage increase, he said that wasn’t so. "I haven’t taken a vote since 1998," he told us then. That year was the tail end of his term in the state Senate, a seat he won in 1992. The GOP told us a commercial it had run attacking Crist for a vote against raising the minimum wage was referring to 2004, when Crist was attorney general. That year, Florida voted in favor of a ballot initiative to raise the minimum wage by $1, to $6.15 an hour. Before then, there was no state minimum wage, only the federally mandated minimum. After the measure passed, the state’s minimum wage went up and was tied to inflation. This year it went up 14 cents an hour and is now $7.93. As attorney general, Crist had no say about whether the measure passed or not. But he also was a board member of the state’s public-private economic development agency Enterprise Florida, which did take a position on the minimum wage. Meeting minutes showed that on Aug. 19, 2004, the board held a teleconference in which members voted unanimously to oppose the minimum wage increase. The voice vote was a statement of principle and was not binding. Attorney General Crist was present at the meeting. Crist barely mentioned the issue until this year, and there is no record it has come up before now. Crist's campaign did not have any response to Scott's statement about Crist taking a Senate vote on the minimum wage. Karen Woodall, executive director of the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, said there had been voting on the minimum wage in the House while Crist was in the Senate, but there were no votes in the Senate. Miami Beach Democrat Jack Gordon had filed a bill in 1992, but that fight ended before Crist was elected. Another bill was filed in 1994 by Howard Forman, D-Hollywood, but it died in committee with no action taken. The House filed a bill with no Senate companion in 1997, but that also failed. The Scott campaign did not clarify Scott’s response, instead pointing out the 2004 vote. With no evidence the issue came up during Crist’s Senate term, it’s possible the governor meant the 2004 voice vote for Enterprise Florida. There’s no evidence of any Senate action between 1993 and 1999, when Crist was there. Our ruling Scott said Crist "voted against minimum wage when he was in the Senate." Crist served on the board of Enterprise Florida when the group opposed an increase to Florida’s minimum wage in 2004. At the time, he was attorney general. But there’s no evidence that Crist ever voted on minimum wage legislation as a state senator. It’s entirely possible Scott misspoke, but there’s no evidence of any such vote during Sen. Crist’s term. We rate the statement False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2014-10-16T16:12:19	2014-10-15	['Charlie_Crist']

pomt-15269	"The top one-tenth of 1 percent" of Americans "own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jul/29/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-madison-claims-top-01-americans-hav/	A month after launching his long-shot bid for the White House, a 73-year-old senator from Vermont appeared in Madison before perhaps the largest gathering for any candidate to that point in the 2016 campaign. Bernie Sanders called for a political revolution against greed and took jabs at Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, a contender on the GOP side of the field. Cheering him on was an Alliant Energy Center crowd that his aides estimated at nearly 10,000 people. At one point during his hourlong speech on July 1, 2015, Sanders said: "The issue of wealth and income inequality, to my mind, is the great moral issue of our time. It is the great economic issue of our time and it is the great political issue of our time. "Let me be as clear as I can be: There is something profoundly wrong when today, the top one-tenth of 1 percent own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent." Wealth inequality is sure to be an issue Sanders emphasizes as he challenges Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination. So, does the top one-tenth of 1 percent of Americans own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent? Previous claims Two of our most-clicked fact checks have found significant gaps in wealth in the United States. Filmmaker Michael Moore -- also speaking in Madison, during the height of protests against Walker over his collective bargaining reforms in 2011 -- said 400 Americans have more wealth than half of all Americans combined. Our rating was True. As of 2010, the net worth of the Forbes 400 -- $1.37 trillion -- exceeded that of the poorest 60 percent of U.S. households. We also rated True a 2013 statement by the liberal One Wisconsin Now advocacy group, which said the wealth of the Wal-Mart Walton family equalled the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined. The wealth of Sam Walton’s heirs, we found, was $89.5 billion -- equal to the bottom 42 percent of American families. A note about those fact checks, in terms of helping explain the wealth gap: Many Americans make a good income, have some savings and investments, and own a nice home; they also have debt, for a mortgage, credit cards and other bills. Some people would still have a pretty healthy bottom line, but still have a negative net worth. Meanwhile, so far in 2015, PolitiFact National has given Sanders a Mostly True for saying income equality in the U.S. is the widest since the 1920s; and a Mostly True for saying 99 percent of all new income is "going to the top 1 percent." Now to his new claim, which is about wealth, rather than income. Sanders’ evidence To back Sanders’ statement, his Senate office cited a news article from The Guardian newspaper. The headline on the article, which reported on a wealth inequality study released in October 2014, matched Sanders’ claim nearly word for word. The study was done for the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonpartisan organization in Cambridge, Mass. It is perhaps best known as the arbiter for determining whether the U.S. economy is in recession. The authors of the study were economists Emmanuel Saez of the University of California, Berkeley, and Gabriel Zucman of the London School of Economics. Using tax records, they made estimates for 2012 on wealth -- that is, the value of all assets, such as a home, and savings and retirement accounts, minus all debts, such as mortgages and credit card balances. The major finding, in terms of Sanders’ claim: The top 0.1 percent was composed of 160,000 families with average wealth of $72.8 million. All told, they owned 22 percent of the nation’s wealth. Meanwhile, the bottom 90 percent -- 144 million families with average wealth of $84,000 -- owned only 22.8 percent of the wealth. In other words, the top 0.1 percent and the bottom 90 percent of U.S. households own virtually the same share of all the nation's wealth. "Wealth is getting more concentrated in the United States," the researchers observed, "but this phenomenon largely owes to the spectacular dynamics of fortunes of dozens and hundreds of million dollars, and much less to the growth in fortunes of a few million dollars. Inequality within rich families is increasing." Two other prominent economists -- Thomas Piketty of the Paris School of Economics and Edward Wolff of New York University -- told us that the study makes solid estimates about wealth inequality. Wolff said he was not aware of another study that examined the wealth of the top 0.1 percent. But some fault the findings to some degree. Another view Richard Burkhauser, a professor of policy analysis at Cornell University, told us that Saez and Zucman are "very well respected economists," but that he has a major complaint about their study: it excludes Social Security. "To ignore it as they do grossly understates the wealth held by Americans in the bottom 99 percent of the population," Burkhauser said. Another criticism is the study that it doesn't take into account changes in tax laws. Daniel Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, pointed us to an article one of his colleagues wrote in the Wall Street Journal. It said, for example, that changes in tax laws in the 1980s and ’90s skew any increase in wealth inequality by requiring more capital income of high-income taxpayers be reported on individual returns, while excluding most capital income of middle-income savers and homeowners. Mitchell told us: "Even if one makes the heroic assumption that the data is completely accurate, our friends on the left take these numbers and want people to believe that the wealth of the top 1 percent (or top 10 percent, or top .01 percent, etc) comes at the expense of the rest of us. This is generally nonsense. People such as Bill Gates become rich because they generate real value for others. There is no fixed pie." Our rating Sanders said "the top one-tenth of 1 percent" of Americans "own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent." His claim repeats a finding from a study by two internationally known economists that were supported by two other major economists we contacted. But the study has been criticized, for example, for not including Social Security in the wealth calculations. For a claim that is accurate but needs additional information, a rating is Mostly True.

pomt-01284	Says Scott Brown "voted to reward" companies "to ship jobs overseas."	half-true	/new-hampshire/statements/2014/oct/31/jeanne-shaheen/jeanne-shaheen-says-scott-brown-voted-reward-compa/	Everywhere they go, Jeanne Shaheen and Scott Brown each tout their own record of supporting businesses. It’s been a familiar topic on the campaign trail, in TV ads and during debates in one of the most-watched Senate races in the country. During their first of three televised debates on Oct. 24, 2014, Shaheen, the Democrat, took it to the Republican Brown, saying he voted to give tax breaks to companies that move jobs overseas. "One of the problems with our tax code is we encourage companies to outsource our jobs. We actually provide tax credits for companies that ship jobs overseas," Shaheen said directly to Brown. "When you were in the senate, you voted to reward those companies to ship jobs overseas." Brown had a definitive response: "I have never voted to outsource jobs." The exchange sounded like a job for PolitiFact. In this item, we will look into Shaheen’s claim that Brown "voted to reward" companies to ship jobs overseas. As evidence, the Shaheen campaign pointed to Brown’s vote on a 2010 bill introduced by Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., called the Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act (S. 3816). The bill aimed to give companies incentives to bring overseas jobs back to the U.S. and to reduce tax breaks that companies can benefit from when moving jobs outside of the country, according to a summary of the legislation by the Library of Congress. In some cases, the 2010 measure would have taken away a firm's option to defer taxes on profits from goods made overseas but sold here. The bill drew opposition from major businesses and industry groups as well, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and Koch Industries, both of whom registered to lobby on the bill. "S. 3816 would create a payroll tax holiday for employers moving jobs to the United States from overseas in a purported attempt to stimulate job growth," wrote R. Bruce Josten, the executive vice president of government affairs for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, which now endorses Brown in the race. "However, the concept of economic growth is not a zero-sum game. Replacing a job that is based in another country with a domestic job does not stimulate economic growth or enhance the competitiveness of American worldwide companies." PolitiFact previously checked a claim by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., a co-sponsor of S.3816, who said the country’s tax code allows companies to deduct the expense of moving jobs overseas. That statement was found to be true. Shaheen voted yes, and Brown voted "no." However, he’s got some cover. First, while the intention of the Durbin bill was "to create American jobs and to prevent the offshoring of such jobs overseas," it never came to an up or down vote. The bill died on a procedural vote to end debate, known as cloture. It gained only 53 of the 60 votes required to shut down debate and move to a final, up-or-down vote. Senators voted mostly along party lines: 52 of 57 Democrats voted yes (one didn't cast a vote), and 40 of 41 Republicans voted no (with one not casting vote). The chamber’s two independents were split. So Brown never cast a vote on the merits of the measure. However, Brown openly criticized the bill on Sept. 27, 2010 -- the day before the Senate vote -- saying it would hurt job creation and harm the economy. "Mr. President, this bill on the floor tonight is not about job creation. It’s about the campaign and November," he said at the time. "They want to call us the party of ‘No’– I get it. Some pollster says that it plays well back home when politicians talk about ‘companies that ship jobs overseas.’ I get that too." He added, "Major employers in Massachusetts that I’ve talked to have said that these proposals are like getting a small piece of candy with one hand and hit with a sledge hammer with the other." The second bit of cover for Brown is that Shaheen exaggerates somewhat when she says that Brown "voted to reward" companies "to ship jobs overseas." As we’ve noted previously, there is no tax break or loophole that addresses outsourcing or insourcing jobs specifically. When Democrats refer to "tax breaks" for outsourcing, they are typically referring to standard business expense deductions. Companies can write off many business-related expenses as tax-deductible -- including relocation. This provision of tax law isn’t targeted at businesses that move outside of the United States. A business would get the same deductions for money spent moving from New York to California. Our ruling Jeanne Shaheen says Scott Brown voted to reward companies to ship jobs overseas. A bill in the Senate in 2010 called the Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act was aimed at giving companies incentives to bring overseas jobs back to the United States and reducing tax breaks that can benefit companies that move jobs outside of the country. On a procedural vote to move the bill forward, Shaheen voted in favor and Brown against. Brown did openly oppose the bill in a speech, but his actual vote was procedural -- not on the merits -- and it’s debatable whether his opposition amounted to "rewarding" companies that outsource or simply kept a status quo that treated all companies equally. On balance, we find Shaheen’s statement Half True.	None	Jeanne Shaheen	None	None	None	2014-10-31T16:28:07	2014-10-21	['None']
pomt-05710	Says the proposed fiscal year 2013 budget "is still below the level of state spending when I took office."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/mar/08/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-proposed-budget-smaller-leve/	Gov. Chris Christie wants to increase state spending in the coming fiscal year, but he claims the proposed budget is smaller than the one in place when he took office in January 2010. The governor made that point in a Feb. 21 speech before state legislators and other officials, when he unveiled his proposed $32.1 billion budget for fiscal year 2013, which begins July 1. The adjusted budget for the current fiscal year stands at roughly $30.9 billion. "The budget I propose would total $32.1 billion for the coming year," Christie said. "While this represents minimal growth from last year, it is still below the level of state spending when I took office." PolitiFact New Jersey was interested in whether state spending was higher two years ago, and a state Treasury Department spokesman showed us the numbers that back up Christie’s claim. The proposed fiscal year 2013 budget is smaller than the fiscal year 2010 budget in place around the time Christie took office -- but just barely. The difference between the two budgets is about $5 million. Let’s break down the numbers. Christie, a Republican, was sworn into office on Jan. 19, 2010 -- in the middle of fiscal year 2010, which began under former Gov. Jon Corzine, a Democrat. Two months later, the new governor introduced his budget for fiscal year 2011. To support the governor’s statement, Treasury spokesman Andrew Pratt pointed out how the fiscal year 2010 budget when Christie took office was $32.151 billion. That figure represented the adjusted budget as of March 16, 2010, according to a Treasury report at the time. The governor’s proposed budget for fiscal year 2013 is $32.146 billion, according to a recent budget summary. "As such, his statement is true," Pratt told us. So, the proposed budget is roughly $5 million less than the "level of state spending" when Christie took office, marking a decrease of 0.016 percent. That’s not a lot of money, but it still means Christie’s statement is correct. But there’s a major reason for why the fiscal year 2010 budget was larger than the proposed budget for fiscal year 2013: federal stimulus dollars. That adjusted budget of $32.151 billion for fiscal year 2010 included $2.289 billion worth of appropriations supported by stimulus funds. Those stimulus funds were used to help close a projected budget shortfall. Without those stimulus dollars, the proposed budget for fiscal year 2013 would be larger than the budget in place when Christie took office. Our ruling In his Feb. 21 budget speech, Christie claimed in regard to his proposed fiscal year 2013 budget: "While this represents minimal growth from last year, it is still below the level of state spending when I took office." According to state Treasury documents, Christie is accurate. The proposed budget is $32.146 billion -- about $5 million less than the $32.151 billion spending plan in place when Christie took office.

pomt-09778	On whether the governor of Massachusetts should be able to appoint an interim U.S. senator	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/24/massachusetts-legislature/massachusetts-legislature-flip-flops-governors-sen/	We've never put an entire legislature to the Flip-O-Meter before. But the recent move by the Massachusetts legislature in filling the seat held by the late Sen. Edward Kennedy was too bold to pass up. Massachusetts legislators this week approved a bill that allows the governor to appoint a temporary successor to Kennedy. But that came just over five years after legislators stripped the governor's longstanding power to appoint a U.S. senator to fill a vacancy. Both moves were consistent in one sense: In the strongly Democratic state, they advanced the Democratic Party's interests. But the two actions amount to a resounding flip-flop. In 2004, the state's junior senator, John Kerry, was the Democratic presidential nominee. Party leaders knew that if Kerry won in November, state law allowed the governor — then Republican Mitt Romney — to appoint Kerry's successor, and that person would presumably be a Republican. So, the Democratic leadership of the legislature drew up a measure to strip the governor of his senatorial appointment power. Under this bill, a special election would be held between 145 and 160 days after the incumbent senator left office. Until that special election was held, the seat would be vacant, and the governor would be unable to appoint an interim senator, something the governor had the right to do previously. The measure passed both chambers and was vetoed by Romney. The Democrats then muscled a two-thirds majority to override the veto. Of course, Kerry never won the presidency, but the law remained on the books. Fast-forward to 2009. Democrats realized that the law they had enacted in 2004 forced the state to have only one senator for roughly five months — and after Kennedy's death, that meant the state would be short one senator. From a political standpoint, that meant the U.S. Senate would have one less Democrat at a time when a Democratic president was trying to reach a 60-vote threshold to enact landmark legislation on Kennedy's signature issue, health care. And this time, the governor, Deval Patrick, is a Democrat and presumably would appoint someone from his party. So legislators quickly passed legislation that would keep the special election but still allow the governor to appoint an interim senator to serve until the special election. The measure passed both chambers, and on Sept. 24, 2009, Patrick named former Democratic National Committee chairman Paul Kirk, a Kennedy family friend, as the interim senator. To gauge the magnitude of this flip-flop, we looked back at the roll call votes in the state House from 2004 and 2009. (We were unable to locate the Senate roll calls online.) We found 50 state House members who effectively voted in 2004 to keep Kerry's seat in Democratic hands and also voted this month to appoint an interim senator who — no surprise here — ended up being a Democrat. All 50 were Democrats. It's worth pointing out that the votes were not about exactly the same thing. The 2009 vote kept in place the 2004 legislation's provisions on the special election, with both bills ultimately putting the choice for the Senate seat in the hands of the voters. Indeed, if we compared the votes on this basis alone, we might have suggested that the legislature had done a Half Flip. But two factors made the flip-flop more egregious. One was the rhetoric that Democrats used to defend the initial effort to strip gubernatorial appointment power. Many legislators argued that the power to choose U.S. senators ought to reside with the voters, not with one person. For instance, Democratic state Rep. J. James Marzilli Jr. told the Boston Globe in 2004, "It's ridiculous. We choose senators and members of Congress in elections. We shouldn't let politicians make those choices for us." The article added that Marzilli "was unconcerned" about leaving the seat vacant until the special election. "We already have a congressional delegation, and we'll always have at least one member in the United States Senate," he said. Meanwhile, House Speaker Thomas Finneran charged that Romney wanted to name the next senator "in a back room," according to the Boston Herald . He added, "That's reform? Please." And Senate President Robert E. Travaglini said, according to the Globe , "We have always felt that this position is significant enough that no one person should make that determination. It should be decided by the people." (None of the three Democrats were serving in the legislature by 2009.) The second factor that underlined the magnitude of the flip-flop is that Democratic legislative leaders in 2004 specifically rejected an entreaty by Romney to allow the governor to pick a temporary senator. In fact, Romney even offered to let Democratic leaders have a say in whom he picked. As the Globe reported on July 12, 2004, a top aide to Romney unveiled the proposal on the steps of the state Capitol, saying the governor was willing to submit the name of a temporary appointee to the House speaker and the Senate president. That appointee would serve until the special election. (The temporary appointee could run in the special election; Kirk has promised not to.) But in 2004, key Democrats dismissed the governor's proposal. State Sen. Brian Joyce, the Democratic co-chairman of the Election Laws Committee, called it "a clever political ploy." It went nowhere. To be fair, we should note that Republicans also said some things during the 2004 debate that would eventually clash with what they argued in 2009. But we are rating the Massachusetts legislature, which was, and is, controlled by Democrats. So let's recap. Democratic legislators in 2004 sought to take away the power of a (Republican) governor to appoint an interim senator, arguing that doing so would enable the people to take up their rightful responsibility instead. Five years later, many of those same legislators passed a law enabling a (Democratic) governor to name an interim senator — and in doing so, enacted something very similar to what they had rejected when the (Republican) governor proposed it in 2004.

pomt-12487	"China account(s) for 90 percent of North Korean trade."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/01/rex-tillerson/does-china-account-90-north-korean-trade-rex-tille/	The Trump administration has cited China's trade relationship with North Korea as a key lever to deter the regime from producing a nuclear missile capable of striking the U.S. "We must all do our share," Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the U.N. Security Council April 28. "But China, accounting for 90 percent of North Korean trade, China alone has economic leverage over Pyongyang that is unique, and its role is therefore particularly important." Tillerson’s remarks, which included a call for fresh economic sanctions, came at a time of heightened tensions between the United States and North Korea. As a U.S. Navy strike group steamed toward the Korean Peninsula -- where 28,500 American troops stationed in South Korea are on alert following the latest provocations from Pyongyang -- President Donald Trump on April 27 warned of a possible "major conflict" if diplomatic efforts fail. We’ve previously looked at Trump’s claim about the degree of control Beijing wields over Pyongyang. With Tillerson citing Chinese-North Korean trade relations as a vital diplomatic pressure point, we decided to explore how much China accounts for North Korea’s overall trade with the outside world. Finding accurate data for the secretive regime is a bit tricky since no North Korean equivalent of Trade.gov with troves of trade data exists, as Pyongyang treats this information as a state secret. But so-called "mirror statistics," an accounting of data reconstructed from other countries’ reports, offer a workaround, albeit a flawed one, since the statistics don’t capture some transactions. The available data tell a story of growing dependence on Chinese trade over roughly the past two decades as economic sanctions levied by the UN and individual countries, as well as other factors, have seen North Korea’s trade with other partners fall drastically. In 2000, China, South Korea and Japan each accounted for about a fifth of the regime's overall trade, with the rest of the world making up the remaining roughly two-fifths. Since then, China’s slice of the pie has more than quadrupled, according to Stephan Haggard, professor of Korea-Pacific Studies at the University of California-San Diego. "As sanctions have reduced South Korean and Japanese trade basically to nothing, trade has naturally become focused more on China," Haggard said. "The rest of the world has not picked up the slack." Marcus Noland of the Peterson Institute for International Economics agreed that China’s current position as an outsize trade partner of North Korea is largely a function of Pyongyang’s strained relations with its neighbor to the south -- but he noted this could change if political winds shift. "The reason that the percentage is so high is that South Korea, which was North Korea’s second largest trade partner, imposed sanctions and trade between the two countries is virtually nil," Noland said. "If South Korea were to resume trade relations (as it might in the next administration) China’s share of North Korean trade would fall, but China would still be the country’s principal trade partner." Bilateral disputes led to Tokyo imposing sanctions that went even further than UN restrictions, said Haggard, who noted that the commercial risk associated with North Korea and its poor record on honoring property rights have also dissuaded potential trade partners. As South Korean and Japanese trade with Pyongyang fell, China’s economy boomed, fueling increased trade with North Korea -- a relationship unfettered by bilateral sanctions, as Beijing has traditionally viewed the regime as an ally. China has also been accused of being less compliant with UN sanctions than other countries. As a result of these factors, the consensus among experts we spoke to is that China now accounts for roughly 90 percent of North Korean trade. Source: Stephan Haggard, professor of Korea-Pacific Studies at the University of California-San Diego. UNSCR refers to United Nations Security Council Resolutions. "Yes, China accounts for more than 90 percent of North Korea’s recorded trade," Noland said. "They are the primary supplier of oil and the marginal supplier of grain. If China wanted to, it could bring North Korea to its knees." "It has the economic leverage, but has been unwilling to use it, perhaps because it fears destabilizing the regime," he added. Our ruling Tillerson said, "China account(s) for 90 percent of North Korean trade." China’s role as an outsize trade partner of North Korea is a relatively new development. Since 2000, trade with the rest of the world has dropped off, as Chinese trade has risen. While the ratio is subject to change based on political factors, China now accounts for around 90 percent of North Korean trade. We rate Tillerson’s statement True.

pomt-14778	"From 2010-2014, median household income" in Wisconsin "has actually gone up 7.4 percent."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/dec/07/scott-walker/ignoring-inflation-scott-walker-says-incomes-rose-/	On the morning of Dec. 3, 2015, Gov. Scott Walker tweeted this from his official Twitter account: "From 2010-2014, median household income has actually gone up 7.4 percent." The word actually seemed to allude to a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news article from the front page of that morning’s newspaper. The headline was: "Household income takes sharp downturn in most of Wisconsin." So, which is it? Have incomes in the Badger State gone up? Or down? Previous claim In July 2015, while pursuing his presidential bid, Walker used his personal Twitter account to say that under his leadership, Wisconsin median household income was up 2.7 percent, while it was down 1.3 percent nationally under President Barack Obama. Our rating was Mostly False. Walker had cited U.S. Census data, usually a gold-standard source. But the data was from the census’ Current Population Survey. That set is good for the national income picture, but less accurate at the state level. The better data is from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey, a rolling collection of household and demographic statistics from 3.5 million addresses. Those figures revealed a much different picture than Walker had painted: An income drop nationally, yes -- of 1.72 percent. But also an income drop -- not an increase, as Walker stated -- in Wisconsin of 1.62 percent. So, what about the governor’s claim this time? The news story The Journal Sentinel’s article reported on newly released data from the American Community Survey covering two periods: 2005 to 2009 and 2010 to 2014. Median household income fell by a significant margin in two-thirds of Wisconsin counties during the period. Importantly, the article reported figures that are adjusted for inflation. By the way, think of median household income as the midpoint: Half of Wisconsin households have an income higher than the median, and half have an income that is lower. Walker spokeswoman Laurel Patrick emailed the Journal Sentinel about the article, saying it was distorted because it did not include the 7.4 percent figure Walker cited in his tweet. The Journal Sentinel asked her for the data that produced that figure. What the newspaper found was that Walker used American Community Survey data -- but didn’t properly adjust for inflation. That means he compared 2010 dollars to 2014 dollars, an economic no-no. Whenever you are looking at income, "you should be looking at real income instead of nominal income, which means you adjust for changes," said Abdur Chowdhury, a professor of economics at Marquette University in Milwaukee and former chief economist of the United Nations Economic Commission in Europe. Otherwise, he said, you’re looking at apples and oranges. "$100 today is not the same as $100 last year," Chowdhury said. "If you adjust for price, what you get is the real change in your buying power." For the news article and for this analysis, the Journal Sentinel used the Consumer Price Index from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics to adjust for inflation. Here’s what the adjusted data show: Walker’s method: 2010 Wisconsin median household income -- unadjusted 2014 median household income adjusted for inflation (2014 dollars) Difference $49,001 $52,622 7.4% increase After adjusting for inflation: 2010 Wisconsin median household income -- adjusted for inflation 2014 median household income adjusted for inflation (2014 dollars) Difference $53,198 $52,622 1.1% decrease "What you are doing is the right approach, looking at real income instead of nominal income," Chowdhury said. "The real reason they (Walker) use nominal income is because it looks better." Our rating Walker said that from 2010-2014, median household income in Wisconsin "has actually gone up 7.4 percent." In the best light, median household income in Wisconsin rose by 7.4 percent from 2010 to 2014. But the better figures account for inflation. And by that measure, income dropped by 1.1 percent during that period. For a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate Walker’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-09658	On legalizing illegal immigrants.	half flip	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/30/lou-dobbs/did-lou-dobbs-oppose-amnesty-he-doesnt-oppose-it-n/	Before resigning as a CNN anchor Nov. 11, Lou Dobbs made a name for himself opposing illegal immigration. So we were surprised to see him a few weeks later on the Spanish-language network Telemundo declaring himself a friend to Latinos. "Whatever you have thought of me in the past, I can tell you right now that I am one of your greatest friends and I mean for us to work together," Dobbs said during a half-hour interview with Maria Celeste on the news program Al Rojo Vivo . Dobbs said he was considering his options and might make a run for public office. For most of the interview, Celeste grilled Dobbs about news reports aired on his CNN show that she said were inflammatory and denigrated immigrants. Dobbs said he made mistakes and corrected them, which Celeste disputed. One of the top examples was a report Dobbs ran in 2007 that said undocumented immigrants were responsible for 7,000 new cases of leprosy spread over three years, a claim that has been widely debunked . (There were actually 431 new cases between 2003 and 2005.) Dobbs said on Telemundo that the United States needs a "rational, effective humane policy" for immigration that emphasized securing the border. But also said, "We need the ability to legalize illegal immigrants on certain conditions." That last point surprised us, because we thought Dobbs opposed efforts to offer citizenship to undocumented immigrants, commonly called amnesty. We went poring through the files, and interestingly, we found no point-blank case where Dobbs himself said he personally opposed amnesty. But he certainly gave the impression that he didn't much care for it. He was particularly opposed to a 2007 immigration bill promoted by President George W. Bush and Republican Sen. John McCain that included eventual citizenship for some illegal immigrants. In one show, he called the bill "idiotic," "just bizarre" and "a horrible piece of legislation." He asked his viewers to vote on the following question: "Do you believe the Senate, the White House and those who support amnesty for millions of illegal aliens are simply ignoring our existing U.S. law and the will of the American people? Yes or no? Cast your vote at loudobbs.com," he said on May 23, 2007. Later, he reported, "The results of our poll tonight: 97 percent of you responding that the Senate, the White House and those who support amnesty for millions of illegal aliens are ignoring not only existing U.S. law, but the will of the American people." Dobbs gave another provocative answer to reporter Leslie Stahl of 60 Minutes when she interviewed him in May 2007. "He all but campaigns against the president's guest worker proposal and seemed to suggest that all illegals should be rounded up," Stahl said, then asked him directly, "But I wonder if you think that we can possibly deport all of those people?" "I've never called for their deportation," Dobbs said. "But at the same time, when this president and open-borders, illegal-alien-amnesty advocates say, 'You can't deport them,' my answer is: 'You want to bet?' Because this is the United States. ... I think this country can do anything it sets its mind to." We next turned to two advocates on different sides of the immigration issue to see what they thought of Dobbs' recent comments to Telemundo. The Southern Poverty Law Center has criticized Dobbs for promoting anti-immigrant views and false news reports. The center's director of research, Heidi Beirich, said that Dobbs has claimed many times to be a friend to immigrants, even though he brings on anti-immigrant guests who make false statements. "He's let his guests say things that he hasn't challenged many, many times," Beirich said, "He'll sit there and make comments like, 'Incredible,' 'Amazing,' 'Mind-boggling.'" Of his comments on Telemundo, Beirich said, "It seemed to me very cynical and opportunistic, based on the idea that he wants to jump into politics." We also spoke with Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies and the author of The New Case Against Immigration, Both Legal and Illegal . Krikorian said he differs with Dobbs in that Dobbs generally favored legal immigration, opposing citizenship only for those who entered the country illegally. "He was clearly opposed to legalizing illegal aliens, period. There is just no question about it," Krikorian said. "Everyone who cared about immigration thought he was against amnesty." We asked Krikorian if there was any sort of middle ground here in which someone could favor citizenship for some undocumented immigrants but still be opposed to amnesty. Krikorian said he didn't think so. "That's what amnesty means -- letting illegal immigrants stay," he said. "He was against legalizing illegal immigrants, and now he says he's for it." We reached a spokesman for Dobbs, Robert Dilenschneider, who said that Dobbs does indeed believe that undocumented immigrants should be allowed to stay in the country under certain conditions. "I think you're going to see a new Lou Dobbs in the next year or two, a man looking for solutions, not for problems," he added. In ruling on whether Dobbs changed his position on citizenship for undocumented immigrants, it's clear that he now favors legalization under certain circumstances. We have not been able to find statements in the past where Dobbs said specifically that he opposed amnesty. But he gave the distinct impression that he opposed it, and many people clearly thought he did oppose it. Now, at a minimum, Dobbs is significantly changing his tone on the issue. We hesitate to give him a Full Flop because we found his older position to be slippery and unclear. So we rate his position a Half Flip.

pomt-08023	On choosing a Texas House speaker	full flop	/texas/statements/2011/jan/08/warren-chisum/texas-rep-warren-chisum-two-minds-role-gop-caucus-/	Pointing to the Republican romp in the November elections and a desire to see a "conservative" lead the Texas House, state Rep. Warren Chisum, R-Pampa, is pushing the GOP caucus to select a speaker candidate during its scheduled closed-door Jan. 10 meeting. "The voters of Texas have elected a strong overwhelming majority of Republicans to the Texas House of Representatives," Chisum says in a Dec. 21 press release. "We need to respond to the will of the voters and work together to select a single Republican nominee for Speaker." He then notes there are three GOP candidates for speaker and says the "Republican caucus is the appropriate place for us to narrow the field to one candidate." Chisum and Rep. Ken Paxton, R-McKinney, are challenging the current speaker, Rep. Joe Straus, R-San Antonio. Whoever wins the post presides over the House and appoints its committees and committee chairs. Any speaker candidate agreed upon within the 101-member GOP caucus would be all but guaranteed to win when the 150-member body elects the speaker Jan. 11. In committing their votes to that candidate, Republicans could unilaterally choose the speaker. We're not sure the speaker-apparent has ever been designated through a caucus vote. But in the last 20 years, the speaker has been chosen by the entire membership in open session on the House floor. That doesn't mean the outcome is a surprise: The votes generally accord with written pledges that speaker hopefuls have already secured from members. In a Jan. 3 letter to House members, former Democratic House Speaker Rayford Price urged lawmakers not to anoint a speaker through a GOP caucus vote. "A majority of a political caucus has no right or authority to direct how any member will cast his vote," Price's letter states. "I cannot believe any member would agree to give up that right and duty as is being suggested." According to a July 2002 Austin American-Statesman news story, a similar push for the GOP caucus to hold a vote on a speaker candidate came that year, ahead of the November election, when Republicans were expected to win the majority in the Texas House for the first time in 130 years. The article says that "Republican Party delegates voted at their convention in early June to require their House members to agree to vote as a caucus for speaker, and to bind all the Republicans to vote for whomever the caucus chooses." But at about the same time, according to the story, 23 "Republican House members signed an open letter to newspapers saying they thought the requirement flew in the face of the bipartisanship President George W. Bush lauded while he was governor." There never was such a caucus vote, according to Rep. Todd Smith, R-Euless, among the signers of the 2002 letter. Chisum also was one of those 23 objectors, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reminded readers in a Dec. 23, 2010, blog post. Chisum's signature on that letter was also brought to our attention by GOP consultant Bryan Eppstein, who has Straus as a client. So, has Chisum changed his position on the appropriate way to pick a speaker? The 2002 Chisum-supported letter — which appeared in the Star-Telegram June 6, 2002 under the headline "Let's not have partisan speaker elections" — says that letting the majority party select the speaker would remake Texas in the image of Washington. "In Washington, each party caucus nominates one candidate for speaker," the letter says. "House members then are forced to vote for their party's candidate. A bare majority of the members ... of one political party decides who wins." In contrast, the letter praises the Texas practice: "The outcome is not determined by the majority party. It is an open election in which any member may nominate any other member. The speaker is elected by a majority of all members of the House — Republican and Democrat." The letter urges House Republicans to resist calls for the caucus to select a single GOP candidate. "Now that it appears Republicans will gain a majority of Texas House seats this November, some — but not all — of our Republican colleagues are eager to change this system and seize control so that no Democrat will have a voice in choosing the next speaker," the letter says. "They want effectively to elect the speaker in the Republican caucus. To support such a monumental policy change simply and solely because it improves the odds of a particular speaker candidate is short sighted and fundamentally wrong." We wondered what led Chisum to advocate a similar policy change for the 2011 speaker election. He did not respond to our inquiries. However, in a Dec. 29 press release, Chisum made an assertion that indicated he may be playing tit for tat with the Democrats. He said Democratic "members of the Texas House caucused before the last legislative session to elect Speaker Straus. ... Therefore, when we convene on January 10th, I call on Representative (Larry) Taylor as the Republican Caucus chair, to call for a vote to determine the Republican preference for Speaker of the Texas House." Soon after, a post on the online news site Quorum Report challenged Chisum's claim that the Democrats had caucused to elect Straus. Chisum fired back in a second news release that day, pointing to a pledge that some Democratic members made shortly before the 2009 session not to vote for the incumbent speaker, Rep. Tom Craddick, R-Midland. Chisum said: "Now, it seems to me that when you see a letter with 64 signatures, released by the Democratic Caucus, all taking a unified party position on the speaker's race, that it just might be fair to say that the Democrats 'caucused' and took a position on the speaker's race. We all know that every one of those 64 Democrats subsequently pledged to vote and did vote for Joe Straus for speaker. ... My position is that the Republicans should also caucus and take a unified position on the race for speaker." We're not truth-testing whether the Democrats' actions then constituted a caucus vote. The test is whether Chisum's recent call-to-caucus reverses the position he took in 2002. We find that it does. Mark this a Full Flop.

pomt-12979	Fifty percent of workers ages 55 to 64 have "zero" money "in the bank as they enter retirement."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/dec/21/bernie-sanders/approaching-retirement-half-workers-55-64-have-zer/	At a post-election town hall meeting in Kenosha, Wis., 2016 Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders opined on why Republican Donald Trump is headed for the Oval Office and not the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton. "One of the arguments as to why Trump won is the belief that most of – or many of -- his supporters are sexist or are racist or are homophobes. I happen not to believe that`s the case," Sanders said at the Dec. 12, 2016 meeting, which was broadcast on MSNBC. "I think what he did do is, he said, ‘You know what, there is a lot of pain in this country; people are scared and people are worried.’ One example: Right now, 50 percent of older workers, 55 to 64 -- you know how much money they have in the bank, as they enter retirement? Who wants to guess? "Zero!" the Vermont senator exclaimed. "What do you think? People are scared to death of retirement." On another haves and have-nots claim -- that "the top one-tenth of 1 percent" of Americans "own almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent" -- we gave Sanders a Mostly True. But, are half of Americans approaching retirement with nothing in the bank? Sanders’ evidence To support Sanders’ statement, his campaign cited a May 2015 report on the financial status of retirees and workers approaching retirement from a gold-standard source, the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office. Sanders had requested it in his role as ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Retirement Security. The report used data from the latest triennial Survey of Consumer Finances done by the Federal Reserve Board, in 2013. It is the premier survey of wealth in the United States, according to Wellesley College economics professor Courtney Coile, who is the associate director of the Retirement Research Center at the National Bureau of Economic Research. The GAO found that 52 percent of households age 55 and over have no money in what the report defined as retirement savings -- an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) or a defined-contribution plan, such as a 401(k). But that group includes people who are well into retirement. The situation is somewhat less dire for the group that Sanders cited at the town hall, those ages 55 to 64. The report found that 41 percent of the people in that group have no money in defined-contribution plans or IRAs. There’s another point of clarification, however. The report did not consider in that statistic other savings that the 55 to 64 age group have. The Center for Retirement Research at Boston College ran those numbers for us, using the same Federal Reserve survey data, although it expressed the statistic a little differently. The center found that 38.5 percent of Americans ages 55 to 64 do not have a retirement account such as an IRA, traditional pension or 401(k), but nevertheless have some savings. With that group, the median amount of their savings is $1,000 -- in other words, half of them have savings of more than $1,000 and half have less. So, it’s not as though those people have "zero" in the bank, although many don’t have savings that would last them very long in retirement. Our rating Sanders said 50 percent of workers ages 55 to 64 have "zero" money "in the bank as they enter retirement." His claim is somewhat high, but doesn’t give a misleading impression. A widely respected government report says 41 percent of Americans 55 to 64 have no savings in common retirement accounts such as an IRA or a 401(k).

pomt-07318	Says businesses "already pay most of the taxes."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/may/15/steve-ogden/state-sen-steve-ogden-says-businesses-pay-most-tax/	Asked by reporters how legislators can address the state’s recurring revenue shortfall, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Steve Ogden reiterated his belief that a good start would be reworking the business franchise tax. Readers may recall that the franchise tax was revamped in 2006 to help pay for a statewide reduction in local school property taxes, but it has not brought in as much money as was projected. However, "the issue is not to single out businesses as some sort of villain," Ogden, R-Bryan, said April 5. "They already pay most of the taxes. The issue is having a tax system that, in my opinion, is uniform and equitable and as low as possible." Readers who spotted Ogden’s comment in an Austin American-Statesman news story asked us to check whether businesses do "pay most of the taxes." Responding to our inquiry, Ogden pointed to the way the tax system is structured in Texas. Because the state has no personal income tax, Ogden said, most state and local tax revenue comes from taxes that are levied on businesses and individuals alike. And because businesses "are the largest economic entities in the state," he said, it stands to reason that they pay the most. Ogden referred us to a biennial report from the state comptroller’s office on tax burdens in Texas. The latest version, published in February, projects how much businesses and individual consumers will pay in state sales and use taxes, franchise taxes, gasoline taxes, motor vehicle sales taxes, cigarette taxes, oil production taxes and school property taxes in 2013. According to the report, two of the taxes — franchise and oil production — are initially paid entirely by businesses. A third tax, the cigarette tax, is paid entirely by consumers. The remaining four taxes are shared between consumers and businesses. The largest expected revenue producers are school property taxes ($11.3 billion projected to be paid by businesses in 2013, $10.7 billion by consumers) and state sales taxes ($9.8 billion projected to be paid by businesses, $12.1 billion by consumers). To get a total tax dollar amount for each category — consumers and businesses — we added up the estimated burden imposed by each of the taxes analyzed in the report. The results were close: $28.2 billion for businesses and $27.5 billion for consumers. Two previous comptroller’s tax-incidence reports calculated slightly greater tax burdens for businesses, compared with individuals, but differed from the current report because they included a natural gas tax but not cigarette and oil production taxes. The 2009 report, projecting ahead to 2011, estimated $30.1 billion for businesses and $28.4 billion for consumers. The 2007 report, projecting for 2009, estimated $25.9 billion for businesses vs. $25.2 billion for consumers. Next, we touched base with the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, a business group, about Ogden’s statement. Dale Craymer, its president, said by email that the comptroller’s report does not consider "the entire spectrum of taxes in the state." R.J. DeSilva, a spokesman for the comptroller’s office, told us that the six state taxes in the agency’s 2011 report — excluding school property taxes, which are collected locally — represented 86 percent of state tax revenue in fiscal 2010. Also excluded are property taxes paid to local governments such as cities and counties. Craymer suggested that we consider what he called the most comprehensive look at business taxes, a study done for the Council on State Taxation, a Washington-based trade association representing corporate businesses. Bill Hammond, president of the Texas Association of Business, also pointed us to the report. The study, by the economics and statistics unit of consulting firm Ernst & Young, estimates the taxes paid by businesses to state and local governments in each state in fiscal year 2008. Among them: property taxes, state and local sales taxes paid by businesses on purchases of production materials and equipment, corporate income and franchise taxes, unemployment insurance taxes, and business and corporate license taxes. The study estimates that in Texas, businesses paid 61.2 percent of state and local taxes. That compares with a national share of 44.1 percent. We asked how the study was done. Andrew Phillips, an author, told us that researchers drew data from several sources, including the U.S. Census Bureau, IRS and Bureau of Economic Analysis. For another perspective on the Ernst & Young report, we turned to Matt Gardner, executive director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, a research arm of Washington-based Citizens for Tax Justice, which says it advocates for fair taxation of middle- and low-income families. Gardner suggested that the Ernst & Young report may have overestimated the share of total property taxes paid by businesses. He said his own estimate, based on available 2008 data from the Census Bureau, indicates that Texas homeowners paid about 45 percent of property taxes that year. If one assumes that businesses paid the rest, Gardner said, their share is 55 percent, not the 62 percent share of property taxes reported by Ernst & Young. Still, Gardner didn’t quibble much with Ogden’s statement. "It’s probably OK to assert that a majority of Texas taxes fall initially on non-individuals," he said. Both Gardner and Hammond, the TAB president, echoed Ogden’s point that businesses in Texas shoulder a higher-than-average initial tax burden because the state is one of a minority that have no income tax on individuals. But inherent in the distinction between taxes on individuals and on businesses is the idea that the latter can shift their burdens to customers, employees, tenants and others. The comptroller’s report says: "It should be recognized that any tax levied directly on a business" will ultimately be passed on — either to consumers through higher prices, to employees through lower wages or to business owners and shareholders through reduced profits. Businesses can also push some of their tax burden out of the state. How much tax shifting occurs depends on the market in which a business operates and other complicated factors. "The only thing that can be said with certainty is that no one really knows how taxes (particularly those levied on property and business) are shifted," according to the comptroller’s report. Tom Neubig, an author of the Ernst & Young report, told us, "All economists would say that it isn’t business that bears the burden of the taxes; it’s people." He pointed to a January 2010 national study in which he and other researchers, using 2005 tax data, estimated where state and local business taxes ultimately fall. The study concluded that in Texas, business owners wound up holding the bag for 4 percent of those taxes. The rest were shifted into higher consumer prices (2 percent), lower wages (45 percent) and to people living outside Texas (49 percent). For Gardner, this "final incidence" is more important than whether businesses or individuals initially pay the taxes. Upshot: The analyses we found basically support Ogden’s claim that businesses pay "most" of the taxes in Texas, though the margin varies from a slim 51 percent (according to the state comptroller) to 61 percent (Ernst & Young). However, analysts also agree that businesses — unlike individuals — can offload their tax burden through various means. We rate Ogden’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-11849	The diversity visa lottery is "plagued by fraud."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/06/david-perdue/gop-sen-david-perdue-says-diversity-visa-lottery-p/	Sen. David Perdue, R-Ga., repeated President Donald Trump’s criticism of the diversity visa program, claiming that the program is "plagued by fraud." An Oct. 31 terrorist attack in New York City resulted in eight deaths and about a dozen injuries. Trump said the suspect came to the United States through the diversity visa program and called for its termination. ".@realDonaldTrump is right, the Diversity Visa Lottery is a problem and is plagued by fraud. The RAISE Act would eliminate it. #gapol," Perdue tweeted Nov. 1. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Perdue co-sponsored the Reforming American Immigration for a Strong Economy (RAISE) Act, seeking to reduce legal immigration to the United States and to eliminate the diversity visa program, which allows up to 50,000 immigrants per year. We wanted to know the accuracy of Perdue’s fraud claim and found that government reports and officials have identified fraud as an issue in the program. The State Department said it did not have data to determine how widespread the problem is, and experts told us they were unaware of quantitative estimates. Diversity visa program, fraud and scams The diversity visa program, administered by the State Department, was created in 1990 through a bill signed into law by former President George H. W. Bush. The program is intended to diversify the U.S. immigrant population, granting up to 50,000 visas annually to individuals from countries that in the previous five years had low rates of immigration to the United States. A lottery system that began in 1995 allows individuals to enter for a chance to apply for a visa. Fraud in the diversity visa program has been a concern for years among lawmakers and government officials. Reports of fraud have even led government agencies to post warnings about scammers’ attempt to deceive applicants. But the State Department told us it did not have data on how widespread fraud is in the program, or what percentage of applications or lottery entries per year are believed to be fraudulent. There are "extensive programs to vigorously prevent and combat U.S. passport and visa fraud" and the department investigates all fraud allegations, said Noel Clay, State Department spokesman. A 2007 U.S. Government and Accountability report said the program was "vulnerable to fraud committed by and against (diversity visa) applicants" and that the State Department had not compiled comprehensive data on detected and suspected fraudulent activity. Consular officers reported that in countries such as Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nepal, Nigeria, and Ukraine, applicants lacked access to computers or were not internet savvy, therefore sought help from "visa agents" or "visa consultants." Some providers took advantage of applicants by disseminating misleading information, intercepting official correspondence, and charging exorbitant fees for each step in the process, the 2007 report said. In Bangladesh, some agents used their own address on entry forms so that program notification letters would go to them instead of the person in the entry, and in some cases "held these letters for up to $20,000 in ransom" or offered to reduce the fee if the selectee entered into a sham marriage and added the spouse to the application, the report said. A September 2013 report from the State Department’s Office of Inspector General said there was a "pervasive and sophisticated fraud scheme" affecting the program in Ukraine. Organized fraud rings in Ukraine masquerading as travel agencies buy, steal or obtain from public sources information on Ukrainian citizens and enter their data into the program’s online entry form. The fraud rings contact individuals who win the lottery and demand $15,000 in exchange for a confirmation number sent by the State Department that’s needed to proceed with the visa application. If the person can’t pay, fraud rings seek to enter that person in a sham marriage with someone else who wants to come to the United States and is willing to pay the fraud rings a fee for the pairing, the report said. "There is no question that fraud is rampant in the diversity visa lottery program," said Jessica M. Vaughan, director of policy studies at Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low-immigration levels. Vaughan said there’s "massive document fraud" that’s difficult for consular officers to detect — where people apply first and later produce required information, such as education or work experience documentation. Vaughan and Jan C. Ting, a law professor at the Temple University Beasley School of Law in Philadelphia, told us they were unaware of quantitative estimates of the amount of fraud in the program. "It is very likely that people have obtained diversity visas through fraud and successfully immigrated to the U.S. and become citizens because of their fraud," said Ting, who in 2004 testified before a House committee in objection to the program. Charles D. Piot, an anthropologist and professor at Duke University, says there was a lot of gaming of the system when it was first instituted, but technology added to the process now makes it unlikely for a type of fraud where an applicant is substituted by another person. "It's important to emphasize that today it's impossible for applicants to sell his or her identity, to swap out that identity, because of the biometrics," said Piot, who has done research on Togolese who came to the United States via the visa lottery. Our ruling Perdue said the diversity visa program is "plagued by fraud." The State Department did not provide data on how widespread fraud is within the program, but fraud issues have been documented for many years. Some of the fraud involves organized groups entering individuals into the lottery without their consent and then extracting money from them in exchange for a confirmation number needed for the visa application process. Technology helps prevent the type of fraud where a person would take the place of the original applicant. We rate Perdue’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-08830	On whether to eliminate the state income tax.	half flip	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/12/john-kasich/kasich-silence-casts-doubt-whether-he-would-seek-i/	John Kasich stormed the stage in a park in his hometown of Westerville, Ohio, last year to emphatically declare his candidacy to become the Republican nominee for governor. He offered big-picture ideas, the staples of conservative politics — shrinking government spending and lowering taxes. One specific tax goal he reaffirmed that June 1 was to eliminate Ohio’s state income tax. It’s a goal Kasich had mentioned in earlier speeches in the run-up to that formal announcement. And he left no doubt where he stood that day. "We’ll march over time to destroy that income tax that has sucked the vitality out of this state," Kasich roared. But as time has marched on, a funny thing happened. Kasich has stopped calling for an elimination of Ohio’s income tax. It is absent from his campaign website, where he argues spending cuts are needed so taxes can be lowered. And at a speaking event Aug. 4, Kasich talked nearly an hour without mentioning the income tax repeal once. We decided to run his remarks through the Flip-O-Meter to see if he’s done a full gainer on the issue. When he launched his campaign, Kasich’s call to eliminate the state income tax was emphatic. But he has never detailed how he would eliminate a major tax that provides much of the state’s operating money. He repeatedly has dodged reporter’s questions for details about his plan. Full of disdain, he often would brush aside questions, sometimes snapping that he would discuss specifics when he was good and ready. Each week Kasich delivers campaign speeches across Ohio and it’s common now for him to not mention his cornerstone policy issue. Perhaps growing weary of the questions, Kasich lately has softened his retorts and taken pains to be less bombastic and more assuring that he has not abandoned his idea. "Nothing’s changed on that. I’m for reducing taxes," Kasich said to reporters Aug. 4 after his speech in Columbus. "Nothing has changed. But this idea of reducing these taxes, as I told you from the beginning, takes time. "There’s no obfuscation there at all. . . Nothing’s changed about any of my programs or my plans." Kasich was essentially forced to distance himself from his own idea when Republican state Rep. John Adams, of Sidney, near Dayton, last winter introduced a bill that would phase out the state’s income tax. Democrats, who control the House, happily linked Adams’ bill to Kasich’s idea and gave the bill a series of hotly promoted committee hearings. In January, the Legislative Service Commission, an independent state agency, released an analysis of Adams’ bill and predicted the plan would cost Ohio more than $800 million next year and as much as $12 billion by 2020. In all, eliminating the state’s income tax could blow a 40 percent hole in the general revenue fund, which could in turn impact police, fire and local government appropriations. Those details make Kasich’s plan all the more intriguing. He insists it can be done, even as he refuses to offer up details or talk about it on the campaign trail. Sure Kasich says he’s standing by his plan to eliminate the state’s income tax but his silence on the campaign trail about an issue he once was so boastful about speaks volumes. His unwillingness to answer questions or provide details about how he would eliminate the tax makes it appear as if he wishes he never promised its demise so prominently. He hasn’t publicly gone that far, yet, so we rate his position a Half Flip.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2010-08-12T11:45:00	2010-08-12	['None']

pomt-09332	"The video doesn't show the broader picture of the firing that was going on at American troops."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/apr/12/robert-gates/gates-said-leaked-military-video-shooting-iraq-doe/	On ABC's This Week on April 11, 2010, host Jake Tapper asked Defense Secretary Robert Gates about the recently released WikiLeaks video showing American soldiers in an Apache helicopter opening fire on a group of men on a Baghdad street, which seriously injured two children and resulted in the deaths of two Reuters journalists who were mistaken for insurgents. "I understand the fog of war," Tapper said. "And I understand that this was a very difficult situation. Does the release of that video, and the fact that that happened damage the image of the U.S. in the world?" "I don't think so," Gates said. "They're in a combat situation. The video doesn't show the broader picture of the firing that was going on at American troops. It's obviously a hard thing to see. It's painful to see, especially when you learn after the fact what was going on. But you -- you talked about the fog of war. These people were operating in split second situations." "And, you know, we've investigated it very thoroughly. And it's unfortunate. It's clearly not helpful. But by the same token, I think it should not have any lasting consequences." We are fact-checking the claim that, "The video doesn't show the broader picture of the firing that was going on at American troops." According to a military review completed five days after the incident, soldiers in that company "had been under sporadic small arms and rocket propelled grenade fire since" the operation -- described as "clearing their sector and looking for weapons caches" -- began at dawn that morning. That comports with the detailed reporting from David Finkel, a Washington Post journalist who was embedded for eight months with the battalion in question, and who described the events that day in his book, The Good Soldiers. "All morning long, this part of Al-Amin had been the most hostile," Finkel wrote. "East Al-Amin had been filled with gunfire and some explosions. There had been reports of sniper fire, rooftop chases, and rocket-propelled grenades being fired at Bravo Company, and as the fighting continued, it attracted the attention of Namir Noor-Eldeen, a twenty-two year-old photographer for the Reuters news agency who lived in Baghdad, and Saeed Chmagh, 40, his driver." In the graphic and controversial video footage shot from an Apache helicopter on the morning of July 12, 2007, and later leaked by whistle-blowers to WikiLeaks -- now viewed by millions --it is clear from the audio that a soldier on the helicopter mistakes a camera with a telephoto lens slung across the shoulder of one of the journalists for a rocket-propelled grenade launcher (RPG). An investigative report by the military issued five days later concluded that among the group of 11 men on the street, two were carrying cameras with large telephoto lenses ("which could be easily mistaken for" a machine gun) but also that at least one other in the group had a rocket-propelled grenade launcher, and another had a rifle. The video at one point shows the Reuters cameraman peering from behind a wall, pointing a long telephoto lens. According to the military investigation, there were U.S. ground troops less than 100 meters away, and "due to the furtive nature of his movements, the cameraman gave every appearance of preparing to fire an RPG on U.S. soldiers." The report states that ground troops later discovered two RPGs, an RPG launcher and a rifle where the group had been clustered, and an RPG round under one of the bodies. "There is no question that coalition forces were clearly engaged in combat operations against a hostile force," Lt. Col. Scott Bleichwehl, a spokesman for the multinational forces in Baghdad, told the New York Times a day after the incident. Glenn Greenwald, an author and blogger for the online magazine Salon who has been highly critical of the military response, said Gates' comment was "sufficiently vague that it can't be called factually false, but is quite misleading." None of the people who were shot at by the Apache in that video ever fired on American troops, he said. "It's true that on that day -- and every day -- there were firefights involving American forces, but that had nothing to do with the incident depicted in the video," Greenwald said. "Worse, the part of the video that caused the most controversy -- the shooting of unarmed rescuers who were dragging an unarmed, wounded man to safety -- has absolutely nothing to do with prior firefights. Nothing that happened previously could justify or even mitigate the killing of people who plainly are not a threat and can pose no threat." The military investigation concluded that the men shot while trying to help one of the wounded journalists into a van were believed at the time to be insurgents. Two children in the van were seriously wounded. "I think it's fair to say that there have been many, many bad days for Iraqis and Americans, and this was one of them," Finkel wrote in an online Q & A about the video on April 6, 2010. By way of context, Finkel noted, "What's helpful to understand is that, contrary to some interpretations that this was an attack on some people walking down the street on a nice day, the day was anything but that. It happened in the midst of a large operation to clear an area where U.S. soldiers had been getting shot at, injured, and killed with increasing frequency. What the Reuters guys walked into was the very worst part, where the morning had been a series of RPG attacks and running gun battles. "More context," Finkel later added. "You're seeing an edited version of the video. The full video runs much longer. And it doesn't have the benefit of hindsight, in this case zooming in on the van and seeing those two children. The helicopters were perhaps a mile away. And as all of this unfolded, it was unclear to the soldiers involved whether the van was a van of good Samaritans or of insurgents showing up to rescue a wounded comrade. I bring these things up not to excuse the soldiers but to emphasize some of the real-time blurriness of those moments. "If you were to see the full video, you would see a person carrying an RPG launcher as he walked down the street as part of the group. Another was armed as well, as I recall. Also, if you had the unfortunate luck to be on site afterwards, you would have seen that one of the dead in the group was lying on top of a launcher. Because of that and some other things, EOD -- the Hurt Locker guys, I guess -- had to come in and secure the site. And again, I'm not trying to excuse what happened. But there was more to it for you to consider than what was in the released video." Asked about Finkel's comments, Greenwald said the only evidence for all of this is the video and the Army's investigative reports. "It's unclear from the video if someone had an RPG -- definitely possible, but far from definitive," Greenwald said. "The Army report claimed that an RGP was found at the scene -- impossible to verify or otherwise know, but that is what it claimed." Our aim here is not to settle this very complicated, controversial and terribly sad incident. We are not ruling on whether the United States military acted properly. Rather, we are looking specifically at Gates' comment that, "The video doesn't show the broader picture of the firing that was going on at American troops." Some might interpret Gates' comment to mean that if only the video had panned back, or started a little earlier, you'd see that this group of men in the street was firing at the Apache helicopter, and there's no evidence that that's the case. But we think Gates' words suggest he was speaking more broadly of the context around that incident, that -- as Finkel noted in providing context during his Q & A -- insurgents had been firing at American soldiers in that immediate area that very morning. And military reports support that. So we rule Gates' comment Mostly True.	None	Robert Gates	None	None	None	2010-04-12T18:07:14	2010-04-11	['United_States']

pomt-13822	"You're more likely to be the victim of a violent crime in Milwaukee than in 96 percent of the country."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jul/15/van-wanggaard/more-dangerous-milwaukee-96-nation/	Resentment and recrimination often characterize political relations between Milwaukee and the rest of Wisconsin. In the latest clash, the Milwaukee Public Schools board thwarted an effort by Republican state lawmakers to reform the low-performing district. That led the GOP leader of the Senate to say the Legislature might respond by cutting the district’s funding. About two weeks later, on July 10, 2016, another GOP lawmaker issued a broadside against largely Democratic Milwaukee. State Sen. Van Wanggaard of Racine wrote an opinion piece in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that was laden with statistical claims unfavorable to the city -- including one making a national comparison about crime that we want to check. "Recent complaints from Milwaukee leaders about their lack of state funding are misguided and lack perspective," the column began. "Unfortunately," Wanggaard later wrote, "the only way to cut this expenditure is to reduce the number of people needing assistance — reducing poverty. But the failing school system and Milwaukee's crime problem prevent that." Then came the claim we’re interested in, with Wanggaard saying "you're more likely to be the victim of a violent crime in Milwaukee than in 96 percent of the country." Milwaukee is known for a relatively high violent crime rate. But this way of expressing that has some problems. Trends in violent crime Across the country, crime has been on a downward trend. That’s what PolitiFact National reported in June 2016 in rating as Pants on Fire Donald Trump’s claim that "crime is rising." With regard to violent crime, our colleagues checked FBI figures through 2014, the latest year for which complete figures are available. They found that nationally, the rates of violent crime per 100,000 people have been falling on an almost uninterrupted basis since the early 1990s. As counted by the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR), violent crime includes murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Milwaukee’s violent crime rate has been among the highest among large cities. In 2014, there were 8,864 violent crimes reported in the city, according to the FBI figures. That was up 8 percent from 8,194 in 2013. Now, to Wanggaard’s claim. Wanggaard’s evidence To back the statement, Wanggaard’s staff cited rankings from two websites that rank places to live. Each used the FBI’s UCR violent crime figures for 2014. AreaVibes.com says Milwaukee is safer than 4 percent of the cities in the United States. Another way to say that would be that Milwaukee’s violent crime rate is higher than 96 percent of the country. NeighborhoodScout.com says the figure is 3 percent. Michael O’Hear, a law professor at Marquette University in Milwaukee, told us the rankings give some basis for Wanggaard’s 96 percent claim. But O’Hear and other criminal justice experts told us there are problems with the claim. "It’s sort of a dubious measure on so many grounds," said Alfred Blumstein, an emeritus professor of urban systems and operations research Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh. Comparison problems 1. UCR figures are solid. But the FBI "strongly discourages" using them to make rankings to evaluate different communities, saying: "These incomplete analyses have often created misleading perceptions which adversely affect geographic entities and their residents. For this reason, the FBI has a long-standing policy against ranking participating law enforcement agencies on the basis of crime data alone … many factors cause the nature and type of crime to vary from place to place." 2. Across the country, violent crime generally is concentrated in larger cities, so it stands to reason there is less violent crime in most parts of the country. But the figures used in the website rankings compare Milwaukee with cities such as Mount Pleasant near Racine (15 violent crimes in 2014) and Sun Prairie (32) near Madison that have a population as low as 25,000. "There’s a world of difference between a city of 25,000 and a city the size of Milwaukee (population 600,000)," O’Hear said. 3. Violent crime in Milwaukee is concentrated in certain neighborhoods, while other neighborhoods carry no more risk of violent crime than many suburban neighborhoods. In other words, you’re not suddenly at great risk of being a violent crime victim simply by crossing the city limits. "Usually if you’re not hanging out" in high-crime neighborhoods, "your chances of being a victim of crime are pretty low," said Michael Jacobson, executive director of the City University of New York Institute for State & Local Governance. Our rating Wanggaard said: "You're more likely to be the victim of a violent crime in Milwaukee than in 96 percent of the country." Three rankings using violent crime rates from the FBI give Milwaukee such a ranking. But the FBI warns against using its figures to do rankings; the rankings compare Milwaukee to relatively tiny cities; and the claim makes a broad claim about Milwaukee but ignores the fact that most violent crime in the city is limited to certain neighborhoods. For a statement that is partially accurate but takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.	None	Van Wanggaard	None	None	None	2016-07-15T10:30:00	2016-07-10	['Milwaukee']

Since then, the menu of issues has become longer, but a recent flyer from Americans for Tax Reform, a leading anti-tax group, seeks to put jobs front and center once again. The flyer appeared in mailboxes in New Hampshire and asks, where did the stimulus money go? A photo of President Barack Obama superimposed above a sprawling map of China in fire engine red provides an answer. Below the fold, an iconic photo of Mao Zedong is set against a newspaper headline "NH has lost more jobs to China than any other state." Inside, the text reads "The stimulus was intended to create ‘green’ American jobs. But the Obama administration funneled close to $2 billion to overseas firms. A Democratic Senator said this would create thousands of jobs in China." There is a lot to unpack here but the gist of it comes down to the assertion that about $2 billion in "green" stimulus money went to foreign companies, with particular benefits for China at the expense of American workers. That’s a claim that we can check. Foreign wind and solar suppliers Americans for Tax Reform cites the work of the Investigative Reporting Workshop, a project of American University headed by investigative journalists. In February, 2010, the workshop wrote that it had found that the largest stimulus program to develop alternative energy had handed out $2.1 billion for wind, solar and geothermal power and of that, 79 percent went to companies based overseas. We dug further and found some reports that Americans for Tax Reform missed but that bolster its claim. A later study from the workshop estimated the amount that had gone to overseas firms had reached nearly $2.4 billion. Later still, about a year after the first report, the lead author again updated his findings. The journalist, Russ Choma, noted that "most of the jobs that were created, in the United States at least, were short-term construction jobs." "Since the bulk of the companies that received the money were foreign," Choma continued, "and the bulk of the equipment (like wind turbines) were purchased from foreign companies, who mostly do their production overseas, very few of the high-skill, high-pay manufacturing jobs that green energy development can bring ended up in the United States." A study by the U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the domestic portion on wind projects ranges from 48 percent to 66 percent of the total investment. For large solar projects, the domestic portion falls in the 42 percent to 71 percent range. A complicated jobs picture Those wide ranges tell us that connecting taxpayer dollars to American jobs is not simple. Some foreign companies have American subsidiaries. Some American firms import large components. The people who have tried get a handle on this have looked at the two main programs the government used to build the renewable energy sector. The biggest program, called Section 1603, subsidized energy producers. It paid the project developers 30 percent of the total project cost after an installation was complete. So far, Section 1603 has cost about $14 billion. The smaller program, Section 48C, also provided a 30 percent subsidy but was focused on manufacturing. It helped companies that built or expanded manufacturing capacity in the U.S.. The final cost for 48C was $2.3 billion. Teasing out the ways that Section 1603 money worked its way through the economy is tricky. The reporter cited by Americans for Tax Reform spoke about his own uncertainty after months of research into wind power. "I can't say how many of the turbines built by American manufacturers were overseas," Choma said, "and how many of the turbines built by foreign manufacturers were built here." The case of the Danish firm Vestas shows the challenge when dealing with foreign-based firms. Vestas supplied over 1,800 turbines in the U.S. between 2009 and 2011, or about 15 percent of the total added in those years. On the power production side, the Section 1603 subsidies for the turbines alone would be worth hundreds of millions of dollars. But Vestas also received nearly $52 million through the government’s program to boost manufacturing. Those dollars ended up in Colorado for the construction of American subsidiary plants, Vestas Nacelles, Vestas Blades, and Vestas Towers. A declining wind industry has led to layoffs but at last count, the Danish firm employed about 1,700 workers in those plants, with about 5,000 workers statewide tied to the wind industry. "This is insourcing," said Peter Kelley, spokesman for the American Wind Energy Association, an industry trade group. "It’s important to draw foreign investment that creates jobs here in the U.S." Tracking the jobs for a domestic company is no easier. GE is the nation’s largest supplier of wind turbines. The Connecticut-based firm is providing the turbines for a wind farm in Alaska. GE might be an American company but the project includes blades made in Brazil and towers from China. On paper, it might look like stimulus money would stay in the country but in fact, not all of it would. The most detailed estimate of the total number of American jobs created through the 1603 program comes from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. In a 2012 report, it found that from 2009 to 2011, spending on wind and solar produced some 57,000 to 80,000 jobs each year in construction, manufacturing and ongoing operations. These are the jobs that remain after you subtract the dollars that went overseas. Importantly, the total earnings of American workers tied to these projects fell in the range of $9.5 billion to $14.3 billion. If these numbers are right, they tell us the low end of that estimate is more than the cost of the 1603 program, about $8.7 billion, during those years. This might be expected since 70 percent of the project costs were covered by private money. The China factor The flyer from Americans for Tax Reform casts China as a major beneficiary of stimulus spending. While Chinese firms have certainly received some contracts, they do not seem to have played a major role. Their biggest place in the American renewable energy marketplace is in solar. China has about half of the American photovoltaic market, according to Recharge News, an online industry magazine. In 2011, that was worth about $2.8 billion to Chinese manufacturers. Subsidies for the solar industry through the 1603 program amount to about 20 percent of all spending. Wind accounts for about 70 percent of the dollars. In wind, China is a negligible player. Of over 12,000 turbines installed under the 1603 program by 2011, Chinese firms had a role in six -- five in Texas and one in Iowa. This according to the American Wind Energy Association, an industry trade group. For the curious, here is the national breakdown for the number of turbines installed in the U.S.from 2009 to 2011, according to the American Wind Energy Association and the Congressional Research Service: United States - GE, Clipper - 49 percent Germany - Siemens, RePower, Nordex -15 percent Denmark - Vestas - 15 percent Spain - Gamesa - 7 percent India - Suzlon - 6 percent Japan - Mitsubishi - 6 percent All others - 2 percent Our ruling The Americans for Tax Reform flyer said the Obama administration funneled about $2 billion in "green" stimulus money to foreign companies, with particular benefits for China. On the dollars, the claim understates the amount that went to foreign owned companies. It was certainly more than $2 billion, which would bolster the group’s claim. But the flyer offers a very selective picture of what the stimulus did for American workers.. The distinction between domestic and foreign companies and the impact of that on jobs is unclear. And while the stimulus did help pay for high-skilled jobs overseas, it also leveraged thousands of jobs in the U.S. and produced earnings greater than the amount of money spent by the government. Money did leave the country, but not with the impact the flyer presents. Regarding China, the flyer exaggerates the benefits for that nation. China stood to gain from spending on solar power, and it is hard to see how it wouldn’t have collected millions of taxpayer dollars. But solar represented about a fifth of the stimulus subsidies. The wind projects accounted for 70 percent and in wind, China played a tiny role. The countries that gained the most overall were European. The statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-04672	"I've cut taxes for ... middle-class families, small businesses."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/07/barack-obama/barack-obama-said-hes-cut-taxes-middle-class-famil/	In his speech at the Democratic National Committee in Charlotte, N.C., President Barack Obama mocked Republicans for turning to tax cuts as the solution to every problem. "Have a surplus? Try a tax cut. Deficit too high? Try another. Feel a cold coming on? Take two tax cuts, roll back some regulations, and call us in the morning!" Obama said. "Now, I’ve cut taxes for those who need it – middle-class families and small businesses. But I don’t believe that another round of tax breaks for millionaires will bring good jobs to our shores, or pay down our deficit," Obama said. Obama is often accused by Republicans of raising taxes, and he has raised some taxes during his presidency. He’s also said that he intends to raise income tax rates for couples who make more than $250,000 a year or single people who make more than $200,000 a year. Here, we’re going to look at his claim to cut taxes for "middle-class families and small businesses." (We’ve been tracking all of Obama’s campaign promises about taxes on our Obameter.) Obama has signed off on two major tax cuts for middle-class families: the Making Work Pay tax credit that was part of the economic stimulus of 2009 and a temporary reduction in Social Security payroll taxes that went into effect in 2011. As part of the stimulus, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, single workers collected a $400 tax credit, and working couples got $800. The credit didn’t come in the form of a check; it worked out so that most workers had about $400 less in federal income taxes withheld from their paychecks spread out over the entire year. Most workers received a tax cut under that plan, with the exception of some high earners. The tax cuts phased out for couples who make more than $250,000 or a single person making over $200,000, according to an analysis from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center . The result mirrored what Obama promised he would do on the campaign. Obama pledged tax cuts of $500 for each worker and $1,000 for working couples. We rated the promise a Compromise on our Obameter because the resulting tax cut was a little lower than what Obama wanted. That tax cut expired at the end of 2011. But Obama won another round of tax cuts for most workers in a December 2010 tax deal with Republicans in Congress. Those tax cuts -- a temporary reduction in worker’s payroll taxes, worth about 2 percent of total earnings -- expire in 2013. Again, the tax cut didn’t come as a check, but gives workers a little more in their paychecks than they would have otherwise. Obama also has passed an array of tax cuts for small businesses. Eight of them were included in the stimulus, the Affordable Care Act (also known as the health care law), and the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (also known as the HIRE Act). Among the cuts were the exclusion of up to 75 percent of capital gains on key small business investments; a tax credit for the cost of health insurance for small business employees and new tax credits for hiring Americans out of work for at least two months. Another eight cuts came via the Small Business Jobs Act, signed by Obama in September of 2010. These included: adding deductions for business cell phone use; creating a new deduction for health care costs for the self-employed; allowing greater deductions for business start-up expenses; eliminating taxes on all capital gains from key small business investments, and raising the small business expense limit to $500,000. Three months later, the president signed a tax bill that raised the expense limit to 100 percent of small business new investments until the end of 2011. It also extended the elimination of capital gains taxes for small business investments through the end of 2012. (For more details, see our previous fact-check that provided at least 16 tax cuts to small businesses; we rated it Mostly True.) To be clear, this doesn’t mean the middle-class and small businesses haven’t seen any tax increases under the Obama administration. We rated his campaign promise that no family making less than $250,000 will see "any form of tax increase" as Promise Broken. Obama has signed off on new taxes on cigarettes and indoor tanning. His health care law includes a tax penalty for people who don’t buy health insurance; that starts in 2014. (It includes hardship exemptions for people who can’t find affordable policies.) Also, under the health care law, small businesses that have more than 50 employees that don’t offer their employees health insurance could face fines. Our ruling Obama has raised some taxes during his presidency, but he’s also pursued broad-based tax cuts for the middle class and small businesses. We particularly give weight here to the tax cuts that were part of the stimulus and the payroll tax holiday, which reduced taxes for broad swaths of the workforce. Some small businesses may have been hit by new taxes that were part of Obama’s health law, but these would depend on the particular circumstances of each business. Also, there were new taxes on cigarettes and indoor tanning. Obama said he has "cut taxes for those who need it – middle-class families, small businesses." He has, but he also has raised some taxes. So while his statement is accurate, it lacks that additional context. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-09-07T00:27:40	2012-09-06	['None']
pomt-05898	Says Gov. Chris Christie’s proposal to reduce state income taxes "would be the second tax cut for the rich by the governor in two years."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/feb/05/paul-sarlo/chris-christies-proposed-income-tax-cuts-blasted-d/	A state income tax cut proposed by Gov. Chris Christie would provide greater savings to more affluent New Jerseyans, but according to Democratic state Sen. Paul Sarlo, that’s nothing new. As Sarlo sees it, the Republican governor has already cut taxes for the wealthy once before. At the start of the Jan. 30 Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee meeting, Sarlo, who serves as committee chairman, provided some opening remarks about how the governor’s proposal would disproportionately benefit high-income earners. "The proposed tax cut plan is measuring up as a potential billion-dollar gift for those who are high-income earners," Sarlo (D-Bergen) told his fellow legislators. "This would be the second tax cut for the rich by the governor in two years." If the latest proposal would be the second tax cut, what was the first? Sarlo told us in a phone interview that Christie cut taxes the first time when he vetoed a bill in 2010 to increase the income tax rate on taxable income exceeding $1 million, or the so-called "millionaires tax." But PolitiFact New Jersey found there’s a difference between stopping a tax increase and cutting taxes. The governor’s veto helped millionaires avoid a larger tax rate, but Christie has maintained the rates he inherited upon entering office in January 2010. Four economic experts also told us the governor’s veto doesn’t qualify as a "tax cut." First, let’s review the history behind the millionaires tax. In 2009, then-Gov. Jon Corzine, a Democrat, and the Democrat-controlled Legislature approved a one-year increase in some high-income tax rates. The higher rates were effective for tax year 2009 and reverted to their previous levels on Jan. 1, 2010 -- before Christie took office. A few months later, the Legislature passed a bill to increase the tax rate on taxable income exceeding $1 million from 8.97 percent to 10.75 percent. Christie immediately vetoed that bill and a related measure, and state Assembly Democrats later could not gather enough votes to override the vetoes. Through his veto, Christie "preserved the tax cut" provided when the higher rates expired at the end of 2009, according to Sarlo. But four economic experts argued that the governor’s veto should not be considered a tax cut. "I don’t believe that maintaining current law by vetoing the bill should be characterized as a tax cut," Jim Nunns, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, said in an email. "(Likewise, vetoing a bill that proposed some tax cut relative to current law should not be characterized as a tax increase.)" J. Fred Giertz, an economics professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, echoed the same argument: "Since the tax was never in place, the veto did not result in a tax decrease. The veto kept taxes the same and kept taxes from increasing." But Sarlo maintained that Christie’s veto led to a tax cut. "His actions resulted in the higher income brackets getting a reduced rate," Sarlo told us. "His actions resulted in a tax cut." Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts argued that Democrats could have renewed the millionaires tax before it expired at the end of 2009. "Factually, the tax surcharge (which I believe is what it technically was) expired under a Democratically controlled legislature and a Democratic Governor, before Governor Christie took the oath of office," Roberts told us in an email. "Pants on fire." Our ruling During a Senate committee meeting about Christie’s proposed income tax cut, Sarlo claimed: "This would be the second tax cut for the rich by the governor in two years." Sarlo was referring to Christie vetoing the proposed millionaires tax in 2010. But that veto just kept income tax rates at the same levels as when the governor took office. Those millionaires actually got their tax cut under a Democratic governor and the Democrat-controlled Legislature -- before Christie took office. Yet since Christie’s veto stopped a proposed tax increase from going through, we rate the statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-05685	Says there are four super PACs on the Republican side of the Texas U.S. Senate race.	true	/texas/statements/2012/mar/13/paul-sadler/paul-sadler-says-four-super-pacs-are-us-senate-rac/	At a candidate forum in Austin, Paul Sadler was asked if he’d support a constitutional amendment overturning the 2010 Supreme Court decision that touched off a flood of super PACs, a type of political action committee that cannot coordinate with a candidate’s campaign, but can independently spend unlimited donations to influence a race. "Hell yes, I will," Sadler said at the March 1, 2012, Travis County Democratic Party event. Calling the super PACs’ impact "scandalous," the lawyer and former Texas House member said: "In our race on the Republican side, already, there are four super PACs -- four super PACs -- and it is a distortion of our democracy." Such PACs are weighing in heavily this election season, raising eyebrows in some cases because they can accept money from certain tax-exempt groups that don’t have to disclose their donors’ names. According to the nonpartisan research group Center for Reponsive Politics’ opensecrets.org, super PACs have spent $65 million in the 2012 cycle so far supporting presidential candidates -- including President Barack Obama, who as PolitiFact noted February 7, 2012, executed a Full Flop in his stance on fundraising for super PACs. But four in our little ol’ U.S. Senate race? Jeff Rotkoff, spokesman for Sadler’s campaign to succeed retiring Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, told us the backup for his candidate’s statement was included in Sadler’s February 8, 2012, fundraising email, which cited in turn a Texas Tribune news story from the day before. That story listed four super PACs and linked them to candidates: Texas Conservatives Fund and Conservative Renewal Political Action Committee, supporting Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst; Real Street Conservatives, supporting Craig James; and Club for Growth Action PAC, supporting Ted Cruz. Like traditional PACs, super PACs register with the Federal Election Commission, which describes supers as "independent expenditure-only committees." Typically when a super PAC is created, the organizers attach a memo to the FEC stating their intent to make independent expenditures. The FEC website displays those memos for three of the PACs that Sadler referred to. For the fourth, we asked Club for Growth spokesman Barney Keller to confirm its super PAC status. Keller told us by email that the club’s Action PAC is its super PAC, distinct from its traditional Club for Growth PAC, which Keller said has endorsed Ted Cruz. So, yep: All four are supers. We set out to learn what we could about their activities. From websites and what the four PACs had reported to the FEC through March 6, 2012, we gleaned these thumbnails, keeping in mind that only the Club for Growth super PAC has existed long enough to have filed reports of contributions and expenditures: Texas Conservatives Fund: Created in January 2012 by Paul Kilgore, according to its statement of organization filed with the FEC. Kilgore, whom we reached by phone, is president of a campaign consulting firm in Athens, Ga. The PAC says on its website that its mission is to help Dewhurst get the GOP nomination and be elected to the U.S. Senate. Conservative Renewal Political Action Committee: Created in January 2012 by Larry Hicks, according to its statement of organization. A February 3, 2012, Houston Chronicle blog entry reported that the Conservative Renewal PAC would support Dewhurst. Hicks, whom we reached by phone, is a certified public accountant in Houston. Real Street Conservatives PAC: Created in February 2012 by Jerad Najvar, according to its statement of organization. Najvar, an election lawyer in Houston, told us by phone that he wasn’t authorized to state the PAC’s purpose or name the client who hired him to file the organizing documents. The Austin American-Statesman reported in a February 3, 2012, news blog post that a source had confirmed the Real Street Conservatives PAC supports James. Club for Growth Action: Created in August 2010 by Chris Chocola, according to its statement of organization. Chocola is president of the Washington, D.C.-based Club for Growth. The Club for Growth is a national conservative group that advocates economic growth. According to opensecrets.org, the group spent $5 million on Congressional races in the 2010 election cycle, using its cash for items such as television ads. In the 2012 election cycle, opensecrets.org shows the group has only spent $574,097 so far, but 82 percent, or $468,758, of that has been used against Dewhurst, the website records. So, yep: four supers, all linked to Republican candidates in the Texas U.S. Senate race. Sadler told us via email that he did not know of any such PACs supporting him. How would he respond if such a group formed? "Nothing I or anyone else can do -- I think that is the point, isn't it?," he wrote. We rate Sadler’s claim True.

pomt-05682	The "Democrat majority in the Senate has failed to submit [a] budget in the past 1,000 days."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/14/johnny-isakson/isakson-democrats-failed-submit-budget-1000-days/	A favorite GOP talking point accusing Democrats of punting on the nation’s budget problems for the past 1,000 days has made its way to Georgia. The GOP devoted an entire video ad to it. U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, the Republican from Wisconsin who has won kudos from some deficit hawks, is churning out essays and press releases on it. And Georgia’s U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Republican, is putting his own spin on the subject. "I find it very troubling that the president is asking to increase the nation’s debt limit when his Democrat majority in the Senate has failed to submit [a] budget in the past 1,000 days," Isakson said in a Jan. 26 press release. That’s about three years. We grabbed our calculator and got to work with the help of our sister sites PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact Wisconsin, who have analyzed other claims on the same subject. But before we proceed with our fact check, it helps to explain how Congress comes up with its federal budget. This is how it works: Since the passage of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, the Senate and the House are supposed to pass budget resolutions in the spring. These budget resolutions set a framework for spending, taxation and other fiscal items in the coming fiscal year. They also lay out general plans for the next four years. If these budget resolutions differ, the chambers are supposed to hammer out a compromise. If a budget resolution doesn’t pass, the federal government won’t go dark. Budget resolutions are distinct from appropriations bills, which actually allocate how the federal government spends its money. If a resolution tanks, the majority party can use congressional procedures to move forward to consider appropriations bills. As a previous PolitiFact National story said, "the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority's organizational skills and/or the degree of partisan discord in Congress. It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter, and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate." Now, on to our fact check. Thanks to PolitiFact Florida and PolitiFact Wisconsin, we have a good sense of whether Isakson’s claim is accurate. Last year, George LeMieux, a Republican contender for U.S. Senate in Florida, posted on Twitter that it had been 750 days since his opponent and Senate Democrats "passed" a budget. LeMieux was referring to the last time the Senate, which is controlled by Democrats, passed a budget resolution. Indeed, the last time the Senate passed a budget resolution was in 2009 for the 2010 fiscal year, according to a report on the budget process by the Congressional Research Service. PolitiFact Florida rated this statement Half True. The candidate got the number of days right, but placing the blame on Senate Democrats wasn’t fair. Partisans on both sides share responsibility. Let’s move on to Jan. 23, about 250 days after LeMieux made his statement. Ryan, the Republican House member from Wisconsin, said Senate Democrats "have gone without any budget at all" for more than 1,000 days. Ryan’s language could have been more precise, PolitiFact Wisconsin ruled. It had been that long since a budget resolution passed, but not since the last Senate budget resolution expired. He earned a Mostly True. Isakson uses somewhat different wording from Ryan and LeMieux. He said that the Democratic majority in the Senate has failed to "submit" -- not pass -- a budget in the past 1,000 days. Democrats did submit a budget resolution since the last resolution passed, though it never went before the full Senate for a vote. We took a look at the Congressional Record, the official record of Congress’ proceedings. On April 26, 2010, under the heading "Submitted Resolutions," is S. Con. Res. 60, introduced by Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota. He’s a Democrat and head of the Senate Budget Committee. The resolution would have set forth the budget for 2011, but the Senate took no action after its date of submission. A resolution is "submitted" when its author formally presents it to the house of which he or she is a member, according to Congressional Quarterly’s American Congressional Dictionary, a widely used authority on language used in Congress. Instead of passing a typical budget resolution for 2011, Democrats passed one that would last for a single year. They said that they were waiting for a fiscal commission created by President Barack Obama to make its recommendations for debt reduction, according to news accounts at the time. In an email, Isakson spokeswoman Lauren Culbertson described Conrad’s submission of the budget resolution as a "gimmick." "It was never reported out of committee. It was never brought to the floor. It was not debated for even one hour," the email said. Federal law limits debate on a budget resolution to 50 hours. The Democrat-controlled Senate didn’t put a budget resolution up for a vote last year. And according to news accounts, they don’t intend to put one up this year, either. Isakson’s claim that the "Democrat majority in the Senate has failed to submit [a] budget in the past 1,000 days" needs some revision. No budget has been passed in the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate. None has been put up for a vote in that time, either. But one was submitted April 26, 2010, or 640 days before Isakson issued his press release. That said, this flaw in Isakson’s statement doesn’t undermine his larger point. The budget resolution for 2011 languished. It never went up for a vote, and Democrats haven’t submitted one since.

pomt-09411	"Kay Bailey Hutchison was elected state treasurer, succeeding Ann Richards. Democrats then abolished the position ... Hutchison later became a U.S. senator."	false	/texas/statements/2010/mar/19/karl-rove/karl-rove-writes-democrats-abolished-state-treasur/	Karl Rove, the Texas-steeped consultant who guided George W. Bush through nearly two terms as governor and two more as president, recently issued a barbed claim about Democrats paying back Kay Bailey Hutchison. Rove, whose clients before Bush bid for governor included Hutchison, writes in his autobiography, “Courage and Consequence, My Life as a Conservative in The Fight”: “Kay Bailey Hutchison was elected state treasurer, succeeding Ann Richards. Democrats then abolished the position, which made me wonder if political payback is about the only grounds on which Democrats abolish government posts. Hutchison later became a U.S. senator.” The book was released March 9. Rove correctly reflects on Hutchison winning election as state treasurer in 1990, succeeding Richards, who won election as governor. However, we're intrigued by Rove’s statements about what happened next: According to him, Democrats then abolished the treasurer’s position. Later, Hutchison was elected to the U.S. Senate. Rove told us he stands by his account. Chronologically speaking, for starters, it's not so: Hutchison won her Senate seat in June 1993 while still serving as state treasurer, and the treasury remained a stand-alone agency after Hutchison left for Washington. Richards appointed an East Texas Democrat, Martha Whitehead, to serve out Hutchison’s term. Whitehead won election in her own right in 1994. So when -- and how -- was the treasurer's job abolished? According to legislative records, the Democratic-majority 1995 Legislature proposed a constitutional amendment abolishing the agency and shifting its operations elsewhere. Contrary to Rove's take, it wasn’t a move backed solely by Democrats. Senate Joint Resolution 1 was authored by Sen. Rodney Ellis, D-Houston, and sponsored in the House by Reps. Mark Stiles, D-Beaumont, and Bill Siebert, R-San Antonio. The proposed amendment cleared the Senate by 23-7 with five Republicans and two Democrats voting "no" and the House by 107-18 with several Republicans who voted “no” saying afterward they’d intended to vote “yes,” according to Senate and House journals. Texas voters approved the change by 69 percent to 31 percent in November 1995. And Whitehead--who’d campaigned for election vowing to eliminate the agency—marked her last day in office Aug. 31, 1996 by scraping her name and title off the glass front of the agency’s Austin headquarters. “I am the last treasurer of the State of Texas,” she said. Another Democrat, State Comptroller John Sharp, had proposed the agency’s abolition in a report issued in 1994, after Hutchison was already in the Senate. His report called the treasury a “bureaucracy with an annual operating budget of more than $11 million whose most important tasks are duplicated elsewhere across state government… Consolidating the bulk of the State Treasury's responsibilities with those of the Comptroller's office would cut costs, improve services and maintain accountability. It would also offer Texans the chance to prove that they're serious about reducing the size of their state government.” How does Rove’s statement shape up? As noted, he's correct that Hutchison succeeded Richards as treasurer. But he's wrong about the order of subsequent events, and assigns an unsupported motive—that Democrats abolished the agency because a Republican had its top spot. Some Republicans backed the abolition, too, and it was Hutchison’s Democratic successor whose stint in the office came to a sign-scraping close. We rate Rove’s poor job of retelling history as False.

pomt-12530	Says President Donald Trump as a candidate mentioned WikiLeaks "over 160 times in speeches" in the last month of the campaign.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/21/jackie-speier/did-trump-really-mention-wikileaks-over-160-times-/	President Donald Trump reveled in WikiLeaks’ disclosures against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton during the closing argument of his presidential campaign. His CIA director, Mike Pompeo, revealed a different attitude in a tough April 13 speech which addressed the anonymous hacking website. The group "walks like a hostile intelligence service and talks like a hostile intelligence service," Pompeo said. U.S. Rep. Jackie Speier, D-Calif., was one of many voices who noticed the administration’s hardened view toward WikiLeaks. CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer interviewed Speier, a member of the House intelligence committee, on April 13 about Pompeo’s characterization of WikiLeaks. How much did Trump the candidate love WikiLeaks in the last days of the campaign? She attempted to count the ways. "If you recall during the election cycle, in the last month of the campaign, I believe that President Trump as a candidate hailed WikiLeaks as the new savior, had mentioned it over 160 times in speeches during that period of time. Really, that many times? We decided to check it out. WikiLeaks released tens of thousands of emails from the account of Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman John Podesta in October 2016 and released thousands of emails from Democratic National Committee staffers in July 2016. Speier’s office said she was referring to a Jan. 7 article by left-leaning website ThinkProgress for her statement. Here’s how that article began: "President-elect Trump says that information published by WikiLeaks, which the U.S. intelligence community says was hacked by Russia, had ‘absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.’ This was not the view of candidate Trump, who talked about WikiLeaks and the content of the emails it released at least 164 times in last month of the campaign." The article analyzed Trump’s "speeches, media appearances and debates" to get a tally of 164 mentions from Oct. 10 to Nov. 8. That number includes 124 times Trump mentioned the group by name, with the rest being mentions of the emails released by WikiLeaks. We set out on our own review, looking through transcripts from Congressional Quarterly by searching for the words "WikiLeaks" and "Trump," and limiting results to the last month of the campaign. We found Trump said the word "WikiLeaks" about 137 times in campaign rallies, interviews, speeches, his tweets and other social media presence, and debates. Speier’s figure of over 160 seems possible, however, because he often referenced disclosures from WikiLeaks without using the group’s name, and it’s possible there were interviews or speeches where Trump brought up WikiLeaks that our search didn’t return. At the time, Wikileaks steadily released a series of emails from the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman. These emails were characterized by Trump and her other critics as showing Clinton held policy positions in private that were different from her public positions, that she received town hall topics in advance, and that they demonstrated negative internal dynamics inside the Clinton campaign. Trump repeatedly brought up the emails, encouraged his supporters to see them for themselves, and also described several revelations inaccurately. Let’s replay some of the biggest hits. "The WikiLeaks revelations have revealed a degree of corruption at the highest levels of our government like nothing we have ever seen as a country before," Trump said at a rally in Colorado on Oct. 29. "Hillary Clinton, as WikiLeaks proves, is a corrupt globalist," he said at a rally on Oct 21. "I love WikiLeaks," he said on Oct. 10. Trump has not said much publicly about WikiLeaks as president. The closest moment came during the transition. After receiving an intelligence briefing on Jan. 6, Trump released a statement that said "while Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election." He also brought up Donna Brazile’s passing of town hall topics to a Clinton staffer ahead of a primary debate in an interview with Time magazine on March 23, 2017. Our ruling Speier said Trump as a candidate mentioned WikiLeaks "over 160 times in speeches" in the last 30 days of the campaign. Official counts may vary, but her larger point is clear: Trump brought up WikiLeaks a lot in the waning days of the campaign. He has stayed largely mum about the group since taking office, even as his CIA director said WikiLeaks acts like a "hostile intelligence service." We rate this claim Mostly True. <a href="https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/13b3ef93-7755-4388-a286-c0f6e047d2e4">https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/13b3ef93-7755-4388-a286-c0f6e047d2e4</a>	None	Jackie Speier	None	None	None	2017-04-21T15:01:43	2017-04-13	['WikiLeaks', 'Donald_Trump']

pomt-05847	"The U.S. Census believes that by 2030 the majority of Americans will use Spanish as their first language."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2012/feb/14/glee/ricky-martins-character-tv-show-glee-says-us-censu/	We’re gonna make this fact-check sing. Or -- since this fact-check was inspired by a Spanish teacher played by singer Ricky Martin on the TV show Glee -- we will make it cantar. Our fact-check is about how many people will be speaking Spanish as their first language in the year 2030. But before we hit play on our claim, we will catch you up with the show that follows a fictional Glee Club, named the New Directions, at a high school in Ohio. The show is about a group of musically talented misfits who belt out songs in between typical teenage plot twists about dating, spats with their parents, applying to college and the ever-present quest for popularity. The worst is getting "slushied," which means having slushy drinks tossed in their faces by cool football players. The cast of characters includes Artie, the bespectacled skinny guy in a wheelchair; Santana, the bad-ass Latina lesbian from the wrong side of town; Quinn, the blonde cheerleader/chastity club leader who gets pregnant; and many more. They are led by the Glee Club director/Spanish teacher William Schuester, who is on an annual quest to lead his club to victory at nationals. The plot of the Feb. 7, 2012, episode: Schuester enrolls in a night Spanish class taught by Ricky Martin’s character, David Martinez. (Yep, Mr. Schuester is a Spanish teacher whose Spanish es muy muy malo.) Martin tells his students that they need to learn Spanish to function in the U.S. in the future: "Do you know that the U.S. Census believes that by 2030 the majority of Americans will use Spanish as their first language?" (Here’s a clip of Martin singing "Sexy and I know It" and "La Isla Bonita" on the episode.) Schuester uses Spanish as the inspiration for his weekly assignment for the Glee Club: sing a song by a Spanish artist or that includes Spanish. We decided to take a short intermission from politics to test Glee’s claim about whether the Census Bureau believes the majority of Americans will speak Spanish as their first language by 2030. U.S. Census projects growth in Hispanic population Glee’s claim surprised the folks at the U.S. Census Bureau. "We don’t do projections of language spoken," on a regular official basis, said Robert Bernstein, a census spokesman. "That’s very strange someone would cite us." Bernstein pointed us to projections about the Hispanic population released in 2008 based on data from 2000. The census projected that by 2030 there will be about 85.9 million Hispanics out of about 373.5 million people in the U.S., representing about 23 percent of the population. That projection is compared to about 16 percent of the population (49.7 million people) in 2010. So it’s true that the Hispanic population in the U.S. is on track to grow. But the census projections are about the number of Hispanics -- not how many people will speak Spanish as their first language at home. Spanish spoken in U.S. in 2010 The American Community Survey, which is a part of the census program, provides estimates of population characteristics including language. For 2010, the survey showed about 37 million of 289 million people over age 5 spoke Spanish -- or about 13 percent. It doesn’t ask respondents what their "first" language is, but asks what they speak at home and how well they speak English. And those Spanish speakers include Hispanics and non-Hispanics. "We don’t know how frequently they speak one (language) or the other, or which one they use exclusively or first," said Tiffany Julian, an analyst with the Census Bureau. The survey also showed that for 2010, of the 45.6 million Hispanics, about 11.2 million speak only English while 34.3 million speak Spanish (including those who don’t speak English and those who speak English of varying ability.) That means 75 percent of Hispanics speak Spanish. So if we know in 2010 that 75 percent of Hispanics speak Spanish, we could apply that figure to the 85.9 million Hispanics projected for 2030. That would bring us to a projection of 64 million Hispanics speaking Spanish by 2030, and if we divided that into the overall projected population of 373.5 million, we find that Hispanic Spanish speakers would represent about one-sixth of the population. But what we’ve spelled out here is not a projection by ACS or the Census and may not be accurate: it’s pure math without taking into account any changes in immigration or fertility over the next two decades. Plus, we’ve also left out non-Hispanics who could speak Spanish at home as their first language. Paper on language projection At this point, we were about ready to say hasta la vista. But wait -- we found a couple of experts at the Census Bureau who took a stab at language projections and presented a paper at the Federal Forecasters Conference in April 2011. Their paper projects that somewhere between 13 and 15.3 percent of the age 5 and older population will speak Spanish by 2020 -- the last year cited in the paper. The authors of the paper, census demographer Jennifer Ortman and survey statistician Hyon Shin, told us that even if they projected out to 2030, the percentage of Spanish speakers likely would have continued to grow slightly -- but nowhere close to a majority of Americans speaking Spanish as their first language. "That is just blatantly wrong," the two agreed. "We don’t have anything that can support that." While nationwide immigrants typically continue to speak their native language, their children and grandchildren tend to use mostly -- if not only -- English. That means as the Hispanic population in the U.S. continues to grow, in part due to the descendants of immigrants, those children will speak English. Spanish is projected to remain the language spoken by a majority of what census researchers call "Language Other Than English" speakers. But "English is expected to continue to be the only language spoken by a substantial majority of all U.S. residents 5 years and older," the paper by the census experts said. Our ruling Ricky Martin’s character said on Glee, "The U.S. Census believes that by 2030 the majority of Americans will use Spanish as their first language." The Census Bureau predicts that in 2030 about 23 percent of the U.S. population will be Hispanic -- but all of those Hispanics in the future won’t speak Spanish as their first language. Two census researchers projected that somewhere between 13 and 15.3 percent of people in the U.S. will speak Spanish in 2020 -- a far cry from the majority of Americans, and we don’t know how many of those will speak it as their first language. They said the numbers from 2030 would still be nowhere close to the 50-percent mark. Ricky Martin may have looked good singing in his tight pants, but we’re going to light the show’s pants on fire anyway. Pants on Fire!

pomt-00906	"We have cut taxes more than 40 times in four years."	half-true	/florida/statements/2015/mar/03/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-he-cut-taxes-more-40-times/	Gov. Rick Scott has been touting his record of tax-cutting for years now, but in his March 3, 2015, State of the State address, he said he’s been pulling out the red pen even more. "We have cut taxes more than 40 times in four years," Scott said during his speech to open the 2015 legislative session. That’s a lot of instances of cutting Floridians’ taxes. Scott said during the 2014 gubernatorial campaign he’d cut taxes 40 times, but the "more" part piqued our interest. But what does Scott consider a tax cut, and how many times has he cut them? We took a closer look to try to break the code. Scott’s tally Scott said in 2013 he considered a tax cut to be a change that reduced government revenue by $3 million in any one year. He altered his definition in 2014 to include more revenue reductions for less than $3 million as tax cuts. That means he included things that weren’t, strictly speaking, an outright reduction in a single tax rate -- like sales tax holidays, stopping automatic fee hikes, tax credits and some temporary measures. He then counted each instance of some things every time they happened (so, for example, the annual back-to-school sales tax holiday is counted multiple times). Scott’s people didn’t get back to us with new information immediately, but in May 2014 they shared with us a list that included 41 items, so that may explain the "more than 40 times" part of it. In no particular order they are (with estimated savings in parentheses): 1, 2.) Unemployment compensation taxes: The Legislature reduced the number of weeks and payout for unemployment compensation in 2011 ($124.5 million). A tax increase for businesses was rolled back in 2012, although not eliminated. ($830 million for tax years 2012-14). 3, 4.) Manufacturing equipment: A 2012 sales tax exemption on machinery purchases was expanded ($56 million). In 2013, the Legislature eliminated the sales tax entirely for three years, starting April 30, 2014 ($370 million in state taxes and and $83 million in local government taxes through 2017). 5.) Property taxes: Scott and legislators forced most state water management districts to reduce their property tax collections by 30 percent in 2011 ($210 million). 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.) Sales tax holiday: Scott counted the mostly annual tax-free shopping holiday four different times prior to 2013. It applied to shoes and clothing up to $75 per item and school supply purchases up to $15. The state has offered the holiday every year since 1998 except in 2002, 2003, 2008 and 2009. The Aug. 2-4 tax holiday counted twice, according to Scott, because it also exempted sales taxes on electronic equipment, such as E-readers, laptops and tablets, up to $750 (about $30 million for all four holidays). For 2014, there were three sales tax holidays: From May 31-June 8, 2014, for Floridians to buy hurricane preparedness supplies without paying 6 percent ($2.9 million); A three-day back-to-school shopping period from Aug. 1-3 was for clothes worth $100 or less, school supplies worth $15 or less, or on the first $750 of the cost of a personal computer (about $30 million); and Sept. 19-21 on the purchase of energy- and water-efficient appliances costing $1,500 or less (about $1.7 million). 13, 14.) Corporate Income Tax exemptions: Lawmakers expanded the exemption for corporate income taxes from $5,000 to $25,000 in 2011, and then all the way up to $50,000 in 2012 (about $60 million). 15.) Tax credit scholarships: A program that gives businesses a tax credit if they purchase tuition vouchers for low-income families to go to private schools was expanded ($25 million). 16, 17, 18.) Energy breaks: A 2013 law implemented part of a 2008 constitutional amendment that says a property appraiser may not base an increase in a property’s just value on the installation of a "renewable energy source device," including windmills, solar panels and roof pools (local revenue losses of $12.6 million by 2017). Two other tax credits from 2012 aimed at helping agribusiness and renewable energy production facilities are set to expire in 2016. Scott allowed the bill to become law without his signature. 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25.) Various business tax incentives: Since 2011, Scott and the Legislature have expanded tax credits available to businesses under a federal/state "new markets" program, allowing businesses to take it against their corporate income tax bill or insurance premium tax bill ($12.9 million per year). They’ve allowed companies that spent at least $250 million on capital costs from 2011-13 to write-down a portion of their Florida business taxes ($7.5 million). They temporarily waived a requirement that a new facility creating at least 100 jobs be in certain technology fields in order to qualify for the Capital Investment Tax Credit, though only if they are located in certain Panhandle counties. The exemption lasted through June 30, 2014 ($4.4 million per year). They also created an annual corporate income tax credit for certain research and development expenses (up to $9 million a year). In 2014 businesses won a small decrease on the tax rate on electricity ($3 million) and allowed a sales tax refund on bad credit card debt (about $6.7 million). 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33.) Targeted breaks: Lawmakers eliminated sales taxes on repairs to planes between 2,000 and 15,000 pounds ($12.3 million). The same bill tweaked requirements for a tax credit for businesses in an urban high-crime area ($3.5 million per year). The Legislature blocked a July 2013 automatic inflation adjustment factored in registration for hunting and fishing license fees every five years ($4.4 million for 2012-13). A wide-ranging 2012 law eliminated the annual adjustment and surcharge for severing phosphate ($12.6 million annually). A person licensed as a real estate salesperson or broker associate does not have to apply for an exemption from a local business tax when he or she is an employee of someone else under a 2012 law ($3.8 million from local government per year). A portion of the 2014 tax cut package clarified how prepaid calling plans were taxed ($7.2 million). It also contained provisions to cut taxes for premiums on bail bonds ($700,000) and title insurance ($5.4 million). The bill also extended and increased financial incentives for businesses to donate to community development and housing projects for low-income residents by providing a tax credit or sales tax refund ($14.7 million). 34.) Communications dealers: A 2012 law spared communications dealers, in certain situations, from being liable for penalties if they assign a customer to the wrong local tax jurisdiction ($4.7 million annually). 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40.) Sales tax exemptions: The tax cut package from 2014’s HB 5601 included several exemptions for more than just businesses. There was a temporary $3.3 million cut for the purchase of cement mixing drums for cement trucks, but the list also includes child car seats and youth bike helmets (about $2.5 million), prescribed diet pet food (another $2.5 million or so) and prepaid college meal plans (about $12 million). These exemptions are in effect until 2017. 41.) Car registration fees: In 2014, the Legislature rolled back the 2009 annual auto tag fee increase. Those fees had gone up to deal with a budget shortfall. The fee cut took effect in September 2014 and saves motorists about $25 a year per vehicle registration (about $395 million annually). Adding it up So that totals 41, but do they really count as tax cuts? It depends on how you look at it, experts have told PolitiFact Florida. If you’re a business, some of the changes are a real benefit. But if you’re a regular, taxpaying Floridian, there’s not a whole lot here for you -- especially if you need to collect unemployment. Sales tax holidays can change from year to year, and exemptions are temporary. Tax credits only save you money if you spend it somewhere else, and preventing property appraisals from going up if you improve the property means you still have to improve the property. Ending a fee increase isn’t so much a cut as it is saving people from paying more for something they have to pay anyway, like a hunting or fishing license. And don’t forget that many times, local governments may raise taxes to make up for their own lost revenue. Scott has requested several tax changes for 2015, but it is up to the Legislature to approve them. Our ruling Scott said, "We have cut taxes more than 40 times in four years." A list his office sent us last year with 41 things they considered tax cuts likely explains that sum.

pomt-08564	Independent groups behind ads attacking Democratic candidates are "front groups for foreign-controlled companies."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/28/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-independent-groups-behind-ads-attack/	On ABC's This Week on Sept. 26, 2010, David Axelrod was asked about the growing influence of Republican strategist Karl Rove, former adviser to President George W. Bush, who is affiliated with American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS, organizations that are spending millions on ads attacking Democratic candidates. "Here's the thing about Karl Rove and what he's doing," said Axelrod, senior adviser to President Barack Obama said. "The insidious thing about it is they are funding negative ads all over the country against Democratic candidates paid for by major corporate special interests who don't have to disclose their participation, the oil industry, Wall Street, insurance industry. "We put a bill in the United States Congress asking one thing -- and this was a loophole that was opened by the Supreme Court earlier in this year -- we put a bill in the Congress saying, disclose who is funding these campaigns. Let the American people know who's paying for these ads. It's a very simple premise." Axelrod is talking here about the 5-4 ruling by the Supreme Court on Jan. 21, 2010 in the landmark case Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission, which struck down barriers to corporations spending money directly from their own treasuries to influence elections. And the bill that Axelrod said would close that loophole is the Democracy is Strengthened by Casting Light on Spending in Elections (DISCLOSE) Act, which was recently derailed in the Senate. According to Axelrod, these independent groups are "spending tens of millions of dollars. In some districts, they're spending more money than the candidates themselves on negative ads from benign-sounding Americans for Prosperity, the American Crossroads Fund. No. These are front groups for special interests. These are front groups for foreign-controlled companies, which would have been banned under the bill that we put through Congress, and they don't want the American people to know, and the American people ought to be alert to that." The fact we are checking here is whether some of the independent groups supporting Republican candidates are front groups for foreign-controlled companies. White House officials said that the two groups Axelrod cited by name -- Americans for Prosperity and the American Crossroads Fund -- were examples of "front groups for special interests," but not necessarily fronts for foreign-controlled companies. According to media reports, Americans for Prosperity is funded by oil magnates David and Charles Koch; and American Crossroads is a group created by GOP strategists Karl Rove and Ed Gillespie. According to a story in Roll Call, American Crossroads is almost entirely funded by 10 wealthy donors and corporations, including $1 million from a Dallas-based oil and gas executive. While the source of American Crossroads' money must ultimately be disclosed, many of the donors may not be known until after the elections. Crossroads GPS, on the other hand, was formed as an IRS code 501(c)4 non-profit, which must spend most of its money on issues rather than candidates, but does not have to disclose its donors. In other words, we don't really know where some of these groups and others funding the negative ads are getting their money. "The fundamental problem following Citizens United is that it is difficult to determine who is sponsoring these groups," said White House spokeswoman Kate Bedingfield. "And that comes at the expense of the American people, who no longer have the right to know who is financing these ads in an attempt to influence an election for their preferred candidate. Wall Street, the insurance lobby, oil companies and other special interests are now one step closer to taking Congress back and returning to the days when lobbyists wrote the laws. And that’s the point Axelrod is making here. He’s referring generally to front groups and lists Americans for Prosperity and American Crossroads as two specific examples of incorporated entities that can now use corporate money to pay for electioneering communications in light of the Citizens United decision. They don’t represent every single kind of incorporated entity that Axelrod is referring to; they’re just two examples of front groups with benign-sounding names." So far, it remains to be seen how much, if any, money comes from foreign companies. In January, 2010 PolitiFact looked into a claim from President Obama that the Citizens United case opened the floodgates for special interests -– including foreign corporations. We found that the president had overstated the decision's immediate impact and rated it Barely True. It is a matter of intense legal debate. In the Citizens United case, the majority justices left intact current federal law that prevents "a partnership, association, corporation, organization, or other combination of persons organized under the laws of or having its principal place of business in a foreign country" from making "directly or indirectly" a donation or expenditure "in connection with a Federal, State, or local election," to a political party committee or "for an electioneering communication." But the minority justices in that case warned the ruling could lead to foreign companies exerting influence. Some legal experts we spoke to said that the ruling could open the door to foreign companies spending on American campaigns, given the general direction of the majority's opinion. We concluded then that "until test cases proceed and further rulings are handed down, Obama's claim about foreign campaign spending is a reasonable interpretation, and nothing more." White House officials could not provide evidence that any of the groups funding campaign-related ads are fronts for foreign-controlled companies. Rather, they said, the issue was raised as a hypothetical problem created by the Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court. Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, said it's "possible" that donations could come from a foreign-controlled company. "I'm certainly concerned this cycle because some of these donors fly under the radar," she said. However, she said. "I know of no specific organization that is foreign-controlled. I think (Axelrod) was incorrect if he said that. It is a legitimate thing to be concerned about. There have been many examples of it happening in the past. But I don't think there is any evidence of that happening." Democratic lawmakers sought, in part, to definitively close the door on foreign money through the DISCLOSE Act. "The problem with our political system is that we don't have any idea where any of the money that is going to these groups that funds these ads is coming from," said Doug Thornell, a spokesman for Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, the Democrats' House campaign committee chief. "The DISCLOSE Act would have provided the American people with an important tool to use to find out who is trying to influence these upcoming elections." Section 102 of the DISCLOSE Act detailed how it would prevent foreign influence in U.S. elections. Again, the bill stalled in the Senate. With regard to the financial backing for some of the attack ads against Democrats, we think Obama's wording was more accurate when he said in a fund-raising speech in Philadelphia on Sept. 20, 2010, "The names always sound very benign - it's 'Americans for Prosperity,' 'Committee for Truth in Politics,' 'Americans for Apple Pie' -- I made that last one up. None of them will disclose who is paying for these ads. You don't know whether it's some big financial interest; you don't know if it's a big oil company, or an insurance company. You don't even know if it's foreign controlled." Obama here warned the groups could be using money from entities that are foreign controlled. Axelrod went one step further and said they are front groups for foreign-controlled companies. That might make for a powerful sound bite, but it's a concern, not a known fact. We think it's defensible for Obama and Axelrod to express concern that the Citizens United decision has created the opportunity for foreign companies to use money to try to influence the upcoming elections. But we don't see any evidence to support (or disprove) that it is actually happening. Because Axelrod's comment was so definitive, we rate it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00409	"This year West Virginia produced more AmeriCorps members than any other state."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/31/joe-manchin/does-west-virginia-produce-most-americorps-members/	Is West Virginia the largest source of members for AmeriCorps, a federally run network of national service programs that operate in communities to mentor youth, fight poverty, sustain national parks, and prepare for disasters? Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., said so in a tweet on Aug. 8, 2018: "West Virginians look out for one another and our commitment to service speaks for itself. This year West Virginia produced more @americorps members than any other state. Do you know an AmeriCorps member? Thank them for their service!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We wondered whether Manchin was correct that West Virginia produces more AmeriCorps members than any other state. On its website, AmeriCorps published a study listing the states that produced the most AmeriCorps volunteers for 2018. Here’s the list, which ranks the states based on a per-capita measurement, so that larger-population states don’t dominate the rankings: Rank State 1. West Virginia 2. Washington, D.C. 3. Minnesota 4. Utah 5. Vermont 6. Montana 7. Hawaii 8. New Mexico 9. Massachusetts 10. Maryland This is the first time West Virginia has ranked first. In 2017 and 2016, it ranked third, and in 2015, it ranked fifth. So why does West Virginia rank so high? History, said Dana Bryant, a spokeswoman for Volunteer West Virginia, the state's commission for national and community service. National service programs like AmeriCorps "have a long history in West Virginia, from the Civilian Conservation Corps of the 1930s to southern coalfield (Volunteers in Service to America) fighting poverty in the 1960s to the creation of AmeriCorps in 1993," she said. In West Virginia, "volunteering is just a way of life," she said. West Virginia also received benefits from AmeriCorps. In 2017, the agency said, more than 3,800 people undertook national service in 600 locations across West Virginia and $12.2 million was invested, including "reducing crime and reviving cities, connecting veterans to services, fighting the opioid epidemic, helping seniors live independently, and rebuilding communities after disasters." Our ruling Manchin tweeted, "This year West Virginia produced more AmeriCorps members than any other state." AmeriCorps data confirms West Virginia’s first-place rating per capita for 2018, the first time the state ranked first since the agency began publishing the data in 2015. We rate the statement True.

pomt-06376	Says Mitt Romney flip-flopped on abortion.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/02/jon-huntsman/Says-Mitt-Romney-flip-flopped-on-abortion/	To make fun of Mitt Romney for flip-flopping, a new web ad from former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman uses a wind-up monkey. In one side-by-side video comparison, the ad shows video of Romney first saying, "I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country," then saying, "I have consistently been pro-life." Clearly, the ad is charging Romney with flip-flopping on abortion. So we decided to see whether the charge is accurate. First, let’s look at some of the things Romney said earlier in his career about abortion, when he was waging a losing bid for a U.S. Senate seat in Massachusetts and winning the governorship a few years later. Here are two of the clearest statements of his position. • In a debate during his 1994 race against Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney said, "I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country." Referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that lmade abortion legal in every state, Romney added, "I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice." • In his 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, "I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard." We believe that these two comments -- made in highly public forums and eight years apart -- represent pretty solid evidence that Romney was an abortion-rights supporter during that phase of his political career. What about his views today? The "issues" portion of his website doesn’t list abortion, but Romney wrote a June 18, 2011, op-ed in the conservative National Review that lays out his abortion views pretty clearly. It was written after he risked alienating anti-abortion activists by declining to sign a pledge offered by the Susan B. Anthony List, an anti-abortion group. "I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood, which primarily performs abortions or offers abortion-related services. "I will reinstate the Mexico City Policy to ensure that nongovernmental organizations that receive funding from America refrain from performing or promoting abortion services as a method of family planning, in other countries. This includes ending American funding for any United Nations or other foreign assistance program that promotes or performs abortions on women around the world. "I will advocate for and support a Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act to protect unborn children who are capable of feeling pain from abortion. And perhaps most importantly, I will only appoint judges who adhere to the Constitution and the laws as they are written, not as they want them to be written." Our ruling Abortion opponents may disagree on exactly where on the anti-abortion spectrum Romney falls, and questions have been raised about how fully and quickly Romney made his ideological transition after the event he cites as the spark -- a meeting with a Harvard stem-cell researcher in 2004. Still, we believe these issues are outside the scope of the claim in Huntsman’s ad. Simply put, Romney’s views on abortion are vastly different today than what he expressed in the 1994 and 2002 debates. Huntsman’s claim that Mitt Romney flip-flopped on abortion rates a True.

pomt-06997	Says many public-employee unions falsely told their Wisconsin members his budget-repair bill sought 12 percent to 13 percent of their incomes for health insurance premiums.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jul/10/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-public-employee-unions-false/	Gov. Scott Walker loves playing political pundit, so he was ready with talking points when a CNBC interviewer asked him if he could resurrect popularity polls numbers that "are in the toilet." Walker predicted his numbers would turn around as protests over his battle with public employee unions die down and people realize his 2011-’13 budget wasn’t the end of the world. And he blamed unions for a disinformation campaign for tainting the public’s view of the plan, which forces public employees to pay more for pensions and health care costs. "In many cases, many of the national unions told their members things that just don't add up," Walker told "Squawk Box" co-anchor Joe Kernen on June 21, 2011. "They told them, for example, that the health insurance premium (contributions) we were asking for were a percentage of their incomes, not of their premiums." "Well that’s a big difference," Walker continued. "If you’re asked to pay 12 to 13 percent of your actual salary, that’s a huge amount..." That certainly is a big difference. Walker’s claim is a variation on a theme advanced by Republicans, that national union leaders were pulling the strings here in order to boost the size and duration of the Capitol protests. But it puts an awfully specific spin on it. When we asked for backup, Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said they had no documentation of unions making that claim to members. He said Walker as heard this privately from teachers around the state, though he did not identify any individual teachers. That leaves it to us to see what evidence there may be. A bit of background before we begin: In December, after the election, Walker spoke publicly about his plan to seek greater health and pension contributions. He repeated that during his state of the state speech Feb. 1. And less than two weeks later, he unveiled the plan as part of his budget-repair bill. After unprecedented protests -- and the departure of 14 Democratic senators to Illinois -- the plan won final approval on March 9, 2011. It then survived a legal challenge at the Supreme Court over the manner in which it was approved -- and there may be more battles to come. A central part of the plan: Requiring most state and local public employees to pay at least 12 percent of the cost of their health insurance premiums. It is a big deal for workers. As the issue was debated, we found in an earlier item, the average state employee was paying about 4 percent to 6 percent of the premium. Local government workers’ costs varied by municipality or school district. Walker’s plan also called for workers to pay more toward their pensions -- a contribution of about 5.8 percent of their salary. Note the difference: the pension contribution was a percentage of salary, and the health change was percentage of total premium. The governor’s office -- and reporters -- soon began reporting the combined impact on workers’ paychecks, because in the end that’s where the money would come from. In effect, it is a reduction in pay. In our review, we found a range. Depending on their incomes and health insurance choices, workers would see a 6.8 percent to 12.9 percent hit from the combined changes. With all these numbers floating around, the opportunity for confusion was there. In fact, scattered media reports got the health-insurance change wrong, reporting it as a percentage of income. And we previously found one falsehood on health insurance that circulated briefly in an email, but it involved Walker’s separate two-year budget, not the repair bill. Some state corrections employees, including a dentist who leads unionized state professionals, thought the budget forced workers to pay 100 percent of health costs, but that email rumor was quickly debunked by the state’s largest public-sector union, and separately by PolitiFact Wisconsin. The issue here is how the big unions described Walker’s health change to their members. Those unions were the subject of Walker’s misinformation claim. We reviewed dozens of public communications -- web postings, email alerts and press releases -- between the various unions and their members, as well as to the general public. We also looked for private communications, some of which surfaced publicly. The ones we found all accurately described the impact of the plan. A few examples: The Wisconsin State Employees Union, part of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), got it right. Same for the state’s largest teachers union, the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the National Education Association, AFT-Wisconsin and Madison Teachers Inc. Marty Beil, head of the Wisconsin State Employees Union, said his 22,000 members understood Walker’s plan very clearly. "For him to say that is just misleading as hell," Beil said. "There was no misunderstanding." Let’s finish up. Walker blamed union disinformation for what he said was confusion about his health insurance plan in his budget repair bill. He squarely blamed big unions, and described the problem as widespread. But Walker offered no tangible evidence for his claim. And our check of the communications by the big unions found no instances of unions falsely portraying his plan as a percentage of income. If any additional information surfaces, we may revisit this ruling. But based on the information available, and the lack of documentation from Walker, we rate the statement False.

pomt-04078	"Nearly a quarter of all adults in this state have some college credit without a degree."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/21/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-nearly-quarter-wisconsin-adu/	In his third "state of the state" speech, Gov. Scott Walker recounted leaving Marquette University in 1990 without a degree when he went to work full-time at the American Red Cross. That year, Walker also was busy launching his political career with an unsuccessful bid for state Assembly in Milwaukee. He later married and had two children, thwarting his plan to "squeeze in a course here or there and finish things off in a year or two," he recalled. Twenty years later, after stints in state and county government, Walker won the governorship. And on Jan. 15, 2013, he used the "state of the state" speech to promote his efforts to help the University of Wisconsin System create a new online degree program for working adults seeking a less costly and faster way to finish off a degree. It’s a program Walker has said he eventually may use to complete his own degree. Walker attended Marquette for four years and would have needed to stay at least another year to get a degree, according to a letter his 2010 campaign released. Walker said in the speech his situation is far from unique, noting "nearly a quarter of all adults in this state have some college credit without a degree." Amid the debate over workforce development and retaining college graduates, is Wisconsin home to that many people who started but did not finish college? When asked for backup, Walker’s office pointed us to a 2011 policy brief by the private Indianapolis-based Lumina Foundation, which pushes nationally for an increase in the number of college graduates. Of Wisconsin residents aged 25 to 64, an estimated 22.8 percent reported having some college credits but no degree, according to the group. The report is dated January 2011 and uses 2008 U.S. Census Bureau data compiled annually from the American Community Survey. (As a point of comparison, the same year, 38 percent of Wisconsin adults in that age range held at least a two-year degree, the report found.) We confirmed the 22.8 percent figure using the Census Bureau’s "American Fact Finder" site. That’s the figure Walker described as "nearly a quarter." We checked for more recent numbers, from 2011, and got a very similar number: 22.5 percent. That’s as close to one-fifth as it is to Walker’s description of "nearly a quarter." But still within rounding range. The figure represents about 684,000 people reporting post-secondary credit but no college degree. Women slightly outnumbered men in the group. "College" includes technical schools. The Wisconsin numbers very closely mirror the situation in the United States as a whole. The Lumina analysis cited by Walker excludes adults under 25 and those over 64. That’s a bit at odds with Walker talking about nearly a quarter of "all adults." But two researchers we spoke with said it was reasonable to use that age range for the comparison being made. Many adults under 25 are going to school, so excluding them from the analysis makes sense, said Dale Knapp, research director at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. And if the governor views the program as a workforce development tool, it’s fair to analyze the situation using a figure that focuses on people under 65, said Noel Radomski, managing director of the Wisconsin Center for the Advancement of Postsecondary Education. The UW online program, which launches in fall 2013 at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, will be open to adults of any age, but the "target market" is clearly working-age adults who want and need a more convenient way to attain their degree, said UW System spokesman David Giroux. Another study we examined, "College Completion in Wisconsin: The Impact on the Workforce and The Economy," used the same age range as the Lumina report. The "College Completion" report found that Wisconsin was second in the nation in high school completion rates, but 36th in high school graduates going straight to college. Our rating Touting a new flexible online option for finishing college degrees, Walker said that "nearly a quarter of all adults in this state have some college credit without a degree." His cautiously worded estimate is in range, with the clarification that he meant adults under 65 and over 24. The number who have some credit is 22.5 percent in the most recent data; Walker cited a study that used 2008 data and put the number at 22.8 percent. We rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-11948	Says Winston Churchill said, "A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/09/colin-kaepernick/nfls-colin-kaepernick-incorrectly-credits-winston-/	Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick, apparently responding to a TV report he considered incorrect, tweeted a quote about lying that he attributed to British leader Winston Churchill. Like every good play in football, let’s set up our formation: During the 2016 season, Kaepernick knelt during the Star-Spangled Banner to protest racial inequality. He then opted out of his 49ers contract and has not been re-signed. Many people think Kaepernick has been blacklisted by the NFL for his protests. USA Today and ESPN then reported in March that Kaepernick would stand during the national anthem. The stories both used anonymous sources, because Kaepernick had not (and as of this writing, still has not) spoken publicly about whether he would continue his protests. On Oct. 8, 2017, CBS Sports reporter Jason La Canfora told The NFL Today host James Brown that Kaepernick wanted to play in the NFL again. Brown asked La Canfora, who said he had spoken to Kaepernick the night before, whether the quarterback would continue to kneel in protest. "He's not planning on kneeling," La Canfora answered. That garnered some attention in the sports world, but upon further review, La Canfora walked back his remarks. He clarified his answer via Twitter shortly after the broadcast, writing that that he had not actually asked Kaepernick about his protests. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com In an apparent response to La Canfora, Kaepernick tweeted the quote later that day. "A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on. Winston S. Churchill," he wrote. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com But we have to throw a flag on this one, because there’s no evidence that Churchill ever said it — although the British Bulldog does often get the credit. Tim Riley, director of the National Churchill Museum at Westminster College in Fulton, Mo., said Kaepernick is not the first to make this mistake. This and other misattributed Churchill quotes often spread online, he said. "The irony is that today such misattributed quotes circle the globe a thousand times before the truth even begins to think about putting on pants," Riley said. Churchill historian Richard Langworth found the saying traced back to President Franklin Roosevelt’s secretary of state, Cordell Hull, who wrote: "A lie will gallop halfway round the world before the truth has time to pull its breeches on." Langworth also noted Churchill would have said trousers, not breeches, so there’s that. But we’re still only partially dressed with that explanation. This quote has dozens of variations, stretching back quite some time. If we go to 1919, Mark Twain got credit for saying, "A lie can travel around the world and back again while the truth is lacing up its boots." (Samuel Clemens died in 1910, by the way.) Baptist preacher Charles Haddon Spurgeon allegedly used a version with boots in it back in 1855. The saying sometimes substitutes shoes. In 1840, it was credited to Thomas Jefferson. There’s an entire history of the saying on QuoteInvestigator.com, citing sources that attribute versions of it to all manner of outlets, from magazines to Chinese proverbs. The origins of the quote reach all the way back to the 18th century. One version is attributed to English clergyman Thomas Francklin. "Falsehood will fly, as it were, on the wings of the wind, and carry its tales to every corner of the earth; whilst truth lags behind; her steps, though sure, are slow and solemn," he wrote in a 1787 sermon. But Bonnie Taylor-Blake, a neuroscience researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and amateur etymologist, told PolitiFact that she and other word investigators found a probable origin with no mention of boots or pants. "Falsehood flies, and the truth comes limping after it," Jonathan Swift wrote in The Examiner in 1710. "I should note that it's possible, though maybe not terribly likely, that the metaphor wasn't entirely Swift's," Taylor-Blake said. "He may have adapted it from an earlier, now-unknown form, even a version not then in English." Our ruling Kaepernick credited Churchill for saying, "A lie gets halfway around the world before the truth has a chance to get its pants on." This is a quote that often is attributed to the British prime minister, but there’s no record of him saying it. But that’s a common mistake, experts told us. The line has grown and evolved — and then credited to different people — many times over hundreds of years, potentially starting with a version by Swift in 1710. This is a broken play by Kaepernick. We rate it False. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com	None	Colin Kaepernick	None	None	None	2017-10-09T17:21:07	2017-10-08	['None']
pomt-11180	"So far this year, more students have been killed in schools than soldiers in combat zones."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2018/may/21/gwen-graham/have-more-students-been-killed-schools-soldiers-co/	After a student gunman killed 10 people in Santa Fe, Texas, a claim circulated widely on social media that compared the number of deaths in the military with the number of deaths in school shootings. One of the politicians who shared it on social media was Gwen Graham, a former Democratic member of the U.S. House who is now running for governor of Florida. In a May 18 Facebook post, Graham wrote, "So far this year, more students have been killed in schools than soldiers in combat zones. We are WAY past the point of talking. We need action now." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Graham’s post linked to an article by Philip Bump of the Washington Post titled "2018 has been deadlier for schoolchildren than service members." The article found that "more people have been killed at schools this year than have been killed while serving in the military." We wanted to look at the data ourselves. Graham’s formulation was a bit narrower than the newspaper’s: Her post said "students" rather than individuals "at schools," and "in combat zones" rather than "while serving in the military." Either of the definitions is plausible; as it happens, Graham’s parameters make an even stronger case than the Post article does. Students killed in school shootings We found five shooting incidents that resulted in student fatalities in 2018. The figures below do not include adults slain in these incidents, because they are outside the scope of Graham’s statement. Benton, Ky., Jan. 23, 2018: 2 students killed Parkland, Fla., Feb. 14, 2018: 14 students killed Birmingham, Ala., March 7, 2018: 1 student killed Great Mills, Md., March 20, 2018: 1 student killed Santa Fe, Texas, May 18, 2018: 8 students killed Total: 26 students killed in school shootings through May 18, 2018. (Including the adults killed would raise the count to 31 total fatalities.) Members of the military killed in combat zones There are two active combat operations for the U.S. military: Operation Inherent Resolve, which includes anti-ISIS efforts in Iraq and Syria, and Operation Freedom’s Sentinel, which includes military activities in Afghanistan. In 2018, there have been five deadly incidents in Operation Inherent Resolve, on Jan. 8, Feb. 19, March 7, March 15, and March 30. Each of these incidents resulted in one American service member’s death, except for the one on March 15, in which seven airmen died in the crash of an HH-60 Pave Hawk helicopter in western Iraq. So the total number of deaths in 2018 for Operation Inherent Resolve is 11. Meanwhile, there have been two deaths this year in Operation Freedom’s Sentinel. They occurred on Jan. 1 and April 30. Total: 13 service members were killed in combat zones in 2018. That's half the number of student deaths in school shootings this year. Some caveats The first caveat to consider is that today’s snapshot in time is unusual in recent history. Specifically, the number of school-shooting deaths is unusually high in 2018, according to the Post’s database of school shootings. Through May 18 of 2017, there were two deaths in school shootings. Through May 18 of 2016, it was one; for 2015 it was zero; and for 2014 it was one. Looking at full-year totals, the Post article found that the number of military deaths in 2017 exceeded 30, compared to five school-shooting deaths. The second caveat to know involves the death rate — that is, deaths divided by the total population at risk of death. The death rate remains significantly higher for members of the military in combat zones. There are currently an estimated 50.8 million students enrolled in K-12 classes. That’s vastly larger than the combination of personnel serving in the two military operations cited above, which is less than 20,000 people, according to publicly disclosed data. The Post article that Graham linked to made this point. "The figures for 2018 do not suggest schools are more dangerous than combat zones," the article said. "So far in 2018, a member of the military has been about 40 times as likely to be killed as someone is to die in a school shooting." Our ruling Graham wrote, "So far this year, more students have been killed in schools than soldiers in combat zones." On the numbers, she is right. This year at least, within Graham’s stated parameters, exactly twice as many students have died in school shootings than military personnel have died in combat zones. It is important to know, however, the likelihood of being killed in a combat zone is still vastly higher than it is in a school. The statement is accurate but needs additional information. That meets our definition of Mostly True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Gwen Graham	None	None	None	2018-05-21T15:35:56	2018-05-18	['None']

pomt-14370	Senate Democrats "have never held up a Supreme Court nomination."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/20/harry-reid/harry-reid-says-unlike-gop-senate-democrats-never-/	NBC Meet the Press’ Chuck Todd said there’s a degree of hypocrisy to the Democrats’ assertion that the Republicans have a constitutional duty to have hearings and vote on President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee. Senate Republicans have declared that they will not even hold hearings on Obama’s pick, Merrick Garland, chief judge of the federal court of appeals for the D.C. Circuit. Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., has argued that Republicans’ behavior is a dereliction of the Senate’s constitutional duty to "advise and consent" the president on his nominee. But on Meet the Press, Todd presented Reid with a clip from 2005, in which Reid said, "Nowhere in that document (the Constitution) does it say the Senate has a duty to give presidential nominees a vote." Todd, who also asked Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to explain his own clash with past positions, asked Reid what changed. "You have to look at what has happened," Reid replied. "We have never held up a Supreme Court nomination. Since 1900 in a lame-duck session, there have been six that have all been approved." Reid’s claim that the Democrats "have never held up a Supreme Court nomination" gave Todd and us pause, so we decided to put it on the Truth-O-Meter. Reid has a point that the degree of opposition to Garland is unprecedented, but Democrats have offered their fair share of strong opposition to Republican presidents’ nominees in recent history. They started it! Since the 1960s, the Senate has held a hearing for nearly every Supreme Court nominee, the exception being Harriet Miers, a 2005 George W. Bush nominee who faced opposition from Democrats and Republicans alike. So when McConnell vowed, within hours of Justice Antonin Scalia’s death, not to even consider the yet-to-be-named replacement, it was an unprecedented degree of opposition. And, no, there’s no tradition of not nominating a justice during a presidential election year. It’s generally accepted, though, that the modern political battle over Supreme Court seats started with Democratic opposition to Robert Bork, a Ronald Reagan nominee, in 1987, Reid's first year in the Senate. Democrats launched a massive public assault on Bork’s conservative judicial philosophy and record. Bork did face a hearing and a Senate vote, which he lost, but his confirmation process made the rules of the game more contentious. "The rules have been changed for the battle over this particular seat on the court," an internal Reagan administration memo read, according to Roll Call. "Maybe they have been changed for all time. We must convince the nomination handlers that the opposition has invented the tank, and we have to get out of the trenches and take the offensive." More recently, several Senate Democrats — including Reid and then-Sen. Obama — attempted a filibuster against conservative Bush nominee Samuel Alito. The filibuster, though, was largely symbolic, as not enough senators participated to actually delay or block the vote, which resulted in Alito’s confirmation. Reid spokesman Adam Jentleson said comparing Democratic opposition to Republican nominees with the current Republican tactics amounted to a false equivalence. Referring to the Alito filibuster, Jentleson said, "No lay person could possibly consider this to be on the same planet as what Republicans are doing to Garland." In his interview with Reid, Todd mentioned Democratic opposition to Bush nominee Miguel Estrada, who was up for a position on the federal appeals court for the D.C. Circuit. In 2005, Senate Democrats garnered enough votes to block Estrada's confirmation. Because Estrada was up for a federal appeals judge position, not one on the Supreme Court, this incident doesn't affect this fact-check. Before we rule, we wanted to note a slight error in the second part of Reid’s statement that "since 1900 in a lame-duck session, there have been six (nominees) that have all been approved." We have found in a previous fact-check that since the early 1900s, there have been six Supreme Court nominees in election years, and all were confirmed. However, only one was clearly a "lame-duck" nominee, meaning the president making the nomination was no question on the way out (Reagan). The others were nominated by presidents running for re-election to serve another term (Herbert Hoover, William Howard Taft, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson, who nominated two people in 1916). Our ruling Reid said Senate Democrats "have never held up a Supreme Court nomination." Reid steps a little too far in saying Democrats "have never held up" a nomination. They were chiefly responsible for Bork’s failed nomination, a turning point in the political nature of Supreme Court nominations, and they at least symbolically attempted to hold up Alito’s confirmation in 2005. However, we can't find a time when a Democratic Senate refused to hear a Republican president's nominee. Even if they were opposed, they allowed the nominee to come to a comfirmation vote. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Harry Reid	None	None	None	2016-03-20T17:42:27	2016-03-20	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-05559	"We were the No. 1 job creator in America in February and we are now the No. 4 job creator in the last year."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/apr/05/john-kasich/john-kasich-says-ohio-led-all-states-job-creation-/	John Kasich ran for governor using job creation as a stick to beat incumbent Ted Strickland. Since taking office, Kasich has used the issue as a yardstick measuring Ohio's progress -- often on Fox News, where he once hosted his own show and remains a regular presence. In his most recent interview, on April 2 with anchor Neil Cavuto, the governor proclaimed his best news yet: "We were the No. 1 job creator in America in February, and we are now the No. 4 job creator in the last year." That followed a loss of 400,000 jobs over the previous four years, he said. When the governor speaks, PolitiFact Ohio listens -- and checks. In previous ratings, going back to the 2010 campaign, we found that the 400,000 number was correct -- but that it was inaccurate to put all the blame for Ohio's economic woes on Strickland. Last August, Kasich took credit for his administration creating an increase of 45,000 jobs since the beginning of the year. The number was accurate, but we rated that claim as Mostly False for the part of the statement where the governor said "we’ve created" the jobs. But the governor earned a rating of Mostly True in January when he said Ohio ranked 8th in the nation in job creation. Now we asked Kasich's spokesman, Rob Nichols, his basis for saying Ohio was number one in job creation in February and number four over the previous year. He pointed to employment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and to the news release issued by the bureau when it posted new numbers on March 30 . "In February," says the BLS release, "nonfarm payroll employment increased in 42 states and the District of Columbia and decreased in 8 states. The largest over-the-month increase in employment occurred in Ohio (up 28,300), followed by Texas and New York." The Ohio figure was the nation's "largest statistically significant" job gain, BLS said. (In terms of percentage increase in employment, the second category used by BLS, North Dakota ranked first, up 1.3 percent. But raw numbers have been the metric used consistently by the Kasich administration and the Kasich campaign before that.) The BLS release also lists the states that had "statistically significant employment changes from February 2011 to February 2012." The biggest gainer was Texas, which added 273,900 jobs, followed by New York and California. No. 4, adding 73,500 jobs, was Ohio. So Kasich’s figures are accurate. And, putting them in context, he did not overreach when Cavuto asked if credit due to governor might be taken by President Obama. "When economies get better, executives get credit for it," Kasich said. "The fact is, does he benefit to some degree in Ohio from that? There`s no question that he does. Do I? Yes. Are we responsible for it? From our perspective out here, we have just taken on a lot of tough problems and created a better environment." That part could be classified as political rhetoric, and we’re not rating it. But Kasich’s statement about job creation rates is True.

pomt-13270	"If you look worldwide, the number of terrorist incidents have not substantially increased."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/13/barack-obama/obama-says-terrorism-worldwide-has-not-increased-s/	President Barack Obama spoke with veterans and active military members at a CNN town hall, discussing extended wait periods at VA hospitals and and the threat of terrorism. A major serving in the West Virginia Air National Guard asked Obama if the United States is doing anything greater to combat Islamic jihadists. He prefaced his question by saying that since Obama took office in 2009, "there has been a substantial increase in terror attacks around the world" and in the United States. Obama contradicted the premise of the question, though. "It's important to recognize that if you look worldwide, the number of terrorist incidents have not substantially increased," Obama said. "What we've seen are some very high-profile attacks, mostly in the Middle East, also in our European theaters." Obama said the emergence of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, also called ISIS) underscored "that the ideology of hatred and killing had metastasized" even after the killing of Osama bin Laden and the dismantling of al-Qaida. He also said military efforts, intelligence work and other improvements had made large-scale terrorist attacks more difficult. Obama said there had not been a "substantial" increase in terrorism. Even though there’s no hard number to measure that against, we decided to look into it. Obama’s numbers, and a caveat When we asked, the White House referred us to data from the State Department’s counterterrorism bureau. Terrorism is defined as "premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents." Looking at Obama’s time in office, worldwide terror attacks increased about 7 percent, from 10,999 in 2009 to 11,774 attacks in 2015. That’s an increase, not a decrease, but in recent years the numbers have been declining. In 2015, the total number of terrorist attacks decreased by 13 percent compared with 2014. Deaths due to terrorist attacks also decreased in 2015 compared to 2014, by 14 percent, according to the State Department figures. "This was largely due to fewer attacks and deaths in Iraq, Pakistan, and Nigeria," the report said. "This represents the first decline in total terrorist attacks and deaths worldwide since 2012." It’s problematic, though, to compare years between 2009 and 2015, because in 2012 the State Department changed the way it collected data about terrorist attacks. In 2012, the State Department began using data from the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, or START, from the University of Maryland. While the old count and the new count used similar methods -- data from open source information such as TV reports, specialized journals and think tank studies -- they are not exactly the same. The State Department said that due to the collection change, the data is "not directly comparable." ‘Conservative filter’ Erin Miller, who manages START’s Global Terrorism Database, says the numbers it provides the department amount to "a conservative filter" on the broader definition used in START’s own database. Totals presented by the State Department don’t include attacks targeting people in combat. They also exclude incidents in which there are mixed reports or vagueness. START’s overall count of global terrorism attacks in 2015 is at least 3,000 more than the State Department’s 2015 figure, because it includes some combat deaths and less definitive incidents. By START’s measure, there was a 214 percent increase in terrorist attacks from 2009 to 2015. Joseph Young, an associate professor in the School of Public Affairs and School of International Service at American University, said it is tough to make claims about trends in terrorism since 2009. Obama’s statement is one possible interpretation of the data. There have been small increases and decreases in attacks over recent years, shifts in targeted locations, more suicide attacks and a small decline of other terror actions, Young said. "(Obama’s) statement is consistent with a range of outcomes," Young said. START and State Department data both show there were fewer attacks in 2015 than in 2014. More than 55 percent of all terrorist attacks in 2015 happened in five countries — Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India and Nigeria, according to State Department data. The department also reported 382 terrorist attacks in Syria in 2015 (up from 232 in 2014), but says they are conservative estimates given limitations of media coverage in that country. On top of attacks and fatalities rising, terrorist arrests are also up, noted Max Abrahms, a political science assistant professor at Northeastern University. A December 2015 report from the Program on Extremism at George Washington University said 56 individuals were arrested in 2015 in the United States for ISIS-related activities, "the largest number of terrorism arrests in a single year since September 2001." Brent Smith, director of the Terrorism Research Center at the University of Arkansas, said there are attacks, like the one in San Bernardino, Calif., last year, where there were no arrests because the perpetrators were killed in the incident. Our ruling Obama said, "If you look worldwide, the number of terrorist incidents have not substantially increased." There is no universally accepted definition of a terrorist incident, so there is no universally accepted count. Based on State Department data, there’s been a 7 percent increase in terrorist attacks worldwide from 2009 to 2015. But the State Department’s criteria for what can be counted as a terrorist attack is stricter than that of other databases. According to START’s Global Terrorism Database, for instance, there was a 214 percent rise in terrorist attacks from 2009 to 2015, a substantial increase. Obama’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0174e372-7a3e-45be-b61e-724cad9e0ab5	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2016-10-13T16:43:53	2016-09-28	['None']
pomt-14415	"I opposed TPP (Trans-Pacific Partnership) and have always opposed TPP."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/10/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-i-always-opposed-tpp-trans-pacific-partne/	Trade has become a dividing line in the Republican Party. While traditionally the GOP has been a vocal supporter of reducing trade barriers between the United States and its trading partners, the cost of trade deals on American jobs has led to outright opposition to the largest treaty now on the table, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. CNN moderator Jake Tapper asked Texas Sen. Ted Cruz to explain why he shifted from supporting the TPP to opposing it in the March 10 debate in Miami. Cruz was quick to say that the question contained an error. "There are two different agreements," Cruz said. "There’s TPA (Trade Promotion Authority), and TPP. I opposed TPP, and have always opposed TPP, which is what you asked about." Cruz was talking about two separate pieces of legislation that are linked, but indeed are separate. Before we untangle them, we will assess Cruz’s statement that he has always opposed the TPP. In a June 2015 post on his campaign website, Cruz’s staff said that he was taking a wait-and-see approach to the TPP. "Sen. Cruz has not taken a position either in favor or against TPP," the statement said. "He will wait until the agreement is finalized and he has a chance to study it carefully to ensure that the agreement will open more markets to American-made products, create jobs, and grow our economy." When the treaty language was released in early November 2015, Cruz’s stance hardened. At an event in Iowa on Nov. 20, 2015, Cruz said he would not support it. "There are a number of Republicans on that (debate) stage who support TPP, who support (the Trade Promotion Authority)," Cruz said. "I voted against TPA, and I intend to vote against TPP." That statement again blends Trade Promotion Authority with the TPP, but the key point is that Cruz said he opposed the trade deal. A shifting stance on Trade Promotion Authority Trade Promotion Authority is legislation that allows the president to negotiate a trade treaty with only an up-or-down vote on the final package in the Senate. The TPA was a key precursor to passage of the TPP. Cruz initially voted in favor of the TPA bill in the Senate. In fact, in anticipation of that vote, Cruz joined with current House Speaker Paul Ryan to publicly urge Congress to vote in favor of fast-track authority. Of particular importance to this fact-check, the opening lines of the op-ed the two published in the Wall Street Journal spoke of the promise of trade and described the TPP, while not actually using the name of the treaty itself. "The United States is making headway on two historic trade agreements, one with 11 countries on the Pacific Rim and another with America’s friends in Europe," Cruz and Ryan wrote. "These two agreements alone would mean greater access to a billion customers for American manufacturers, farmers and ranchers." The op-ed urged passage of Trade Promotion Authority, but the linkage to the TPP was the starting point. Trade promotion passed in the Senate. Following the Senate vote, the bill went to the House where it was split into two separate votes: one on TPA and the other on Trade Adjustment Assistance, or TAA (a program that provides training support, career counseling, allowances and wage supplements to workers affected by globalization and trade). On June 12, fast-track passed, but Trade Adjustment Assistance was voted down. In a procedural vote on June 23, the Senate passed the fast-track legislation once again, 60-38. But this time Cruz cast a "nay" vote. Cruz explained that he had learned new details of the TPA that smacked of a backroom deal and he would have no part of it. Our ruling Cruz said he has always opposed the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The record shows that he took no position on the treaty itself until the full text became public. Then he said he opposed it. However, when Cruz first supported granting the president the key authority to finalize the TPP, he spoke positively about the concept of the trade deal. He described how it could bring millions of customers to American business owners. When the treaty moved from being a concept to actual text, Cruz opposed it. His statement glosses over his initial backing of the idea of the trade treaty. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Ted Cruz	None	None	None	2016-03-10T22:50:50	2016-03-10	['None']

pomt-10928	Says "political interference" from Scott Walker’s administration has led to "gagging (DNR) scientists so they can no longer comment on proposed legislation" and "we’re letting polluters write their own permits."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jul/27/kelda-helen-roys/governor-hopeful-kelda-roys-says-walker-administra/	Republican Gov. Scott Walker has made headlines for years with his initiatives to ease regulatory burdens in the state after declaring during his Jan 3, 2011, inaugural address that "Wisconsin is open for business." But has the Walker administration gone so far as to prevent Department of Natural Resources scientists from commenting on proposed legislation, and letting corporations draft their own permits? That was the claim from former state Rep. Kelda Roys, one of eight Democrats hoping to face Walker in the November 2018 election. In a May 2, 2018, interview with journalist Steve Walters of WisconsinEye, Roys claimed "political interference" from Walker’s administration has led to "gagging (DNR) scientists so they can no longer comment on proposed legislation." And, "We're letting polluters write their own permits." Let’s take a look at both parts of Roys’ claim. The changing role of DNR in legislation When asked for backup on the "gagging" part of the claim, the Roys campaign provided three news articles. Two (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel and Isthmus) reported a case in which DNR testimony was absent from a legislative hearing regarding chronic wasting disease and the baiting/feeding of white-tailed deer. The other, from Scientific American, carried this headline: "How Scott Walker dismantled Wisconsin's environmental legacy." In the March 23, 2017, Isthmus article, DNR Deputy Secretary Kurt Thiede is quoted as saying: "The department does not take positions for or against legislation. When requested, the department appears at the public hearing for informational purposes when requested by either a committee chairman or a bill’s primary author. This has been administration policy since 2011." When asked to comment, the Walker campaign referred us to the Republican Party of Wisconsin, which cited numerous instances where the department was asked to testify -- for information only -- at legislative hearings during Walker’s administration: Assembly Bills 160, 203, and 668, and Senate Bills 228 and 368 among them. DNR communications director Jim Dick said since February 15, 2017, DNR staff have given informational testimony on 30 different topics during legislative hearings, met with legislators and/or their staff about once a week, and have fielded about 40 calls or emails a week to answer questions from lawmakers on various topics. "In a three-year period (2014-2017)," said Dick, "we received and responded to more than 6,000 legislative inquiries. DNR staff does communicate with legislators and legislative staff frequently. But it is not our role to offer our opinion on whether a particular piece of legislation is right or wrong, good or bad." Still, the policy marks a change from the pre-Walker era. Tom Hauge, who retired in 2016 after serving 25 years as wildlife director for the department, said staffers had more latitude in the past. At any and every relevant hearing, he said, experts from the department would testify alongside the department’s legislative liaison, taking a stand on whether the agency supported, opposed, or was neutral toward the proposed legislation. If they found that the legislation would have negative impact — "I don’t just mean trivial," he added — they would take an official position in opposition at the hearings. Shifting DNR’s role to an invite-only, information-only basis hasn’t necessarily reduced its participation in legislative hearings, as the earlier numbers show. But there’s no guarantee that they will be asked to attend. For instance, the DNR was noticeably uninvited to the March 2017 hearing on Assembly Bill 61 which would lighten rules that prohibit baiting/feeding deer in counties with documented chronic wasting disease. Hauge, then retired, attended as a private citizen; reports said he fielded questions from interested lawmakers for nearly half an hour after giving his testimony. So, DNR staffers have not been "gagged," in that they continue to testify at hearings and provide information to lawmakers. But under Walker administration policy they cannot go beyond "providing information" in their statements and can’t even do that unless explicitly invited. The role of permitted entities in their own permitting On the issue of "polluters writing their own permits," the Roys campaign sent two Wisconsin State Journal articles, but only one was on point. And in that article, the DNR explicitly denied accusations that "polluters" (in this case, dairy producers) will be allowed to write their own permits under Walker-administration initiatives aimed at moving the burden of permit-related paperwork to credentialed contractors. After our own digging, we found that desires to "streamline" permitting were among many changes included in DNR’s "strategic alignment plan," which was announced in November 2016 by then-DNR secretary Cathy Stepp. A Nov 30, 2016, article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel covered the announcement, saying: "The DNR will develop a program to turn over some time-consuming tasks of permit writing to experts in the private sector who are hired by a property owner or business seeking the permit. The agency plans to set benchmarks so that officials reviewing the permits can be assured that information they get from the consultants is accurate." The article also said: "The DNR will still write final permits, but will develop so-called ‘assurance programs’ so they can rely more on the accuracy of information provided by private parties. The new approach on permits is part of a series of organizational changes officials say will make the agency more efficient at a time when its workforce has shrunk to a 30-year low." Did these plans become a reality? Changes to wetland permits were the first major change under Walker, with the introduction of the "assured delineator" program. This initiative encourages project planners to hire consultants to mark wetlands for which construction would be prohibited or require mitigation, prior to applying for a permit. Dick, the department spokesman, told us the DNR announced plans in 2016 for similar "assurance programs" that would allow large dairy producers to hire private contractors to work on their pollution permit applications. But, he noted, the program hasn’t been implemented yet. And the DNR is now in discussions about moving the entire program to the Department of Agriculture, Trade, and Consumer Protection, so "the plan is not likely to be implemented anytime soon, if at all." Sarah Geers, staff attorney for Midwest Environmental Advocates, works to watchdog DNR’s implementation and enforcement of environmental laws. Her take on permitting matched Dick’s. So, various changes were proposed that would have allowed permit applicants to hire contractors to complete major parts of the permit applications. But saying the plan allows polluters to write their own permits goes too far -- especially since the programs have not been implemented. Our rating Roys said "political interference" from Scott Walker’s administration has led to "gagging (DNR) scientists so they can no longer comment on proposed legislation" and "we’re letting polluters write their own permits." As for the Walker administration, DNR scientists are permitted to share their expertise regarding proposed legislation -- without declaring a position or commenting on the legislation itself -- by invitation only. The evidence suggests this still happens frequently, though pre-Walker staffers had more latitude in what they could say. As for the second half of Roys’ statement, Walker has taken steps to change permit-writing processes so that businesses are more involved (and DNR officials less involved). But the plans have not come to fruition, and even if they did, responsibility would shift to "assured contractors" and would not occur in-house with those Roys labeled the "polluters."

pomt-10262	As a state senator in Illinois, Obama made sure women got equal pay for equal work.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/26/michelle-obama/obama-was-there-for-equal-pay-but-not-alone/	The Obama campaign continues trying to bolster its case among female voters, trying to show his record on women's issues. The candidate's wife took up the task during her convention speech, lauding Barack Obama's work in the Illinois state Senate, where she said he was busy "moving people from welfare to jobs, passing tax cuts for hard-working families, and making sure women get equal pay for equal work." We looked into the welfare to work claim here, and we examined the tax cut claim here. In this story, we're looking at the final element in Michelle Obama's three-point claim, that what her husband did in the state legislature included "making sure women get equal pay for equal work." In 2003, the Illinois General Assembly passed a law that gave workers more protection from gender-based pay discrimination than federal law provides. The Illinois law applies to employers with four or more employees, instead of the 15-worker threshold in federal law, allowing more workers to file complaints. Obama was not the lead sponsor of the bill in the state Senate, but he did co-sponsor it on the day it was introduced. The lead sponsor, Carol Ronen, said Obama was "instrumental" and played a "significant role" in crafting the bill. Ronen, who has also left the state Senate, is a Democratic superdelegate. The bill passed the Senate easily, on a 53-2 vote, with one member voting present. Obama attended the Mother's Day bill signing with his daughters, said Melissa Josephs, who was also there. Josephs is director of equal opportunity policy at Women Employed, a Chicago-based not-for-profit group that supported the bill. The bill gave equal-pay protection to an estimated 330,000 additional workers, including some state employees that were not covered under federal law, Josephs said. Since it became law, the state has investigated more than 300 cases, and workers have received more than $91,000 in back pay. Let's come back to Michelle Obama's statement. Did Barack Obama make sure women get equal pay for equal work? Well, sort of. It's always difficult to judge the contribution of any single lawmaker in passage of an individual piece of legislation, and we recognize that the person best situated to answer that question here is currently supporting Obama's presidential campaign. Still, there are enough details to reach a reasonable conclusion. Obama was an early co-sponsor of the legislation, and his appearance for the bill signing supports the contention that he considered it a priority. Obama helped pass a law that expanded equal-pay protections, though that doesn't necessarily guarantee equal pay. Although he wasn't the architect of the policy, he was more than a bit player. Michelle Obama's statement is Mostly True.	None	Michelle Obama	None	None	None	2008-08-26T00:00:00	2008-08-25	['Illinois', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-00532	"This March, for the first time in human history, the monthly average carbon dioxide in our atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million. The range had been 170-300 parts per million for hundreds of thousands of years."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2015/jun/21/sheldon-whitehouse/sen-whitehouse-gets-it-right-co2-air-historic-leve/	Sheldon Whitehouse gave his 100th speech on climate change on the floor of the U.S. Senate on May 18, 2015. Over the past three years, the senator has served up several climate claims worth checking during his running series "Time to wake up." So we examined his 100th installment and noticed this statement: "This March, for the first time in human history, the monthly average carbon dioxide in our atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million. The range had been 170-300 parts per million for hundreds of thousands of years." Scientists, who see climate change as Whitehouse does, say the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the earth’s atmosphere is increasing due, in large part, to the burning of fossil fuels. And they say rising CO2 levels are an indicator that humans are degrading the health of the planet. We went looking for evidence and quickly found a report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that seemed right on target. On May 6, NOAA announced that the monthly global average of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had exceeded 400 parts per million — for the first time since it had been compiling the data in 1979. This seemed to leave only the "human history" part of Whitehouse’s claim in question. But when Whitehouse addressed the issue May 18, he did not specify his source. And, confusingly, he spoke of a "monthly average" not a "monthly global average," the term used by NOAA. The distinction is relevant: While the NOAA monthly global average had never exceeded 400 over a period of more than 35 years, the agency’s scientists had previously measured monthly average carbon dioxide levels exceeding 400 ppm in several single locations. In 2012, for example, the "monthly average" at the NOAA observatory in Barrow, Alaska, exceeded 400 ppm for the first time. Then the agency’s observatory in Mauna Loa, Hawaii, reported that its "monthly average" CO2 level had exceeded 400 parts per million in April 2014. These earlier records, which were reported extensively, were based on observations from single locations while the NOAA monthly global average is based on data from 40 different sites. So Whitehouse seems to have been off a bit with his description of the monthly CO2 data. But what about human history? The senator’s spokesman, Seth Larson, referred us to ice-core data from Antarctica. Scientists take core samples in Greenland and Antarctica and study the CO2 level of air bubbles — some of which have been trapped in the ice for hundreds of thousands of years. Data from Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, which serves as the primary climate-change data hub of the U.S Department of Energy, show carbon dioxide concentrations ranging between 170 and 300 parts per million "over the last 800,000 years." That more than covers Whitehouse’s in-human-history claim as humans have only been around for about 200,000, according to the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. Before we closed the book on this one, we contacted Anthony Watts, an often-quoted global-warming skeptic. Watts claimed Whitehouse was wrong and cited the individual monthly data and a 2005 article in Nature that he said challenged the senator’s statement. We tracked down the lead author of the Nature, Swedish scientist Anders Moberg, and asked him about the Watts challenge. Impossible, Moberg said, explaining that his study was about temperatures in 1100 AD to 1150 AD — not carbon dioxide. For CO2 data, Moberg and John King, an oceanography professor at URI, pointed us to the ice-core research, the same data cited by Whitehouse’s office. The ice core records "would support the Senator's statement," said King. "The highest natural levels are around 300 ppm." Our ruling In his 100th speech on global warming on May 18, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said: "This March, for the first time in human history, the monthly average carbon dioxide in our atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million. The range had been 170-300 parts per million for hundreds of thousands of years." He probably could have been more precise if he had used the phrase "global average," because there have been times when the monthly average exceed 400 parts per million at observation sites in Alaska and Hawaii. Beyond that small point, Whitehouse and his staff were on solid ground. For that reason, we rate his statement True.

pomt-14295	Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland "voted to uphold" D.C.’s ban on handguns.	false	/virginia/statements/2016/apr/04/john-whitbeck/john-whitbeck-misfires-merrick-garlands-gun-record/	Gun rights are "hanging by a thread," Republican Party of Virginia chairman John Whitbeck wrote recently in an email urging the rejection of U.S. Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland. "When Justice Antonin Scalia wrote his watershed opinion in D.C. v. Heller, it marked the first time that an individual right to keep and bear arms was recognized by the Supreme Court by a razor thin 5-4 vote," Whitbeck wrote. "Now President (Barack) Obama is attempting to replace Justice Scalia with Judge Merrick Garland, an avowed opponent of our Second Amendment rights. While Justice Scalia voted to overturn D.C.’s draconian gun laws, Judge Garland voted to uphold them," the chairman added, emphasizing the second sentence with bold type. Whitbeck concluded his email by asking Republicans to sign an Internet petition telling Virginia’s U.S. senators - Democrats Mark Warner and Tim Kaine - that Merrick "must not be confirmed to the Supreme Court!" Scalia, who died Feb. 13, did write the majority opinion in the Supreme Court’s landmark 2008 ruling on District of Columbia vs. Heller. By a 5-4 vote, the high court found that Washington’s gun regulations - essentially amounting to a ban on handguns in the home - were unconstitutional. This Truth-O-Meter will focus on Whitbeck’s claim that Garland, who has been a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since 1997, "voted to uphold" the handgun ban. A number of conservative organizations and individuals, including Fox News commentator Bill O’Reilly, have made similar statements. The D.C. law The Supreme Court’s decision in Heller was significant because it was the first time justices ruled that the Second Amendment guarantees an individual’s right to own a firearm for self-defense. Until Heller, the widespread understanding was that the right to bear arms did not necessarily extend beyond militia service. Before the case went to the Supreme Court, though, it was heard in the federal appeals court where Garland serves. In a 2-1 decision, a panel of D.C. appeals judges came to the same conclusion as the Supreme Court: The Washington handgun ban was unconstitutional. Based on Whitbeck’s claim, one might assume that the single dissenting vote in this D.C. Circuit opinion belonged to Garland. However, it was Judge Karen Henderson who dissented, while Judges Laurence Silberman and Thomas Griffith signed the majority opinion. Garland didn’t vote on the case at all. He was not part of the three-judge panel that heard it. After the D.C. Circuit handed down its 2007 decision, the city of Washington asked the court to rehear the case en banc, meaning all of the court’s judges would reconsider the case and not just the three-judge panel. The court ended up denying the city’s petition, but Garland was among the group of D.C. Circuit judges who voted to rehear the case. It’s misleading to say Garland supported the Washington gun regulations because he wanted to reconsider Heller, as he did not take a formal position on the merits of the case. Rehearing a case en banc is generally used when a case goes against precedent or presents a question of significant importance, and that was true of the Heller case. D.C. Circuit Judge A. Raymond Randolph, a well-known conservative, joined Garland in voting to reconsider the case. And the George W. Bush administration, though supportive of the notion that the Second Amendment protects individual gun rights, filed an amicus brief asking the Supreme Court to send Heller back to the lower court for broader definition - for example, what type of gun-ownership restrictions should remain constitutional. "Garland voted for his court to consider the constitutionality of D.C.'s law," Adam Winkler, a Second Amendment law expert at the University of California Los Angeles Law School, recently told PolitiFact National when it was fact-checking a statement by O’Reilly. "Such a vote does not tell us one way or another how Garland feels about the Second Amendment." Our ruling Whitbeck said Garland "voted to uphold" D.C.’s ban on handguns. Garland never heard the case about Washington’s gun law from the bench. It was ruled unconstitutional by a panel of three other judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, where Garland serves. Garland voted in favor of having the full court reconsider the case en banc - not an unusual step when a major decision bucks precedent. Randolph, a conservative judge on the appeals court who didn’t sit on the three-member panel, also voted to have the decision reconsidered en banc. It’s simply inaccurate to say Garland’s vote to reconsider the case is tantamount to a vote to uphold D.C.’s gun restriction or to extrapolate from it the nominee’s position on the case.

pomt-02819	"American voters remain steadfast in their support for immigration reform with a path to citizenship, with more than 70 percent who want to see reform passed this year."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2013/nov/25/causa-oregon/do-more-70-percent-american-voters-support-pathway/	Few issues are more likely to ignite roaring political arguments these days than immigration. Finding common ground on this hot-button topic isn’t easy, as witnessed now in Washington, D.C., where Congress could adjourn for the year without reaching agreement on immigration reform that members of both parties insist is critical. But while some say the real focus should be on increased border security and not rewarding those who enter the country illegally, others counter that guest-worker programs and the needs of the estimated 11 million people living in the U.S. illegally should be paramount. In this atmosphere of division, a recent claim by Andrea Miller, executive director of Causa Oregon, caught our attention. In a Nov. 14, 2013, news release criticizing House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, for his refusal to take up an immigration bill passed by the Senate, she said, "American voters remain steadfast in their support for immigration reform with a path to citizenship, with more than 70 percent who want to see reform passed this year." Given the controversy hanging over every aspect of immigration, are more than seven in 10 Americans really in favor of reforms that include providing "a path to citizenship?" PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. We emailed Causa Oregon, a Salem-based immigration rights organization, and asked where it got the 70 percent figure. Erik Sorenson, the group’s communications director, said that "several polls" contain that finding. He specifically mentioned a recent Gallup poll. We checked and found some information supporting Miller’s assertion. In a Gallup poll conducted in June 2012, for instance, 66 percent of respondents said immigration is "a good thing" for the country. That was up up from 59 percent last year and one percentage point off the high of 67 percent in 2006, according to the poll. The response was even more favorable in a Gallup poll conducted in June. Fully 87 percent of respondents said they favored allowing "illegal immigrants living in the U.S. the opportunity to become citizens after a long waiting period if they paid taxes and a penalty, pass a criminal background check, and learn English." As Sorenson indicated, a number of other polls around the country have revealed strong support when respondents were asked if they support reform that would allow immigrants living in the U.S. illegally to remain here legally and, further, to apply for citizenship. An Associated Press GfK poll conducted in January, for instance, found that more than six in 10 Americans favored allowing illegal immigrants to eventually become U.S. citizens. A CBS News poll last month showed 77 percent of respondents willing to embrace that option. Miller’s claim was looking plausible but we called the Center for Immigration Studies in Washington, D.C., to get another perspective. Steven A. Camarota, the nonpartisan group’s research director, said, in essence, not so fast. "It all depends on what you ask," he said. "As with all polls, how you phrase the questions matters enormously." Camarota said he was familiar with the poll results Causa Oregon cited, but he passed along a couple of other recent polls that produced dramatically different results. The primary difference from one to another, he said, was the wording. An Ipsos poll conducted in February for Thompson Reuters, for instance, asked bluntly, "When you think about immigration, which of the following solutions comes closest to your opinion?" Only 5 percent of respondents answered yes to "All illegal immigrants should be able to stay in the U.S., with some exceptions." Another 31 percent said "most" should be able to remain here. However, a combined 53 percent said most or all illegal immigrants should be deported. Camarota said similar reversals in results came when pollsters subbed in the word "amnesty" for the phrase "pathway to citizenship." Yet another poll, conducted in August by NBC News/Esquire, asked respondents if they supported "providing illegal immigrants with a path to citizenship even though they have broken the rules." Only 16 percent answered yes. "If you remind people that illegal immigrants broke the rules," Camarota said, "they pull back quickly. It suggests the support may be tissue-paper thin." All of the polls we looked at, including those mentioned by Causa Oregon, were conducted by reputable, professional polling organizations and had error margins no greater than plus or minus three percentage points. The combined results of those polls, not unlike the controversy surrounding proposed immigration reform, were all over the map. So do seven in 10 Americans support letting illegal immigrants remain in the U.S. with an added bonus of a pathway to citizenship? Apparently so, according to several polls -- but only if you don’t remind respondents that someone "broke the rules" coming here in the first place. Adding that phrase, according to other polls, yielded a far different answer. We rate Causa Oregon’s claim Half True.	None	Causa Oregon	None	None	None	2013-11-25T15:58:04	2013-11-14	['United_States']
pomt-07326	Says Rick Perry "turned down our invitation to meet" President Barack Obama in El Paso.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2011/may/13/jay-carney/president-obamas-press-secretary-says-rick-perry-d/	Asked why President Barack Obama didn’t meet with Texas Gov. Rick Perry during his one-day trip to Texas, White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters Tuesday: "Gov. Perry turned down our invitation to meet the president at the airport." Obama spokesman Adam Abrams later told us that Carney was referring to the airport in El Paso, where Obama ventured before flying to Austin for political fundraisers. According to a White House transcript, when a reporter suggested Perry "wanted a more substantial meeting" and didn’t want to travel across the state "to discuss the wildfires and border security and all that," Carney replied: "Again, we invited him to meet with the president, and he declined the invitation." Did Perry refuse to greet Obama in El Paso? Rewind: In August, the GOP governor experienced a 34-second handshake of a conversation with the Democratic president at Austin’s airport during which he attempted to hand him a letter urging closer attention to security along the U.S.-Mexico border. The letter was accepted by a White House adviser. In an interview, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed confirmed that on Tuesday, the governor declined an offer from the White House to greet the president in El Paso. "It would have been a 10-minute greeting," she said. However, Nashed said, "we did ask them if we could meet and greet the president later in Austin or if the president would be interested in" taking a flying tour of wildfires that have hurt rural Texas. "Unfortunately, we couldn’t arrange anything," Nashed said. Separately, Perry spokesman Mark Miner was quoted in the Austin American-Statesman’s Postcards blog as saying Perry "wanted to meet with the president to discuss the wildfires and border security, not just shake his hand in a receiving line on a tarmac." We asked how the governor passed the hours he could have spent journeying to and from El Paso, about 575 miles from Austin. Nashed, forwarding Perry's state schedule for that day, said he joined Jay Kimbrough, his former chief of staff and a favorite troubleshooter, in marking the anniversary of the severe wound Kimbrough endured as a Marine machine gunner in Vietnam in 1967. The two lunched in East Texas, she said, and joined a motorcycle ride to a veterans museum in Huntsville. On May 12, as noted by the Dallas Morning News, Perry told interviewer Laura Ingraham that he didn't have time to fly to El Paso for a handshake. The newspaper said Perry told Ingraham, "If he wanted to meet, I was in Austin. I would have been here." The White House did not comment on Perry’s professed offer to meet in Austin, though emails between Perry's office and the White House confirm that Perry was invited to greet the president in El Paso and that a gubernatorial aide asked if it was "an option" for Perry to greet Obama in Austin "since we are here." A White House aide replied: "Unfortunately there won't be a tarmac greet in Austin." PolitiFact Texas obtained the emails through an open-records request. Our call? Perry declined to howdy the president in El Paso. However, Carney’s response implies Perry flat refused to meet when an alternative meeting prospect was floated.

pomt-11812	BREAKING: Rosa Parks’ Granddaughter SLAMS Racist Democrats, Endorses Trump	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/15/reaganwasright/no-rosa-parks-granddaughter-didnt-praise-trump/	A fake news story says that the granddaughter of civil rights icon Rosa Parks praised President Donald Trump following racial unrest. "Rosa Parks’ Granddaughter SLAMS racist Democrats, Endorses Trump," states the Nov. 4 headline on the website Reaganwasright. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The article states that Parks’ granddaughter defended Trump to denounce claims from "Antifa" protesters that Trump is a "racist bigot" and a "traitor." The article quoted Parks’ supposed granddaughter, Muriel Parks-Gouldman, speaking to students at Oxford University: "This violence and destruction I see from my people is just unacceptable. My grandmother took a stand by sitting down, but she would never ‘sit down’ while our once-proud people cover their faces and commit violent acts in the streets." But the story is fake because Rosa Parks was childless when she died in 2005 at age 92. The photo in the story is of Ohio state lawmaker Nina Turner. Rosa Parks is a famous African-American civil rights icon who in 1955 refused to give up her seat on a bus to a white man in Montgomery, Ala. The goal of the story appears to be to shock readers that a grandchild of Parks would side with Trump, who called the violence in Charlottesville a result of "hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides." In August, we fact-checked a similar claim that "Rosa Parks’ daughter praises (President Donald) Trump’s response to Charlottesville." In that article, Parks’ daughter had a similar name: Muriel Parks-Rosenberg. We messaged the website on Facebook and received a reply directing us to scroll to the bottom of the page. The disclaimer states: "Nothing on this site is real. It is satire. Call it "fan fiction" if you prefer." The headline says, "Rosa Parks’ granddaughter SLAMS racist Democrats, endorses Trump." But Parks didn’t have children. For viewers who scroll to the bottom of the page, they will find a disclaimer that describes the website as satire. We rate this headline Pants on Fire!

pomt-11006	Says Brett Kavanaugh "has said the president shouldn't be investigated."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/10/charles-schumer/trumps-supreme-court-pick-said-presidents-shouldnt/	Democrats pounced on a years-old statement by president Donald Trump’s U.S. Supreme Court pick Brett Kavanaugh to drum up concern about how he might shield the president from Robert Mueller’s investigation. In an interview July 10, Senate Democratic Leader Charles Schumer suggested the comment about presidential power by Kavanaugh could give Trump a pass in the investigation, even though it came long before Mueller’s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. "You are worried about president Trump’s overreach. So am I," Schumer said on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. "This nominee has stood more, both certainly before he became a judge, for presidential overreach. He has said the president shouldn't be investigated. He has gone so far as to say a president if he declares a law unconstitutional doesn’t have to obey it. How is he going to react if Mueller needs a subpoena? If Mueller needs some other action?" Many Democrats have latched onto Kavanaugh’s statement about investigations into presidents. But we found that Democrats aren’t telling the full story about what Kavanaugh said. Minnesota Law Review article The statement by Kavanaugh stems from his 2009 article in the Minnesota Law Review about the separation of powers. At the time, he was a judge for the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. His article was adapted from remarks he made at the University of Minnesota Law School on Oct. 17, 2008, a couple of weeks before the presidential election. Kavanaugh made a reference to his experience with the Starr Report, which said that president Bill Clinton lied under oath in Clinton vs. Jones regarding his sexual relationship with Monica Lewinsky, obstructed justice, and refused to testify. Clinton was impeached in 1998 but acquitted by the Senate. In the law review article, Kavanaugh wrote that Congress could consider a law exempting the president while in office from criminal prosecution because it is "inevitably politicized by both their supporters and critics." Kavanaugh wrote that the Supreme Court‘s decision in Clinton vs Jones that presidents are not constitutionally entitled to deferral of civil suits "may well have been entirely correct" but Congress "may be wise" to set a statute to allow temporary deferral. Democrats have zeroed in on this passage by Kavanaugh: "Even the lesser burdens of a criminal investigation — including preparing for questioning by criminal investigators — are time-consuming and distracting. Like civil suits, criminal investigations take the president’s focus away from his or her responsibilities to the people. And a president who is concerned about an ongoing criminal investigation is almost inevitably going to do a worse job as president." Kavanaugh also wrote that the Constitution already provides a check on executive power, because an impeached president is then subject to criminal prosecution. "In short, the Constitution establishes a clear mechanism to deter executive malfeasance; we should not burden a sitting president with civil suits, criminal investigations, or criminal prosecutions. The president’s job is difficult enough as is. And the country loses when the president’s focus is distracted by the burdens of civil litigation or criminal investigation and possible prosecution." In a footnote, Kavanaugh wrote that the independent counsel statute, which was used by Kenneth Starr to investigate Clinton, "was a major mistake." "The law itself created a perverse structure that was inconsistent with foundational principles of separation of powers and that created problems for both the president and the independent counsel," he wrote. Experts weigh in on Schumer’s statement Law professors told us it was important to put Kavanaugh’s 2009 comments in context. Kavanaugh was calling for Congress to pass a statute granting presidents temporary immunity. "Schumer is using that notion — that in general, it is bad policy to allow presidents to be pursued by prosecutors while in office — to imply that Kavanaugh thinks Trump shouldn’t be investigated, and to question how he would rule as a judge," said Michigan State University law professor Brian Kalt. "That is disingenuous, because Kavanaugh was calling for Congress to pass a statute granting immunity. They have passed no such statute, and it is not reasonable to suggest that Kavanaugh as a judge would ignore that fact." If Kavanaugh became a justice and had to react to a future Mueller subpoena of Trump, Kavanaugh "would almost certainly respect the unanimous precedent of U.S. v. Nixon, which held that the president is not immune from subpoenas. If Congress passed a statute exempting the president from such subpoenas — which it hasn’t — then he would say that the president is exempt," Kalt said. Noah Feldman, a Harvard law professor, wrote in a Bloomberg column that while Democrats argue that Kavanaugh believes a president shouldn’t be indicted while in office, "Kavanaugh’s expressed views actually support the opposite conclusion: that the president can be investigated and maybe even indicted unless Congress passes a law saying he can’t — which Congress has not done." Kavanaugh said only that Congress should pass a law that delays certain investigations until after the presidency, Feldman told PolitiFact. "He did NOT say that was the state of affairs without the law — and there is no such law. For comparison, that is what Bill Clinton wanted even for civil investigation. Totally mainstream," Feldman said. "On the subpoena, we don’t know. But given that there is no law in place protecting (the president) and that Ken Starr issued subpoenas while Kavanaugh was working for him, my money would be on requiring Trump to comply." Our ruling Schumer said that Kavanaugh "has said the president shouldn't be investigated." Schumer is plucking one part of what Kavanaugh wrote in a 2009 Minnesota law review paper without recapping his comments in full. Kavanaugh wrote that civil suits and criminal investigations take away from a president’s focus on his or her work responsibilities. He didn’t call for the court to take away the power to investigate the president; he said that Congress could consider writing a law to exempt the president.

pomt-06323	Solar and wind energy are "both cheaper than nuclear right now."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/11/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-wind-solar-are-already-cheaper-n/	During a Nov. 8, 2011, appearance on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, former President Bill Clinton touted the prospects for adopting renewable energy. "Solar energy and wind energy ... would already be competitive with coal if you had to pay the extraneous costs of coal -- the health care costs and other things. And ... wind within two years and solar within five will be competitive in price with coal. They're both cheaper than nuclear right now." A reader asked us to check Clinton’s comment. We won’t rate his claim that wind and solar will be competitive with coal within two and five years respectively, since that’s a prediction. Instead, we’ll focus on his claim that solar and wind energy are "both cheaper than nuclear right now." We found a price comparison published in 2011 by the Energy Information Administration, which is part of the U.S. Department of Energy. It uses "levelized cost" to compare various energy technologies. This measurement, widely used by energy policy analysts, includes the inflation-adjusted price tag for building and operating a plant over its life cycle. Here’s the summary table from this study, with the relevant technologies in bold. (One factor that was not included in this calculation was state or federal incentives, such as tax credits.) Method Total system levelized cost for plants entering service in 2016, in 2009 dollars per MWh Conventional Coal 94.8 Advanced Coal 109.4 Advanced Coal with carbon control and sequestration 136.2 Natural Gas-fired: Conventional Combined Cycle 66.1 Natural Gas-fired: Advanced Combined Cycle 63.1 Natural Gas-fired: Advanced Combined Cycle with carbon control and sequestration 89.3 Natural Gas-fired: Conventional Combustion Turbine 124.5 Natural Gas-fired: Advanced Combustion Turbine 103.5 Advanced Nuclear 113.9 Wind -- Onshore 97.0 Wind – Offshore 243.2 Solar -- Photovoltaic 210.7 Solar -- Thermal 311.8 Geothermal 101.7 Biomass 112.5 Hydropower 86.4 So, according to this study, the least expensive form of wind energy -- using onshore turbines -- is about 15 percent cheaper than nuclear. But the cheapest form of solar -- using photovoltaic panels -- is about 85 percent more expensive than nuclear. This means that Clinton’s claim was half-right. (Clinton also could have pointed to three additional forms of renewable energy that are cheaper than nuclear -- geothermal, biomass and hydropower.) The experts we contacted generally agreed with this analysis. "It’s common and convenient to couple solar and wind in offhand references, but solar-based electricity remains, for now, appreciably costlier than wind," said Joel Darmstadter, a senior fellow with Resources for the Future, a Washington-based think tank on energy and environmental issues. He cautioned that not including government incentives does add to the uncertainty of these figures, though it potentially cuts both ways. For instance, nuclear plants benefit from the Price-Anderson Act, which limits their accident liability, while solar and wind receive different types of tax credits, he said. Stephen Brown, an economist at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas who specializes in energy policy, agreed that Clinton was right on wind but not on solar. He added that if you include additional factors known as externalities -- the kinds of things Clinton was referring to in the first part of his quote, such as the spillover environmental costs of the technology in question -- then the cost comparison could change. For instance, if the externalities were found to be sufficiently low for solar and sufficiently high for nuclear, he said, solar might end up being cheaper than nuclear. However, since Clinton wasn’t making that comparison, we won’t factor that possibility into our rating. A final thought from Darmstadter: In the short term, the comparative price options make natural gas, not any of the renewable fuels, the lowest-cost competitor with coal. Several natural gas technologies are cheaper than coal, according to the Energy Department study. Our ruling Clinton was correct about wind energy being "cheaper than nuclear right now," at least the onshore kind. But for now, nuclear beats the cheapest form of solar energy on price. So we rate his statement Half True.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2011-11-11T15:13:01	2011-11-08	['None']

pomt-12587	"Since 2012," city of Austin "property taxes have gone up almost 30 percent while incomes have only risen 4 percent."	false	/texas/statements/2017/apr/07/ellen-troxclair/ellen-troxclair-incorrectly-city-taxes-incomes-fam/	An Austin City Council member declared that city property taxes have lately surged with family incomes failing to keep up. Ellen Troxclair, who represents District 8 in Southwest Austin, told Lauren Petrowski of Austin’s Fox 7 on a February 2017 edition of "Good Day Austin" that she wants the city this year to "move the needle" versus the local cost of living. In the interview, Troxclair touted her affordability action plan, which was set aside by the council a week later. Troxclair: "Since 2012, property taxes have gone up almost 30 percent—" Petrowski: "Wow." Troxclair: "—while incomes have only risen 4 percent. So people are really struggling to stay in the city." Let’s gauge the proclaimed tax changes, then the described changes in income. City taxes up? By email, Troxclair aide Alice Claiborne said the nearly 30 percent statistic was derived by comparing the city property tax bill on a median-valued non-senior homestead as reported in the city budget for 2016-17 with the bill on a median-valued residence as stated in the city’s 2011-12 budget. The budget for fiscal 2011-12, which began in October 2011, states: "The median property tax bill is estimated at $879 per year" on a median-priced residence. The 2016-17 city budget estimated the city property tax bill on that year’s median-valued non-senior homestead at $1,132.96--which was 29 percent greater than the noted 2011-12 figure. Yet, we noticed, that comparison looked at different classifications of property. Single-family residences sweep in stand-alone homes, townhouses, condominiums, row houses and mobile homes regardless of who lives there. "Homestead" refers to an owner-occupied residence that can qualify for tax breaks. In 2016, according to the Travis Central Appraisal District, Austin had 183,423 single-family residences; 130,253 Austin property owners claimed a homestead exemption. By email, a city budget official, Ed Van Eenoo, advised that at the council's direction, the estimated tax bill in the 2016-17 budget was limited to non-senior homesteads, meaning those properties affected by increased exemptions adopted by the council. He confirmed that was a change from the 2011-12 budget. To reach a balanced comparison, we asked for the appropriate 2011-12 figure to compare with the 2016-17 tax estimate. Van Eenoo replied that the city tax tab for the median-value non-senior homestead in 2011-12 was $967.02. The 2016-17 tax bill for that type of homestead was 17 percent--not 29 percent--greater. Homestead tax changes Even so, we realized, that percentage doesn’t reflect actual changes in city-levied taxes for any given property. For starters, increases in the median-valued homestead were influenced by new and more valuable homes landing on the tax roll. Beyond that factor, we wondered how much more actual homeowners faced in 2016-17 city taxes compared with what the homeowners paid in 2011-12. To gauge that, we turned to Marya Crigler, chief appraiser for the appraisal district, which appraises local properties for taxation purposes. We asked Crigler to focus on city taxes on specific homesteads occupied by the same owner or owners in the period so we could see how each homeowner fared by 2016. Crigler emailed us tax data for eight geographically dispersed Austin homesteads whose owners in 2011-12 had paid city taxes of $967, which was then the bill for the city’s median non-senior homestead. Results: Seven sampled properties faced higher taxes in 2016 than 2011 or 2012, but the differences varied widely, from 3 percent to 24 percent—and one homestead, in East Austin east of U.S. 183, faced 4 percent less in taxes for 2016 than 2012. On average, the taxes levied in 2016 were 11 percent higher than the taxes levied in 2011 and 8 percent up from 2012. Location mattered. Among the homesteads, the smallest tax differences showed up on suburban properties, the biggest on urban-core homesteads in East Austin and west of MoPac Boulevard, the spreadsheet shows. Crigler also emailed us a chart showing that by TCAD’s calculations, the $1,137 in city taxes due on a median-value homestead in 2016 was $124 or 12 percent greater than the $1,013 due on a median-value homestead in 2012. Significantly, Crigler said, the 2016 figures take into account the curbing effect on tax bills from state homestead appraised-value limits plus the local homestead tax exemptions approved by the council that year. So, Austin’s homestead property taxes were almost universally higher in 2016 than five years previous. But for the most part, homeowners weren’t socked as hard as Troxclair's "almost 30 percent" suggests. Van Eenoo, when we asked, had no quibble with Crigler’s figures. Michael Searle, Troxclair’s chief of staff, questioned our focus on homesteads rather than single-family dwellings. "I would say that looking only at homesteads gives a narrow picture," Searle emailed. We tried to check on changes in taxes on median-value single-family dwellings. Van Eenoo said, though, the finance staff did not have a 2016 figure comparable to the 2011-12 budget’s figure. He said the council in 2016 directed it to focus on taxes on homesteads, enabling members to track the effect of the council-adopted increases in homestead tax exemptions. Family incomes Next, we turned to Troxclair’s claim about minimal changes in local incomes. Claiborne and Searle told us city staffers gave Troxclair the figures she relied on to gauge changes in Austin’s median family income. The provided figures suggest a median family income of $78,671 for 2017—which would be up $3,771, or 5 percent, from the presented median family income in 2011 of $74,900. The projected 2017 figure would be up $2,771, 3.7 percent, from Troxclair’s cited 2012 median family income of $75,900. Asked about those income figures, the city demographer, Ryan Robinson, told us that he wasn’t familiar with a 2017 projection, but the figures for previous years reflected data covering families in the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos region, not just Austin, that are annually put together by the U.S Department of Housing and Urban Development. Robinson pointed us to a HUD website where we spotted the median family income figures provided by Troxclair’s office for fiscal 2016 and fiscal 2011 and 2012. So, median family incomes in the Austin area—extending beyond Austin and Travis County to include Bastrop, Caldwell, Hays and Williamson counties—escalated nearly 4 percent from 2012 to what’s projected for 2017. But that’s a regional figure. We endeavored to seek Austin-only numbers. Austin-only income changes And to our inquiry, a U.S. Census Bureau spokeswoman, Jewel Jordan, pointed us to its estimates of median family incomes in Austin alone, which were based on the bureau’s American Community Survey results for 2011 through 2015. That research suggests bigger jumps in median family income among Austin residents. According to the bureau, Austin’s 2015 median family income of $76,629 was up nearly 13 percent from the $68,023 median family income of Austin residents in 2012 and up 20 percent from the $63,672 median family income of Austinites in 2011. In the same years, the number of Austin families escalated from 66,158 in 2011 and 66,474 in 2012 to 73,928 in 2015 (a three-year, 11 percent increase). Next, we adjusted the dollar figures for inflation: Median Family Incomes for Austin in 2015 Dollars YEAR AMOUNT INCREASE/DECREASE ($s) % CHANGE % CHANGE from 2012 2011 $67,090 na na na 2012 $70,222 $3,132 4.7 na 2013 $72,757 $2,535 3.6 3.6 2014 $76,754 $3,997 5.5 9.3 2015 $76,629 ($125) (0.2) 9.1 na=Not applicable SOURCES: American FactFinder, American Community Survey, 1-Year Results, 2011-2015, U.S. Census Bureau and CPI Inflation Calculator, Bureau of Labor Statistics (accessed March 16 and 22, 2017) For our part, we also wondered if—just as an influx of higher-value housing arguably dampened existing homeowners’ property tax bites—a portion of the indicated family income gains reflected new residents filling new higher-wage jobs rather than workers in Austin at the start of the period soaking up pay gains. Unfortunately, we didn’t divine a way to figure that out. We noticed otherwise that the Census Bureau’s Austin surveys suggest slightly favorable changes: In 2011, about 26 percent of Austin families had incomes of less than $35,000 while in 2015, that share was down to 21.6 percent. Conversely, in Austin in 2011, 15.8 percent of families had incomes of $150,000 or more while in 2015, 18.8 percent of families were at that level. Troxclair, informed of the bureau’s city-specific income estimates, didn’t defend her reliance on HUD’s regional figures. She noted that city staff had provided her with the regional figures in response to her request for the "average increase in income in Austin" over recent years. City staff comments By email, Van Eenoo, the city’s deputy chief financial officer, confirmed that a colleague had submitted the regional figures to Troxclair’s office without clarifying they weren’t city-only numbers. He further said city staff had calculated the region’s median family income for 2017 by applying the 10-year compound annual growth rate to HUD’s 2016 figure. Van Eenoo, asked why it makes sense to rely on HUD’s regional estimates, noted they’re more up to date than the bureau’s city-specific estimates. Notably too, Van Eenoo said, the HUD data series is the "official data series used to determine eligibility for a wide range of affordable housing programs. We therefore have often relied on the HUD data series because it is the most current official government data series and tracks with other evaluations of housing affordability, whereas relying on the ACS data would require us to make independent projections of income two years into the future in order to compare income versus current property tax levels." We sought his comment on the bureau figures showing median family incomes in Austin trailing the regional HUD estimates; Van Eenoo said city staff hadn’t researched that in depth. Our ruling Troxclair said: "Since 2012," city of Austin "property taxes have gone up almost 30 percent while incomes have only risen 4 percent." Both percentages, we found, have flaws enfeebling this admittedly difficult comparison. In our attempt to be precise, we estimate that city taxes on homesteads in 2016 were up around 8 percent to 11 percent from a few years before with Austin’s median family income in 2015 about 9 percent higher than the city’s median family income in 2012 (though this also almost certainly doesn't reflect income changes for the same specific families). Upshot: City taxes mostly were up, but largely to a lesser degree than Troxclair suggested. Also, the cited regional income figures reflected lesser gains for families than Austin-only estimates available from the Census Bureau. We rate the statement False.

pomt-07300	On supporting the budget proposed by Rep. Paul Ryan	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/may/18/newt-gingrich/did-newt-gingrich-flip-flop-supporting-paul-ryans-/	Jay Newton Small, Time magazine: "But would you have voted for Ryan’s plan?" Gingrich: "Sure." Small: "Do you think it would actually save the health care system?" Gingrich: "No, I think it’s the first step. You need an entirely new set of solutions." -- Time magazine interview with Gingrich, April 20, 2011 *** Gingrich: "... There are things you can do to improve Medicare." NBC’s David Gregory: "But not what Paul Ryan is suggesting, which is completely changing Medicare." Gingrich: "I, I think that, I think, I think that that is too big a jump. I think what you want to have is a system where people voluntarily migrate to better outcomes, better solutions, better options, not one where you suddenly impose upon the -- I don't want to -- I'm against Obamacare, which is imposing radical change, and I would be against a conservative imposing radical change." -- Interview on NBC’s Meet the Press, May 15, 2011 *** Gingrich: "I made a mistake. And I called Paul Ryan today, who's a very close personal friend and I said that. The fact is that I have supported what Ryan has tried to do on the budget. The fact is that my newsletter strongly praised the budget when he brought it out. And the budget vote is one that I'm happy to say I would have voted for. I will defend and I will be glad to answer any Democrat who attempts to distort what I said. And I made a simple mistake." -- Interview on Fox News Channel’s On the Record with Greta Van Susteren, May 17, 2011 *** Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., made a splash when he officially entered the 2012 presidential race in mid May. But it wasn’t exactly the splash he was looking for. In addition to a testy exchange with an Iowa voter that was caught on video, a glitter attack by a gay-rights protester, revelations that he had owed a six-figure amount to the luxury retailer Tiffany’s and a series of articles questioning the accuracy of his facts, Gingrich also took heat from conservatives for an alleged flip-flop on whether he supported the budget plan written by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and passed by the GOP-controlled House. Ryan’s budget includes aggressive spending cuts that have energized conservatives, and changes to Medicare that have outraged liberals. Support for Ryan’s plan has become something of a litmus test for Republicans, especially those running for the GOP presidential nomination. So Gingrich’s stance on the plan was bound to become an issue. Gingrich’s views on Ryan’s proposal have indeed varied over time -- and they’ve also been somewhat more nuanced than the popular reaction would indicate. In a Facebook post on March 17, 2010, Gingrich wrote favorably of Ryan’s previous plan, known as the "Roadmap." The "Roadmap" is broadly similar to the budget resolution passed earlier this year by the House, including in its approach to Medicare. Gingrich’s post called Ryan’s proposal "a comprehensive, bold solution to America’s serious problem of rapidly rising debt. CBO scores the Roadmap reforms as achieving full solvency for Social Security and Medicare and eliminating all long term federal deficits, balancing the federal budget for the long haul. … I know Congressman Ryan remains committed to improving the quality of life for all Americans, both now and in the future, and this Roadmap represents a comprehensive way to achieve that." More than a year later, Gingrich told Time magazine reporter Jay Newton Small that he would have voted for Ryan’s latest plan if he’d been serving in the House. Pressed on whether it would "actually save the health care system," Gingrich responded, "No, I think it’s the first step. You need an entirely new set of solutions." In other words, Gingrich indicated that the plan was worth voting for but added that it was not a silver bullet. A few days after that, in comments at the Brookings Institution on April 23, 2011, Gingrich once again praised Ryan’s big-picture thinking but added that "there are details (of the plan) I disagree with." According to an account in the Daily Caller, one of his reservations involved "cutting investment in science and research." Reductions in science funding envisioned under Ryan’s plan are "essentially like saying I want to save money on your car, we’re not going to change the oil. And for about a year I can get away with it. And then the engine will freeze up, and we’ll have to replace your engine. But if I have a CBO that scores oil but doesn’t score engines, I can annually replace the engine for free, because it won’t count as a budget cost." This seems to reinforce a view that Gingrich supported the proposal, but not without qualifications. Then came the Meet the Press interview on May 15, 2011. Host David Gregory asked Gingrich, "Do you think that Republicans ought to buck the public opposition and really move forward to completely change Medicare, turn it into a voucher program where you give seniors … some premium support and -- so that they can go out and buy private insurance?" Gingrich responded, "I don't think right-wing social engineering is any more desirable than left-wing social engineering. I don't think imposing radical change from the right or the left is a very good way for a free society to operate." After explaining his desire to instead cut waste and abuse, Gingrich insisted that "there are things you can do to improve Medicare." "But not what Paul Ryan is suggesting, which is completely changing Medicare?" Gregory suggested. Gingrich said, "I, I think that, I think, I think that that is too big a jump. I think what you want to have is a system where people voluntarily migrate to better outcomes, better solutions, better options, not one where you suddenly impose upon the -- I don't want to -- I'm against Obamacare, which is imposing radical change, and I would be against a conservative imposing radical change." While Gingrich didn’t explicitly tell Gregory, "I wouldn’t have voted for the Ryan proposal," his stance seems pretty clear to us -- that he did not favor the Ryan Medicare overhaul. So we think it’s fair to say that, after the Meet the Press interview, Gingrich had at the very least done a half-flip on the question of whether to implement the Ryan proposal. But that wasn’t the end of it. In an interview with the Wall Street Journal’s editorial page the day after the Meet the Press appearance, Gingrich backtracked somewhat. He said he had "probably used too strong language" on the show, though he added, "I have thought about this for a long time and I am very, very worried. … I think it would be politically catastrophic to pass the bill in its current form," at a moment when conservatives have an opportunity "to break the left for the first time since 1932." So Gingrich indicated to the Wall Street Journal that he’d overstated his view, but still thought that it would be "politically catastrophic to pass the bill in its current form." Yet there was more to come. As a wave of criticism built, mostly from conservatives outraged at his failure to fully back Ryan’s proposal, Gingrich went on Fox News Channel’s On the Record with Greta Van Susteren on May 17, 2011, to extend and clarify his remarks. "I made a mistake," Gingrich said. "And I called Paul Ryan today, who's a very close personal friend and I said that. The fact is that I have supported what Ryan has tried to do on the budget. The fact is that my newsletter strongly praised the budget when he brought it out. And the budget vote is one that I'm happy to say I would have voted for. I will defend and I will be glad to answer any Democrat who attempts to distort what I said. And I made a simple mistake. ... "So, let me say on the record: Any ad which quotes what I said Sunday is a falsehood and because I have said publicly, those words were inaccurate and unfortunate. And I'm prepared to stand up -- when I make a mistake, and I'm going to on occasion, I want to stand up and share with the American people, that was a mistake, because that way, we can have an honest conversation." In other words, Gingrich used the appearance with Van Susteren to back away from any suggestion that he would have voted against the Ryan plan. As we indicated, a close reading of the Meet the Press transcript shows that Gingrich never precisely said that he would have voted against the Ryan plan. But he certainly made clear that he thought a key provision of the plan -- the changes to Medicare -- were "too big a jump" for him to support. And by saying on Van Susteren’s show that he "made a mistake" in his Meet the Press comments -- a big enough mistake that he felt a need to call Ryan and smooth things over -- it seems like a tacit admission of a flip-flop. We do think that, taken as a whole, there has been more nuance to Gingrich’s stance than some of the coverage has indicated. But his philosophical travels -- from the full-throated Facebook endorsement in 2010, to qualified endorsements in the Time interview and at the Brookings conference, to the downbeat assessment on Meet the Press, to the hasty re-endorsement on Van Susteren’s show -- indicate that Gingrich’s support for the Ryan proposal has ebbed and flowed over time. Gingrich seems to have gone full circle in his views on the proposal, and it qualifies in our book as a Full Flop.	None	Newt Gingrich	None	None	None	2011-05-18T19:41:31	2011-05-17	['None']

pomt-07795	Says under his budget-repair bill, "collective bargaining is fully intact."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/18/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-his-budget-repair-/	If Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker isn’t trying to strip most collective bargaining rights from public employees, then why do workers keep pouring into Madison by the thousands to demonstrate against him? Many state, local government and public school employees -- including those represented by the largest state workers union -- have said they would be willing to pay more for pensions and health insurance, as called for in a budget-repair bill introduced by Walker. But the workers continue to protest provisions in the bill that would restrict most public employee unions to bargaining only over wages, and then only within caps. It’s the central issue in the protests, which have drawn national attention. And yet on the morning of Feb. 18, 2011 -- a day after Democratic state senators fled to Illinois to prevent a vote on the bill -- Walker made a startling declaration in a Milwaukee radio interview. At the turn of the 19th century, the Republican governor told conservative talk show host Charles Sykes, Wisconsin adopted the "strongest civil service protections" in the world. Walker then added: "Those fully remain intact. Civil service does not get altered by the modest changes we’re talking about here. Collective bargaining is fully intact. You’ve got merit hiring, you’ve got just cause for termination and for discipline. All those things remain." In the middle of that statement is the eyebrow-raising remark. Collective bargaining would remain "fully intact"? We immediately asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie for evidence that would back up his boss’ statement. In the crush of activity in Madison, where the state Assembly took up the budget-repair bill as Walker did the interview, Werwie had not responded by publication time. But let’s take a look at what was said. In contending that collective bargaining would remain fully intact, Walker mixed civil service protections with collective bargaining rights. They are not the same. Civil service protections The protections are put into state law by the Legislature, or into a local ordinance by a city council, or village or town board, said public-sector employer attorney Andrew Phillips. He is general counsel for the Wisconsin Counties Association and his Mequon firm also represents municipalities and school districts. Currently, state employees are covered by civil service, but most local government employees don’t have it and no public school employees do, Phillips said. Phillips said civil service protections, among other things, specify employee rights to things such as vacation and overtime; prohibit termination for reasons other than just cause; and create procedures for employees to file grievances and to have those complaints heard. What they don’t provide, he said, is any right for employees to bargain with their employers over those issues and others. The terms are set by the employer. Collective bargaining rights Two sections of state law -- one for state workers and one for local government and public school employees -- give public employees the right in Wisconsin to collectively bargain. The law issues a mandate to both the employer (the government) and the collective bargaining unit (employees represented by a union). The two sides must "meet and confer at reasonable times, in good faith, with the intention of reaching an agreement" on wages, hours, fringe benefits and conditions of employment. In other words, the workers -- through their union -- have a say in those areas. They do not have such a say under civil service rules. So, what would change if Walker’s budget-repair bill is adopted by the Republican-controlled Legislature? With an amendment approved by the Joint Finance Committee, the bill would require local governments that don’t have a civil service system to establish one, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. Alternatively, local governments could establish a grievance procedure that would, at minimum, address employee discipline and workplace safety, and provide for a grievance procedure for employee terminations. Let’s return to Walker’s statement that under his changes collective bargaining remains intact. To be sure, those rights would remain intact for the State Patrol and local police and fire department employees. They are exempt from any of the changes. As for the rest of state, local government and public school employees, Walker’s own Feb. 11, 2011 letter to employees about his plan cited "various changes to limit collective bargaining" to the rate of base pay. The letter also noted other changes, including limiting contracts to one year and requiring annual employee votes to retain unions. Moreover, the bill would repeal all bargaining rights for home health care workers, University of Wisconsin System faculty and academic staff, and employees of University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics. Indeed, Walker also said in the interview with Sykes it was necessary to use his bill to strip collective bargaining rights because when it comes to money the state is broke. He added: "What changes is the fact that no longer can our unions have a stranglehold -- not only on the state government but local government -- to force them to not alter benefit packages that are like a virus eating up our budget." Where does that leave us? In arguing the changes would be modest, Walker cited the civil service system and said "collective bargaining is fully in tact." However, Walker himself has outlined how his budget-repair bill would limit the collective bargaining rights of public employees.

pomt-06440	Says Anthropology is a STEM (science, technology, engineering, math) field.	half-true	/florida/statements/2011/oct/21/frank-brogan/brogan-claims-anthro-part-stem/	Gov. Rick Scott found himself at war with anthropologists when he told a radio talk show host on Oct. 10, 2011, that Florida doesn't need "a lot more anthropologists." Instead, Scott said, the state needs more graduates in science, technology, engineering and math fields -- shortened often as STEM. (To read more about Scott's spat with anthropologists read this blog item from the St. Petersburg Times.) Scott's pro-STEM, anti-anthropology sounding statement produced loud opposition from anthropologists and liberal arts majors. It also resulted in a simple question from state Rep. Alan Williams, D-Tallahassee, to State University System Chancellor Frank Brogan. At an Oct. 19 House committee meeting, Williams asked: "Is anthropology a STEM?" Brogan responded: "It is." So if anthropology is STEM, and Scott likes STEM, but Scott doesn't like anthropology ... The conclusion of that sentence starts with whether Brogan is right -- that anthropology is a STEM field. And that depends whom you ask. National Science Foundation -- Yes. The National Science Foundation considers anthropology a STEM field, according to Mark Fiegener, a National Science Foundation project officer. Fiegener said that NSF considers anthropology to be part of the "S", or science, in STEM. "NSF considers anthropology to be a field of science – one of the social sciences, to be precise," Fiegener wrote in an e-mail. "Consequently, when we report STEM fields in our statistical reports, the data from or about anthropology departments or students are always counted in the broad 'science' category." U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement -- No. Believe it or not, U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement has a list of STEM programs because the federal government allows foreign students on student visas who graduate with STEM degrees to remain in the U.S. for additional time to receive work experience. ICE announced in May 2011 that it expanded the list of STEM degrees -- but anthropology isn't included. President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology -- Kind of. The council issued a report discussing K-12 STEM education in September 2010. They specifically excluded anthropology as a STEM field for K-12 education, but they also said it was "appropriately considered STEM fields at the undergraduate and graduate levels." Florida Board of Governors -- No. The board, which oversees the state university system and selected Brogan as university chancellor, has designated 103 STEM undergraduate and graduate degrees but not anthropology. The board, working together with the state universities, re-classified the degrees in 2008. Our ruling At a subcommittee meeting a state legislator asked Brogan "is anthropology a STEM?" and Brogan replied: "it is." The National Science Foundation agrees with him, but his own university system and U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement don't. Brogan's response suggests that the answer is simple, but in reality it's anything but clear cut and he should have explained that. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-06267	"The overwhelming number" of school districts reported their staff stayed the same or grew after the 2011-’13 state budget	false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/nov/27/scott-walker/walker-says-overwhelming-number-wisconsin-school-d/	As opponents push to recall him, Gov. Scott Walker is working to douse criticism of major cuts in school aid approved in his 2011-2013 budget. In the wake of media coverage of a survey of school districts that showed a net drop of 3,400 education staff spread across more than 350 local districts, he laid out his own view of the numbers. Not every district lost staff, but the cumulative effect was a 5 percent reduction overall. On that point, Walker noted a majority of staff cuts came from just a few large urban districts -- including ones that couldn’t or didn’t take advantage of the change that eliminated collective bargaining with teachers’ unions over health and pension costs. Critics responded that those few districts educate a big share of public school kids. Taking on the survey, Walker went further in a Nov. 15, 2011, interview on WTMJ-AM (620). Host Charlie Sykes asked Walker if his budget had resulted in "significant educational cutbacks in school districts across the state." Walker responded: "No. This is myth vs. reality. You saw a rush to judgment when some folks put that information out. The media wanted to believe that … at least the more liberal biased media wanted to believe that so they immediately assumed it was true." He concluded: "If you actually look at this, it shows just the opposite. It shows the overwhelming number of districts saw that staffing was the same or greater, that there were the same or fewer cuts than before, and in the few areas where they did see significant reductions in staffing, it was places like Milwaukee, Kenosha and Janesville..." We’re working on several statements related to the survey. Here’s our question for today: Did the survey -- done by the Wisconsin Association of School District Administrators and analyzed by the state Department of Public Instruction -- show the "overwhelming number of districts" escaped a drop in staff? Let’s start with this note: Walker doesn’t dispute the data in the survey filled out by more than 80% of public school districts -- just the way it was used. In fact, he uses the same data to make opposing points. In the survey, "staff" referred not only to teachers, but to teachers aides, support staff and administrators. Walker argues the raw data actually show a large number of districts where more new staff was hired than was laid off or dismissed by contract non-renewal. We crunched the numbers and he’s right by that method of accounting: More than eight in 10 districts surveyed showed no net loss of staff, and most had gains. There’s a big footnote, however. You won’t find Walker’s numbers cited in the survey’s summary, because the survey calculated the staffing changes using a number -- a critical one -- Walker leaves out: retirements of staff. In all, more than 4,700 school employees retired in the last year -- a level many school officials attribute to Walker’s own budget’s push to force them to pay more for pensions and health care. For each district, the survey arrived at a staff loss or gain by adding up all the staff departures (retirements, layoffs, contract non-renewals) and subtracting the new hires. The survey showed Racine schools, for instance, reported a net drop of 100 staff, mostly teachers aides. But by Walker’s method, Racine shows a net gain of 14, according to our calculations. The reason for the difference: Walker doesn’t count the 114 retirements in the district. When we analyzed the survey results using the complete statistics used to calculate the staff change, we found the opposite of Walker’s conclusion: Three out of four districts reported a net loss of staff, including all four categories of staff. A reduction in teachers drove that result: Nearly two out of three districts (63 percent) reported a net loss of teachers. That trend was much less pronounced in the other categories: for teachers aides, 38 percent of districts saw reductions, we found. For support staff, 31 percent saw a loss. For administrators, 21 percent reported a loss. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said the governor excluded retirements because a teacher can retire for any number of reasons unrelated to budgets. True, but the same claim could be made about new hires -- something Walker includes. Indeed, new hires were often necessitated by the retirements. Pulling out just one of the categories unravels any attempt to get at what actually is happening. "We would have had to lay off way more teachers" if 28 hadn’t retired, said Burlington Area School District Superintendent David Moyer. The district rehired 20, according to the survey. Most new hires in the Muskego-Norway district were replacing teachers who retired, said Superintendent Joe Schroeder. Retirements tripled over the previous year. Werwie, the governor’s spokesman, said that ultimately Walker’s counting method shows "new teachers had an easier time getting a job in Wisconsin." That seems like a safe statement, but it’s a different point than saying most districts had the same staffing or greater. Werwie also argued that "staffing" should be judged by broader measures such as class size. It’s possible, he said, for class sizes to hold steady even if staff is reduced because the budget granted freedom from various work rules. In Kaukauna, for instance, the district required educators to teach six hours a day instead of five, as the Journal Sentinel reported. It’s true that very large majorities of districts reported no increase in class sizes -- 74 percent in grades kindergarten to three, and 66 percent in grades 4-6, for example. We think Werwie’s point about judging "staffing" by what happened to class sizes has some merit. Increases or decreases in class size can result from changes in teacher staffing. But enrollment and other factors can affect class size too. In the end, it’s a really a broader topic than the one in front of us on the breadth of the staffing cuts. In any event, Walker’s reference to staffing levels of "the same or greater" makes it clear he was quantifying staffing, not discussing class size. Our conclusion Walker referred to school survey results, saying "the overwhelming number of districts saw that staffing was the same or greater." But he cherry-picked figures in his favor, leaving out a key factor -- retirements -- that formed the basis of the survey’s conclusions on overall staffing reductions. When they are included, the survey actually shows the opposite of what he said. We rate his statement False.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2011-11-27T09:00:00	2011-11-15	['None']

pomt-05073	"If you look at most of the polls, this is a margin-of-error race on Fourth of July between Mitt Romney and the president."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/05/chris-christie/mitt-romney-barack-obama-margin-error-race-white-h/	Gov. Chris Christie said a narrow win for the national health care law in the U.S. Supreme Court helped boost President Barack Obama’s poll numbers over his Republican opponent for the moment. But, he said, the race for the White House is a statistical dead heat. "If you look at most of the polls, this is a margin-of-error race on Fourth of July between Mitt Romney and the president," Christie, a top surrogate for Romney, said in an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box on Tuesday. "And if for any Republican, if I had told them in January, in the middle of the scrum between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary with Mitt Romney getting beaten up by all those people on the stage, ‘Don't worry. On Fourth of July, it'll be a dead heat race between the president and Mitt Romney’ every Republican would have signed up for that. So let's keep everything in perspective. This is a margin-of-error race. It's going to be a close election. But I think Governor Romney is in [a] really good position right now as the challenger to be able to make the case over the next number of months that he can win," Christie said. Are Obama and Romney facing off in a "margin-of-error race," as Christie claims? PolitiFact New Jersey found most polls back up the governor. We reviewed more than a dozen polls, conducted by different organizations, that asked respondents about who they would vote for in the 2012 presidential election. Only two of those polls found a difference between Obama and Romney that could not be impacted by the survey’s margin of error. A July 2 report from Gallup found respondents split 48 percent in favor of Obama to 43 percent in favor of Romney. That poll had a margin of error of 2 percentage points, not enough to swing the results another way. Charles H. Franklin, professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and co-founder of Pollster.com, said "you can easily find some polls where the margin is within the margin of error and a few now and then that are outside the margin of error." But the fact that a poll falls outside of the survey’s sampling error "doesn’t mean that poll was right," he said, citing a June 20 Bloomberg poll that found Obama 13 points ahead of Romney as an example. Recent polls from CNN, Fox News, NBC News/Wall Street Journal, Pew Research and others, show a more narrow spread between Obama and Romney. Though almost all of those polls had the president ahead of his Republican challenger, the margins of error had the possibility of swinging the results in Romney’s favor. A CNN/ORC International poll with a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points released July 2 found Obama ahead of Romney, 49 percent to 46 percent. In a Fox News Poll released June 27, 45 percent of respondents said they’d vote for Obama and 40 percent said they vote for Romney if the election were held today. That survey had a sampling error of 3 percentage points. "In general all the polls show Obama with a lead within the margin of error," said Peter Woolley, executive director of the PublicMind Poll at Fairleigh Dickinson University. But, he said, "I wouldn’t call that a dead heat. I think that’s an optimistic pronouncement. When you have poll after poll that puts Obama a little bit ahead then I would say that you’re pretty confident Obama is a little bit ahead." Our ruling Christie said that "if you look at most of the polls, this is a margin-of-error race on Fourth of July between Mitt Romney and the president." PolitiFact New Jersey reviewed 13 recent polls from different organizations, nearly all of which put Obama ahead of Romney. Only two of those polls showed the president with a lead outside of the margin of error. We rate this claim True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-14847	Drinking champagne could help prevent Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia.	false	/georgia/statements/2015/nov/17/viral-media-reports/heres-toast-some-very-bad-information-booze-and-de/	A story making the rounds on social media raises hopes about raising glasses. A "new" study, the headlines cheer, shows drinking champagne — three glasses every week or every day depending who is posting the story — could prevent Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia. But before deciding to make three-hour brunches the new healthy workday, PolitiFact Georgia did some checking. We didn’t find the new breakthrough study that some might have been expecting. Rather, we discovered social media abuzz about a study from May 2013 by scientists at the University of Reading in the United Kingdom. Those researchers found that drinking champagne might counteract age-related memory loss and help delay the onset of degenerative brain disorders, such as dementia, according to a press release at the time. Rats, not humans, were subjects in the research. For reasons still unclear, the study’s headline findings went viral on social media and cracked Facebook’s list of trending topics this month, nearly three years after the study. "Three glasses of champagne ‘could help Alzheimer’s disease’" was the headline on The United Kingdom’s Evening Standard’s Facebook post Nov. 9. News outlets picked the story up from social media. Most but not all pointed out that the study was not brand new. The attention prompted Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) to issue a statement Nov. 9, declaring that there’s "no hard evidence champagne can prevent dementia." The agency explained that the University of Reading’s 2013 study was small — it involved three groups of eight rats. n a six-week period, the rats had champagne, non-champagne alcoholic drink, or an alcohol-free drink. Each rat was assessed on its ability to find treats in a maze before and after this period. The main finding: rats given champagne were better at remembering how to find the treat than those given the alcohol-free drink. They found the treats roughly five times out of eight, compared with four times out of eight in rats given the other drinks, NHS said. The agency recommended that the study be repeated with a larger sample of rats and pointed out that "this research has limited direct applicability to humans. "The fact that rats may have performed slightly better in a maze, or demonstrated some protein changes related to nerve adaptability, does not mean champagne definitely reduces the risk of dementia in humans." Ginny Helms, vice president of chapter services and public policy for the Georgia chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association, said the 2013 study was very limited "and not at all conclusive on how champagne or other forms of alcohol can help prevent Alzheimer’s. "No one should drink champagne or other alcohol as a method of reducing the risk of Alzheimer’s disease or other dementia based on this study," she said. "Some studies have found that moderate alcohol consumption may reduce risk of cognitive decline and dementia, but other studies had contradictory results." Absent a cure or major breakthrough, the association suggests a combination of a healthy diet, exercise, socialization and exercise of the mind as the best way to protect the brain, Helms said. Managing critical numbers, such as blood pressure and cholesterol, also is highly recommended, she said. The buzz on champagne started just days before the association released a major report that includes some staggering statistics on the rising financial burden to states of Alzheimer’s disease and dementia. Currently, Medicaid programs in 11 states — New York, California, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Texas, Florida, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Illinois, Michigan and North Carolina – pay more than $1 billion a year on individuals 65 and older living with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia, the association reports. Fast forward 10 years to 2025, and the association estimates that 20 states — Georgia included — will be in this boat. Alzheimer’s and other dementia costs the Peach State’s Medicaid program $989 million this year. But, in 10 years, costs are expected to increase 61 percent to $1.59 billion by the association’s estimates. Our ruling Social media recently resurrected an old study Stories were posted suggesting that drinking champagne could help prevent the onset of Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia. The study is from 2013, not new, as some posts suggested. It was based on testing in a small group of rats, which the National Health Service in Britain says would need to be repeated in a larger sample. And it still might not have any implications in humans. To imply otherwise is very misleading. We rate the statement False.

pomt-05876	The state constitution "clearly says there’s not to be a state income tax in Tennessee."	false	/tennessee/statements/2012/feb/09/gerald-mccormick/house-majority-leader-says-tennessee-constitution-/	Under Senate Joint Resolution 221, given final approval by the Legislature in January, Tennessee voters will decide in a 2014 referendum whether to insert language into the state constitution that explicitly prohibits a tax on personal income. Supporters of the amendment say it’s needed because of disagreements over what the Tennessee Constitution says now. But in House floor debate on Jan. 19, 2012, Majority Leader Gerald McCormick had a different take. With a booklet-sized copy of the state constitution in his hand, the Chattanooga Republican declared: "I’ve got my state constitution out and, even though it clearly says there’s not to be a state income tax in Tennessee, we know we don’t have to go very far to find a judge who will say it doesn’t say what it says. And that’s what has happened before, and the member (sponsor of SJR221) doesn’t want that to happen again." We wondered: If the constitution "clearly says there’s not to be a state income tax," then why the need for a constitutional amendment? Wasn’t it just a decade ago that a Republican governor thought there was enough uncertainty over the issue to push for a state tax on income? The constitution in Article II, Section 28 grants the General Assembly broad authority to levy taxes on all property, real and personal, and to tax "merchants, peddlers, and privileges." There is no mention, one way or the other, on taxing income until the final sentence of the section, which declares, "The Legislature shall have power to levy a tax upon incomes derived from stocks and bonds that are not taxed ad valorem." The state Supreme Court has interpreted Article 28 as it relates to personal income in three notable cases. In 1929, the court upheld the Hall income tax on stock and bond dividends in the case of Shields vs. Williams, basing its decision in large part on that final sentence. In 1932, the court struck down a graduated income tax, enacted by the General Assembly a year earlier, in the case of Evans v. McCabe. The decision rested again on that final sentence, as interpreted in the Shields case. By specifically mentioning a tax on income from stocks and bonds, the court reasoned, framers of the constitution implied an intention that other types of income should not be taxed. In 1960, in a complicated corporate taxation case not directly involving personal income, the court nonetheless included some observations on the subject. An often-quoted line: "Realizing and receiving income or earnings is not a privilege that can be taxed." Against this backdrop of seemingly inconsistent Supreme Court decisions, several state attorneys general have issued a series of formal opinions on the validity of proposals to tax payrolls or income. At least since 1981, the opinions have at least questioned the validity of the past Supreme Court rulings and most, including the most recent opinion by then-Attorney General Paul Summers in 1999, have said that an income tax would be constitutional. Summers concluded: "Upon this analysis, it seems clear that the General Assembly does have the power to levy a properly-structured income tax as a privilege tax imposed on income-producing activities and measured by earnings, as a tax on income as a species of intangible personal property, and possibly as a direct and uncategorized tax imposed under the legislature’s inherent authority." The idea is that, if the Legislature passed a bill deeming the right to earn income a "privilege" or income itself as "property," justices on the high court would rethink the precedents and declare income taxable. Perhaps the most scholarly review of all this comes from the current state attorney general, Bob Cooper, who wrote a treatise on constitutionality of an income tax for the Tennessee Bar Journal in 1992 (he was then in private practice). He concluded that the Supreme Court decision upholding the Hall income tax was "wrongly decided" and that a state income tax would, indeed, violate the state constitution – though the Supreme Court got its reasoning wrong while reaching the right conclusion in the Evans decision. He has not issued a formal opinion on the matter since he has been AG. It seems to us that the constitution is clearly unclear on the taxing of personal income, as attorneys general past and present have declared while reaching different conclusions. Asked for comment about this, McCormick said the constitutionality of a state income tax "is a matter of opinion" and that, "in my opinion, I think it (the constitution) is very clear." But, he added, "We’ve got a lot of legal geniuses who think it’s not." The whole point of amending the constitution is to make things clear. Indeed, the amendment’s preamble states its purpose is "to clarify the language" of the existing ban on a state income tax as interpreted by the Supreme Court. Our ruling The upshot of all this – and we’ve only scratched the surface here of the arguments by lawyers and laymen on both sides -- is that McCormick had things backwards in his statement that the constitution "clearly" says there should be no state income tax. The conflicting court decisions, the wide range of interpretations and the drive for an amendment actually make it very clear that the constitution is not clear. We rate his statement False.

Healey, who has repeatedly run for lieutenant governor with the intention of abolishing the office, and who spent the 2002 election season handing out campaign condoms with the slogan "Nothing never felt so good," got 21.4 percent of the vote after mail ballots were counted in the 2014 gubernatorial election. While the major party candidates, Democrat Gina Raimondo and Republican Allan Fung, saturated the airwaves with commercials, Healey made a few campaign appearances and put up a few signs. But his performance in televised debates in October won him support from a lot of people who like his unconventional style -- or didn’t much like Fung or Raimondo, who won the race. The day after the election, Healey told Providence Journal columnist Edward Fitzpatrick that he spent just $36.29 on his campaign. He made a similar claim on WPRO, where morning host Gene Valicenti congratulated him on his strong showing. "Thank you. For 35, for 38 bucks, not bad," Healey said. "I probably should have spent twice as much. I would have doubled my numbers and maybe be the governor." Valicenti joked that he didn't count gas money. "I know," Healey responded. "(But) I had to go there anyway." The Moderate Party candidate -- who also founded the Cool Moose Party -- has cited similar numbers in other venues. That prompted a reader to question the accuracy of Healey's statements. "Someone had to spend money for those garish signs over I-195. And those signs weren't cheap," the reader said. Indeed, there were more than a few Healey signs throughout the state. We decided to check. Healey's most recent filing with the Rhode Island Board of Elections, for the period ending Oct. 27, 2014, shows that he raised no money and spent nothing during the previous 20 days. His previous report shows that he gave himself $35.31 and spent it all on cell phone expenses. Healey told us the amount jumps to $36.29 when you add the price of the only two purchases he made since his last financial report -- a pair of postage stamps. Filings for the Moderate Party itself show that it spent no money on Healey's race either, at least through Oct. 27. So where did the money for the signs come from? Healey said a lot of supporters downloaded the public-domain images of him and his artwork from his website "so anybody could produce anything." They printed their own. In addition, a local sign maker printed up his own signs and sold them at cost. The candidate also recycled signs from his past campaigns for lieutenant governor. "We just crossed out the word 'lieutenant' and gave those away," said Healey. He also painted a campaign message on the wall of a building using old black paint. He initially had trouble opening the cans of Rust-Oleum paint because the covers had rusted shut. "I found that rather ironic. They should make cans that don't rust," he said. In the end, "I didn't spend any money on signs. Not at all," Healey asserted. In addition, "people printed up a ton of T-shirts. I don't know what people did with them. But we're creating small business in Rhode Island. We're giving people jobs." "We recycled everything -- anything I could cross out the word 'lieutenant.' We recycled buttons. We had some old bumper stickers from when I ran for governor in '98. In the attic, I found a case of Cool Moose combs, which I had in '86. Yardsticks," he said. And did he have any leftover condoms? "We did, but they all expired in 2003. We didn't want to be giving out expired condoms." So when Robert Healey says he spent only about $36 on his campaign, all the evidence points to a truly shoestring operation. We rate his claim as True.

pomt-06789	"Josh Mandel used to be pro-choice, now he’s anti-choice. He used to be sympathetic towards gay and lesbians and now he’s [not]."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2011/aug/16/ted-strickland/former-ohio-gov-ted-strickland-raps-josh-mandel-fl/	Former Gov. Ted Strickland recently pulled a page from the Ohio Democratic Party’s playbook to attack Josh Mandel, the Republican state treasurer who now appears to be running for the U.S. Senate. Mandel, 33, hasn’t formally announced his candidacy but is raising money for the race and taking shots from Democrats as if he’s an official candidate. Mandel, a former state legislator from Lyndhurst, has his eye on the seat held by Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Avon. Strickland took up for his fellow Democrat in a recent interview with Politico, a national political news website. Strickland framed Mandel as a candidate willing to shift his ideals to further his political career. Strickland told Politico that Mandel – whose likely Senate run has gained the support of the Senate Conservatives Fund – has not always been so staunchly conservative. "Josh Mandel used to be pro-choice, now he’s anti-choice," Strickland said. "He used to be sympathetic towards gay and lesbians and now he’s [not]." Democrats have portrayed Mandel as a political opportunist going back to his run last year for state treasurer, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Strickland’s claim to see if Mandel is the shape-shifter his opponents have made him out to be. Let’s slice Strickland’s attack in half, examining the accuracy of each claim. There is no question Mandel is now anti-abortion. He has endorsed the "heartbeat bill," a controversial proposed law banning abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can occur as early as six weeks into a pregnancy. When asked about Strickland’s comments, a spokesman for Mandel’s campaign said, "Josh has always been solidly pro-life and believes all innocent human life should be protected." When we talked to Strickland, he said that Mandel seemed to grow more stringent in his anti-abortion views over time, culminating with his support of the heartbeat bill. Mandel supported exceptions to anti-abortion laws for cases of rape and incest, according to an Ohio Right to Life 2006 candidate survey. On a similar survey two years later, he didn’t list those exceptions to qualify his support for anti-abortion laws. Ultimately, Strickland said he has no evidence to show Mandel ever supported abortion rights. "I’m just going to have to be straight with you, I can’t give you a document or recording that supports what I said," Strickland said. So Strickland’s claim that Mandel used to be "pro-choice" is unsupported. But did Mandel change course on his support for the gay community? When we asked the former governor to back up that part of his statement, Strickland cited quotes from Mandel when he was involved in student government in college, and compared those words with Mandel’s more recent legislative voting record. Mandel was president of the undergraduate student government while he attended Ohio State University. In April 2000, the student government voted to support a domestic partnership plan to allow qualified students to buy student health insurance for their domestic partners, according to The Lantern, Ohio State’s student newspaper. Mandel supported the plan at the time. "The undergraduate student government representatives have been and will continue to advocate for domestic partner benefits in public and private settings," Mandel told The Lantern. "Students want it, students deserve it and the university has a responsibility to provide it." Despite his support for domestic partner benefits in 2000, Mandel nine years later voted against a bill to shield gay and transgender Ohioans from being discriminated against in housing and employment issues. House Bill 176 sought to add sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of classifications for which it is illegal to discriminate for housing, employment and public-accommodation purposes. The bill passed the Democrat-controlled House by a vote of 56-39, with five Republicans joining Democrats to support the measure. But the bill did not go anywhere in the Republican-controlled Senate. Mandel voted against the bill. He was not among a handful of Republicans to explain their vote on the House floor that day. Mandel’s campaign now says he was wrong in college. "Josh has always opposed discrimination against any American citizen and has also always believed that marriage is between one man and one woman," his spokesman, Anthony Conchel, said in a statement. "He also feels he was wrong in college about domestic partner benefits and feels strongly that they should never be funded with taxpayer dollars." So where does that leave us? Strickland claimed Mandel reversed his stances on two social issues – abortion and gay rights. On the latter, Mandel’s legislative voting record and recent statements do not match up with his position in college, and the treasurer now says he was wrong in college. Mandel said he’s always held the same view on abortion rights, and Strickland cannot prove otherwise. So we have to conclude Strickland was wrong there. On the Truth-O-Meter, that two-part statement rates a Half True.	None	Ted Strickland	None	None	None	2011-08-16T10:45:00	2011-07-26	['None']
pomt-06011	"[The] ACLU and atheists in Denver are demanding the NFL stop [Tim Tebow] from praying on the sidelines."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jan/18/john-depetro/talk-radio-host-john-depetro-american-civil-libert/	WPRO radio host John DePetro was chatting on Jan. 13 with Cranston School Committee member Frank Lombardi about the U.S. District Court order to remove a Christian prayer posted on the wall of a high school auditorium when talk turned to football and freedom of expression. With the playoff game between New England Patriots and the Denver Broncos looming, DePetro lamented that things have gotten so bad, "There are atheists in Denver and they're asking the NFL to stop Tim Tebow from praying on the sideline." Lombardi agreed and DePetro went on, bringing the American Civil Liberties Union into the mix. "Look at the mindset you're dealing with," the radio host said. "ACLU and atheists in Denver are demanding the NFL stop him from praying on the sidelines. He's not forcing anyone to join him. He's off in the zone. You see players sitting with their head down. He happens to kneel on one knee. But that is the mindset we're dealing with in 2012." Lombardi joined in, saying he's "concerned about the slippery slope. Where does it end? . . . I don't know where it ends. I'm certainly troubled by Tim Tebow's situation where you're going to regulate private behavior. I think that goes against everything that we stand for." Even we thought that atheists and the ACLU would be guilty of a personal foul if they were trying to get the Broncos’ quarterback in trouble for committing prayer interference. So we went to Google to search for stories about the ACLU-atheist demand to the NFL. We came up empty-handed. So we contacted DePetro. He sent us links to two web pages. The first was a story by the CBS affiliate in Denver headlined "Atheist Group Believes Tebow 'Full Of Crap' With Public Display of Christianity." It quotes David Silverman, president of a New Jersey-based group, American Atheists, and makes no reference to any demand to the NFL or any reference to the ACLU. The second was from the Bad Catholic blog on Patheos.com criticizing Silverman's comments. Again, no reference to any demand to the NFL and no reference at all to the ACLU. We asked Patrick Smyth, executive director of media relations for the Broncos about DePetro's statement. "This is the first I've heard of that," he said. "No, not aware of this," said NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy. "We haven't made any demands," said Silverman, president of the atheist organization. "No law is being broken. He has the right to do it. We think he's wrong to exercise his right this way. But we don't have the right to demand anything because the NFL is a private enterprise. It's like demanding someone say Merry Christmas versus Happy Holidays." Finally, we called the ACLU of Colorado, where spokeswoman Rosemary Harris Lytle said DePetro's statement was not true. "The ACLU would never demand that anyone stop praying. A lot of our work is standing up for [religious] rights, even for people some of us would consider extremists," she said. "We would stand for religious liberty and religious diversity for people of all faith backgrounds" as long as it doesn't violate the separation of church and state. (In fact, the ACLU has a web page devoted to highlighting cases it has supported to protect the rights of individuals to practice or express their religion.) Our ruling Talk radio host John DePetro said, while discussing quarterback Tim Tebow, that the "ACLU and atheists in Denver are demanding the NFL stop him from praying on the sidelines." DePetro's evidence consisted of two web pages that make no such claim. And given the ACLU's history of defending an individual's right to practice his or her religion, the idea that the organization would try to block Tebow from praying when he's not bothering anyone or disrupting a game is ridiculous We've seen the light. It's not from a burning bush. It's from a Pants On Fire! (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter. To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on our PolitiFact Rhode Island Facebook page.)

pomt-13139	Says "Morgan Carroll opposed requiring convicted sex offenders to register their online profiles, making it harder to track online sex offenders and child predators."	mostly false	/colorado/statements/2016/nov/01/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-morgan-carroll-voted-against-tracking-ch/	The rating of this fact-check has been changed since it was first published. See editor's note at the bottom. The dogfight over Colorado’s 6th Congressional District is getting nastier as Election Day nears. The National Republican Congressional Committee hammered U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman’s Democratic opponent, state Sen. Morgan Carroll, with two ads echoing the same theme: She was weak on enforcement of sexual predators in the state Legislature. The suburban Denver district is one the of most hotly contested battlegrounds in the nation. We examined an ad called "The Only One," which features a chorus of women condemning Carroll’s actions on two bills. "Morgan Carroll opposed requiring convicted sex offenders to register their online profiles, making it harder to track online sex offenders and child predators," two women say. "And Morgan Carroll was the only one to vote against tougher penalties for child predators using the internet," another woman says. "The only one...the only one...the only one," several women chime in. The NRCC ad cherry-picked votes Carroll made against bills she considered flawed. The ad also leaves out that Carroll voted for House passage of the legislation after she believed it had been improved. We’re fact-checking the statement that "Morgan Carroll opposed requiring convicted sex offenders to register their online profiles, making it harder to track online sex offenders and child predators." In support of the claim, the NRCC pointed to a 2007 bill that Carroll voted on several times as a state representative. The bill sought to require convicted sex offenders register all their email addresses, instant-messaging identities and chat-room identities with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation. It would have also required the CBI to include the information on the Colorado Crime Information Center database, which is shared with state criminal justice agencies. The measure had the support of Colorado Attorney General John Suthers and the Boys and Girls Clubs of Metro Denver. But Democratic lawmakers -- and even some technology experts -- questioned the three-page bill’s enforceability. "You can create a brand new email address in minutes," Steve Walden, an executive at Pitney Bowes Group 1 Software, told the Denver Post at the time. "I think the intent here is that various chat-room communities can flag these users while they're online," said Walden, whose firm developed software that allows people to use online maps to see how close they live to registered sex offenders. "The Internet is one of those domains where they can roam with complete anonymity. Tying an email address to a person is a very difficult thing to do." Carroll campaign spokesman Drew Godinich said she was all for tracking sex offenders online, but she believed flaws in the bill would allow predators to evade detection. "There was no provision in the email portion of the bill that would guarantee that someone's email address actually belonged to that person. If someone had to register as a sex offender, they could -- under this bill -- create an email under a fake name and there was no enforcement," Godinich said. After the bill's enforceability was questioned by lawmakers and during public testimony at a committee hearing, Carroll voted with other Democrats to kill it. What the NRCC ad doesn't mention is that three weeks later, a new, more comprehensive bill for online tracking of sex offenders was introduced. The bill required that law enforcement agencies "make a reasonable effort to verify all email addresses provided by the (sex offender)." It also required that the registration form a sex offender must fill out contains a warning that providing false information for their email, instant-messaging and chat-room identities "may constitute a misdemeanor or felony offense." Carroll joined a bipartisan group of 59 lawmakers in voting for final House passage of the stronger bill (HB07-1326). The ad leaves out that inconvenient fact. However, there was another twist. The Senate stripped out the House language requiring law enforcement to verify the email addresses a sex offender registers. So Carroll voted against the weakened conference committee bill that became law. Carroll's spokesman said she supported sex offender tracking but voted against the bill that weakened enforcement of tracking. NRCC spokesman Zach Hunter told us, "While legislating may be a messy process, when Morgan Carroll was faced with the binary choice of supporting or opposing legislation that would require convicted sex offenders to register their online profiles, Carroll opposed the bill. If all legislators had voted like Carroll, the bill would have failed and no further protections for our most vulnerable would have become law." A word about the second claim While the ad's second claim — "Morgan Carroll was the only one to vote against tougher penalties for child predators using the internet" — is not on the Truth-O-Meter, it’s worth reviewing because it’s also misleading. It refers to a 2009 bill that sought to update the state law against internet luring of a child to include texting and instant-messaging. It also would have allowed a judge to consider a defendant's prior sex offense convictions in other states when weighing the severity of sentencing. The bill passed the House. When it came to the Senate Judiciary Committee, where Carroll was serving, she joined the unanimous vote to advance the bill. Then the sausage-making of legislation got messy. Two Republican senators each successfully added an amendment to the bill, which passed in the initial Senate floor vote. One amendment would have increased the penalty for failing to register as a sex offender. The other amendment would have added prohibitions against providing sexually explicit material -- pornography -- to children. Carroll objected to the amendments, saying they violated the Colorado Constitution’s requirement that each bill only contain a single subject, which must be clearly expressed in the bill title, her spokesman said. The purpose of the constitutional provision is in part to prevent "log-rolling," where lawmakers bundle together unrelated measures to win votes for passage, according to the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Legal Services. Carroll also argued that the bill needed a new fiscal note because the amendments would boost its cost, Godinich added. This is how Carroll became the lone vote against final Senate passage of the bill. But it didn't end there. The House rejected the Senate amendments. And a conference committee, where lawmakers iron out the two chambers' differences on a bill, stripped out the amendments. In the end, Carroll voted with unanimous Senate passage (HB09-1163) of the original bill to increase penalties for online child predators -- which the TV ad, again, failed to mention. Our ruling The NRCC said, "Morgan Carroll opposed requiring convicted sex offenders to register their online profiles, making it harder to track online sex offenders and child predators." The NRCC blows one of Carroll's committee votes out of proportion to make it sound like she was philosophically against this policy. Carroll did vote to kill the orginal sex offender bill in committee, because she -- along with other Democrats -- said the bill lacked language to prevent a sex offender from creating an email address with a fake name to evade tracking. But she voted for successful passage of another tracking bill with teeth when it was in the House. It required law enforcement to verify a sex offender's email addresses, and it carried criminal penalties for anyone who provides false information about their email or other online identities. When that bill came back from the Senate, the tougher enforcement measures had been stripped out, and Carroll voted against it. The NRCC ad ultimately distorts Carroll's position by saying she opposed making sex offenders register their online profiles when she actually fought for tougher enforcement. We rate this statement Mostly False. Editor's note: This fact-check originally posted with a rating of False. Shortly after publication, the NRCC pointed out Carroll's vote against the final measure when it came back from the Senate, which we did not consider. We updated the piece and revised the rating. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/967b2e0d-12c3-4508-9b55-838e2db70b9c	None	National Republican Congressional Committee	None	None	None	2016-11-01T15:24:27	2016-11-25	['None']
pomt-00185	"The House GOP super PAC in DC is spending more to help my opponent than anyone else."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/19/paul-davis/no-super-pacs-arent-spending-most-amount-money-boo/	As we close in on the last month before the midterms, the ad wars continue to escalate. Political groups are pouring money into congressional districts to make their candidates look good, or more often, opposing candidates to look bad. It is going on all over the country, but Paul Davis’ campaign claims that an outside GOP PAC is spending the most in Kansas’ 2nd Congressional District. In a recent tweet, Davis, the Democrat running for the seat that includes Topeka, Lawrence and communities west of Kansas City, said that "the House GOP super PAC in DC is spending more to help my opponent than anyone else." It is true that the Congressional Leadership Fund - the leading GOP super PAC affiliated with House Republican leadership - is pouring money into the district, but the Davis campaign is exaggerating. Davis is one of the top targets of the super PAC, but he's not No. 1. Here, we look at just how much is being funneled into the district from CLF and how it measures up to other House races around the country. What the Davis campaign says The Davis campaign told us the claim is based off a CNN report released in late September. In the report, CNN examined the top districts where the Congressional Leadership Fund was spending its money on ad buys. It found that, as of Sept. 21 (when the report was published), CLF had poured $1.9 million into the district, nabbing the top spot on its list. Colorado’s 6th Congressional District and California’s 48th followed with $1.6 million and $1.5 million spent by CLF. Most of the television advertising were attacks on Democrats. This is definitely visible in KS-2. In September alone, the PAC aired four attack ads against Davis. How much is actually being spent in the district by outside groups and CLF We checked the OpenSecrets.org database, a widely cited campaign finance tracking resource published by the Center for Responsive Politics. Interestingly, the database shows that so far in the race, CLF has spent more than $3.2 million, nearly double CNN’s estimate, but still doesn’t list the district as the top one for the group's spending. Besides more than $6 million spent attacking Jon Ossoff, who lost to Republican U.S. Rep. Karen Handel in a 2017 special election, the top Democrat CLF is spending against is Democrat Joe Radinovich, who is running against Republican candidate Pete Stauber in Minnesota's 8th District. So far, CLF has spent nearly $3.9 million against him. But while Davis isn't the top Democrat that CLF is spending money against (he comes in at No. 7), the KS-2 race overall takes 4th place when factoring in the money the super PAC has spent in support of Watkins. Races CLF $ Against Democrats CLF $ For Republicans Total $ Spent 1. California 39th $3,839,570 $94,442 $3,934,012 2. Minnesota 8th $3,893,273 $8,660 $3,901,933 3. California 25th $2,880,372 $584,715 $3,465,087 4. Kansas 2nd $2,937,462 $390,063 $3,327,525 5. California 45th $3,068,325 $241,959 $3,310,284 6. New York 27th $3,013,190 $117,732 $3,130,922 7. Pennsylvania 18th $3,077,399 $1,047 $3,078,446 8. California 10th $3,067,550 $6,153 $3,073,703 9. California 48th $2,791,949 $80,687 $2,872,636 10. Minnesota 3rd $2,664,035 $63,944 $2,727,979 Our ruling The Davis campaign says that the House GOP super PAC is spending more to help out Watkins than anyone else. The Republican Super PAC is airing a torrent of attack ads against Davis and spending a lot of money in the district. But records show that Davis is not the top taget for CLF, though the district is listed among the top 5. Still, that doesn’t make Watkins the top recipient of such efforts.

pomt-00419	Says "96 percent of (Google News) results on ‘Trump News’ are from National Left-Wing Media."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/29/donald-trump/no-96-google-news-stories-trump-arent-left-wing-ou/	In a pair of early-morning tweets, President Donald Trump took aim at Google’s system of search results, saying it was biased against outlets that are friendly to him. In two successive tweets on Aug. 28 (later deleted and reposted to correct a spelling error) Trump wrote: "Google search results for ‘Trump News’ shows only the viewing/reporting of Fake New Media. In other words, they have it RIGGED, for me & others, so that almost all stories & news is BAD. Fake CNN is prominent. Republican/Conservative & Fair Media is shut out. Illegal? 96% of … results on ‘Trump News’ are from National Left-Wing Media, very dangerous. Google & others are suppressing voices of Conservatives and hiding information and news that is good. They are controlling what we can & cannot see. This is a very serious situation-will be addressed!" See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The part where Trump said that 96 percent of "results on ‘Trump News’ are from National Left-Wing Media" caught our eye. A close look at the source of the statistic suggests that Trump’s figure is dubious. Where does the figure come from? The White House didn’t respond to an inquiry. The 96 percent figure appears to come from a post on PJ Media, a conservative site. The Aug. 25 story had attracted some attention in conservative media circles before getting picked up by Trump. "Is Google manipulating its algorithm to prioritize left-leaning news outlets in their coverage of President Trump?" Paula Bolyard, PJ Media’s supervising editor, wrote in the article. "It sure looks that way based on recent search results for news on the president." To test the premise, Bolyard performed a Google search for "Trump" using the search engine's "News" tab and analyzed the results using a media bias chart. Of 76 total stories, most came from outlets such as CNN, the Washington Post and NBC. Only three came up from the Wall Street Journal, which is labeled right-leaning by the chart. Bolyard wrote that she repeated her search "multiple times using different computers (registered to different users) and Google returned similar results." Bolyard acknowledged that while the study is "not scientific," though she did conclude that "the results suggest a pattern of bias against right-leaning content." But this conclusion is debatable, and Trump’s reporting of the results is more problematic still. Factors that go into Google searches There is broad agreement that the factors that go into Google’s algorithms for news searches are opaque. And the lack of transparency can allow theories about ideological bias to flourish. They "depend on a lot of factors, including what other people are searching for, what they're clicking on, what sites link to a given search result, whether the website is optimized for mobile, and even whether the site supports encrypted HTTPS," said Jeremy Gillula, tech policy director at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. "But with all that said, Google's search algorithms are still a black box, and we'd prefer if Google gave users more information and control over the factors that influence search results." In a statement, Google said that ideological factors do not play a role in its algorithms. "When users type queries into the Google Search bar, our goal is to make sure they receive the most relevant answers in a matter of seconds," the statement said. "Search is not used to set a political agenda, and we don't bias our results toward any political ideology. Every year, we issue hundreds of improvements to our algorithms to ensure they surface high-quality content in response to users' queries. We continually work to improve Google Search and we never rank search results to manipulate political sentiment." Even if one considers Google’s algorithmic factors to be "biases," that doesn’t necessarily mean they are ideological biases. Searches, for instance, are widely believed to favor newer content and original sources rather than aggregations. At the very least, there should be a fair amount of variability in search results over time. A study made during one snapshot in time, such as the one published in PJ Media, will not produce the same results a few hours later, as new articles come online. Bolyard, in an email interview with PolitiFact, noted that she mentioned some of the caveats in her article. In the article, she cautioned that "factors such as the relevance of the topic, the design of the website, internal and external links, and the way articles are written and formatted all can affect a site's Google traffic. Google is constantly tweaking their algorithm, and a website's traffic prospects can rise or fall depending on the changes." However, Trump made no indication in his tweets that the findings could be chalked up to anything beyond ideological bias. Rating news outlets’ ideology A more problematic aspect of the study is the metric used to label websites. To determine "left" and "right," Bolyard used a chart of media outlets assembled by Sharyl Attkisson, a former CBS correspondent who hosts the Sunday morning program "Full Measure" for Sinclair Broadcasting, a network of local stations that has taken a pro-Trump editorial stance. Here’s the version of the chart Bolyard linked to: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The chart is not neutral evidence supporting Trump’s point, and it labels anything not overtly conservative as "left. In the "left" category are such rigorously mainstream outlets as the Associated Press and Reuters. The three big broadcast networks — ABC, NBC, CBS — are considered "left," as are the Washington Post and the New York Times. Other media outlets that produce a large amount of content every day, including CNN, NPR, Politico, USA Today, and CNBC, are labeled "left." This means that most of media entities that produce large amounts of widely read and cited news content -- factors that might well give them a leg up in the Google algorithm -- are defined by the chart, and thus by the PJ Media study, as "left-wing." So, by its design, the study guarantees that an enormous percentage of Trump news coverage would falls into what the chart defines as "left." Full disclosure: PolitiFact and its owner, the Poynter Institute, are both listed on the chart as left of center. We actually consider ourselves not to have an ideological leaning. "It’s a ‘study’ designed to come up with the outcome it came up with, and it did just that," Chip Stewart, a professor at Texas Christian University’s Bob Schieffer College of Communication. Moreover, the "left" category lumps these large-staffed, comprehensive news outlets in with genuinely liberal-to-left outlets, such as the Daily Kos, Salon, the Nation, Huffington Post, Talking Points Memo, and Media Matters. A more revealing comparison would be to compare search results of truly left-wing sites vs. truly right-wing sites. In a written description of the chart, Attkisson acknowledged that the graphic is "subjective" and writes that "position on the chart doesn’t necessarily imply credibility or lack thereof. Sources on far right and far left have, in many instances, produced excellent, factually correct information at times." Bolyard agreed that "any chart that attempts to quantify media bias is going to be inherently subjective." But she added that "while it may be fair to quibble with Attkisson's assertion about how far left-of-center some major media outlets are, I think it's entirely fair to say that outlets like NBC, the New York Times, and CNN skew to the left, especially in their coverage of the president." Stewart, however, rejected the notion that the algorithm has ideological bias. "A far more plausible explanation is that the items that drive the algorithm — links, shares, etc. — are more common among the so-called liberal publications, which have a long track record of credible journalism and try to cater to a wider audience," he said. Either way, Trump used the 96 percent figure without taking into account any of these methodological concerns. Our ruling Trump tweeted that "96 percent of (Google News) results on ‘Trump News’ are from National Left-Wing Media." This figure is based on a non-scientific study from a conservative website that categorized any media outlet not expressly conservative as being part of the "left." These outlets include wire services, broadcast networks and most major newspapers and collectively account for a large percentage of original news reports produced in the United States. The methodology essentially preordains that a large percentage of coverage captured by Google will be what the study defines as "left," which is wrong. We rate the statement False.

pomt-14286	Says Erv Nelson voted "yes on the pro-amnesty SJR 21, a bill urging Congress to provide citizenship for those residing illegally in our country."	mostly true	/nevada/statements/2016/apr/05/victoria-seaman/immigration-debate-enters-key-nevada-state-senate-/	The federal immigration debate is turning into a down-ballot issue in Nevada. Assembly freshmen Erv Nelson and Victoria Seaman are entwined in an ugly Republican primary battle for a critical state Senate seat that holds the potential to tip the balance in the 11-10 Republican-controlled state Senate. Seaman has relentlessly attacked Nelson, and one of her campaign flyers accuses him of supporting a "pro-amnesty" immigration bill. "Why did Erv Nelson vote yes on the pro-amnesty SJR 21, a bill urging Congress to provide citizenship for those residing illegally in our country?" Because immigration is an important topic in Nevada — a state with a "top share of unauthorized immigrants" — we wanted to fact-check this claim. The accusation leads back to a resolution approved by bipartisan majorities in both houses of the Legislature in 2015: Senate Joint Resolution 21. Nelson voted for the resolution, while Seaman and 10 other Assembly Republicans voted "no." It passed unanimously in the Senate. The only Assembly member to comment on the resolution’s passage was Republican Michele Fiore, who called it a "warm and fuzzy feel-good bill" only to be used for "political benefit" in future elections. "Since it basically does nothing, I urge my fellow colleagues to support SJR 21," she said during a marathon Assembly session shortly before midnight on May 22, 2015. The resolution is straightforward. It’s little more than two pages listing facts about immigration and urging Congress to take up the issue, and to include "earned legal residency accompanied by a clear path to citizenship." It rehashes similar legislation also approved by bipartisan majorities in 2013. So claiming Nelson voted for a bill that included support for a pathway to citizenship is accurate, as the resolution clearly spells out. But calling the resolution "pro-amnesty" is harder to prove. In response to questions from PolitiFact, Seaman’s campaign sent a two-page letter arguing that a pathway to citizenship is equal to amnesty, as "citizenship is a measure of permanent legal relief targeted at a specific group of people." Use of the word "amnesty" in immigration policy is contentious, and there’s no agreed upon metric by which the word should be used. PolitiFact did look into use of the word "amnesty" by Republicans critical of President Barack Obama’s proposed immigration policies in 2011 and 2012, but it’s much more difficult due to differences in the 1,200-page immigration bill in 2013 and the two-page resolution approved by lawmakers in 2015. In general, amnesty is defined as granting permanent immunity from punishment for a group of people who have broken the law. It’s true that granting citizenship to people not legally in the country would prevent punishments like deportation and broadly serve as "amnesty", but the resolution is just so vague that it’s difficult to call it "pro-amnesty." A 2011 PolitiFact check found that use of the politically charged word is "debatable and so charged it should come with a lot more explanation." The resolution additionally doesn’t really do anything other than, in the words of one supporter, "send a strong message to Congress" to take up immigration reform. Nelson didn’t answer multiple calls seeking comment, but neither candidate played much of a role on any of the 2015 bills that could have actually affected the undocumented immigrant community. Both lawmakers voted for a successful measure making it easier for immigrants with temporary legal status to get a teacher’s license in Nevada. And neither Seaman nor Nelson played a role in a measure prohibiting contractors from hiring unauthorized immigrants, which failed to pass out of committee. Ultimately, there just isn’t a lot that state-level lawmakers can do on immigration policy outside of "symbolic" gestures like the immigration reform resolution, as it’s almost entirely a federally managed issue. Nevada did approve driver authorization cards for people not legally in the country in 2013, but neither Seaman nor Nelson was in office at the time. It’s worth noting that Seaman appears to have voted for the resolution during an earlier committee meeting, according to legislative records requested by PolitiFact. A video of the meeting is online, but it’s difficult to tell if she’s present during the voice vote. That isn’t necessarily an endorsement, as many lawmakers will vote to get legislation out of committee to the floor so more lawmakers can weigh in. Seaman’s campaign manager claims she was not in the room during the vote. Our ruling Seaman says Nelson voted "yes on the pro-amnesty SJR 21, a bill urging Congress to provide citizenship for those residing illegally in our country." To be clear, the "bill" was actually a resolution that holds no teeth. It calls for a pathway to citizenship for people not legally in the country. But it's too vague to blankly say it falls under the "amnesty" umbrella, and just doesn’t mean much in the grand scheme of the immigration debate. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-01366	"Elorza wants to teach our public school children about the ‘non-existence of God.’"	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/19/Local-799-international-assoc-fire-fighters/providence-firefighters-union-says-elorza-wants-te/	"Extremist." That’s one of the ways the Providence firefighters union describes Democratic mayoral candidate Jorge Elorza in a recent mailing to city residents. The mailer was sent out in early October 2014, by Local 799 of the International Association of Fire Fighters, which has endorsed Elorza’s opponent, Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci Jr., in the race for mayor. It listed three reasons to vote against Elorza. The first? He lacks experience. The second? Elorza, the firefighters say, supports a municipal income tax. PolitiFact Rhode Island examined this claim when it was made by Cianci last month and ruled it False. The third? "Elorza wants to teach our public school children about the ‘non-existence of God,’" the piece said. The basis for the claim is cited in the mailer: an article that Elorza, a law professor and former Housing Court judge, had published in the University of Pittsburgh Law Review in 2010. The 54-page article, "Secularism and the Constitution: Can Government Be Too Secular?," sets out to answer a question. "If scientific evidence leads us to conclude that a particular aspect of God cannot be true, can this be taught in the public schools?" wrote Elorza, who is on a leave of absence from Roger Williams University School of Law, where he teaches constitutional law and other subjects. The article defines four views of God: the atheist view in which God does not exist; the deist view, which holds that God created the universe but has no influence on daily events; the theist view, which holds that God is not only the creator but also an intervenor in the world’s affairs; and what Elorza calls the "memist" view in which God lays down a moral code but "resides entirely in the minds of its adherents." Elorza focuses on the theist view, arguing that it violates the laws of physics. Science, he says, proves that the theist God does not exist. And U.S. courts have generally ruled that something can be taught in the public schools that may contradict a religious belief if science supports it. Evolution is one example that Elorza gives. As for the three other views of God, Elorza makes it clear that their existence cannot be proven one way or another. Thus, no argument can be made to support teaching that they do not exist, and doing so would violate the Constitution, according to Elorza. So what is his answer to the question that he posed at the beginning of the article? "I conclude, first, that teaching that the theist God does not exist would not violate any of the underlying values and second, that the consequences of doing so are not as far-reaching as may be initially believed," Elorza wrote. Elorza may have concluded, in his lengthy academic paper, that it is legally defensible to teach the non-existence of one particular aspect of God, but nowhere in the article does he say that he wants schools to teach it. Much has been written by others on local blogs on this subject (see here and here), but we couldn’t find any public statements made by Elorza advocating for schools to adopt the position. In fact, he said just the opposite during a WPRI-12 debate in August, when asked by reporter Ted Nesi about the law review article. "I don’t seek to have this be taught in the public schools," Elorza said. "This is a hypothetical that I laid out over 60 pages in an academic article." "And it’s not something that you would seek to implement in the Providence schools?" Nesi asked. "Absolutely not," Elorza replied. (See the exchange here, starting at 28:40.) Derek Silva, secretary of the firefighters’ union, told us that Elorza is now trying to distance himself from the article. When we contacted Elorza’s campaign, his spokesman, David Ortiz, defended the candidate. "Jorge was raised Christian," Ortiz said in an email. "He believes in God. He does not want to teach atheism in schools, and has never made that suggestion anywhere." Our ruling The Providence firefighters union says that Jorge Elorza is an extremist who wants public schools to teach that God does not exist. But their only evidence is a misreading of a 2010 academic article Elorza wrote. Nowhere in the 54-page article does Elorza say he wants public schools to teach that there is no God. Elorza has said repeatedly that’s not his view and we could find no public statements by him that suggest otherwise. This is an inflammatory claim that has no basis in fact. It’s a good thing the firefighters union has experience dealing with flames, because we rule this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-02730	The United States is "behind many countries in Europe in terms of the ability of every kid in America to get ahead."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/19/steven-rattner/it-easier-obtain-american-dream-europe/	Oh, sweet America, ye land of opportunity, home to the time-tested formula in which hard work + perseverance = success, in spite of family background. Or not. The new reality, as described in a Dec. 16, 2013, discussion on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, is it’s harder than ever for Americans born into low-income families to advance up the economic ladder. Middle-class economic growth is stunted compared to other parts of the developed world, and it’s hard for people to work their way out of poverty, said Steven Rattner, a Morning Joe economic analyst and former Treasury Department official who oversaw the restructuring of the auto industry under President Barack Obama. "We have fallen way back," Rattner said. "We're behind many countries in Europe in terms of the ability of every kid in America to get ahead. It's a real problem." Why is that? host Joe Scarborough asked. They talked about the globalization of the job market and increased poverty. Rattner’s statement betrays our classic view of the American Dream. Is his point accurate? Rattner researcher Sundas Hashmi directed us to reports that bolster Rattner’s statement. The takeaway: The American rags-to-riches story is more out of reach than ever, possibly responsible for restricting economic growth. The Great Gatsby Curve We last heard a version of this talking point from the president himself, who spoke at length recently about the dangerous consequences for America if income inequality continues to rise and income mobility decreases. "In fact, statistics show not only that our levels of income inequality rank near countries like Jamaica and Argentina, but that it is harder today for a child born here in America to improve her station in life than it is for children in most of our wealthy allies, countries like Canada or Germany or France," Obama said. "They have greater mobility than we do, not less." Alan Krueger, former chairman of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers, explained the connection between economic mobility and income as the "Great Gatsby Curve," named after the novel about Prohibition-era upper-class excess by F. Scott Fitzgerald. Families at all earning levels were growing together after World War II but have been growing apart since in the decades since, Krueger wrote. The country’s top earners have pulled a lot further ahead than the middle and lower class, he said, and the trend line suggests the future earnings of today’s children will be tied more and more to the income level of their parents. "Not since the Roaring 20s has the share of income going to the very top reached such high levels," Krueger said, according to prepared remarks. Krueger compared income inequality of 10 developed countries with the correlation between a parent’s income and their children’s (it’s more complicated than we described, check out the details in Krueger’s presentation or this Bloomberg infographic). The "Gatsby Curve" showed economic possibilities for children in European countries such as Finland, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Germany and France were much less connected to their parents’ income than in the United States and United Kingdom. Evidence from Pew and others Other research hits similar notes. A 2011 short report by the Pew Charitable Trusts’ Economic Mobility Project described a joint study by researchers from 10 countries who looked at how children’s mobility is connected to their family’s socioeconomic background. They used parents’ education as a measure because it has strong ties to income and offered cross-country comparisons. Of the 10 countries studied, the United States had the strongest link between parents’ education and a child’s economic, educational and socio-emotional outcomes, the study found, more pronounced than in the United Kingdom, France, Germany and Nordic countries, as well as Canada and Australia. "Americans absolutely confirm they believe America is the land of opportunity and that people should have equal opportunity if they have the skills," said Diana Elliott, research officer for the Pew Charitable Trusts’ Economic Mobility Project, in an interview. "The data fly in the face of what Americans have believed and what they say they believe in our polling work." Pew researchers use data from a long-term survey that started tracking 5,000 families in 1968 and follows those parent-child pairs as they form their own households (known as Panel Study of Income Dynamics). Since economic mobility is best measured when people are in their prime working years around age 40, we won’t have a third generation comparison for another decade or two, Elliott said. The United States has a greater degree of "stickiness," in which people at both extremes of the income distribution are likely to stay in the quintile into which they were born, than neighbor Canada, she said, referencing this report. The Brookings Institution and Pew Charitable Trusts teamed up on a 2008 report that analyzed several studies on economic mobility and concluded the following: Cross-country comparisons of relative mobility aren’t always based on perfect data. But the United States is distinct from other countries, research shows, in having "less, not more, intergenerational mobility than do Canada and several European countries." Upward mobility is particularly uncommon for children who are born into families at the lowest income bracket. A previous examination of this issue by PolitiFact Ohio mentioned a 2010 study by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development, a Paris-based think tank with 34 member countries, including the United States. The study found Denmark, Australia, Norway, Finland, Canada, Sweden, Germany, Spain and France out-ranked the U.S. in terms of a child’s ability to earn more than his or her parents. Only Italy and Great Britain had stronger links between a person’s earnings and his or her parents than the U.S. of the 12 countries evaluated. Why is this happening? A 2012 New York Times article that examined five studies about the United States' lagging economic mobility identified the depth of American poverty as one culprit, as the country has a "thinner safety net" than other wealthy nations. Other potential reasons the Times reported include the increased likelihood of poor Americans to be raised by single mothers, decreased unionization, high incarceration rates and the country’s historical racial divide. A college education is one way for children born into the lowest income distribution to move up despite their family background, noted a report by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. But for many born into the poorest bracket, college is out of reach. Just 7 percent of adults whose parents were in the bottom income quintile obtained a college degree. Disagreement, caution and another measure Is it time to ring the alarm? Not yet, say some economists of conservative backgrounds. Among their concerns of the methodology and thrust of some of the research we have described: It is not wise to compare U.S. data with considerably smaller, more homogenous populations in European countries, such as Denmark. The evidence is scant that income inequality is hurting or driving our country’s economic woes. Looking at absolute mobility, or comparing a person’s income to their parents’, reveals a different story than isolating the measure that most of these studies used (that’s relative mobility, or looking at where an adult landed in the income distribution compared to his or her parents). For children born into the lowest quartile, 83 percent made higher family incomes than their parents, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, which examined the same long-term family survey that Pew uses. As a whole, 67 percent of U.S. adults out-earned their parents. Thing is, we don’t have solid comparisons for absolute mobility for other countries, said Donald Schneider, a Heritage researcher who addressed his concerns about international comparisons of economic mobility in a whopping 6,700-word piece. We won’t visit each point here (this is getting long enough -- eat a cookie, you deserve it). Basically, he cautioned the data used for some of these studies is not collected in the same way, and cultural differences could account for some of the income gaps. Plus, he wrote, Americans have to make more money to move from the bottom to the top than in countries such as Denmark. But many see that as the problem, said Julia Isaacs, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute who studied international comparisons of generational income mobility in 2007. More distance means more inequality. "We have more distance from the top to bottom," she said, "and whether that’s a good or bad thing may depend on your point of view." Our ruling Steven Rattner said, the United States is "behind many countries in Europe in terms of the ability of every kid in America to get ahead." Some conservative economists say the comparisons between countries are imperfect, that we need better data, and Americans are doing just fine if you look at their ability to simply out-earn their parents. We don’t know how that compares to European countries. But many studies back up Rattner’s point. Studies show that we are behind "many countries in Europe in terms of the ability of every kid in America to get ahead." Nordic countries have particularly higher rates of income mobility than the United States. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-05193	"As Governor: Romney did not keep public safety funding in line with inflation."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/12/american-bridge-21st-century/democratic-superpac-ad-blasts-romney-record-fundin/	A pro-Democratic super PAC, American Bridge 21st Century, released a Web ad critical of Mitt Romney that attacks his record on public safety as governor of Massachusetts. The ad, unveiled June 7, 2012, features a cartoon image of Romney driving a police car, an image that plays off a recent report that alleges Romney played numerous pranks as a young man, including impersonating a police officer. "Romney might think his pranks are funny, but his record on police issues is no joke," the ad says. The ad offers several specifics on Romney’s tenure, one of which is: "As Governor: Romney did not keep public safety funding in line with inflation." When we contacted American Bridge 21st Century, spokesman Chris Harris said the group used figures from the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center, an affiliate of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which offers a user-friendly budget-tracking tool at its website. The group looked at the category "law and public safety," which shows a decrease for the period 2002 to 2007 when using figures adjusted for inflation for government purchases. The decrease was small -- less than 1 percent cumulatively over the five-year period. But this is only one of the ways to look at the question. In fact, analyzing Massachusetts budget questions is a particularly thorny task. First, determining the proper time frame for judging Romney’s tenure is tricky, since the governor’s term doesn’t line up precisely with the state’s fiscal year. Romney would have had no influence on the 2002 budget, but he would have had responsibility (along with the Legislature) for the second half of the 2003 budget, as well as authority (again, with the Legislature) for 2004, 2005 and 2006, and, finally, for the first half of the 2007 budget. We asked budget experts which time frame would be most appropriate, but there was no consensus. We’ll look at two time spans below. Second, the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center offers two methods for adjusting by inflation -- one for prices of items typically purchased by governments (the one used by American Bridge) and one adjusted for consumer prices overall. We’ll look at both. And third, the category American Bridge used -- "law and public safety" -- isn’t the only one available. Beneath that heading on the budget tool are sub-categories more narrowly targeted toward public safety, including, "law enforcement," "prisons, probation and parole," and "prosecutors." Combining these three categories into one measurement avoids lumping in court operations, many of which stem from civil actions rather than criminal cases. Meanwhile, another line item that sheds some light is "local aid," since many public safety activities in Massachusetts are paid for by localities, partly using revenues handed down from the state. Now let’s look at various combinations of these calculations: Combination of "law enforcement," "prisons, probation and parole," and "prosecutors," adjusted by government-purchase inflation measurement: Fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2007: 5 percent increase Fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2007: 8 percent increase Combination of "law enforcement," "prisons, probation and parole," and "prosecutors," adjusted by overall inflation: Fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2007: 15 percent increase Fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2007: 17 percent increase So, using these figures, Romney’s record actually shows an increase beyond inflation, not a decrease. Local aid, adjusted by government-purchase inflation measurement: Fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2007: 17 percent decrease Fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2007: 3 percent decrease Local aid, adjusted by overall inflation: Fiscal 2002 to fiscal 2007: 9 percent decrease Fiscal 2003 to fiscal 2007: 6 percent increase Romney did cut local aid below the rate of inflation in three out of the four calculations we did. However, local aid is a less precise measurement, since it is allocated in a variety of ways, not just for public safety. Also, because local officials would have a say in how much to fund their own law-enforcement departments, Romney wouldn’t be solely to blame for local law-enforcement cuts made during his tenure. Finally, we should note that a Democrat, Deval Patrick, followed Romney as governor, and his record has been one of contracting spending compared to inflation. Between 2007 and 2012, the combination of "law enforcement," "prisons, probation and parole," and "prosecutors," adjusted for government inflation, plunged by a whopping 17 percent. Our ruling There are ways to fiddle with the numbers so that spending on "public safety" declined compared to inflation while Romney was governor. But there are more ways, and we think more credible ways, to calculate it that show spending increases on Romney’s watch. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-14715	Says U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho said "African Americans should only be given three-fifths of a vote."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2015/dec/30/viral-image/facebook-post-accuses-us-rep-ted-yoho-wanting-stri/	A viral image on Facebook falsely accused U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, R-Fla., of saying black Americans should only have three-fifths of a vote. A curious reader pointed us to the image, which reads: "This guy is Republican Florida Representative Ted Yoho who said this week that African Americans should only be given three-fifths of a vote. He is an elected member of Congress and he actually said that… OUT LOUD. You stay classy Florida." We looked into it and found that there’s no evidence whatsoever that the Republican congressman said that. It appears that the meme’s creator was duped by a satirical website. We learned the image was from a Facebook user in California named Mark Kusler, who based it on a story on Politicalo.com. The website posts some real news, but it also posts satirical stories with exaggerated content. The site includes a "Show Facts" button that allow readers to highlight which parts of their stories are true and which are not. But the viral image — which has been shared more than 3,000 times — does not say any part of its message is untrue. So what’s the real story? On May 20, 2014, liberal website RightWingWatch.org ran a story about video footage from a stop at Berean Baptist Church in Ocala during Yoho’s 2012 congressional campaign (not last week, as the image said). During the appearance, Yoho blasted allowing an uninformed electorate into polling places and decried early voting through absentee ballots. He wrapped up by noting voting laws were much more restrictive in the past. "I’ve had some radical ideas about voting, and it’s probably not a good time to tell them, but you used to have to be a property owner to vote," he said in the video. He didn’t say anything about black voters, but the next day Politicalo.com made it appear Yoho said inner-city black constituents who rented their homes didn’t deserve to have the same voting power. Politicalo included Yoho’s actual comment about being a property owner. Then the site added a made-up quote: "The founding fathers didn’t have early voting, why should we? We need to go back to what the founding fathers intended. No early voting. No absentee voting. No renters voting. And a black man’s vote counts as three-fifths of a white man’s. It’s what God intended." The YouTube video of the appearance cuts off at the point where Yoho would have said the latter comments on Politicalo, which echoed the U.S. Constitution's three-fifths compromise of 1787 that allowed Southern states to count slaves as three-fifths of a person for the sake of representation and taxation. But we found no proof he actually said the United States should make African-American votes count less than white votes. An administrator from Politicalo pointed out to PolitiFact Florida that the quote was not highlighted by the "Show Facts" button, meaning it was fabricated by the post’s writer. People For the American Way, the parent of Right Wing Watch, confirmed to us that Yoho didn't say the things Politicalo added. That’s not to say Yoho’s comment about voters historically being property owners didn’t face some backlash. Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in 2014 that Yoho’s assertions "harken back to another century when Americans were denied their basic rights as citizens" and "should be roundly condemned in the strongest possible terms." Yoho spokesman Brian Kaveney told MSNBC in an email that "the congressman was making a reference to how voting was structured when America was in its infancy (from a historical perspective). He does not believe that this is the way it should be now." Our ruling A viral image said Yoho said "African Americans should only be given three-fifths of a vote." There is no evidence Yoho said anything specifically about black voters in a 2012 campaign appearance in Ocala. The image was taken from a satirical news story on a satire site that twisted Yoho’s words about voting rights to make him appear biased against black voters. While Yoho has talked about reducing early voting, the post goes too far in using a fake quote to make it appear the congressman wants to strip away African Americans' civil rights.

pomt-06458	"Over the last several years, 40 percent (of) the jobs created in Texas were created for illegal aliens."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/19/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-hits-rick-perry-saying-40-percent-texa/	During the Oct. 18, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas, Mitt Romney sought to undermine Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s argument that he’s presided over rapid job creation during his tenure. "If you look over the last several years, 40 percent, almost half the jobs created in Texas, were created for illegal aliens, illegal immigrants," Romney said. Romney was referring to a study titled, "Who Benefited from Job Growth In Texas? A Look at Employment Gains for Immigrants and the Native-Born, 2007 to 2011," published by the Center for Immigration Studies, a research group that supports reducing illegal immigration. The report analyzed U.S. Census Bureau data and found that immigrants, both legal and illegal, "have been the primary beneficiaries" of job growth in Texas since 2007, even though native-born workers accounted for 69 percent of the growth in the state’s working-age population over the same period. Specifically, the report said that, of the jobs created in Texas since 2007, 81 percent were taken by newly arrived immigrant workers, both legal and illegal. In the meantime, the group estimated that about half of the newly arrived immigrants who took jobs in Texas beginning in 2007 were illegal. As a result, the report estimated that about 40 percent of job growth in Texas since 2007 went to newly arrived illegal immigrants. So Romney’s comment described the results of the study pretty faithfully, though it would have been more accurate if he’d referred to jobs "given to illegal aliens," rather than "created for illegal aliens." The study doesn’t suggest that Texas employers were conspiring to create jobs specifically for illegal immigrants, only that illegal immigrants ended up filling them. However, we see two additional issues that call into question the accuracy of the study itself: The 40 percent figure uses gross numbers of immigrants rather than net numbers. The report actually offered calculations using two sets of numbers -- one using the total number of immigrants coming into the state, and the other using that number minus the number of immigrant departures and deaths. Using the net immigrant figure -- the one Romney didn’t use -- results in a lower percentage. The figure using net immigration is about 54 percent. And once you divide that by two to estimate the share for illegal immigrants, the relevant number is about 27 percent, not 40 percent. So Romney has effectively cherry-picked the higher of two percentages offered in the report. Both the 40 percent figure and the 27 percent figure are subject to a wide margin of error. Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer for the Pew Hispanic Center, an independent research organization, said that "there are lots of methodological problems with the CIS study, mainly having to do with the limitations of small sample sizes and the fact that the estimates are determined by taking differences of differences based on small sample sizes." In addition, the assumption that 50 percent of immigrants are illegal is an educated guess, but still a guess. Meanwhile, the Census data used in the report is a longitudinal survey, which means that Census employees check back periodically with the same participants. "How many undocumented folks do you honestly think would be participating in that?" asks Sarah Jane Glynn, a policy analyst with the liberal Center for American Progress. Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, added that the report did not drill deeper into the data than "working age." "Even within the working-age population, it might be the case that the immigrant population may have disproportionately grown in age groups -- say, ages 25-49 -- where employment rates are highest," he said. "A really sophisticated analysis might show that, given the age distribution of net immigrant population growth and net native population growth, immigrants got exactly the proportion of new jobs a good forecaster would predict." Given the data, though, we "just don’t know," he said. The report does acknowledge that "no estimate of illegal immigration is exact." But the methodological shortcomings also weaken the certainty of Romney’s statistic. On balance, we think that both the report’s authors and its critics have reasonable points. In the big picture, we agree with Chuck DeVore -- a conservative critic of the study -- that "trying to draw conclusions about immigration and employment in Texas in isolation from other factors is problematic at best." But we also agree with Mark Krikorian, the Center for Immigration Studies’ executive director, that "even if DeVore prefers a net-to-net comparison, immigrants still got a disproportionate share of new jobs." Our ruling In the debate, Romney cited the report’s headline figure pretty accurately. But he failed to note, first, that it was an estimate subject to significant uncertainty, and second, that the report itself included an alternative -- and arguably more accurate -- measurement that produced a significantly lower figure. That said, the lower figure, even when adjusted for uncertainty, still backs up Romney’s underlying point that illegal immigrants have gained a disproportionate share of new jobs in Texas. It’s just that the number probably isn’t as high as Romney said in the debate. So we rate the statement Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-10-19T12:58:58	2011-10-18	['Texas']

pomt-02850	The U.S. Department of Defense spends $80 million a year on prostate cancer research, $25 million a year on ovarian cancer research and $150 million a year on breast cancer research.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/nov/19/saxby-chambliss/senator-questions-some-areas-defense-budget/	Remember the classic U.S. Army slogan? "We do more by 9 a.m. than most people do all day," a voice said in the famous commercial. What you may not know is that the military is doing some significant multitasking. In addition to chasing down terrorists and conducting humanitarian rescue missions in places such as the Philippines, the Defense Department is also working to prevent and cure some of the deadliest diseases known to mankind. U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., recently said the medical research may not be the best use of Defense Department resources. "What I don’t understand is why the … military is spending $80 million a year on prostate cancer research, why we’re spending $25 million a year on ovarian cancer research and $150 million on breast cancer research. We’re also doing lung cancer research," Chambliss said during a Nov. 7 meeting of the Senate Armed Services Committee. Chambliss wants additional money for the Defense Department, but he says it should be spent wisely. "Now if there are particular needs that the military has regarding military research and there are some, particularly because of the casualties we’ve suffered recently, I can understand it," the senator continued. "But these are types of research that simply have no place in my opinion in (the Defense Department). They ought to be done in (the National Institutes of Health)." Chambliss complained there is little coordination between the research done by the Defense Department and the National Institutes of Health. PolitiFact Georgia was unaware that the Defense Department was doing that kind of research. We’re not early-risers like the Army. We embarked on a mission to determine whether the senator was correct that the military was conducting research on these serious conditions and whether his math was correct about how much in taxpayer dollars it was spending on such work. In late 1992, Congress began to set aside annual funding toward research of various illnesses and diseases to be done by the Defense Department. Some of the research is for conditions that appeared directly related to the battlefield, such as Gulf War Illness and traumatic brain injuries. Other research is for conditions faced by Americans that are not necessarily military-related. The list of conditions includes, as Chambliss noted, breast cancer, lung cancer, ovarian cancer and prostate cancer. As Chambliss told it, the now-deceased Sen. Ted Stevens, an Alaskan Republican, asked for some prostate cancer research dollars to be allocated to the Defense Department. Chambliss said Stevens later realized those funds should be allocated to the NIH. We looked up the most recent funding totals for the various forms of research. The Defense Department Congressionally Directed Medical Research Programs website said $80 million was spent in fiscal year 2013 on prostate cancer research, but the totals were slightly less for the other forms of cancer Chambliss mentioned. The website said $20 million was spent on ovarian cancer research and $120 million on breast cancer research in FY 2013. The 2013 federal fiscal year began Oct. 1, 2012, and ended Sept. 30. Lauren Claffey, a spokeswoman for Chambliss, said he was using numbers for fiscal year 2010. To sum up, Chambliss said the federal government gives the U.S. Department of Defense $80 million a year for prostate cancer research, $25 million a year for ovarian cancer research and $150 million a year for breast cancer research. The senator is correct that there is such a program. The numbers are slightly off for two of the three forms of research. Chambliss used numbers three years older than the most recent material.

pomt-03329	Says last year "13 million (health insurance) rebates went out, in all 50 states. Another 8.5 (million) rebates are being sent out this summer, averaging around 100 bucks each."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/24/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-millions-benefit-insurance-compa/	President Barack Obama is trying to get ahead of a steady rain of attacks on his signature health care reform law, the Affordable Care Act. With House Republicans voting to delay key elements of the law and Americans for Prosperity, a well-funded conservative group, running television ads to stir sentiments against it, Obama focused on health care when he spoke last week at the White House briefing room. Among the changes due to the law, the president touted the tangible benefit of consumer rebates from insurance companies that have spent too much on administrative overhead. "Last year, millions of Americans opened letters from their insurance companies," Obama said. "But instead of the usual dread that comes from getting a bill, they were pleasantly surprised with a check. In 2012, 13 million rebates went out, in all 50 states. Another 8.5 (million) rebates are being sent out this summer, averaging around 100 bucks each." In this fact-check, we examine whether millions of Americans received rebates on the scale the president described. Why we have rebates in the first place Part of the law requires health insurance companies to spend at least 80 percent of each premium dollar to provide care, rather than cover administrative expenses. There’s some wiggle room on the 80 percent, but by and large, this is called the medical loss ratio and people speak of it as the 80/20 rule. If an insurance company spends less than 80 percent, it must send the difference back to the customer. That is the rebate. Most insurers already meet the standard. The Government Accountability Office said that in 2010, two-thirds of the firms passed muster. But behind that figure was an important difference among insurance policies. For companies selling to large employers with over 100 workers, 77 percent were in compliance. For those selling to small employers with 100 or fewer workers, 70 percent met the grade. But in the individual market, where people buy their insurance directly and don’t get it through their employer, only 43 percent of firms met the 80/20 rule. Obama’s numbers At one level, the official data tells all. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services track all rebates and indeed, in 2012, insurance companies returned $1.1 billion to about 12.8 million policy holders. In 2013, the dollars are about half as much and about 8.5 million policyholders benefit. The average rebate is $98, which is pretty close to Obama’s $100. Over 2.7 million households in the individual market received a rebate directly. We should note, though, that 61 percent of the rebate money went to employers. That is to be expected since about 85 percent of all people with private insurance get their coverage through their employer. The employer buys the insurance so the employer gets the rebate. Nearly all the time, the employer and the employee share the cost of health care premiums, and the law requires that the rebate be split proportionately. It gives employers the option to pay workers their share in a lump sum, reduced premiums in the future or "applying the rebate in a manner that benefits its employees." We have not found any government agency that tracks how firms share the rebate. We did find this guidance to employers from the U.S. Labor Department. It said the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) applies and as far as what companies do with the rebate, employers "must act prudently, solely in the interest of the plan participants and beneficiaries." One final point. Individuals saw a rebate check more often than you would expect. These customers represent just 15 percent of the private insurance market. But they made up 32 percent of the households that got rebates. Our ruling Obama said "millions of Americans opened letters from their insurance companies" and got rebates from companies that failed to spend at least 80 percent of premiums on care. Then he talked about 13 million rebates going out last year and about 8.5 million this year. Those numbers are generally accurate. But while Obama gets the numbers right, he left a misleading impression about the rebates going directly to so many people. In fact, more than half of the rebates went to the employers that run health plans for their workers. Federal law says the employers have to use the money on health care, but they can also use it shore up the health plans. So not all of these policy holders are getting $100 directly. For these reasons, we rate Obama's statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2013-07-24T16:36:11	2013-07-18	['None']
pomt-09909	"In Wisconsin, the stimulus paid for a bridge to a bar called Rusty's Backwater Saloon. They've got great burgers, but no new jobs."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jul/07/john-boehner/boehner-ad-says-stimulus-paid-bridge-rustys/	In a hokey Web ad from House Republican leader John Boehner last week, the GOP "releases the dogs on the money trail" to find jobs created by the Obama-backed economic stimulus package. The stimulus was supposed to be all about jobs, according to the folksy narration by Rep. Lynn Westmoreland, R-Ga., "but after five months and billions in debt on our kids and grandkids, where are the jobs?" Here's what the job-sniffing GOP bloodhound Ellie Mae finds: "In Wisconsin, the stimulus paid for a bridge to a bar called Rusty's Backwater Saloon," Westmoreland says. "They've got great burgers, but no new jobs." The 85-foot bridge in question spans Rocky Run, a creek off the Wisconsin River in Stevens Point, Wis. The project to replace the bridge got $840,000 in stimulus money. State bridge inspection reports show the bridge carries an average of 260 vehicles a day. According to Dale Peterson, Portage County assistant highway commissioner, most of the traffic using the bridge is people going to and from the Wisconsin River Golf Course (a public course). It's also used by crews for Consolidated Paper driving to the company's waste treatment plant. And there's a small development going in, about 20 homes, whose residents will use the bridge. That's why the 20-year projections show the average daily usage doubling to nearly 600 cars per day. So what about Rusty's Backwater Saloon? A few of its customers may use the bridge. But not many, according to Peterson and someone we spoke with at the saloon. The main route to Rusty's is via a more direct highway access nearby. Peterson suspects the Republicans used Rusty's as the example because "I imagine it made good print." The ad makes it seem like this is a bridge only to Rusty's. It's not. In fact, Rusty's business would do just fine without it because there are other routes to get to the bar. But we don't want to ignore the ad's bigger point, which is that stimulus money is being spent on a little-used bridge. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel did an investigative report of stimulus-funded bridge projects in Wisconsin and found that the vast majority of the bridges awarded money in the first wave of stimulus funding are small, rural bridges that carry less than 1,000 vehicles a day. The Stevens Point bridge is one of 37 little-used bridges that got nearly $16 million in stimulus funding, while many higher-priority, well-traveled bridges were ineligible for the first round of stimulus funding. That's because so-called "shovel-ready" projects moved to the front of the line for the first round of stimulus money, state highway officials said. The idea of the stimulus was to get people working on projects that could be started fairly quickly. What does shovel-ready mean? It means the projects have environmental assessment and Army Corps of Engineers permits in hand and engineering and design work is finished. In the case of our little Stevens Point bridge, it has been in the works since 2006. It was designed and ready to go when the stimulus passed in February. In fact, it was originally slated to be replaced in 2009 but got pushed back to 2010 due to lack of available federal funding. "This wasn't some project we cooked up when the stimulus was passed," Peterson said. "All it needed was funding." Construction is set to begin in August and is expected to take about three months. Peterson estimates a crew of about a dozen will be used to build the bridge. And the concrete and steel will be purchased locally. So presumably that will create some economic ripple as well. Built in 1937, the bridge is in need of replacement, Peterson said. If it isn't, he said, ultimately they'd have to shut the bridge down, and "that would affect quite a few people. And more people would be out of work." "It does serve a purpose," Peterson said. "I'm happy this is being replaced." The GOP ad ends with Boehner kneeling behind a hound dog on a manicured lawn. "I'm John Boehner," he says. "This is Ellie Mae. She hasn't found any stimulus jobs yet. And neither have the American people. It's time to stop runaway spending in Washington and help small businesses get the economy running once again." Boehner didn't just pluck the Rusty's crack from thin air. On his Web site, he cites a June 16, 2009, story from the Wall Street Journal that mentions the bridge. It comes in a story about a report from Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., called "100 Stimulus Projects: A Second Opinion." Coburn's report says, "One small bridge is receiving $840,000, though it only carries 260 vehicles a day on average. It primarily provides access to a golf course and Rusty’s Backwater Saloon, which boasts pontoon rentals and a Steak-A-Rooni for just $5.25." We realize this Web ad from Boehner was a tongue-in-cheek attack. And let's face it, "Rusty's Backwater Saloon" creates a nice visual. But when you single out a project — as Boehner did with the "Bridge to Rusty's" — we think he ought to have his facts straight. And the fact is, this Wisconsin bridge is not a bridge solely to Rusty's, as the ad implies. In fact, it's not even the main access point for Rusty's. And as for the project not creating jobs, we think Ellie Mae's sniffer is a bit off there too. The main point of the stimulus wasn't so much to create burger-flipping jobs on the other end of bridge construction projects, but to to create jobs for people doing the bridge work itself, thereby creating an economic ripple effect. And according to a Wisconsin highway official, at least a dozen construction workers will be used to replace the bridge. But because some people may use the bridge to get to Rusty's, and because there's a legitimate argument to be made that many small, rural and barely used bridges got stimulus money while other bigger (arguably more important) projects were ineligible, we'll give Boehner a Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03157	Says U.S. Rep. Tom Price is sending letters both supporting and opposing the "small-business killing Internet Tax Mandate."	false	/georgia/statements/2013/sep/09/georgia-campaign-liberty/price-guilty-tomfoolery/	Who’s side are you on, congressman? That’s the question some Georgia activists are asking U.S. Rep. Tom Price. The Georgia Campaign for Liberty recently distributed fliers that contend the Roswell Republican "is trying to have it both ways on the small-business killing Internet Tax Mandate." "Rep. Price has been sending letters in support of the Internet Tax Mandate to constituents who support it … and letters expressing concern over the Internet Tax mandate to his constituents that oppose it!," the flier states. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the organization was correct in its assertion. The Campaign for Liberty states on its website that it believes "the free market ... is the most just and humane economic system and the greatest engine of prosperity the world has ever known." The Virginia-based group also supports a "noninterventionist foreign policy" and opposes the Federal Reserve system, according to its website. The organization’s interim state coordinator, Ike Hall, sent us a copy of the flier to support its argument about Price. Hall did not know how many fliers were distributed, but the flier has been posted on various websites, which is how we saw it. On the back of the flier are two letters Price wrote to different constituents concerning the issue. Both letters were nearly identical. The key difference is one paragraph. Before we examine the contents of the letters, PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d briefly offer some context about this issue. On Feb. 14, a group of U.S. House lawmakers introduced Resolution 684, titled the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013. The legislation was intended to allow states to collect taxes on some items sold online. One study concluded that in 2012 Georgia lost about $455 million in uncollected Internet sales tax revenue. "Small businesses and states alike are suffering from the inability to collect due – not new – taxes from purchases made online," said Rep. Steve Womack, an Arkansas Republican who was a lead sponsor of the legislation. "The Marketplace Fairness Act is the bipartisan, bicameral, common-sense solution that promotes states’ rights and levels the playing field for our Main Street businesses rather than continuing to allow the government to pick marketplace winners and losers." The Senate passed the legislation in early May by a wide majority. Both U.S. senators from Georgia, Saxby Chambliss and Johnny Isakson, voted for the legislation. The resolution was referred to a House subcommittee. Some activists have fought the legislation. A Facebook page was created to urge House members to hit the delete button when the legislation comes their way. Grover Norquist's influential Americans for Tax Reform has labeled it a tax increase. Former Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul, chairman of the Campaign for Liberty, has described the bill as an "Internet tax mandate." The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported in May that Price was unsure about his support for the bill. Price has not publicly stated a position on the bill. His office told us the congressman doesn’t want to see any changes to the tax code that would hurt the economy. Many members of Congress face difficult political choice on the legislation. Many local business communities support the tax. They contend that not charging taxes on Internet purchases gives online merchants an unfair advantage. But many taxpayers, who also vote, view the legislation as creating a new tax. The Georgia Campaign for Liberty, like its national chairman, has qualms about the legislation. It accuses Price of "two-faced taxation Tomfoolery," using the letters as evidence. Hall said it received the letters from supporters and says Price has admitted he’s "waffled" on his position. One letter, to a supporter of the legislation, was dated July 10; the other, to an opponent, July 12. There are two differences in the letters. The second paragraph of the July 10 letter begins "Your support for this legislation is appreciated." The second paragraph of the July 12 letter begins "Your concerns for this legislation are appreciated." The only other difference in the letters was a sentence in the third paragraph. "At a time when regulations and taxation are out of control at the federal level, it is critical that we continue to examine avenues that involve a complete and comprehensive overhaul of our tax system so that we may see a positive effect and simplification of our tax code," Price wrote in the July 10 letter. The July 12 letter has a sentence that begins the same, but ends differently. "At a time when regulations and taxation are out of control at the federal level, it is critical that we do not potentially inflict further damage on an already delicate economic recovery. Responsible solutions are needed to ensure the survival of our small businesses." So, is the Georgia Campaign for Liberty correct that Price is trying to have it both ways? "As all can clearly see from the text of the letters themselves, any claim the congressman is expressing support for the bill in one letter and opposition to it in another is baseless," Price spokesman Ryan Murphy said in a statement. "Any accusation that he is trying to provide two opposing opinions depending on the audience is a blatant PolitiFact ‘Pants on Fire’. The letters clearly show the congressman being consistent and responsive to the concerns of his constituents." Hall chuckled when we read Price’s statement to him. "We stand by our flier," he said, declining to comment further. To sum up, the Georgia Campaign for Liberty put together a flier accusing U.S. Rep. Tom Price of Georgia of writing letters for and against legislation that would allow states to tax some items sold online. The letters were nearly identical. And they are indicative of everyday correspondence from a congressman’s office to constituents concerned about pending legislation. Part of one sentence could be interpreted as suggesting Price has problems with the bill. But the organization’s conclusion about the congressman’s position is a stretch. Our rating: False.

pomt-03355	Says Austin is the "largest city in America without a congressional district anchored in it."	true	/texas/statements/2013/jul/17/elliott-naishtat/austin-legislator-calls-austin-largest-us-city-wit/	During Texas House action, two Travis County Democrats discussed whether Austin is weird in a politically unique way. From the House floor’s back mic on June 20, 2013, Rep. Elliott Naishtat asked fellow Austin Rep. Eddie Rodriguez: "Did you know that Austin is the only major Texas city and the largest city in America without a congressional district anchored in it?" Rodriguez replied from the front of the chamber: "Sadly, I am aware of that fact. Austin is now the 11th largest city in America and yet we don’t have a congressional district that’s based here, anchored here in Austin." That so? Austin's six districts We’ve analyzed Austin’s congressional districts before. In July 2012, we rated as Mostly True a Seguin resident’s claim that no like-sized or smaller city than Austin has as many congressional representatives. Austin and Fort Worth were somewhat similarly divided up in the map of Texas congressional districts imposed by federal judges, we concluded, though Austin was arguably socked harder because its voters wouldn’t necessarily determine victors in any of its districts. And does that also mean Austin lacks an "anchor" district, as Naishtat said? Six U.S. House districts take in at least a portion of the city under the interim plan imposed for the 2012 elections by a panel of federal judges. The court-imposed Austin-area districts align with how the districts were drawn by the Republican-led 2011 Legislature. As far as Austin by itself goes, two of the congressional districts each took in 24 percent of city residents at the time the map was finalized, another drew in 22 percent of city residents, the fourth had 19 percent of the population and the remaining two districts each had less than 8 percent of Austin residents, . And Austin residents don't dominate any of them, according to information posted online by the Texas Legislative Council in February 2012. By our calculation, some 27 percent of residents in both the 10th and 35th districts hail from Austin. That share of residents might be seen as signaling a little pull, but it’s also not close to a majority. Notably, too, the eastward-stretching 10th District, represented by Michael McCaul, R-Austin, is home to more Harris County than Travis County residents, while the southward-running 35th district, held by Lloyd Doggett, D-Austin, encompasses more Bexar County than Travis County residents. Each other district taking in part of the capital has a smaller share of Austin residents. About 25 percent of residents of the 21st district, extending south into San Antonio and represented by Alamo City Republican Lamar Smith, hail from Austin. Austinites make up 22 percent of the 25th district, running west and north nearly to Fort Worth; Republican Roger Williams, a Fort Worth-area businessman, moved to Austin before winning the seat in 2012. Less than 10 percent of residents of the north-running 17th and 31st districts, held by Republicans Bill Flores and John Carter, respectively, live in Austin. What's an anchor? We asked two redistricting experts how to define an anchor district. Austin lawyer Steve Bickerstaff had already aired his impression of how Austin and surrounding Travis County came out when the Republican-majority Legislature was drawing congressional districts, a task that comes around after each decennial U.S. census. In a March 24, 2012, commentary published in the Austin American-Statesman, Bickerstaff said the legislatively-initiated splitting of Travis County among several districts was "clearly intended to dilute, not enhance, the effect of the county's voters (especially Democrats)... These objectives are not surprising for a Republican-controlled Legislature, because Travis County is the only major Texas county in which a majority of non-Hispanic white people continue to vote consistently for Democratic candidates." But what about "anchor" districts? By email, Bickerstaff told us that in his experience, an "election district is ‘anchored’ in a jurisdiction in the purest sense if the district is wholly contained within the jurisdiction." For instance, Bickerstaff said, the Texas Constitution requires Texas House districts to be located entirely within a county, with a few specific exceptions. The next question can become, then, whether a district within a county is anchored in a particular city or neighborhood, he said. But Bickerstaff said an election district may be called "anchored" in a jurisdiction (such as a county, city or neighborhood) even if it contains more than one jurisdiction if the voters of the singled-out jurisdiction constitute at least a majority of the district’s voters. "The bigger the majority, the more secure the anchor," he said. In a reminder that most everything connected to redistricting law has a wiggle or three, Bickerstaff added that one may also define the relevant majority based on a district’s voting-age population, which would be a bigger group than registered voters alone. Also, he said, one could define a majority in terms of a district’s total population or even accept less than a majority to define an anchor when the singled-out jurisdiction "clearly has the largest plurality of voters or population in the district (and usually votes as a bloc)." Broadly, Bickerstaff wrote, the "key concept is that the voters of an anchor jurisdiction have the potential ability to elect the person of their choice without much, if any, regard to the vote of any other jurisdictions in the election district. Of course, the ultimate outcome of elections is more complicated. It is possible that even when a jurisdiction has a majority, or nearly so, of a district, the elected candidate may come from outside the jurisdiction especially if the voters in a smaller jurisdiction vote overwhelmingly for one candidate and the voters in the larger or anchor jurisdiction split more evenly." As an example, he said, the 2012 election of Doggett, long from Austin, despite the fact that Travis County residents do not account for most district residents. By email, Dallas lawyer Michael Li said he is unaware of a precise definition of an anchor district, but "in general, a district's anchor has the ability to control or substantially influence the outcome of elections because it contains the majority or a substantial plurality of the district's population." So, by the measure that we found accessible--raw population--Austin lacks an anchor district. But is that status unique among cities of like size or bigger? More populous cities Shortly before Naishtat made his claim, the U.S. Census Bureau ranked Austin as the nation’s 11th-most-populous city. A May 23, 2013, bureau press release had a link to a chart showing Austin with nearly 842,600 residents as of July 2012. More populous cities, the bureau said, were New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, Dallas and, in California, San Diego and San Jose. Naishtat’s office emailed us a chart, attributed to Nate Walker, Rodriguez’s chief of staff, indicating that each of the more populous cities had at least one anchor district. It was hard for us to decipher, so we checked on anchor districts in each of the larger cities with help from David Wasserman, U.S. House editor for the Cook Political Report, who told us by phone that he would define an anchor district as one in which more than half its residents live in the city. By that gauge, he said, each of the cities larger than Austin has at least one anchor district, while Austin does not. Specifically, Wasserman said, New York has more than a dozen House districts, Los Angeles has several and Chicago residents comprise most of the population in three districts. In Texas, he noted, Houston residents account for most of the 18th and 29th congressional districts and Dallasites largely comprise the 30th district; San Antonio residents anchor the state’s 20th district. Philadelphians account for most residents of Pennsylvania’s 1st and 2nd districts, Wasserman said, while Arizona’s 4th Congressional District is in Phoenix. In California, he said, the 52nd district draws largely on San Diego residents and most of San Jose is in the 19th district. Checking for ourselves Next, we looked at maps and other materials posted online by government agencies and U.S. House members, which suggested: Multiple districts within or largely within New York, Los Angeles and Chicago; Residents of Houston comprise more than half the population of the 7th (53 percent Houstonians); 29th (55 percent); 18th (62 percent); and 9th (74 percent) districts, according to information posted online by the Texas Legislative Council, while Dallas indeed has one anchor district, the 30th, in which six of every 10 residents live in the city; Pennsylvania’s 2nd Congressional District consists almost completely of Philadelphians, according to Maisha Leek, chief of staff for Rep. Chaka Fattah, D-Philadelphia. And Arizona’s 7th Congressional District is largely comprised of Phoenix residents. Maura Saavedra Cordova, press secretary to Rep. Ed Pastor, D-Phoenix, told us by telephone that according to the 2010 U.S. census, nearly 595,000 of the district’s 710,224 residents--84 percent--lived in Phoenix. California’s 52nd Congressional District consists of nearly the entire city of San Diego, according to the August 2011, final report of California's Citizens Redistricting Commission, which drew boundaries: "The district is highly urbanized with regional parks, lakes, and open-space preserves and is the central social and economic hub of San Diego County"; California’s 19th Congressional District "encompasses most of San Jose." Our ruling Naishtat said Austin is the "largest city in America without a congressional district anchored in it." Austin has portions of six districts and Austinites don’t come close to comprising the majority of residents in any of them. In contrast, the nation’s 10 more populous cities have at least one such district. We rate this claim as True.	None	Elliott Naishtat	None	None	None	2013-07-17T10:00:00	2013-06-20	['United_States']
pomt-09240	Says the EPA "outsourced the scientific basis for its greenhouse gas regulation to a scandal-plagued international organization that cannot be considered objective or trustworthy."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/may/10/greg-abbott/attorney-general-abbott-says-epas-endangerment-fin/	Greg Abbott, the Texas attorney general seeking re-election this year, announced a state challenge in February to a judgment that greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide endanger the health of Americans. At a Feb. 16 press conference, Abbott also said the Environmental Protection Agency, which issued the endangerment finding, "outsourced the scientific basis for its greenhouse gas regulation to a scandal-plagued international organization that cannot be considered objective or trustworthy." We saw his statement in a press release issued that day by Gov. Rick Perry, who attended the news conference with Abbott. We wondered if Abbott's salvo, echoed at an April forum by a delegate for Perry's campaign, accurately captured the EPA’s approach. Some background: The EPA’s finding, issued in December, came out after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases are air pollutants covered by the federal Clean Air Act and that the agency must determine whether or not emissions of greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles cause or contribute to air pollution which may endanger public health or welfare. The EPA said its scientific conclusions were based on work by three groups: the U.S. Global Climate Research Program, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the National Research Council, which synthesize thousands of studies, conveying a consensus on what scientific literature shows about climate, according to the agency. "No other source of information provides such a comprehensive and in-depth analysis across such a large body of scientific studies, adheres to such a high and exacting standard of peer review, and synthesizes the resulting consensus view of a large body of scientific experts across the world," the agency said. "For these reasons, the (EPA) administrator is placing primary and significant weight on these assessment reports in making her decision on endangerment." The report adds that EPA scientists previously gave "significant input" to the groups. The state’s 38-page petition for the EPA to reconsider its finding says that rather than do its own assessment, the agency's "administrator outsourced the actual scientific study, as well as her required review of the scientific literature necessary to make that assessment." "That is, EPA’s conclusion depended on summaries of existing reports that were provided by third parties," the petition states, "rather than on an analysis that was within EPA’s own quality control." Also, the petition says, the groups that the EPA cites for scientific back-up interweave; two have quoted the third, which is misidentified in Abbott's petition as the United Nations International—it’s actually Intergovernmental—Panel on Climate Change, which we delve into below. First, we tried to ask the EPA about the outsourcing descriptive. Spokeswoman Catherine Milbourn pointed us to an EPA website that calls the science behind greenhouse gas pollution "settled"; it says too the finding drew upon the works of "highly respected, peer-reviewed sources" around the globe plus hundreds of thousands of public comments. So the EPA acknowledges leaning on others' existing research, which it considers tip-top sound. What of the second part of Abbott’s statement--that EPA leaned on a scandal-plagued international organization that cannot be considered objective or trustworthy? He’s referring to the Geneva-based IPCC, which became the leading international body for the assessment of climate change after its formation more than 20 years ago by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization to "provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic consequences," the panel says online. In 2007, the panel shared the Nobel Peace Prize with Al Gore, the former vice president with a long interest in global warming. The Norweigan Nobel Committee said the panel created "an ever-broader informed consensus about the connection between human activities and global warming. Thousands of scientists and officials from over 100 countries have collaborated to achieve greater certainty as to the scale of the warming." Its 2007 review of research, cited by the EPA, was its latest look at climate science over all. Another is due in 2014. The Fox News Channel has reported that the panel's "reputation for accuracy and fairness, to a large degree, was responsible for building a consensus around the world that global warming was both real and a potentially devastating phenomenon largely caused by man." Of late, however, the panel has drawn fire, mainly from skeptics that the planet is rapidly heating. The latest outcry emerged after e-mails surfaced last year involving scientists including researchers at the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom, many of whom have participated in IPCC work. The e-mail back story (detailed by PolitiFact here): On Nov. 20, more than 1,000 e-mails and 3,000 documents came to light. Dating as far back as March 1996, they include exchanges between scientists indicating shaky practices, intentions to withhold public information and even, in one instance, a desire to punch a critic. Over all, though, the Pew Center on Global Climate Change found the e-mails largely routine and innocuous, writing: "Although a small percentage of the e-mails are impolite and some express animosity toward opponents, when placed into proper context they do not appear to reveal fraud or other scientific misconduct." In December, PolitiFact rated False a statement by Sen. James Inhofe, R-Oklahoma, saying the hacked e-mails debunked the science behind climate change. At a hearing, Inhofe later asked Lisa Jackson, the EPA’s administrator, about the agency leaning on flawed science from the IPCC. Jackson disagreed the panel was discredited, according to video posted online by C-SPAN. "It’s important to understand that the IPCC is a body, that it follows impartial and open and objective assessments," she said. The state's petition for reconsideration mentions the e-mails, noting that Phil Jones, director of the Anglia-based climate research center, was the lead author of the IPCC's 2007 report's "Summary for Policy Makers," and his research is cited 39 times (in 21 chapters) in the panel's report. The petition says the Anglia center is the primary provider of temperature readings used in the IPCC report. So what? So, the state says, the panel's conclusions are flawed because they rely on data from scientists with an agenda, some of them exposed in the e-mails. "Dr. Jones and his colleagues were far from objective," the petition states. "To the contrary, there is overwhelming evidence of outcome-oriented conduct that severely undermines the objectivity of their scientific research." The petition specifies scientists whose impartiality the attorney general questions. To plumb Abbott's point, we reviewed news and opinion articles about the panel and its 2007 report shared by his office. Some highlights: The report misstates the year by which Himalayan glaciers are expected to melt (an error, for which the panel offered a correction this year, that looks like a typo); incorrectly overstates how much of Holland rests below sea level; doesn't support an assertion that global warming could soon cut rain-fed north African crop production in half; and includes a statement about rain forests in South America shrinking for lack of rain that might not be proving out. Broadly, critics including some American scientists have called for the panel to open its next report to doubts about the science and to scientists who point out uncertainties. Separately, an arm of the United Nations agreed in February to review the panel; a report is expected in August. Achim Steiner, executive director of the United Nations Environment Programme's Governing Council, was quoted in The Telegraph newspaper saying the IPCC faced a crisis of public confidence. Amid the hubbub, there's no sign of nations forsaking the panel. Two leading British and American scientists have been among onlookers to stress that nothing has undermined the panel's 2007 conclusion that human activities are almost certainly contributing to global warming. Robert Watson, environment minister for the British government and a former head of the IPCC, was quoted by The Telegraph saying: "It is concerning that these mistakes have appeared in the IPCC report, but there is no doubt the earth’s climate is changing and the only way we can explain those changes is primarily human activity." Ralph Cicerone, president of the National Academies of Science and chairman of the National Research Council, wrote in Science magazine that the exposed e-mails "raised concern about the standards of science and has damaged public trust in what scientists do." Yet his "reading of the vast scientific literature on climate change is that our understanding is undiminished by this incident." Later, Cicerone was quoted telling scientists they need to redouble their efforts to share the implications of climate change with the public. "A lot of what we need to do," he said, "is translate basic information into terms the public can understand." At the same meeting, Jerry North, a professor of atmospheric sciences at Texas A&M University, was quoted saying there "has been no change in the scientific community" in the consensus that global average temperatures have been steadily climbing since the mid-20th century. John Nielson-Gammon, the Texas state climatologist, recently told us he believes about 95 percent of what the panel concludes. "It’s probably as good as it gets in terms of a comprehensive analysis done by scientists of a comprehensive... far-reaching issue," he said. "If you're going to rely on something external, that’s the document to rely upon." Where does all this leave Abbott's statement? True, instead of producing on its own research, the EPA instead relied on the work of three other entities. But calling it "outsourcing" is highly misleading because it suggests the agency was shirking its duties. It wasn't. In choosing to use the work of those agencies, particularly the IPCC, the EPA was relying on a large international group of scientists that has reached consensus from thousands of studies. That's a far more comprehensive review than anything the EPA could have done. Abbott also overreaches saying the panel is scandal-plagued and can't be considered objective or trustworthy. Yes, the stolen e-mails have raised questions about a small number of scientists, but the e-mails have not undercut the validity of the panel's main findings. Bottom line: There's a small bit of truth in Abbott's claim, the part that the EPA is relying on outsiders. But his statement is misleading because he implies the EPA has shirked its duties when in fact it is relying on three groups that have synthesized thousands of scientific studies -- almost certainly far more work than the EPA could ever do itself. And yes, the e-mails have raised questions about the work of a clutch of scientists, but they have not put a significant dent in conclusions reached by the IPCC. We rate Abbott's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03723	"The Social Security disability fund is going belly up in 2016."	true	/ohio/statements/2013/apr/15/rob-portman/sen-rob-portman-says-social-security-disability-fu/	You hear it often: Social Security is going broke. What you hear less often is an analysis of Social Security’s components -- its old-age retiree program and its disability program. Sen. Rob Portman discussed both parts during a newsmaker breakfast on April 9 sponsored by Politico, the Washington-based newspaper and website. Portman’s remarks on the disability program could be considered jarring to those who don’t pay close attention, so we thought we’d take a step back to check them out. Portman said, "The Social Security disability fund is going belly up in 2016." And 2016, he noted, is "right around the corner." Portman is correct -- from an accounting standpoint, and as of right now. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the most recent Social Security trustees’ annual report, the Social Security account that disburses monthly disability payments will not only pay out more money in 2016 than it takes in through taxes, but also will spend the last dollar it has in reserve by the end of that year. As budget documents put it, the Disability Insurance, or DI, Trust Fund -- the account that held surpluses and was tapped to help make up any recent shortfall -- will be "exhausted" that year. This is the "disability fund" Portman was referring to. The same fate isn’t expected to hit the other piece of the Social Security pie, Old Age and Survivors Insurance, until 2036 (or 2038 under a different analysis). Disabled workers and their spouses and dependents account for 18 percent of overall Social Security payments, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The coming shortfall will occur because disability payments have exceeded the program’s noninterest income since 2005. This occurred for several reasons, including a liberalization of the Social Security screening process with a 1984 law that made certain non-fatal conditions such as back pain, arthritis and mental illness potential qualifiers; a rise in the program’s income-replacement computation, "which strengthened the incentives for workers to seek benefits," and an increase in the female labor force that expanded the pool of insured workers, according to a 2006 analysis by economists for the National Bureau of Economic Research. The latter provided more tax money but also expanded the pool eligible for benefits. But there is another reason, cited by the CBO last July: the aging of the baby boom generation. "More older people suffer from debilitating conditions; moreover, the program’s qualification standards for older workers are less strict than those for younger workers because older people are assumed to be less able to adapt to new types of work," the CBO reported. It noted that "between calendar years 1996 and 2009—the approximate period during which the baby-boom generation entered their 50s—the share of disabled worker benefits awarded to older workers (age 45 and older) rose from 67 percent to 76 percent." But if payroll tax income to the program is insufficient already, why isn’t the DI program broke now? The answer is that the program still has money left from better days -- held in the Trust Fund in the form of government securities. That makes it still possible to pay 100 percent of all benefits. But in 2016, those savings will be depleted., A few numbers make this clearer. In 2011, the DI program paid out $132.3 billion, including $2.9 billion in administrative expenses. But it only took in $81.9 billion in dedicated payroll taxes and $1.6 billion in income taxes that some beneficiaries must pay (depending on their incomes). To make up the rest, it tapped the Trust Fund. It will not be able to do that and pay full expected benefits in 2016. From a practical standpoint, Congress and the White House are likely to act before then. A number of proposals provide ways to avoid a retiree and disabled-worker calamity, some with changes to the payroll tax, some with benefit cuts, some with both. That makes the odds slim that Social Security’s disability fund will actually go broke. But until that happens, all anybody has are the projections. And they are clear. So is this doomsday for Social Security? Not at all. Social Security will still take in enough money to pay a percentage of the claims. Although federal law says the Trust Fund must have assets for claims to be paid, Congress can change the law. More likely is a broader fix from Congress. Portman recognizes this, as he makes clear often -- and did so again at the Politico breakfast -- in his calls for entitlement reform. The Social Security trustees report in 2012 recognized this too, saying, "The DI program faces the most immediate financing shortfall of any of the separate trust funds; thus lawmakers need to act soon to avoid reduced payments to DI beneficiaries four years from now." So yes, we can hope or expect that the problem will be solved before 2016. But as of right now, Portman’s claim -- that the "disability fund is going belly up in 2016" -- is accurate, or as accurate as Social Security’s trustees and the CBO can be. We rate the claim True.

pomt-02712	"A quarter of our workers make $18,000 per year."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/23/teresa-ghilarducci/economist-teresa-ghilarducci-says-quarter-us-worke/	Amid growing debate about whether to raise the nation’s $7.25 minimum wage, Teresa Ghilarducci, a labor economist with the New School in New York City, offered a statistic that sought to gauge how many American workers are poor. "We are No. 1 in the world in creating low-wage jobs," Ghilarducci said on the Dec. 15, 2013, edition of the MSNBC show Up. "One out of four workers in the United States is a low-wage worker, meaning that they make 45 percent of the median wage, which is now $18,000 per year. So a quarter of our workers make $18,000 per year. And no other industrialized country has that kind of record." We wondered if she was correct that "a quarter of our workers make $18,000 per year." We found data from the U.S. Census Bureau that addresses the question. The Census data The Census Bureau data breaks down wage and salaried workers by ranges of income, from "$1 to $2,499" to "$100,000 and up." The data shows that 148.3 million Americans age 15 and up earned some wage or salary income in 2012. Of these workers, 33.5 million earned $17,500 or less. But to square it with Ghilarducci’s income ranges, we need to adjust upwards a bit to account for those earning between $17,500 and $18,000. This adjustment makes the number approximately 35 million. If you divide these 35 million low-income workers by the total 148.3 million workers, the result is 24 percent -- right on target for Ghilarducci’s claim. Some caveats However, we’ll note a few important bits of context. • Part-time workers. As it turns out, the bulk of these 35 million low-income workers -- 23.5 million, or about two-thirds -- worked part time. Now, some percentage of these 23.5 million workers -- perhaps a large percentage, given the slow economic recovery -- is working part time because they want a full-time job but can’t find one. But others may prefer working part time, such as students or parents of young children. When we contacted Ghilarducci, she agreed that this was an issue and forwarded recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics suggesting that about one-third of part time workers are doing so because they can’t find an acceptable full-time job, while two-thirds are working for non-economic reasons. This suggests that it’s wrong to assume that all, or even most, part-time workers are doing so because of the poor economy. • Partial-year workers. The Census data also tracks how much of the year workers spent on the job. The data shows that 14.8 million people who earned less than $18,000 worked 26 weeks or less. In other words, 42 percent of all workers earning under $18,000 worked for half the year or less. They might have earned well above that if they’d been paid at that rate for the full year. This offers another reminder that it’s wrong to view Ghilarducci’s statistic as suggesting that one-quarter of all workers with a full-time, full-year job are making $18,000 or less. An alternative number So let’s take a look at just the workers who had a full-time job and worked all year. The Census data shows that 98.3 million workers had full-time jobs for the whole year. Of those, about 8.8 million earned $18,000 or less -- just shy of 9 percent. Is this a better number? Not necessarily -- both have merit, and both are imperfect. Ghilarducci’s one-quarter overestimates the number of low-income workers because it includes Americans working part-time voluntarily, or who, by choice or not, may have worked for only for a part of the year. At the same time, the alternative number -- 9 percent -- does the reverse, underestimating the number of low-income workers by not including Americans who are working part-time jobs when they would actually like to have a full-time job. Ghilarducci thanked PunditFact for checking up on her work. "It is important for yakkers on TV to footnote!" she said. "I think I will change my behavior and not give interviews without a follow up with footnotes of my own. So you saved me work. Thank you." Our ruling Ghilarducci said that "a quarter of our workers make $18,000 per year." Census data backs up this top-line number, but beneath the surface, there are reasons for caution. The number she cites does not refer exclusively to full-year, full-time jobs. Rather, it includes lots of people who had a low income because they worked in a part-time job, or worked for just part of the year. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.	None	Teresa Ghilarducci	None	None	None	2013-12-23T10:00:18	2013-12-15	['None']

pomt-05647	"However, it took $19.5 million in Oregon Lottery funds for the Port of Newport to eventually land the new NOAA Marine Operations Center-Pacific."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/mar/21/oregon-lottery/did-it-really-take-oregon-lottery-money-land-noaa-/	One way the Oregon Lottery pitches itself is by talking about all the money it brings to economic development projects around the state: a brewery in Astoria, a new home for nonprofit Mercy Flights, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration facility in Newport. From the Lottery’s website: "Newport gave its all when competing with several other sites to bring the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to town. However, it took $19.5 million in Oregon Lottery® funds for the Port of Newport to eventually land the new NOAA Marine Operations Center-Pacific … " That raised the eyebrow of a sharp-eyed reader, and ours, too. The facility was a huge deal for Newport and for Oregon, allowing us to best the Puget Sound for a coveted federal facility that means jobs and bragging rights. (We took it away from Seattle.) But is it fair for the Lottery to claim unbridled credit for this wonderful new economic activity? The state’s main economic development arm, Business Oregon, seems to think so. Its website says the Port of Newport was able to make the winning pitch "largely because of $19.5 million in Oregon Lottery funds, appropriated by the state Legislature, which allowed it to offer a 20-year lease for only $2.4 million per year." Specifically, Lottery revenue bonds were sold to help finance construction of the new Pacific Coast operations center and base; $19.5 million of the total bond sale was earmarked for the Port of Newport. A news report in The Oregonian at the time confirmed that Newport officials called state Sen. Betsy Johnson, D-Scappoose, to help score lottery funds for the deal: "Six months later, they laugh at the memory because, as crazy as it seemed, Johnson and the rest of the caucus bought into the port's dream, and despite the worst economy imaginable, secured $19.5 million in lottery funds to help build a new facility for NOAA, should it agree to come. And agree it did, as the port learned Tuesday." Newport was one of four bidders with the other three in Washington, specifically Seattle, Port Angeles and Bellingham. NOAA awarded the Port of Newport the lease because it had the "highest technically-rated and lowest-priced offer." We called Johnson and asked for her take on the Lottery statement. Her response? "It’s accurate on one level, but it is not very nuanced," she said. She credits a whole bunch of factors for the winning bid, including the members of the legislative "coastal caucus" who put aside differences to push for Newport; legislative leaders who made the money a priority; the Lincoln County delegation, which refused to quit lobbying; and the people in Astoria, who gave up their NOAA bid so the federal delegation could get behind one Oregon bid. "Absent that $19.5 million I don’t think Newport would have shown as well as it did," Johnson said, but she added, it’s not as if the Lottery woke up one morning and decided, "Sheesh, we can make a difference." Certainly officials in Washington said they could not compete with the financing offered by Oregon. The Seattle Times reported in December 2009 that the lease in Bellingham would have cost NOAA $4 million a year and the lease at Lake Union cost nearly $6 million, compared to $2.4 million a year at Newport. But let’s not forget that Newport beat the other sites on technical factors, too. Chuck Baumann, spokesman for the Oregon Lottery, acknowledges lots of factors were at play, but that lottery money was critical for a low-cost lease. "We’re certainly not saying we made the decision," he said. "But it’s also important for us to tell folks where lottery dollars go." The money was critical. NOAA itself says Newport had the lowest cost bid, and that was in large part due to the Lottery. But Johnson is correct that many other factors played a role and for the Lottery to suggest that its money was the final piece is incomplete. The statement is partially accurate -- Lottery money made the lease competitive -- but it leaves out important details. Astoria dropped out; Newport’s bid was better on technical fronts than the others; legislative leaders pulled together to set aside the dollars and bonding authority. We rule the statement Half True.

I told you what my position was, and what I did as governor, the fact that I received the endorsement of the NRA."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/31/mitt-romney/even-he-admits-its-not-true/	Mitt Romney had his flip-flop feet held to the fire by Meet the Press host Tim Russert on Dec. 16, 2007, and made this statement claiming he was endorsed by the National Rifle Association during his 2002 campaign for Massachusetts governor. But he wasn't. The Washington Post picked up on the error that day and posted on its blog "The Trail." The story included a backpedaling quote from the Romney campaign. "The NRA did not endorse in the 2002 campaign," spokesman Kevin Madden said in the Post blog. A couple of days later, Romney campaign spokesman Kristy Campbell elaborated to PolitiFact: "They did not officially endorse, but there had been folks doing supportive phone banking for him." We called the NRA several days in a row seeking comment and confirmation of Campbell's statement about phone banking. Despite promising to call PolitiFact back, no one did. And we could find no independent verification. We did find something funny: Turns out the NRA endorsed a Romney for public office, just not Mitt. Ronna Romney, divorced from Gov. Romney's brother Scott, earned the NRA's support in 1996 as she campaigned for a U.S. Senate seat representing Michigan. She won the primary, but lost to incumbent Sen. Carl Levin.

pomt-13475	North Carolina’s coast "is possibly the best place in (the) U.S. for an offshore windfarm."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/sep/09/duane-hall/north-carolina-top-state-offshore-wind-power-state/	Some lawmakers want to ban wind turbines from much of North Carolina’s soil, citing concerns about interference with the flight paths of military and civilian aircraft. The N.C. Senate approved regulations in June to do just that. The House of Representatives didn’t vote on the regulations. But regardless of whether they are revived and become law in future legislative sessions, some Democrats are already touting opportunities for wind power that aren’t on land. "NC's coast is possibly the best place in U.S. for an offshore windfarm," Rep. Duane Hall of Raleigh tweeted in August, responding to news of an offshore wind farm being built in Rhode Island. "We need to do this!" Beachgoers tend to hate the winds that stir up sand and send umbrellas tumbling away. But we wondered whether the energy industry views windy days at the North Carolina coast differently, or whether Hall’s claim was nothing but hot air. Energy potential First, we need to ask whether Hall’s claim is even relevant. It wouldn’t matter how good North Carolina’s potential for offshore wind power is compared with the rest of the country if no one is seriously interested in offshore wind power. Even though it’s a new industry in the U.S., it makes sense for wind power advocates to focus offshore. Winds tend to be stronger and more uniform over water than over land. Several offshore wind farms are in various stages of development, and the federal government wants 20 percent of the country’s power to come from wind by 2030. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, "offshore wind is a crucial renewable resource to be incorporated in the country's clean energy mix" because 80 percent of energy use is in coastal states. The federal Bureau of Ocean Energy management has identified three developable sites off the North Carolina coast that contain up to 3,740 megawatts of wind energy potential. That’s nearly twice as much as the solar energy North Carolina produced in 2015, when it ranked third in the nation in solar output. So the potential is there. But is it the best? The best states for wind Hall didn’t respond to our questions asking for evidence backing up his claim. So we looked up various maps and charts on our own, trying to find "possibly the best place" for offshore wind energy. A 2010 study by the federal government’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory measured offshore wind power potential in each state. North Carolina ranked fifth behind Hawaii, California, Michigan and Louisiana. Here's a map from the lab: The study measured total wind power and did not factor how much space would be realistically unusable due to developmental or environmental issues. But taking reality into consideration, Cristina Archer, a University of Delaware professor who studies renewable energy, said North Carolina is "a pretty awesome state for offshore wind." While it doesn’t have the most total wind or the highest wind speeds, she said, North Carolina might have the best actual potential due to the geography of the coast. "I would agree that it is possibly the best in the country, because of the ideal combination of high winds, relatively shallow waters, and a long coastline," Archer said. "Other states, like California, might have higher winds, but the waters are too deep. Or Massachusetts is windier and shallow too, but it does not have the long coastline." The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management agrees: "Wind speeds off the Atlantic Coast and in the Gulf of Mexico are lower than wind speeds off the Pacific Coast. However, the presence of shallower waters in the Atlantic makes development more attractive and economical for now." Factors against North Carolina There are a few reasons why North Carolina might be passed over, however. While North Carolina has more total offshore wind potential than any other East Coast state, some spots in New England have stronger winds. Hurricanes could also scare off some companies. Turbines can only handle winds up to certain strengths, and very fast winds can damage or destroy them. A 2012 study of the risk of hurricane damage in four counties with appealing offshore wind prospects – one each in North Carolina, Texas, New Jersey and Massachusetts – found that the second-riskiest was Dare County, in northeastern North Carolina. The silver lining is that most of the risk in Dare County would be from category 4 and 5 hurricanes. No storm that strong has hit Dare County since at least 1851, when hurricane tracking began. North Carolina as a whole has experienced only one storm that strong – Hurricane Hazel, with category 4 winds, hit southern North Carolina in 1954. Ocean auctions None of the pros or cons matter, however, if companies can’t access the swaths of ocean where they want to build wind farms. The only way to get that access is to lease it from the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management at auction. The BOEM has identified three areas in North Carolina for auction – one in Dare County, near Kitty Hawk, and two near Wilmington. The only other such sites in the U.S. are in New York, South Carolina, Hawaii and Oregon. A BOEM spokeswoman said the two Wilmington areas won’t be put up for auction for some time, since they’re being combined with the South Carolina areas. The Kitty Hawk site could be auctioned next year. Our ruling Hall said North Carolina’s coast is "possibly the best place" in the country for offshore wind. We appreciate Hall’s use of the word "possibly." He’s right to acknowledge some uncertainty. North Carolina has neither the country’s best individual spots for wind power nor the most total potential. But it’s near the top and further benefits from a uniquely long, shallow and uniformly windy coastline that gives it competitive advantages. Since Hall’s claim is accurate but needs additional explanation, we rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/52e75965-891a-4094-b1ea-aa5a0ddf548b	None	Duane Hall	None	None	None	2016-09-09T17:34:23	2016-08-23	['United_States']
pomt-12802	"Before the Affordable Care Act, (West Virginia’s) uninsured rate for people 64 to 19 was 29 percent. Today, it is 9 percent."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/14/bernie-sanders/wva-uninsured-rate-has-declined-not-fast-bernie-sa/	Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., had been planning to have a town hall with MSNBC’s Chris Hayes and residents of McDowell County, W.Va., on Feb. 13, 2017, until the West Virginia National Guard told them they could not use a local armory for the event. Sanders instead appeared on Hayes’ show by satellite from the U.S. Capitol, still tailoring his comments to West Virginia. Sanders: "And one of the ironies, Chris, is that one of the states that has benefited the most from Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, is West Virginia." Hayes: "Yes." Sanders: "Before the Affordable Care Act, their uninsured rate for people 64 to 19 was 29 percent. Today, it is 9 percent." Is that correct? Sanders’ office pointed to one government number to support its point. Another government number we found showed a less dramatic decline, but it doesn't change the thrust of his overall point. Let’s crunch the numbers. We’ll start by noting that the age range Sanders cited make some sense. The mandatory Medicare program kicks in at age 65, and enhanced access for children to government health programs tends to produce higher insurance coverage rates for kids than for adults. Sanders’ office pointed to an article in the Charleston (W.Va.) Gazette-Mail that touted the state had the country’s "biggest decline" in the uninsured rate. The article points to data from the National Health Interview Survey, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The study found that between 2013 and 2015, West Virginia’s uninsured rate for persons between 18 and 64 fell from 28.8 percent to 8.9 percent. That supports Sanders’ point. (We won’t quibble about Sanders citing an age range that was off by one year.) However, the same report provides an important caveat. It notes that for several states — including West Virginia — the data was "not statistically significant due to larger standard errors." It turns out that some states in the CDC study don’t have enough people sampled to provide robust data. "This would be especially important for a small, low-population state like West Virginia," said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush and remains a health care policy analyst.. So is there a better number? Yes, specifically, data from the Current Population Survey’s Annual Social and Economic Supplement. This data set, published by the U.S. Census Bureau, asks questions every year on a battery of topics, including health insurance coverage. The database includes figures broken down by state and age category. We looked at West Virginia’s figures for the uninsured population below 65 and subtracted the uninsured population below 18. Here’s what we found. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com This data backs up Sanders’ most recent uninsured rate for West Virginia. But instead of 29 percent, it shows the state’s uninsured rate hovered around 21 percent between 2008 and 2013. Wilensky said she’s not surprised to see such a wide difference between the two data sets, given the methodological differences. She added that the decline in West Virginia’s uninsured rate is still notable and was made possible by the Medicare expansion provision of the Affordable Care Act. "West Virginia’s level of uninsurance would be on the higher side to begin with since they are a poor state," she said. "Since they took advantage of the Medicaid expansion, the big decline is not surprising." Our ruling Sanders said, "Before the Affordable Care Act, (West Virginia’s) uninsured rate for people 64 to 19 was 29 percent. Today, it is 9 percent." Sanders pointed to one federal measurement, though it has methodological problems when drilling down to the statistics for smaller states. A more reliable data set for West Virginia’s case showed a decline from 21 percent to 9 percent. The decline was not as dramatic as he’d indicated, but it was still a significant one.

pomt-12655	Says President Donald Trump’s proposal to allow Americans to buy health insurance across state lines would make it the same as "the way you buy car insurance" today.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/23/mike-pence/discussing-health-care-mike-pence-wrong-about/	During the 2016 presidential campaign, Donald Trump promised to allow Americans to buy health insurance across state lines. The idea is not new, but it’s never been fully enacted. Currently, health insurance is regulated state by state. Some Republicans have long argued that such state-by-state regulation, including minimum requirements for health insurance plans, has kept the price of premiums high. They argue that a more unfettered, free-market approach -- where insurers compete to sell identical policies anywhere, regardless of what the purchaser’s state requires -- would drive down the cost of coverage for consumers. Critics counter that effectively getting rid of state regulation of insurance coverage within their borders would weaken consumer protections and promote a "race to the bottom" in the quality of coverage. (Here are some articles that discuss the pluses and minuses of the approach.) A provision to do what Trump promised didn’t make it into the American Health Care Act, the House Republican bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. However, Trump reiterated his support for the proposal in future legislation -- and his allies have kept up the rhetoric. During a March 19 appearance at the Church by the Glades in Coral Springs, Fla., Vice President Mike Pence said, "Under President Trump’s leadership ... we're going to give the American people the freedom to buy health insurance across state lines -- the way you buy life insurance, the way you buy car insurance." Pence made a similar remark eight days earlier while visiting Kentucky. And on March 14, White House spokesman Sean Spicer reiterated the theme at his daily briefing. "Who could be against allowing insurance to be sold over state lines?" Spicer said. "It’s something that you can do (for) your car insurance." One PolitiFact reader wrote to ask whether the comparison of health insurance and car insurance was accurate, so we decided to take a look. We found that their analogy is flawed. Contrary to what Pence and Spicer said, the rules governing the sale of car insurance are much the same as how health insurance is sold today -- not how the Trump administration wants it to be sold tomorrow. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry.) Currently, states have laws that set minimum standards for both health insurance and car insurance. For instance, when you buy car insurance, you may be required to pay for policies with a minimum level of liability coverage, medical coverage, property damage coverage and coverage for other drivers in an accident who are uninsured or underinsured. (Here’s an interactive tool from Geico to see the particular requirements in your state.) So it’s common for consumers to buy an auto insurance policy online from an out-of-state vendor -- just as they can buy a health insurance policy from a vendor whose headquarters are out of state. The key factor, though, is that for both types of insurance, that out-of-state vendor has to tailor the plan it sells you to the laws of your state. Today, if you live in Maryland, you can purchase an auto policy from Progressive, which is based in Ohio. But the policy you buy from Progressive must adhere to the minimum requirements of your home state, Maryland. It can’t simply sell you a one-state-fits-all policy. That’s effectively the same setup as it is for health insurance. If you are living in Maryland but decide to buy a health insurance policy from Aetna -- a company headquartered in Connecticut -- that plan must conform to Maryland’s minimum requirements. In reality, then, Pence got it backwards. What the Trump administration wants to do would make buying health insurance unlike the way you buy car insurance today -- not more like it, as Pence had said. "Auto insurance is regulated by the states, which have different laws and regulations," said Roger Feldman, a professor of health policy and management at the University of Minnesota. "It doesn't matter from whom I buy my policy -- all auto insurers that sell policies in Minnesota must live by the Minnesota laws." Feldman called the formulation by Pence and Spicer a "false analogy." Lynne McChristian, executive director of the Center for Risk Management, Education and Research at Florida State University, agreed. In fact, she said, "if you buy your health policy today and move from one state to another, when you notify the insurer of the change of address, the policy changes according to the requirements of the new state of residence -- just like auto insurance would." Our ruling Pence said that Trump’s proposal to allow Americans to buy health insurance across state lines would make it the same as "the way you buy car insurance" today. Experts say this analogy is deeply flawed. Contrary to what Pence suggested, today’s rules for car insurance are not a free-market, borderless nirvana. Car insurance is just as regulated, on a state-by-state basis, as health insurance is. So using today’s car-insurance system as a model for the administration’s vision of cross-border health-insurance sales is wrong. Making the change Trump wants would actually make the rules for health insurance and car insurance different -- not the same. We rate the statement False.

pomt-06221	"Most of, if not all of, the [DeKalb school construction] projects always came in on or were under budget."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2011/dec/06/thomas-brown/were-dekalb-construction-projects-completed-under-/	DeKalb County Sheriff Thomas Brown recently took to the microphone at a few radio stations to talk about education. Surprised? We were. And so we continued to listen. Brown was on the airwaves before the Nov. 8 elections to encourage DeKalb residents to vote for continuing a 1 percent sales tax to fund education construction projects. The sheriff explained his interest in the topic. A large number of the inmates in the county jail don’t have high school diplomas, and it costs about $50 a day to house and feed them. Brown then made a claim that had us reaching for the Truth-O-Meter. "Most of, if not all of, the projects always came in on or were under budget," the sheriff told V-103 during the popular Frank & Wanda morning show the day before the election. Brown repeated similar versions of that claim on other radio programs that day. Ballot initiatives on education spending usually pass with ease, but this was no sure thing. Several former DeKalb school officials, including former Superintendent Crawford Lewis, are awaiting trial on corruption charges. Despite that dark cloud, about 60 percent of DeKalb residents voted to continue the tax. We still wondered whether the sheriff deserved high marks for his claim or was he wrong. Walter Woods, the communications director for the DeKalb County School System, gave us a spreadsheet with 134 projects that have been funded by the latest version of the tax, called the SPLOST III Capital Improvement Program. The program has a budget of about $513 million. Most of the projects under SPLOST III are scheduled to be completed by June 2012. Of those projects, 103 have been completed. Many of the completed projects were for work such as security lighting or carpet replacement. We didn’t consider them as construction projects. We examined projects such as roof replacements (which often cost hundreds of thousands of dollars), renovations and work to comply with the Americans With Disabilities Act. About 85 percent of those projects were done on or under budget. Some of the projects that exceeded the initial cost doubled the earlier budget. They included the track and tennis court at Chapel Hill Middle School, which had an original budget of $125,000 and have a current contract of $255,522. Another was the natatorium work at Lakeside High School, which had an original budget of $150,000 and now has a current contract of $288,506. Others went slightly over budget, such as ceiling, lighting and air conditioning work at Fairington Elementary School, which had an original budget of $1,917,131 and has a current contract of $1,947,809. Many of the projects that were done below the original budget came in 30 percent to 50 percent below costs. Lynn Deutsch, a DeKalb parent who closely watches how the school district spends its money, believes the Great Recession, which took hold in the latter months of 2008, has caused construction costs to drop, which is why most of the projects completed have come in on or under budget. "Things got cheaper," she said. Ken Simonson, chief economist of the Associated General Contractors of America, told us that construction costs dipped after the recession and have since gradually increased. Simonson, however, said the decline in construction work across the country has prompted more companies to bid on government projects, thus driving down bids and the cost of the work. The association represents more than 33,000 firms and started in 1918. Simonson gave us a chart that shows prices for new school construction increased nearly 12 percent in 2008 and dropped nearly 3 percent the year after. The data came from the federal government’s Producer Price Index. Woods said the district has not seen an uptick in costs for materials during the past 18 months. He did say bids by construction companies for DeKalb district work have been lower. "Vendors are more competitive," he said. "I think there’s not a lot of work out there." Minutes from a March 2009 meeting of the SPLOST citizen’s advisory committee make a reference to "favorable construction prices." The minutes were shared by Ernest Brown, a former co-chairman of the committee. Ernest Brown, no relation to the sheriff, recalled discussions about the recession’s impact on construction bids. "It drove down labor costs because people were being more competitive, and it saved money for the taxpayers," he said. Woods also defended the quality of the work, which has been a concern of some DeKalb parents who closely watch the district’s spending. He did say some subcontractors have been late in meeting deadlines. The DeKalb school district’s spreadsheet and what we saw ourselves backs up much of Thomas Brown’s argument. The recession has apparently helped lower bid prices -- even though a few projects were still seriously over budget. We rate Brown’s claim as Mostly True.

pomt-03380	Electricity rates are 40 percent higher in states that have required utility companies to use a certain amount of renewable energy such as solar power.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/10/americans-prosperity-georgia-chapter/group-wants-georgia-block-solar-requirement/	A recent email blast has sparked one of the hottest political debates in Georgia this summer. Americans for Prosperity’s Georgia chapter contacted its 50,000 members on July 1, warning them that the state’s Public Service Commission was preparing this month to make some major changes that would force Georgians to reach deeper into their wallets. "What if I told you something you're not even hearing about in the news is about to raise your electricity bill by more than 40 percent and reduce the reliability of every appliance and electronics gadget in your home?" the organization’s state director, Virginia Galloway, wrote in the beginning of her email. How could this happen? The PSC is scheduled to vote Thursday on whether to require that Georgia Power increase the use of solar energy in its long-term plan. States with such a mandate have electricity bills that are 40 percent more than those that do not, the group says. Not true, others say. Gwinnett County resident Debbie Dooley, a proponent of the plan who is the national coordinator of the Tea Party Patriots, was quoted as saying Galloway was using outdated information to base her claim about the potential 40 percent increase. A PSC member made a similar argument. So who’s right here? PolitiFact Georgia sought to find out. Solar energy has generated a battle among many conservatives. Some say the use of renewable energy such as solar power has created more jobs. They also don’t want states to be dependent on one or two energy sources. Others object to the idea of forcing the marketplace to use renewable energy. They also contend some energy resources are too expensive. Galloway’s email, which she shared with us, contained a state-by-state chart of electricity rates put together by the Institute for Energy Research, a Washington-based nonprofit organization that evaluates public policy initiatives on oil, coal, wind and solar energy. Many members of its staff have worked for Republicans on Capitol Hill. A blog on its website criticized President Barack Obama’s recent speech on climate control. In early 2010, the institute published a 191-page report on energy regulation. The report examined "renewable portfolio standards," a term used to describe how states require or encourage electricity producers to supply some of their electricity from designated renewable resources such as wind or solar energy. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia had some form of RPS guidelines, according to industry accounts. Georgia, like most Southern states, does not have an RPS policy. The report found "mandating the use of wind and solar through renewable portfolio standards increases electricity costs for consumers." Its chart shows the average price for electricity in states with a binding RPS policy is 39.4 percent higher in all sectors. The prices were based on kilowatt hours in 2009. Galloway also sent us a December report by the U.S. Energy Information Administration showing the average price for operating solar plants that will be active by 2018 will be higher than the costs for coal, natural gas and wind. PSC member Doug Everett told Americans for Prosperity that solar prices have fallen significantly since the institute’s report in 2010. "Some other states have seen dramatic price increases when implementing solar power because they went ahead with projects three or five years ago when solar prices were 70 percent higher than they are today," he said. Solar prices have fallen sharply in the past five years due in large part to global oversupply, according to news reports, industry websites and government reports. The federal government has also invested more money in solar research and development to lower prices. The accounts include: -- a Reuters news service report that solar panel prices fell by 50 percent in 2011. -- a Reuters report that last year, the average price for silicon-based solar panels by top manufacturers fell to $0.7-$0.8 per watt, from around $3.5-$4.5 per watt in 2008. -- a U.S. Department of Energy report that solar energy installation prices dropped by 30 percent between 2008 and 2012. Daniel Simmons, an official with the institute, said via email that rates are driven by policy choices such as renewable mandates. "This is why California's electricity rates are much higher than surrounding states for example," said Simmons, the institute’s director of regulatory and state affairs. "The overall point of our paper was pointing out these policy choices. Renewables mandates are one example of the type of policy choices that drive up electricity rates." An Associated Press report also noted that there may be other factors that contribute to higher rates in states with binding renewable portfolio standards, such as the demand for energy and weather. Again, Americans for Prosperity’s Georgia chapter claimed in an email that electricity rates are 40 percent higher in states that have required utility companies to use a certain amount of renewable energy such as solar power. The chapter does not want Georgia to enact the same guidelines here. The claim is based on a study that appears accurate. But there is widespread news coverage that solar prices have fallen significantly in the past five years. It may be premature to make a correlation between the solar market and electricity prices. The chapter’s claim is based on accurate data, but it’s missing some important details. We rate it Half True. Editor's Note: This article includes updated information from an Associated Press report.

pomt-14207	Says that in her speech to the pro-Israel group AIPAC, Hillary Clinton "had one line on the Palestinian people."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/20/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-hillary-clinton-had-one-line-p/	On ABC’s This Week, host George Stephanopoulos asked Bernie Sanders about his remark during the New York Democratic debate that the United States should play "an evenhanded role" with regard to Israel and its neighbors. Sanders told Stephanopoulos that he thinks President Barack Obama has "done much better than his predecessors" in taking the kind of approach he prefers, but added that "I think we still have a way to go. And I was not criticizing President Obama. I was criticizing (former Secretary of State Hillary) Clinton. She gave a speech to AIPAC" -- referring to the most prominent pro-Israel group in the United States. "It's a long speech. It was one sentence, I believe, that even mentioned the Palestinians." While Sanders went on to say that "it goes without saying" that "we have to protect 100 percent Israel's right to exist, its right to live in peace, its right to live in security," he added that "you cannot ignore the suffering of the Palestinian people." When Stephanopoulos asked whether he thought Clinton has ignored the suffering of the Palestinian people, Sanders reiterated that her AIPAC speech had "one line on the Palestinian people." We wondered whether Sanders’ was right that Clinton "had one line on the Palestinian people" in her AIPAC speech. So we looked closely at her address. The most obvious way to look at this is to count the number of references to the Palestinians in Clinton’s speech and see if they amount to more than one line. Sanders is wrong by that simple metric, as we’ll show. But to broaden our look somewhat, we also analyzed more generally how much of Clinton’s speech addressed the Israeli-Palestinian peace process as opposed to how much it addressed Israel’s security needs. What Clinton said about the Palestinians Here is the main section of her AIPAC speech -- which she gave on March 21 -- that addressed Palestinians. The sentences that mentioned the Palestinians by name are in bold. And here is a third choice. Will we keep working toward a negotiated peace or lose forever the goal of two states for two peoples? Despite many setbacks, I remain convinced that peace with security is possible and that it is the only way to guarantee Israel’s long-term survival as a strong Jewish and democratic state. It may be difficult to imagine progress in this current climate when many Israelis doubt that a willing and capable partner for peace even exists. But inaction cannot be an option. Israelis deserve a secure homeland for the Jewish people. Palestinians should be able to govern themselves in their own state, in peace and dignity. And only a negotiated two-state agreement can survive those outcomes. If we look at the broader regional context, converging interests between Israel and key Arab states could make it possible to promote progress on the Israeli-Palestinian issue. Israelis and Palestinians could contribute toward greater cooperation between Israel and Arabs. I know how hard all of this is. I remember what it took just to convene Prime Minister Netanyahu and President Abbas for the three sessions of direct face-to-face talks in 2010 that I presided over. But Israelis and Palestinians cannot give up on the hope of peace. That will only make it harder later. All of us need to look for opportunities to create the conditions for progress, including by taking positive actions that can rebuild trust — like the recent constructive meetings between the Israeli and Palestinian finance ministers aiming to help bolster the Palestinian economy, or the daily on-the-ground security cooperation between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. But at the same time, all of us must condemn actions that set back the cause of peace. Terrorism should never be encouraged or celebrated, and children should not be taught to hate in schools. That poisons the future. Everyone has to do their part by avoiding damaging actions, including with respect to settlements. Now, America has an important role to play in supporting peace efforts. And as president, I would continue the pursuit of direct negotiations. And let me be clear — I would vigorously oppose any attempt by outside parties to impose a solution, including by the U.N. Security Council. This section includes the word "Palestinian" or a variant seven times, over the course of five sentences. So Sanders is wrong that Clinton "had one line on the Palestinian people." She had -- using the strictest definition possible -- five lines. Mentions of the peace process vs. mentions of Israeli security Looking more broadly at the content of Clinton’s speech doesn’t do much to support Sanders’ claim. Sanders’ point seemed to be that the Palestinians’ interests were being ignored in Clinton’s speech. So we wondered about how much Clinton addressed the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians and how much she talked about the need to preserve Israel’s security. We thought this would be a reasonable proxy for Sanders’ point, since the peace process includes Palestinians as an integral part of the equation, whereas a focus on Israeli security relegates Palestinians’ safety and security to a lower priority. To look at this question, we made an effort to break down Clinton’s 3,316-word speech by theme. Our choices aren’t unassailable -- some portions of the speech address more than one topic, and different readers may choose to label different sections differently -- but we think it’s pretty good as a rough categorization of what she said. We settled on five categories. Here they are, along with the number of words we counted for each of those themes: • Preliminary remarks: 238 • Comments about the U.S.-Israel relationship and Clinton’s priorities: 1,148 • Comments about Israel's security: 762 • Comments on Iran or ISIS: 795 • Comments urging the peace process forward (the portion excerpted above): 373 •Total: 3,316 To get a better grasp of this breakdown visually, here’s what her speech looks like by theme. The green section indicates preliminary remarks, the purple denotes U.S.-Israel relations, the gray refers to Iran and ISIS, the light blue denotes Israeli security, and the yellow refers to the peace process. So by our count, more than 10 percent of Clinton’s comments addressed the peace process, which, as we noted, inherently involves the Palestinians. And if you strip out the preliminaries, the comments on the U.S.-Israel relationship and the comments on Iran and ISIS, the ratio becomes even less favorable to Sanders' point. Comparing just Clinton’s Israeli security comments to her peace-process comments, she spent twice as many words on Israeli security as on the peace process. That’s an imbalance, especially if your goal is "evenhandedness." But the imbalance is much more modest than Sanders’ "one line" comment would indicate. Our ruling Sanders said that in her AIPAC speech, Clinton "had one line on the Palestinian people." She actually had more lines than that -- seven mentions of the word "Palestinian" in five sentences. And overall, she spent about 10 percent of her speech talking about the peace process, of which Palestinians are an integral part. That’s still an imbalance -- Clinton spent twice as many words discussing Israeli security -- but Sanders’ assertion is still a significant exaggeration.

pomt-13513	"As the election tracker FiveThirtyEight has reported, whoever wins Pennsylvania will be our next President."	mostly false	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/sep/02/rob-gleason/does-pennsylvania-really-have-power-decide-preside/	Every election, pundits and politicians alike harp on the importance of battleground states, those pockets of uncertainty within the country where less-predictable voting patterns make the outcome a bigger priority for candidates. In 2016, Pennsylvania is one of them. But do voters here bear ultimate responsibility for who is next Commander in Chief? An August 29 fundraising email from Republican Party of Pennsylvania Chairman Rob Gleason says yes. Because a new poll (not cited) showed Donald Trump to be "within striking distance" of Hillary Clinton, according to the email, now was a time to donate because FiveThirtyEight reported that the winner of Pennsylvania would win the election. The last statement bears a closer examination. Nate Silver’s nationally-renowned prognostication site FiveThirtyEight reports all kinds of statistical analysis in order to predict elections (and it’s gotten the last two right.) Naturally, with Pennsylvania as a battleground state, FiveThirtyEight has done a fair bit of reporting on its possible outcomes, as well as how much power it actually could have. The way FiveThirtyEight figures this out is by determining states’ "tipping power" ― that is, the probability that Pennsylvania, for example, will provide the deciding electoral college vote. This is determined by organizing states from most likely to least likely to vote Republican, or the same for Democrats, and finding which state will provide which candidate the 270th electoral vote needed to win (the majority of the 538 available electoral votes.) Naturally, the dialogue has evolved as the election has gotten closer, and so FiveThirtyEight’s certainty in predicting Pennsylvania to be that state with the most tipping power has also varied. In recent elections, the states that have always been the most contested were Ohio, Florida, North Carolina or Michigan. Pennsylvania is so hotly debated this year because its voting patterns have become increasingly split ― even though the Philadelphia metro area and its suburbs form a pretty solid blue voting bloc, Western Pennsylvania and other parts of the state have trended more Republican in recent elections. When asked for comment, Aaron Bycoffe pointed us to a May article about the topic, but again, the headline reads "Why Pennsylvania Could Decide The 2016 Election." Could. Not will. And that’s an important difference. FiveThirtyEight has dedicated plenty of coverage this year to analyzing Pennsylvania’s importance, and the site also has a regularly updated election tracker that includes a list ranking the states with the most tipping power. Currently, Pennsylvania is listed second only to Florida, but the advantage the latter has is 5.7 percentage points, which is a pretty commanding lead compared to the margins of difference between, say, Pennsylvania and the third-likely state, Ohio. Pennsylvania is edging out Ohio in tipping power by just 0.5 percent. Those numbers all still have plenty of time to change before the November election. When asked to clarify the claim, the Pennsylvania GOP referred to the reports that have most confidently handed Pennsylvania tipping power. Rather than numbers, they’ve mostly been commentary from staff, like this chat between several editors and a senior politics writer, a couple of whom answer Pennsylvania to the final question of which state will tip the election. Dave Wasserman, who writes for the Cook Political Report, also penned a piece touting the importance of the state and its increased likelihood to determine the winner. But the staff chat was in early June, and Wasserman published his piece in May. The election tracker is updated at least daily. Our ruling It’s true that at various points in its coverage, FiveThirtyEight strongly emphasized Pennsylvania’s potential to be the deciding vote. However, saying that it flat-out declared the Pennsylvania winner the automatic winner of the presidency is still misleading. For one thing, FiveThirtyEight itself reports predictive statistical analysis ― which is never going to produce such a definitive answer about a swing state’s power. FiveThirtyEight also makes a point of explaining in its election forecast user guide that fluctuations in polling data, which it uses to determine things like tipping power, have more meaning later in the election. So any shifts in the polls (which, given Donald Trump’s lack of predictability as a candidate, are not impossible in this election) could rearrange where that tipping power resides. It’s an effective strategy to stress the importance of a state’s electoral votes in order to get donations and constituencies to vote, but even that should be accurately represented. FiveThirtyEight’s actual election tracker still leaves ambiguity as to Pennsylvania’s ultimate tipping power. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-15385	Says "Hillary Clinton's rejection of efforts to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat not only defies logic, but the will of the majority of Americans."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/29/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-most-americans-support-voter-id-/	In Scott Walker and Hillary Clinton's perfect world, at around this time next year each will be preparing to participate in the 2016 presidential debates. For now, they will have to be content exchanging jabs from afar. The latest exchange began June 4, 2015 when Clinton, who is the leading Democratic presidential candidate, criticized Walker and three other GOP contenders in a speech at Texas Southern University in Houston for their support of voter ID laws. She claimed Walker had cut back early voting in Wisconsin and made it harder for college students to vote. We rated that Mostly True. Walker responded to Clinton’s attack with a statement and then through a series of tweets. In his statement, Walker said, "Hillary Clinton's rejection of efforts to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat not only defies logic, but the will of the majority of Americans." Is Walker right that a strong majority of Americans support photo IDs to vote? And do those requirements make it "easier to vote and harder to cheat"? Polls and photo ID The thrust of Walker’s claim was that photo ID laws are exceptionally popular among voters, and that Hillary Clinton’s view opposing them is out of step. So we will start there. According to the polls we examined, Walker is on target about public support. A Rasmussen Reports poll published June 3, 2015, showed 76 percent of respondents believe voters should be required to show a form of photo identification before being allowed to vote. Even 58 percent of respondents who identified as Democrats supported voter ID laws. The poll included 952 likely voters and had a margin of error of 3 percent. A 2012 Washington Post poll found 74 percent of respondents said they believed voters should have to show government-issued ID before casting a ballot. Again, the support crossed demographic groups: 78 percent of white respondents supported voter ID laws; as did 67 percent of non-whites, 65 percent of blacks and 64 percent of Hispanics. The poll included 2,047 adults. The margin of error was 2.5 percent. We looked at several other national polls, and all had similar numbers: between 70 percent and 80 percent of voters support requiring a photo ID to vote. Meanwhile, a 2014 Marquette University Law School poll of 1,409 registered Wisconsin voters found 60 percent of respondents supported requiring a photo ID to vote. The margin of error was 2.7 percent. "It gets overwhelming public support," said Kenneth Mayer, a professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. "Depending on which poll, you might get 60 to 80 percent support. "The reason you get that level of support ... most of the people who vote have an accessible voter ID." Easy to vote, hard to cheat There are two other elements embedded in Walker’s claim -- that photo ID laws make it easier to vote and harder to cheat. On these points, there is great partisan disagreement and dug-in views on both sides. Critics of ID laws -- mainly Democrats -- say the amount of voter fraud is small and that the laws can disenfranchise poor and elderly voters who may have difficulty obtaining a photo ID. Supporters note the law includes provisions to address access to IDs and argue that any amount of fraud is too much. "It doesn’t matter if there’s one, 100 or 1,000," Walker said in a 2014 gubernatorial debate. "Amongst us, who would be that one person who would like to have our vote canceled out by a vote that was cast illegally?" In 2011, Walker signed Act 23, the law that requires Wisconsin voters to present a form of photo ID before receiving a ballot. Provisions of the law were quickly challenged in court. Thus the law has only fully in place been for the 2012 spring primary -- a nonpartisan contest that had only eight judicial races on the ballot, plus three local special elections. It has yet to be tested in a statewide race. That will change in 2016, with the spring elections. In March 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear a challenge to the law, meaning it now stands. What changed? Before the 2011 legislation, an already-registered voter had to simply state his or her name and address to a poll worker in order to receive a ballot. Under the new law, a voter must also show an acceptable form of photo ID and sign the poll book before receiving a ballot. When asked for evidence that photo ID laws make it easier to vote, a Walker aide pointed to a modest increase in voter turnout in Wisconsin since the law was passed. But that ignores the many other factors at play in driving turnout, including the candidates on the ballot and how close the race is perceived to be by voters. And, as noted, the law has not yet been fully in place for a statewide election, so to say it increased turnout is a stretch at best. Indeed, some studies, such as one from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, suggest photo ID laws may have contributed to a decrease in voter turnout in some states. In 2012, more than 9 in 10 registered Wisconsin voters were estimated to have a valid form of photo ID. That left around 300,000 registered voters without a photo ID at the time. Mayer, who conducted the estimate, said it is unknown how many unregistered voters may lack the proper documents to obtain a free, state-issued ID. The bottom line: At least some voters will have to go to extra steps to obtain a valid ID. That makes it more difficult to vote, not easier. As for the "harder to cheat" portion, Mayer conceded photo ID laws could be effective against in-person voter fraud. But he and others note that there have been few documented cases of in-person voter fraud. "It makes it harder for kangaroos to vote, but kangaroo voter fraud is not a problem," Mayer said. That argument, though, goes to the whether the law itself was even needed. Walker’s claim was on the impact of the changes. The new law adds an extra verification step at the polling place before votes can be cast. That clearly makes it harder to cheat, as Walker claimed. When it comes to voter fraud, the most common type is voting by felons who are not allowed to vote, said Reid Magney, a public information officer for the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board. A felon is not allowed to vote if he or she is still "on-paper," meaning he or she is on parole, on extended supervision or on probation. Once a felon is "off-paper" he or she can vote again after re-registering. Felon voting has been a problem before in Milwaukee. A Journal Sentinel investigation from 2008 identified "at least 278 cases where felons may have improperly voted." But voter ID laws would not prevent this type of voter fraud; many felons can still get driver's licenses. The state catches illegal felon voters by cross referencing a list of voters to a list of felons "on paper" with the Department of Corrections. Our rating Walker said, "Hillary Clinton's rejection of efforts to make it easier to vote and harder to cheat not only defies logic, but the will of the majority of Americans." Walker is on point with the main thrust of his claim. Polls show strong support for voter ID laws, including from Democrats. The other elements of the claim -- easier to vote and harder to cheat -- amount to a split. It’s clearly not easier to vote if the extra step of obtaining a photo ID is added. Likewise, it is harder to cheat if there is an extra verification step at the polling place. On balance, we rate Walker’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-03366	Says Obama administration delay of health care law's employer mandate affects about 1 percent of the American workforce.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/12/robert-menendez/sen-robert-menendez-says-obamacares-employer-manda/	Just how many workers does the health care law’s employer mandate affect, anyway? The Obama administration’s holiday-week announcement that it would delay requiring large employers to provide full-time employees with affordable coverage inflamed opponents of the law. (And dismayed some supporters, who questioned whether the president had that authority.) But some pointed out that, in any case, the mandate wouldn’t affect many folks. Take Sen. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., on NBC’s Meet the Press on July 7: "96 percent of all companies in America weren't subject to the mandate because they're under 50 employees. Those who are subject to the mandate, 95 percent of them already offer insurance so, we're talking about probably 1 percent of the American workforce that works for a company subject to the mandate that didn't get insurance and will be able to get it in the health exchanges that open up in October." Are we talking about just 1 percent of the American workforce? Employers, employees We asked Menendez’s office for evidence for his claim. A spokeswoman pointed us to a respected employer survey and two opinion pieces. It turns out that "1 percent of the American workforce" is a ballpark calculation based on survey research on the number of employees who work for large firms that don’t offer insurance. Several prominent health economists we spoke with think that’s a pretty reasonable way to estimate it. But some others think it may understate the reach of the mandate by millions. But no one’s sure just how many million. Let us explain. Here’s how the mandate works: Starting in 2014 — now 2015 — employers with more than 50 full-time equivalent employees must offer affordable health coverage. If they don’t offer coverage, or offer coverage that’s too limited or too expensive, they’ll likely end up on the hook for penalties (the government’s calling them "shared responsibility payments") of about $2,000 per full-time employee, excluding the first 30. For the visual learners among you, the independent nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation summarized the mandate in this nifty infographic. The employer mandate’s supposed to work hand-in-hand with the individual mandate that everybody — with a few exceptions — carry health insurance or pay a tax penalty. If employers don’t offer coverage, their workers may seek it out on new insurance exchanges, where they may be eligible for tax credits. The employer penalties are designed to discourage dumping employees onto the exchanges, where they may drive up the cost of government subsidies. Or, barring that, to offset the cost of those subsidies. (The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated in May, before the delay, that the penalties would be worth $10 billion in 2015.) But Menendez argued on Meet the Press that because the mandate applies only to larger companies, most of whom already offer insurance, the number of workers who would have been affected just isn’t all that big. More specifically: about 1 percent of the American workforce. Let’s talk about that calculation for a second. The size of the U.S. labor force, according to the government, is about 156 million. Menendez’s sources estimated the mandate only affects about 1 million or 1.5 million workers — about 1 percent of 156 million. They focused only on the likely number of employees who work for the 5 percent of large firms that don’t offer insurance, based on a widely respected employer survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation. We know because we talked to them: Zeke Emanuel, a bioethicist, and Mark Duggan, a health economist, both scholars at the University of Pennsylvania who have advised the Obama administration. (Emanuel also happens to be the brother of Rahm, the president’s former chief of staff, now mayor of Chicago.) It’s hard to estimate exactly, Duggan said, but if the perhaps 10,000 to 12,000 companies that don’t offer insurance each have about 80 to 100 employees — there you go. It’s in the range of Menendez’s 1 percent. It’s reasonable to assume that most of the companies with more than 50 employees that don’t offer insurance are on the small side, they say, because the Kaiser research shows the larger the size of the firm, the more likely it is to offer insurance. Kaiser itself concludes that in 2012, 95 percent of employers with at least 50 workers offered insurance — and among firms of that size, 98 percent of employees worked for a company that offered coverage to at least some of its workers. Here’s the criticism: What about the uninsured workers who work for companies that offer insurance? Duggan and Emanuel (and others, including Romneycare/Obamacare architect Jonathan Gruber at MIT) say most of those folks wouldn’t trigger the mandate, anyway: They’re part-time or temporary workers that companies won’t be required to insure. Other health economists we spoke with said: Not so fast. How do you know? Christopher Conover, who works for the Center for Health Policy and Inequalities Research at Duke University, argues there are millions of uninsured workers who work for companies that offer insurance who may well qualify for employer coverage under Obamacare. He pointed to a recent example in the New York Times of a restaurant that would likely be subject to the employer mandate. The owner offers health coverage to employees, but only to nine of them. It’s a company, then, that offers insurance — and so wouldn’t be part of Duggan’s ballpark calculation. But under the employer mandate, the restaurant owner estimates he would need to insure 22 of his 85 employees. Conover argues any estimate of the number of workers affected by the mandate should include workers like the 13 restaurant employees who are right now left out. They work for a company that offers health insurance, but not to them. Here’s the thing: Economists disagree about how common that situation really is. Are there a million such workers? Five million? More? They don’t know. "It’s a lot more than a million people. It just has to be," said Stephen Parente, a health economist at the University of Minnesota who advised Sen. John McCain’s 2008 presidential campaign. Still, experts we talked to agreed that the vast majority of the American workforce are not affected. "I think the bottom line is that it is small," said Gruber of MIT. "Menendez may not be exactly right but he is in the right ballpark." Our ruling Menendez said on Meet the Press that "we're talking about probably 1 percent of the American workforce that works for a company subject to the mandate that didn't get insurance." He cited a ballpark estimate by health economists based on the small number of large employers who don’t offer insurance. Critics of the estimate say that calculation misses uninsured workers for the 95 percent of large employers that do offer insurance. The problem is that no one’s sure how many of those workers would be subject to the mandate — as opposed to part-time or temporary workers who don’t qualify for employer insurance now, and wouldn’t in 2015, either. But that number, even if it's millions more, remains a small percentage of the U.S. workforce. We rate Menendez's claim Mostly True.

pomt-10494	"He positions himself as pro environment, but he scored a zero — yes, zero — from the League of Conservation Voters last year."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/apr/08/moveon/absences-wrecked-his-rating/	The left-leaning organization MoveOn.org targeted Sen. John McCain in an e-mail to supporters, listing "10 things you should know about John McCain (but probably don't)." The list attacks McCain on a host of issues that include his policies, personal wealth and personality. The final item attacks McCain for his record on the environment. "He positions himself as proenvironment, but he scored a zero — yes, zero — from the League of Conservation Voters last year," the e-mail states. McCain says he supports the environment. His campaign Web site brags: "Along with his commitment to clean air and water, and to conserving open space, he has been a leader on the issue of global warming with the courage to call the nation to action on an issue we can no longer afford to ignore." It's also true that the League of Conservation Voters gave McCain a score of zero on its 2007 Congressional scorecard, placing him among eight senators who got doughnuts. But there is a mitigating reason McCain got a zero. Of the 15 votes the league graded, McCain was absent for every vote — yes, every vote. The other bottom-ranking senators actively voted against the league's agenda. Five voted against the league's preferred position on all 15 votes, and two voted against the league's position on 14 votes. To find out if McCain really is the bottom of the barrel on the environment, we called David Jenkins of Republicans for Environmental Protection, who served on the league's scorecard advisory committee. Jenkins said McCain's record on the environment is significantly better than the league's scorecard shows, and his organization endorsed McCain for president in October 2007, during the Republican primary. "If someone wanted to make the case that, as a senator, you should be there for votes, well, you could make that case," Jenkins said. "But to say that it says something about his environmental positions is disingenuous." (We looked at another, similar controversy over using missed votes to rate McCain's environmental record; read that story here .) The Republicans for Environmental Protection does its own scorecard, but McCain didn't do so great on that one, getting only 36 points on a 100 point scale. (The group's rankings are a little more complicated because they also award bonus points for "leadership positions"; it's even possible to receive a score higher than 100.) Despite McCain's low ratings, Jenkins considers him one of the three most reliable Republican senators on environmental issues. (The other two Jenkins named are Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe, both of Maine.) MoveOn's words about McCain's environmental record are literally true — because he's missed so many votes. As we noted in our previous item, his average score with the group between 2001 and 2006 was 44.3, but the e-mail gives the impression that McCain is rock-bottom on environmental issues.

pomt-02396	"As attorney general, I have prosecuted judges, district attorneys and other public officials across Texas who violated that (public) trust, who have been corrupted."	true	/texas/statements/2014/mar/11/greg-abbott/greg-abbotts-office-has-prosecuted-public-official/	Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott drew heat for a Feb. 4 2014, speech in which he likened official corruption scandals in Texas-Mexico border counties to "third-world practices," a comment PolitiFact Texas unpacked in a Feb. 11 In Context article. His comparison drew criticism from lawmakers, the McAllen newspaper and his main opponent in the governor’s race, Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis, who said, "Abbott even went as far as comparing the Texas border to a third-world country." (Abbott soon after won the Republican gubernatorial nomination in the March 2014 primary.) Responding to such criticism, Abbott said in a Feb. 10 opinion article in the McAllen Monitor that his concerns about corruption expressed in his speech "apply wherever corruption is found." "Public service is a public trust," Abbott wrote. "As attorney general, I have prosecuted judges, district attorneys and other public officials across Texas who violated that trust, who have been corrupted." We were curious about that because the attorney general’s office doesn’t focus on battling violent crime. That’s the purview of local prosecutors and police departments. As the Texas Constitution makes clear, the primary job of the attorney general is representing the state in civil matters. Still, state law permits the attorney general to help prosecute a criminal case if a local prosecutor requests assistance. For such purposes, state lawmakers have allowed the attorney general to employ peace officers and lawyers with backgrounds in criminal prosecution to pitch in on occasion. We asked Abbott’s office for information on the prosecutions he referred to in his commentary. Spokeswoman Lauren Bean emailed us a list of 104 prosecutions handled by the agency since Abbott became attorney general in late 2002. The AG’s office was the lead prosecutor in the vast majority of the cases, she told us by phone. The list included cases involving public officials from dog catcher (a child pornography case that ended in a guilty verdict) through higher city and county officials, tax assessors, sheriffs, justices of the peace, judges, assistant district attorneys and one former district attorney (who pleaded guilty to paying himself and others more than $2 million illegally while in office). Crimes involving child pornography and taking public funds are certainly violations of the public trust, though we also wondered how many of Abbott’s cases involved corruption like the examples he presented in his "third-world" speech: a former state district judge sentenced to six years in prison for his role in a cash-for-favors scheme, a former sheriff’s captain who took bribes from drug traffickers; and law enforcement officials who stole drugs and resold them to dealers. Abbott also noted in his Feb. 10 opinion piece that the Monitor had reported that "cases of public officials on the take have spiked." And, Abbott said, "there have been other stories about law enforcement officers in other Texas counties involved in money laundering, drug smuggling and accepting bribes to protect the cartels and their smuggling routes." Texas Penal Code Chapter 1, Section 1.09, says the attorney general’s office can aid county or district attorneys in prosecuting certain criminal offenses including misuse of state property or funds and abuse of office, according to the office’s website. Public corruption, bribery and abuse of office were specifically cited in some of Abbott’s prosecutions. We set aside those that did not immediately appear to relate to misusing a public office. Deleting DWI cases, child pornography or indecency, murder, assault/injury, sexual offenses and gambling left 61 prosecutions. Eleven of those 61 prosecutions cited theft by a public servant. Others fell into criminal offense categories including bribery, (breach of) public integrity, official oppression, election violations, fraud and abuse of official capacity, as well as misappropriation or misallocation of public funds or property. The type of case in one prosecution involving an assistant county auditor was specifically given as "public corruption." So certainly some of the prosecutions involved what ordinary citizens might regard as corruption. We sought expert advice. Two attorneys suggested it’s not easy to decide when a criminal case involves corruption in office. Director Gregg Cox of the Travis County district attorney’s special prosecutions division, which investigates allegations of wrongdoing by public officials, told us by email, "There is no definition of ‘corruption’ in the Penal Code or Code of Criminal Procedure, and because the way that term is used can differ from office to office, I would just not be comfortable commenting on that." George Dix, a criminal law expert and University of Texas law professor, said via email, "I'm not sure what are 'corruption' cases. As far as I know, that is not a term of art. I suppose the term could mean a prosecution for a crime that requires proof of some official malfeasance." Finally, we looked at whether the prosecutions occurred across Texas, as Abbott wrote, and at whether the prosecuted individuals included judges and district attorneys, as he said. The 104 prosecutions occurred in about one-fourth of Texas’ 254 counties -- six on the border and 193 scattered elsewhere across the state. Nine of Abbott’s public-official prosecutions involved a judge, assistant district attorney, county attorney and district attorney (at the time of his crimes). Four seemed not to be related to abuse of office: a child pornography case, two drunken-driving cases and one case involving misdemeanor offensive contact with an employee. The remaining five prosecutions: State v. David McCoy A Feb. 21, 2008, Amarillo Globe-News news story said, "Suspended 100th District Court Judge David McCoy concluded an agreement with the state Attorney General's office Thursday afternoon that will prevent him from facing felony charges. … A Childress County Grand Jury indicted him on two felony indictments: abuse of official capacity and theft by a public servant." News reports provided no additional detail. State v. Emil Karl Prohl An April 29, 2010, Facebook post by the Kerrville Daily Times said, "Former 198th district judge Emil Karl Prohl has pled guilty to charges of misapplication of funds. He gets two years probation for taking double reimbursement for travel expenses out of several district and county accounts." State vs. Joe Frank Garza A May 9, 2011, Corpus Christi Caller-Times news story said, "Former 79th District Attorney Joe Frank Garza began serving a six-month stint behind bars on Monday for illegally paying himself and his employees more than $2 million from his office's drug forfeiture fund." In re: Judge Christopher Dupuy A Sept. 19, 2013, Houston Chronicle news story said, "A suspended Galveston judge pleaded guilty Thursday to two misdemeanors in exchange for two years of probation. County Court-at-Law Judge Christopher Dupuy pleaded guilty to abuse of office and perjury in exchange for two years of deferred adjudication. … The petition for removal accuses Dupuy of failing to obey an order from a state appeals court, abusing his authority by retaliating against attorneys and threatening the district clerk while attempting to interfere in his own divorce case." State vs. Scott Tidwell An Oct. 5, 2011, Associated Press news story said, "A former West Texas county attorney will spend four months in jail for retaliating against two nurses who made an anonymous complaint about a doctor to state medical regulators. … The nurses were fired from their jobs at a hospital in Kermit and charged with felonies." Our ruling Abbott said, "As attorney general, I have prosecuted judges, district attorneys and other public officials across Texas who violated that (public) trust, who have been corrupted." During Abbott’s decade-plus as attorney general, his office has helped prosecute 104 cases against public officials across Texas -- 61 of them appearing to involve public corruption and five of those against judges, a county attorney and a DA.

pomt-10938	Says Judge Brett Kavanaugh "ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was unconstitutional (reversed by full Circuit Court)."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/25/amy-klobuchar/trump-brett-kavanaugh-scotus-cfpb-unconstitutional/	Democrats are using a court decision on their hard-fought financial industry watchdog to raise red flags about President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court pick. U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said Brett Kavanaugh wrote an opinion opposing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. "Serious concerns I have about Judge Kavanaugh in addition to the obvious health care & separation of power issues: He ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was unconstitutional (reversed by full Circuit Court) & went out of his way to dissent against net neutrality," Klobuchar tweeted on July 9. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., made the same claim in a tweet. We wondered whether Kavanaugh had indeed ruled the CFPB was unconstitutional. Largely, yes. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau The bureau has stirred controversy from the start. Warren was an early advocate for the CFPB and was considered the likely first head until a potential appointment was opposed by Republicans in Congress. Obama’s second choice, Richard Cordray, was also kept from taking office, until Obama sidestepped GOP lawmakers by making a recess appointment. Cordray was later confirmed with some bipartisan support in 2013. (Cordray is now running for governor in Ohio.) Unlike most federal agencies, the bureau does not rely on appropriations for its funding. The bureau’s operating budget comes from the Federal Reserve and does not require congressional approval. The CFPB is headed by a single director with a five-year term who cannot be fired at will. The president may only remove the director for "inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office," according to the law that established it. What Kavanaugh said After CFPB imposed a $109 million fine on PHH Corp., the New Jersey mortgage service provider sued, challenging the constitutionality of the CFPB. In 2016, the D.C. Court of Appeals sided with the company and cleared the fine. Kavanaugh, one of the three judges, wrote the opinion. Kavanaugh wrote that the CFPB is "unconstitutionally structured." The structure, Kavanaugh argued, gives the CFPB director more unilateral authority than anyone in the government besides the president. In order to remedy the constitutional flaw, Kavanaugh wrote, Supreme Court precedent dictates a "narrower remedy" than shutting down the entire CFPB. Kavanaugh suggested allowing the president to supervise, direct and fire the director at will. That’s not exactly the same thing as finding the CFPB itself to be unconstitutional, but it’s close, law experts told us. A later decision by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld CFPB’s constitutionality. The question could still come to the Supreme Court. Aaron Klein, the policy director at Brookings Institution’s Center on Regulations and Markets, said that tying CFPB directly to the president, and thus election cycles, could curb its intended independence. "Reducing the independence of any financial regulator is likely to make them pursue less politically unpopular activities, like reining in credit practices during good times," he said. "That’s why financial regulation tends to only pass Congress after crises, and as the memory of the crisis fades, deregulation comes in." Our ruling Klobuchar said Kavanaugh "ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was unconstitutional (reversed by full Circuit Court)." In 2016, Kavanaugh wrote the opinion for a three judge panel of the D.C. Circuit finding the CFPB structurally unconstitutional. The issue lay in the bureau’s leadership structure, not the bureau itself. That said, a change to its leadership structure could rein in the regulatory activities CFPB performs.

pomt-13954	"We've seen more manufacturing jobs created since I've been president than anytime since the 1990s. That's a fact."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/16/barack-obama/obama-weve-seen-more-manufacturing-jobs-created-an/	Attempting to defend his economic record, President Barack Obama cited manufacturing job creation as a key indicator of growth under his presidency. In a PBS NewsHour special held in Elkhart, Ind. — the RV capital of the world — Obama said that his presidency has seen more manufacturing jobs created since the 1990s when Bill Clinton was president. "We've seen more manufacturing jobs created since I've been president than anytime since the 1990s. That's a fact," Obama said. His statement came in a larger discussion of manufacturing, where Obama tried to assuage the concerns of his skeptics. During the interview, Obama also claimed that the United States has a bigger manufacturing base than it has for much of history, but that automation has led to fewer workers at the same time. But is what he claimed, that "we've seen more manufacturing jobs created since I've been president than anytime since the 1990s," truly a fact? In one sense, yes, but Obama is using some clever phrasing and picking a most advantageous timeframe. Manufacturing employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics best shows the situation. Remember, Obama took office in January 2009. As you can see, Obama actually has presided over a net loss of manufacturing jobs since he has been in office of about 95,000 jobs. But all of those losses are concentrated in the first year-plus of his presidency. Isolating the period from March 2010 forward, the number of manufacturing jobs steadily has been increasing (though not back to the 2009 levels). Between March 2010 (the trough of Obama’s presidency) and May 2016, there has been an increase of 832,000 manufacturing jobs. This is what Obama was referring to, the White House told us. And by that measure, that is indeed the greatest period of increase since the 1990s. Is it really an accomplishment, though? That’s debatable for several reasons. Bigger gains in the 1990s. The United States saw a bigger increase in manufacturing jobs in the 1990s. From July 1993 through April 1998, for instance, the country added 898,000 jobs. Manufacturing was in sharp decline for all of the 2000s. The chart above shows how far, how fast the manufacturing sector has fallen, and while the jobs picture has brightened in recent years — far fewer people remain employed in the manufacturing sector. At the start of 2000, there were a total of 17.28 million employed in manufacturing. Today, that number stands at 12.29 million We’ve seen job losses recently. The United States lost manufacturing jobs — 10,000 — in May 2016. Who deserves credit? And while Obama did not directly attribute the recent increases to his policies, that is an obvious implication. In that regard, it is important to note that other economic factors beyond the president’s control also played a role. Sujit CanagaRetna, a senior fiscal analyst at the Council of State Governments, said external influences such as energy production and the global economic climate also played a role. Our ruling "We've seen more manufacturing jobs created since I've been president than anytime since the 1990s. That's a fact." There has indeed been a consistent decline in manufacturing jobs between 1998 until 2010, so Obama is correct that his presidency has seen the largest period of sustained manufacturing growth since the 1990s. However, manufacturing jobs have still suffered a net loss over Obama’s term. Obama’s statement could lead people to believe there has been the first net gain compared to the 1990s, but that is incorrect — just the first growth spurt.

pomt-04186	Agriculture "is the strongest industry in Ohio."	true	/ohio/statements/2012/dec/12/john-kasich/john-kasich-says-agriculture-strongest-industry-oh/	Jobs in manufacturing, especially in the auto industry, drew so much attention in recent political campaigns that one observer speculated every man, woman and child in Ohio must spend their days building cars. PolitiFact Ohio knew that was a joke, but the focus on factories increased our interest in comments by Gov. John Kasich when he addressed the 2012 meeting of the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation on Nov. 29, 2012. The Ohio Capital Blog recorded the event. Agriculture, Kasich said, "is the strongest industry in Ohio" and "the bedrock of the state of Ohio." We've heard similar comments from others: Sen. Sherrod Brown ("the state's No. 1 industry"), the state Department of Agriculture ("Ohio's No. 1 industry") and the Farm Bureau itself ("Ohio's top industry"). It's a bipartisan claim. But PolitiFact Ohio wondered what measure makes agriculture No. 1. Employment? Dollars generated? Taxes levied? Square footage? So we called Kasich's office and the state Agriculture Department and asked for sources. Both referred us to "OHFOOD," for Ohio food, which is an annually updated economic model developed by Thomas L. Sporleder, the much-cited professor of agribusiness at The Ohio State University. The model, by its own description, is designed "to capture the inter-dependencies and linkages among various sectors and industries composing the complex economy of Ohio" and "specifically to provide estimates of the economic importance of the food and agriculture-related cluster, along with the general manufacturing and service sectors, of the Ohio economy." Agriculture Department spokeswoman Erica Pitchford Hawkins said the analysis is the most comprehensive study available of Ohio agribusiness, and we could find nothing comparable. The most recent, from June 2012, uses data from 2010 gathered primarily federal and county level agencies, Sporleder said. In 2010, the study found, the total food and agricultural cluster contributed 11.7 percent, or $105 billion, of Ohio's total economic output of $898.7 billion. The cluster's share of the gross state product of $477.7 billion was $51 billion, or almost 11 percent. Ohio's gross state product improved by 1.3 percent from 2008 to 2010, the study said, while the portion attributed to the "agrifood" cluster increased about 30 percent. The agrifood cluster accounts for 14 percent of Ohio employment, or about 1 of 7 jobs. It gained 1 percent from 2008 to 2010, a period when total employment declined about 3 percent. There are some points worth noting: In the OHFOOD study, the "financial, legal and real estate" cluster is listed as a larger private sector of the state economy than the agrifood cluster. Kasich's office, though, pointed out that the grouping of financial services, legal services and real estate activities is particular to the study. That grouping is not used by such agencies as the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. Sporleder told us the cluster is grouped because "it’s all service related," but "it’s not a supply chain" in the way food and agriculture is. That leaves food and agriculture the biggest sector of the state economy. "If you’re only talking about commodities, that’s not the case," Sporleder said, meaning the cluster is more than just farming. "If you’re talking wheat to flour to bread, you get the sector build-up. It’s an interdependent supply chain." More than just farming, the "agrifood" or "agribusiness" cluster also encompasses processing, wholesaling and retailing, and food services. As a group, it accounts for $3 billion of the gross state product in the OHFOOD mode. Kasich described agriculture as the strongest industry in Ohio. Data shows that the agrifood sector is the largest sector of the state’s economy. His statement is accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, it rates True.

pomt-04513	Says Mitt Romney's plan "calls for a $5 trillion tax cut."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/04/barack-obama/obama-says-romneys-plan-5-trillion-tax-cut/	Early in the first presidential debate, President Barack Obama attacked Mitt Romney’s tax plan as unbalanced and devastating for the middle class. He charged that Romney’s plan "calls for a $5 trillion tax cut," and challenged him to defend it. The candidates repeatedly disagreed about that number. Four times the president spoke of Romney’s $5 trillion tax cut, and four times the governor rejected it. Obama said: "Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that he's been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn't been able to identify them." Later, Romney countered: "I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What I've said is I won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. That's part one. So there's no economist that can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan." Obama has talked about the $5 trillion tax cut for months. We have looked at this claim before and found it lacked important context. Here’s why. The claim is based on a study done by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group that has analyzed the tax plans of the candidates. The center examined Romney’s proposals for a 20 percent reduction in all federal income tax rates, eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax, eliminating the estate tax and other tax reductions. The center estimated that altogether, the lost revenues would total $480 billion by 2015. The Obama campaign adds up the cost over a decade and winds up with $4.8 trillion, which it then rounds up to $5 trillion. The conclusion is accurate but misleading. Yes, the cuts would total that amount, but as Obama himself noted as he continued speaking, Romney hopes to offset the lost revenues by closing loopholes and deductions. The reductions in tax breaks are as much a part of Romney’s plan as the tax cuts. But Obama is right in pointing out that Romney has yet to specify what tax breaks he would change. The most Romney has personally said is that he might cap deductions at $17,000, but that is a broad figure and does not describe how the number would be achieved. The impact of changing deductions on the scale needed to offset the tax cuts would be great. The largest deductions include interest on home mortgages, state and local taxes and the tax free treatment of health benefits. These are real pocketbook issues for most households and tinkering with them could have significant effects on large sectors of the economy. Romney offers key details on the taxes he would cut. But in explaining how to pay for them, he has essentially said only that he would keep the overall tax burden the same across all income groups by changing unnamed tax breaks. Our ruling President Obama said Mitt Romney seeks a $5 trillion tax cut. The $5 trillion figure accounts for only half of Romney’s plan -- and it's cumulative over 10 years. The governor says he will offset those lost revenues by reducing tax deductions and eliminating loopholes. However, he has never said what those changes would be. The president made a misleading statement about an incomplete plan, but he did describe what the plan was missing and Romney would not fill in the gaps. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-00155	"Thousands of folks are opening West Virginia E-ZPass accounts."	true	/west-virginia/statements/2018/oct/24/jim-justice/are-thousands-west-virginians-signing-e-zpass/	West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice recently took to Twitter to tout the state’s E-ZPass system. On Aug. 27, Justice tweeted, "BIG SAVINGS: I promised a great E-ZPass deal and here it is. Thousands of folks are opening West Virginia E-ZPass accounts, and you can join them! If you sign up now, your plan will automatically transition to the $24 three-year plan in September." We wondered whether it was correct that "thousands of folks are opening West Virginia E-ZPass accounts." (Justice’s office did not respond to an inquiry.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In our initial inquiry in September, Dalphord W. Webb, director of customer service operations for West Virginia E-ZPass, had said hard numbers were not yet available. He added, however, that "we have been experiencing unprecedented growth over the last several months. This growth has resulted in a significant rise in applications, both paper and online, as well as emails, phone calls and walk-ins." By late October, Webb was able to provide hard numbers. He sent PolitiFact a statement that said that "from August 1 through October 15, there were 13,630 new West Virginia E-ZPass accounts opened." If you prorate the number of new accounts that would have been opened between August 1 and August 27 -- the day of Justice’s tweet -- it works out to a bit under 5,000. That still counts as "thousands." It’s worth noting that the only E-ZPass toll road in the state is the West Virginia Turnpike, which runs from Charleston southeast to Princeton. So the "great E-ZPass deal" would only be worthwhile for residents of southern West Virginia or those who drive through that region with some regularity. (It would also be useful for anyone who travels outside the state in areas with E-ZPass roads.) Our ruling Justice tweeted that "thousands of folks are opening West Virginia E-ZPass accounts." The E-ZPass authority reported 13,630 new accounts between August 1 and October 15. Prorated to the period covered by Justice’s tweet, that works out to about 5,000, which meets the definition of "thousands." We rate the statement True.

Johnson, a former New Mexico governor, said Trump has said things that would disqualify anyone else from running for president. Keilar asked Johnson if he thought Trump was racist. "When it comes to Mexican immigration and that he would call immigrants from Mexico murderers and rapists look, that’s just not true," Johnson said. "They are more law-abiding than U.S. citizens, and that is a statistic." We wondered if there really was a statistic to support Johnson’s statement that Mexican immigrants commit fewer crimes than U.S. citizens. Immigrants up, crime down Johnson based his comments on data cited in a July 2015 Wall Street Journal opinion piece by Jason L. Riley, a senior fellow at the conservative-leaning Manhattan Institute. Riley’s commentary focused on studies that show immigrants — irrespective of nationality or legal status — "are less likely than the native population to commit violent crimes or to be incarcerated." Riley points to a July 2015 report by the American Immigration Council, a pro-immigrant nonprofit in Washington. The council analyzed data from the Census’ 2010 American Community Survey and found that about 1.6 percent of all immigrant males (Census does not specify legal status) between 18 and 39 years old were incarcerated, compared to 3.3 percent of the native-born population. The council also reported 2010 Census data that shows incarceration rates of young, less educated Mexican, Salvadoran and Guatemalan men — which comprise the bulk of the unauthorized population — are "significantly lower" than incarceration rates of native-born young men without a high-school diploma. Specifically for Mexican men ages 18 to 39, the incarceration rate in 2010 was 2.8 percent, compared to 10.7 percent for native-born men in the same age group, the council’s report said. Immigrants come to the United States to build better lives for themselves and their children, said Walter A. Ewing, a senior researcher at the American Immigration Council and one of the report’s authors. "They are very motivated to not blow that opportunity by getting in trouble with the police," he said in an email interview. "This is especially so for unauthorized immigrants, who can be deported at any time for unlawful presence." And even as the immigrant population increases, crime has gone down, the report said. Between 1990 and 2013, the foreign-born share of the U.S. population increased from 7.9 percent to 13.1 percent, and the number of unauthorized immigrants went up from 3.5 million to 11.2 million. At the same time, violent crime rate (murder, rape and aggravated assault) decreased 48 percent and property crime rate fell 41 percent, the report said, citing FBI data. Bianca E. Bersani, an assistant professor and director of the Criminology and Criminal Justice Program at the University of Massachusetts Boston, says her research also shows that crime involvement among foreign-born residents is lower than that of U.S.-born citizens. It holds true for Mexican immigrants, she said. "When ethnicity can be distinguished and Mexican immigrants isolated from the group of first-generation immigrants, research continues to find that Mexican immigrants have lower rates of involvement in crime compared to their U.S-born peers," Bersani said. Recent studies tracking changes over time also found that areas of the country with an increased foreign-born population do not experience corresponding increases in crime, said Bersani. "The rhetoric of the ‘criminal immigrant’ does not align with the bulk of empirical research," Bersani said. According to Bersani’s research, while first-generation immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than the native-born population, the second generation (individuals born in the United States to at least one foreign-born parent) more closely resemble patterns of their native-born peers (three or more U.S.-born generations). "This does not suggest that the second generation is uniquely crime prone, but instead that they are acting in ways that are no different from the rest of the U.S.-born population," Bersani said. Datasets with information on both crime and immigrant status are rare, Bersani said, though more research and data are becoming available. The Center for Immigration Studies, which supports stricter immigration policies, in a 2009 study said that overall understanding of immigrants and crime "remains confused" due to lack of data and contrary information. Unless inmates are identified as immigrant or native-born, incarceration rates are a poor way to measure links between immigrants and crime, the study said. Deportations of criminal immigrants may also decrease immigrant incarceration rates because many will not return to the United States and commit more crimes, as could be the case with native-born criminals, the CIS report said. There isn’t exact data on how many undocumented immigrants are currently incarcerated. Our ruling Johnson said Mexican immigrants are not "murderers and rapists" but are actually "more law-abiding than U.S. citizens and that is a statistic." Numerous studies by scholars and partisan groups show that the foreign-born population is less likely to commit crimes than the native-born, and experts say this includes Mexican immigrants. Researchers agree more data is needed to get a better understanding of immigration and crime, but the information available does not disprove Johnson’s point.

pomt-08770	"One of the things we found very clearly and consistently is that [video gaming] is a growth industry."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/aug/25/keith-stokes/wake-curt-schilling-deal-stokes-says-video-gaming-/	Many questions have been raised about the wisdom of the state Economic Development Commission's decision to guarantee $75 million in loans to 38 Studios, former Red Sox pitcher Curt Schilling's video game company. In an interview aired Aug. 7 on WJAR-TV, EDC Executive Director Keith Stokes was asked whether the loan guarantee is a good investment for the state. "In the case of 38 Studios, we looked at this company very carefully," Stokes said. "One of the challenges we've had is that this industry, video gaming, is a fairly new industry but it's a very fast growth trajectory industry. We hired a series of national analysts to come in to look at -- not only 38 Studios as a company and their particular business model and their particular product that they were offering to the marketplace -- but we also looked at the industry in total. One of the things we found very clearly and consistently is that it is a growth industry." With most people hurting in the recession, we wondered whether the growth was clear and consistent. Melissa Chambers, senior communications manager for the EDC, sent us a PowerPoint presentation made by Wells Fargo Securities, dated June 14, 2010, showing the growth in the interactive game software industry. It said that worldwide software sales increased from $25.4 billion in 2006 to $46.6 billion in 2008, and predicted a whopping 28-percent jump in 2009. In North America alone, 2009 sales would go up by 23 percent, to $24.4 billion. But then we found some other sales numbers -- including actual numbers for 2009 -- that made us wonder about Stokes' statement. Less than a week after Stokes' TV interview, the Entertainment Software Association, an industry group for developers of video and computer games for consoles, personal computers and the Internet, released a sales report showing that the amount spent on games in the United States dropped by about $1.2 billion in 2009, going from $11.7 billion to $10.5 billion. That's a decline of 10.3 percent. Then we found a previous Software Association report on U.S. sales showing a dip in 2005, when consumer spending on games dropped by about $400 million, to $7 billion. The dip wasn't reflected in the Wells Fargo report, which begins with 2006. Because the United States makes up the bulk of the North American market, we wanted to find out why Wells Fargo's 2009 positive sales projections seemed so far from the actual sales numbers reported by the ESA. We asked the EDC for all the reports it has received that might be relevant to the issue, hoping to find out whether the U.S. numbers reflected a worldwide trend. The corporation sent us another PowerPoint presentation, this one from Strategy Analytics, based in Newton, Mass. It didn't contain any numbers that seemed relevant, so we contacted the firm directly. Jia Wu, a digital media analyst for Strategy, confirmed that U.S. and North American sales for video and online games declined by more than 2 percent in 2009. Worldwide sales, he said, rose by just two thirds of 1 percent, going from $46.2 billion to $46.5 billion. That's a far cry from the 28 percent worldwide jump Wells Fargo predicted for 2009. Then we heard from Lewis Ward, research manager of gaming at International Data Corporation, which also tracks worldwide software game sales, who said that his figures showed a 5-percent decline in in 2009. We also found two reports from February -- four months before Wells Fargo presented its rosy 2009 projections to the EDC -- showing that 2009 was a rough year for the industry. One was from three video game sales tracking companies reporting that overall software sales in the United States, United Kingdom and Japanese markets dropped by 8 percent. The other was a Feb. 19, 2010, press release from Strategy Analytics stating that "2009 was a tough year for video game publishers." In addition, the Strategy Analytics PowerPoint the EDC gave us notes, under the category of "Mitigating risk factors," that "Game industry does have cycles." While the numbers differ from analyst to analyst, the overall theme is contrary to the assertion Stokes made on Channel 10. We asked the EDC to put us in touch with its Wells Fargo representative. They said they weren't able to provide an analyst to speak with us and, instead, sent us to Fred Hashway, the EDC's director of government affairs and policy. He said it really doesn't matter if sales declined in 2009 because "the individual year is irrelevant" to what EDC considers to be more important -- the long-term trend. Wells Fargo's "forecasting ability is still excellent. You don't look at it at one year. You look at it over a period of time." Wells Fargo is predicting good things for the industry, he said. Hashway also said any 2005 U.S. sales dip is "a distinction without a difference" for the same reason -- broader trends are more important. "I think we went back as far as we needed to." By all accounts, the video gaming industry has grown substantially since the 1990s, topping more than $46 billion worldwide. But the sharp drop in U.S. sales in 2005 and 2009, combined with last year's minimal increase in global sales -- or decline, depending on who's giving you the numbers -- show that, at least for those years, the growth in the industry has not been consistent. Strategy Analytics, in its report to the EDC projecting double-digit growth over the next five years for the type of game 38 Studios plans to develop, noted as much. Stokes could have said that the overall trend in the video gaming business has been strongly upward despite a downturn or two. But he didn't. He said growth in the industry was clear and consistent. So we rate his comment as Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-09002	"Only about a third" of Texans who enroll in college graduate.	true	/texas/statements/2010/jul/13/scott-hochberg/hochberg-says-only-one-third-texas-college-student/	Texas’ high school graduation rate has become a serious talking point in this election cycle, but there are other students we should fret about too, says Rep. Scott Hochberg, D-Houston. "We do have a serious problem in this state," he said to a June 25 caucus at the Texas Democratic convention. "We have many. But one of them is when our kids graduate from high school, the proportion that go to college is small. And more seriously, even those who go, only about a third of them are getting through." Two out of three Texas students who go to college don’t graduate? We wondered. As back-up, Hochberg forwarded us data he received from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, which oversees the state’s public colleges and universities. The board tracked students who were in seventh grade in 1997-98 and therefore could have graduated from college by 2009. Results? Some 32 percent of the 168,739 students who entered a Texas college after high school had graduated within a six-year period with a bachelor’s degree, an associate degree or certificate (in real estate or law enforcement, for example). A couple of caveats: First, the data don’t account for students who enrolled in a Texas institution and then transferred out of state. Second, while the enrollment data include the 6 percent of students who attended school out of state, it doesn’t track whether they graduated. A one-time shot of grant money did allow the board to track how many Texans enrolled in 7th grade in 1994-95 had earned college degrees both in and out of state within a six-year period by 2006. It found that of 8,028 high school graduates enrolled in school out of state, almost 50 percent earned a degree or certificate. However, of 134,473 students enrolled in Texas, 36.5 percent graduated. Combined, about 37 percent of the tracked graduates earned a degree or certificate. Andy Kesling, the board’s communications director, said Hochberg is correct that only about one-third of those students graduated from a Texas college. But, he said, it "all depends on how you look at the data. One thing I’m really concerned about is people go away with the impression that only one third of the students going to school in Texas are graduating. If you look at the six-year graduation rate of Texas universities, the graduation rate is 57 percent." That means that of the students who entered a four-year public university in Texas in the fall of 2002, 57 percent graduated within six years, by September 2009. That includes students who transferred to another public or private school in Texas. Hochberg quibbles with that graduation rate because it excludes the many students who attend institutions like community colleges. "It’s not apples to apples," he said. "It’s only the best apples." Of some 300,000 Texas students who were enrolled in 7th grade in 1997-98, about 63,800 later enrolled in a four-year school, like the University of Texas, while 90,800 enrolled in a two-year school, like Austin Community College. That is, about 60 percent of students pursuing post-secondary education go the community college route. Their graduation rate is far lower. Of the students enrolled full time at a community college in the fall of 2002, the board found that only 11 percent graduated within three years, by 2005. The coordinating board isn’t alone in tracking college graduation rates. Using U.S. Census Bureau data, the Chronicle of Higher Education, a Washington-based journal, reported in April that 30.7 percent of Texas 25- to 34-year-olds had college degrees, compared to 38 percent nationally. Then there’s the National Center for Higher Education Management Systems, which found that as of 2008, 49 percent of first-time full-time Texas students seeking a bachelor’s degree graduated within six years, ranking the state 35th nationally. Looking at the percentage of first-time full-time students seeking their associate degrees, the center found Texas fared worse: 18.6 percent, ranking 41st in the country. Looking at the raw numbers, we found that 35.2 percent of students seeking an associate or bachelor’s degree graduated. Where does this leave Hochberg’s statement? As we learned in earlier checking candidate claims about high-school graduation rates, there are several ways to sort the numbers. The state’s six-year graduation rate at universities, for example, is far higher than the rate Hochberg cites. Yet rolling students seeking associate degrees into the equation supports Hochberg’s assessment. About a third of Texas students lately graduate from a Texas college. His statement is True.

pomt-11135	"Since the end of the financial crisis, we have seen an average of one community bank or credit union disappear every day."	mostly true	/pennsylvania/statements/2018/may/31/keith-rothfus/rothfus-claim-about-disappearing-banks-mostly-true/	According to U.S. Rep. Keith Rothfus, community banks have been collateral damage in Dodd-Frank’s push to rein in big banks. Rothfus said America has lost an average of one community bank or credit union every day since the end of the Great Recession, when Dodd-Frank became law. Rothfus, a Republican, made the claim in a press release explaining his May 22 vote in favor of a partial rollback of Dodd-Frank, the Obama-era law containing new financial sector controls and consumer protections inspired by the banking industry’s role in the financial collapse of 2007. We stumbled upon the claim when comparing Rothfus’ voting record to that of rookie Democratic Congressman Conor Lamb, who is after Rothfus’ seat in the newly drawn 17th District, which includes Beaver and parts of Allegheny County. "Since the end of the financial crisis, we have seen an average of one community bank or credit union disappear every day," Rothfus said. The Great Recession ended in June 2009 — though the recovery continues in many places. Dodd-Frank was signed into law by President Barack Obama one year later and has remained on the books. So is Rothfus’ claim about a decimated community banking sector accurate? Here’s what we found. The rollback Rothfus made his claim after voting in favor of the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, S. 2155, which supporters said will lessen the Dodd-Frank burden on community banking institutions — defined as those with less than $10 billion in assets — and which critics argue creates wiggle room and loopholes that larger banks will exploit. The rollback was signed into law by President Donald Trump on May 24. In explaining his "yes" vote two days earlier, Rothfus said, "Today a House majority that included both Republicans and nearly three dozen Democrats voted to right-size regulations for our community and regional financial institutions. Since the end of the financial crisis, we have seen an average of one community bank or credit union disappear every day." As we stated above, the Great Recession ended in June 2009, the point at which real GDP and industrial production hit bottom and resumed growth. So we’ll start with the third fiscal quarter of 2009 in looking at the number of community banks reporting to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or FDIC. According to FDIC data, there were 7,309 community banks in the third quarter of 2009, and that number decreased every quarter since, winding up at 5,168 in the first quarter of this year. (When asked to cite the source of his claim, Rothfus’ office pointed to FDIC data.) That’s a decrease of 2,141 reporting institutions over 35 fiscal quarters or roughly 244 fewer a year. The decline in community bank numbers certainly has continued under Dodd-Frank. But it was also underway long before the Great Recession and Dodd-Frank ever took hold. "From 1985 to 2013, the number of the smallest institutions has declined dramatically (85 percent to be exact)," PolitiFact reported in 2015. "But mid-size and large community banks have remained relatively stable since 2010 (and have increased, albeit incrementally, since 1985)." The report adds: "Two-thirds of failed or voluntarily closed community banks are actually acquired by other community banks, according to the FDIC. The result: fewer, but larger community banks. Their goal: to achieve ‘economies of scale’ (cost advantages gained when spreading out expenses over more revenue), says the U.S. Government Accountability Office." A 2015 paper published by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City found the number of "failed" community banks went down under Dodd-Frank — from roughly 125 in 2010 to less than 25 in 2014 — while the number of community banks involved in voluntary mergers grew in that same period — from roughly 175 to more than 225. PolitiFact found that the consolidation craze was "a 30-year trend" with various underlying causes — they include a softening of interstate banking rules in the ’80s. And while some experts say Dodd-Frank has exacerbated the trend, the law’s exact impact remains the subject of much debate. What about credit unions? According to National Credit Union Administration data, there were 7,691 federally insured credit unions in the U.S. in June 2009. That number fell to 5,573 in the last quarter of 2017 — the most recent quarter for which data is available. That’s 2,118 fewer federally insured credit unions, or roughly 282 fewer a year. John Fairbanks with the Office of Public and Congressional Affairs at the National Credit Union Administration said the "federally insured credit union" figures above include all but roughly 125 credit unions — those are privately insured — in the United States. Fairbanks told PolitiFact Pennsylvania that it’s important to note what’s happening with these "disappearing" credit unions. "That does not mean those institutions were simply ‘lost.’ Most credit union ‘losses’ are the result of mergers, usually a smaller credit union into a larger one, and usually for a business-related purpose, such as the smaller credit union being unable to provide a greater array of services to members," Fairbanks said. "So credit union members do not ‘lose’ a credit union; it folds into another one. The numbers go down, but note that credit union membership and industry assets continue to grow." So mergers are increasingly common with both U.S. credit unions and community banks. Fairbanks added, "This, by the way, is a long-running trend in credit unions and financial services generally, going back decades. The consolidation process is nothing new." As for the bill supported by Rothfus, the National Law Review says it could actually speed up the pace of community and regional bank mergers by raising the threshold for "enhanced prudential standards" applied to big banks from $50 billion to $250 billion. "The increase in this threshold is especially important because it may spark renewed interest in [merger and acquisition] opportunities among regional banks that have carefully managed growth to avoid crossing $50 billion or that have otherwise been reluctant to pursue transactions in light of the significant regulatory scrutiny that has accompanied applications by large acquirors," the Law Review reports. Our ruling Rothfus said, "Since the end of the financial crisis, we have seen an average of one community bank or credit union disappear every day." His statement is supported by data for that timeframe from both the FDIC and National Credit Union Administration. Since the third quarter of 2009, America lost 2,141 community banks and 2,118 credit unions. That’s 4,259 financial institutions total. Over roughly eight years, that’s 486 per year or roughly 1.4 per day. However, some banks "disappeared" due to voluntary consolidation, something that has been happening for 30 years, and not always as a direct result of Dodd-Frank. Therefore, Rothfus’ claim — given its context — is Mostly True.	None	Keith Rothfus	None	None	None	2018-05-31T14:52:18	2018-05-22	['None']

pomt-05088	Lorain "is the poorest urban school district in the state of Ohio."	false	/ohio/statements/2012/jul/02/dan-ramos/dan-ramos-says-lorain-poorest-school-district-ohio/	State lawmakers generally agreed that too many Ohio school children are struggling to read during a debate in June on legislation to advance Gov. John Kasich’s education agenda. But many Democrats in the House of Representatives voted against the Republican governor’s education policies, which included a third-grade reading guarantee, when they were up for a vote on June 13. Their reasons for opposition varied. Some thought the changes amounted to an unfunded mandate on schools whose state funding already had been cut through Kasich’s budget. Rep. Dan Ramos, a Democrat from Lorain, said the bill was incomplete because it lacked early education programs such as all-day kindergarten to prepare young students, particularly children in poverty. During a floor speech June 13, Ramos made clear his district’s educational needs: "I represent, amongst others, the city of Lorain, which is the poorest urban school district in the state of Ohio." Ramos was one of several lawmakers to speak that day about the bill, Senate Bill 316, also known as the "education MBR" because it was the education component of Kasich’s mid-biennium budget review. The bill passed the House that day by a vote of 56-35, with most Democrats voting "no." Although Ramos’ claim is not about specific provisions in the bill, it caught our attention. Does Lorain really hold the unwanted title of the state’s poorest urban school district. So we called Ramos for an explanation. Ramos said he did not have any statistics or information that showed Lorain is the state’s single poorest district. He provided data from the Ohio Department of Education that shows the city is among districts with the highest percentage of poor students. "I should have said, ‘one of the’" poorest urban school districts, Ramos said. The city had the state’s sixth-highest percentage, 84.5 percent, of students in poverty in the fiscal year ending in July 2011. Students were considered to be living in poverty if they received free or reduced-priced lunches or if their guardians receive public assistance. Cleveland was first, with 100 percent of students in poverty; Dayton was second with 92.5 percent; Youngstown was third with 91.9 percent; East Cleveland was fourth with 88.5 percent and Akron was fifth with 84.7 percent. Lorain ranked fourth the previous year behind Cleveland, Dayton and Youngstown. Ramos said the fact Lorain is among the state’s poorest districts – rather than the single poorest – does not negate the overarching point of his floor speech: School children in Lorain are on hard times and need the state’s help to get a better education, however, the policies in SB 316 do not fully address those needs. Ramos may have a point. And he is correct to say students in Lorain are needy. But his explanation does not make his claim on the House floor accurate. The poorest urban school district in Ohio, in the eyes of the Ohio Department of Education, is Cleveland. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates False.

But is he the only candidate running for district attorney who has explicitly pledged to never seek it if elected? Krasner’s campaign, gearing up for the May 16 primary, wrote on the Democratic candidate’s platform page on his website that "Larry Krasner is the only candidate running for District Attorney who explicitly pledges to never seek the death penalty." But we swear we’ve heard that before, at least once. So we decided to check the claim. We reached out to every candidate for district attorney -- six other Democrats and one Republican -- to ask for clarification on their stance on the death penalty, including whether or not they support Gov. Tom Wolf’s death penalty moratorium (that could be overturned when another governor takes office). Here’s what we learned: Beth Grossman - We didn’t hear back from Grossman, the lone Republican candidate in the race, but she told Philadelphia Magazine in March that she supports the death penalty "in certain cases," but wondered if it’s "economically feasible." Michael Untermeyer - Untermeyer, an ex-Republican and a former assistant district attorney, doesn’t personally support the death penalty but wouldn’t rule it out in the most extreme circumstances, his campaign said. Joe Khan - A spokesman for Khan, a former federal prosecutor, said the Democrat would only seek the death penalty in the most extreme circumstances. During a recent forum when candidates were asked if they would ever seek the death penalty, Khan responded that he wouldn’t while a statewide moratorium is in place. Jack O’Neill - O’Neill, a former assistant district attorney and a Democrat, said while prosecuting homicides in Philadelphia, he never chose to seek the death penalty. But he said he wouldn’t rule it out in the most heinous circumstances, like if a police officer were killed. Teresa Carr-Deni - The former judge’s campaign confirmed her stance is that she would only seek the death penalty in extreme or heinous circumstances. Rich Negrin - Negrin, the former city managing director, didn’t respond to a request for comment. But during a recent forum when asked if he would ever seek the death penalty if elected, Negrin responded "no." That’s a harder stance than he took in a February interview with Philadelphia Magazine, when he said only that he supports Wolf’s moratorium, not that he would never seek the death penalty if that moratorium were to be lifted. Tariq El-Shabazz - A spokeswoman for El-Shabazz, a former deputy under District Attorney Seth Williams, said El-Shabazz "will not seek to impose the death penalty." In the same forum mentioned above when asked about whether or not he would seek the death penalty, El-Shabazz responded "no" -- twice. But similar to Negrin, that’s different from his prior characterization. In an interview with Philadelphia Magazine in March, El-Shabazz said only that he supports Wolf’s moratorium. That means that besides Krasner, two other candidates in the race -- Negrin and El-Shabazz -- have said at one point or another that they would not seek the death penalty if elected district attorney, but both failed to offer up that hard stance when asked earlier this year. (In Krasner’s February Philadelphia Magazine interview, he said he’s strictly against the death penalty and would never seek it if elected.) A spokeswoman for El-Shabazz said his stance is "not new," and the candidate himself said last month that he has opposed the death penalty for his entire career. PolitiFact Pennsylvania could not find an example from prior to April when either Negrin or El-Shabazz said publicly that they would never seek the death penalty if elected district attorney. When PolitiFact reached out to Krasner’s campaign Monday regarding the statement on their website that Krasner is "the only candidate running for District Attorney who explicitly pledges to never seek the death penalty," a spokesman responded that that language has since been updated. The website now reads: "Larry Krasner is the only candidate running for District Attorney who explicitly pledges to never seek the death penalty and has done so throughout the campaign." "Some of the other candidates have changed their positions so quickly that it's hard to keep up," spokesman Rich Garella said in an email, noting: "We have now adjusted the language on our website to reflect the fact that two of them have recently adopted the position that [Krasner] has had for more than 30 years." Garella wasn’t able to identify when the claim in question was posted on Krasner’s campaign website. Krasner, a well-known civil rights and criminal defense attorney, has long been an outspoken critic of the death penalty. Our ruling Krasner’s campaign for district attorney wrote that he "is the only candidate running for District Attorney who explicitly pledges to never seek the death penalty." At this point in the race, two other candidates have made a similar pledge. But it doesn’t appear either of those candidates were as explicit about that view throughout the campaign, unlike Krasner, who has long railed against the death penalty. When PolitiFact pointed out the discrepancy to Krasner’s campaign, the website was almost immediately updated. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-09087	Sharron Angle supported "a Scientology plan to give massages to prisoners."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/24/harry-reid/reid-ad-claims-angle-supported-scientology-plan-gi/	Shortly after Sharron Angle won the Nevada Republican primary, Democratic opponent Harry Reid quickly picked up on some of the attacks levelled against Angle by her Republican primary opponent. According to a Reid ad, Angle supported "a Scientology plan to give massages to prisoners." As a Nevada Assemblywoman in 2003, Angle pushed for Nevada to try a controversial drug and criminal rehabilitation program based on the teachings of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. Angle mulled legislation to bring a demonstration of the program -- called Second Chance -- to women's prisons in Nevada. And she was among a group of several Nevada legislators who made plans to travel to Mexico to see the program in action. According to a Feb. 18, 2003, story in the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the trip would have been paid by a private Arizona businessman with ties to the Church of Scientology. According to the Review Journal story, Angle defended the program, saying that while parts of the program were developed by Hubbard, his religion had nothing to do with the program. "I don't have any inclination toward Scientology,'' Angle said. "But when something works, you have to take a look at it." Angle parroted claims from the program leaders that only 10 percent of the inmates who enter the program return to drugs. But those claims are highly disputed. Nevada Assembly Majority Leader Barbara Buckley, a Democrat, said then that the program was costly and that legislators were told Mexican officials did not check on program participants after they left prison. Angle abandoned her efforts -- and canceled her planned trip to Mexico -- after she said it became clear that Democratic opposition to the program made it a non-starter. Angle's efforts on behalf of the Second Chance program first became political fodder for her Republican primary opponent Sue Lowden, who aired an ad in which the narrator says "Retreat, relax, renew. Unwind and enjoy the soothing sauna and massage treatments in Nevada prisons." Images of male prisoners getting back rubs flashed in the background. The Reid ad picks up on the same theme, showing a male prisoner getting a massage, but does more of a quick hit with, "That's Sharron Angle. First, a Scientology plan to give massages to prisoners. Now she wants to get rid of Medicare and Social Security. What's next?" We addressed the claim that Angle "wants to wipe out Social Security" in a separate item. Here we're looking at the claim that Angle supported "a Scientology plan to give massages to prisoners." We'll take this in two parts. First, is it accurate to call Second Chance a "Scientology plan"? Church of Scientology officials have long contended that Criminon and Narconon, the parent programs of Second Chance, are secular programs unaffiliated with the Church of Scientology. According to Narconon officials, Narconon was not founded by Hubbard, but by William Benitez, who while an inmate in an Arizona prison read books by Hubbard and applied his principles in developing a drug treatment program. However, many of the techniques and courses used in the program are similar to those practiced by Scientologists, which is why many Scientology observers say that at best, the line between Scientology and programs like Criminon and Narconon are blurred. As for the claim that Second Chance was a "plan to give massages to prisoners," we think that's a gross oversimplification of the program. The ad suggests the sum of the program is akin to some sort of spa experience. The program does incorporate the use of saunas as part of a purported detoxification program that mirrors a Scientology ritual called the purification rundown. The use of saunas is based on Hubbard's belief that it is possible to sweat out toxic substances and drug residues, which can cause cravings for more drugs. The program also incorporates the use of "nerve assists." According to an online Scientology handbook, nerve assists are used to straighten joints and the spine. According to the handbook, "The Nerve Assist consists of gently releasing the standing waves in the nerve channels of the body, improving communication with the body and bringing the being relief." What follows is a detailed set of instructions on how to administer a nerve assist. In a candidate debate on Face to Face with Jon Ralston on May 18, 2010, Angle said "it wasn't actually massages, it was really more of a karate chop. And the sauna I would say was a sweat box, in there with 30 sweaty guys is not exactly a sauna." By our reckoning, though, the method described in the Scientology handbook resembles a back massage, at least enough so that calling it that is not out of order. But there's more to the Second Chance Program than saunas and nerve assists. It also includes a series of life improvement courses, such as ones aimed at improving communication skills. News reports in the Wall Street Journal, Santa Fe Journal and the Los Angeles Times detail the workings of the program. It was used in New Mexico prisons for two years. We contacted William Miller, an addiction expert and a retired professor of psychiatry at the University of New Mexico, who reviewed Second Chance at the request of the city of Albuquerque and recommended against the city adopting and funding Second Chance. Via e-mail, Miller told us it is a "Scientology-based program that has no scientific credibility." And it no longer is operating in New Mexico prisons, he noted. "They consumed quite a bit of money for several years, performed poorly, and went out of business when governmental funding dried up for them," Miller said. We also called Angle's campaign for comment about the program and Angle's involvement. Campaign staffer Lee Adams said "it was something she looked at and ultimately said no." As we noted earlier, it wasn't so much that Angle decided the program didn't have merit. Rather, she made a political calculation that it didn't have enough support to pass, and so she declined to offer legislation that was DOA. For the record, Adams said, despite some rumors circulating around, Angle is not a Scientologist. "She's a Southern Baptist," he said. As for the claim in the Reid ad, we think it's accurate to point out Angle's one-time support for a controversial drug and crime rehabilitation program based on the teachings of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard. But we think it's misleading to sum it up as back rubs for prisoners. There's a lot more to it than that. Some may find the idea of taxpayer support for the program equally as troubling, but this was more about supporting a controversial drug treatment program than one aimed at coddling criminals with massages. And so we rate the ad's claim Half True.	None	Harry Reid	None	None	None	2010-06-24T17:37:25	2010-06-12	['None']
pomt-01331	Says Scott Walker is "forcing some women to undergo a transvaginal probe to get an abortion."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/oct/24/emilys-list/scott-walker-forces-some-women-get-transvaginal-ul/	In backing Mary Burke in the Nov. 4, 2014 election for governor, at least three abortion rights organizations have produced ads highlighting Gov. Scott Walker’s opposition to abortion. But one TV ad from EMILY’s List, a Washington, D.C.-based group, might be the most blunt. Halfway into the 30-second spot, released Oct. 21, 2014, the narrator says Walker "is forcing some women to undergo a transvaginal probe to get an abortion." As the words are spoken, a headline appears on the screen that reads: "Scott Walker endorses mandating transvaginal ultrasounds." It is made to look like a newspaper headline, but it comes from an article on the left-leaning Think Progress blog. A medical device is also shown. A series of readers asked us to check the claim. "Transvaginal" is the attention-grabbing word in the claim. But as we’ll see, the reference to "some women" is important, too. Abortion and ultrasounds The ad alludes to a July 2013 Wisconsin law that requires women seeking an abortion to get an ultrasound -- either transabdominally, which is done externally, or transvaginally. Wisconsin is among two dozen states that require an ultrasound before an abortion is performed. In Wisconsin, exceptions are made in cases of sexual assault or medical emergency. The governor’s office praised the measure, saying it "improves a woman's ability to make an informed choice that will protect her physical and mental health now and in the future." The law was opposed by the Wisconsin Medical Society, among others. The society said the measure as a "direct infringement on the patient-physician relationship" and for injecting "non-evolving government mandates into medical science." (Another part of the law, which would require doctors who perform abortions to have hospital admitting privileges, has been blocked in an ongoing court battle.) As we turn to the EMILY’s List claim, one note: The use of ultrasounds among abortion providers is not new, even though the Wisconsin law requiring them is. A couple of weeks after Walker signed the measure, the clinic director and another worker at Affiliated Medical Services, a Milwaukee abortion provider, noted in an opinion piece in the Huffington Post that their clinic has "always" required ultrasounds. "If you go to an abortion clinic that doesn't insist on an ultrasound, you should walk out the door. It's just bad medicine," they wrote. The Milwaukee clinic workers also pointed out, however, that the Wisconsin law does not require a transvaginal ultrasound and that they would have opposed that requirement. They said their clinic only does transvaginal ultrasounds when it is deemed medically necessary -- in cases of early pregnancy, morbid obesity, or "anatomical variants" in the uterus. Tracy Weitz, associate professor and director of the Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health at the University of California, San Francisco, said that nationally, transvaginal ultrasounds are routine among abortion providers in the early stages of pregnancy. They can verify a pregnancy as early as four weeks, meaning women don’t have to wait through weeks of pregnancy symptoms and distress before choosing to have an abortion, she wrote. Evidence for the claim As we’ve indicated, the law Walker signed does not mandate a transvaginal ultrasound -- though the headline used in the ad says Walker endorsed mandating that procedure. Rather, the law requires "an ultrasound on the pregnant woman using whichever transducer the woman chooses" -- either transvaginal or transabdominal -- according to an analysis by the nonpartisan Legislative Council. But there is more to consider. Under the law, the person doing the ultrasound must tell the pregnant woman during the procedure "what the ultrasound is depicting," including the "dimensions of the unborn child and a description of any external features and internal organs that are present and viewable on the image." The person must also display the ultrasound images so that the pregnant woman may view them, but the woman can’t be forced to view them. Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin told us that only a transvaginal ultrasound would enable a clinician to meet the requirements of the law for early-stage pregnancies, up to 12 weeks. And according to an August 2014 report from the state Department of Health Services, 84 percent of abortions in Wisconsin are performed at 12 weeks or less. EMILY’s List, meanwhile, noted that the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists says transvaginal ultrasound often is used in early pregnancy, whereas transabdominal ultrasound often is used after about 10 weeks of pregnancy. And the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that studies reproductive rights, says "routine ultrasound is not considered medically necessary as a component of first-trimester abortion." Barbara Lyons, the former executive director of Wisconsin Right to Life, which opposes abortion, told us that even if a medical situation indicates that a woman seeking an abortion should get a transvaginal ultrasound, the woman still has the final say and the Wisconsin law doesn’t mandate one over the other. "In the end, she gets to make the decision," Lyons said. "There is no mandate." To sum up: The law doesn’t mandate a transvaginal ultrasound. But for some women, the fact that an ultrasound is required means they would have to get the transvaginal procedure, rather than a transabdominal one, in order to get an abortion. Our rating In a TV ad, EMILY’s List said Walker is "forcing some women to undergo a transvaginal probe to get an abortion," while an image on the screen said Walker "endorses mandating transvaginal ultrasounds." The law doesn’t mandate transvaginal ultrasounds, rather it says the woman seeking an abortion can choose either a transvaginal or transabdominal ultrasound. But medical professionals say that the new requirement, as a practical matter, means some women have to get a transvaginal ultrasound. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important information, our rating is Half True. You can comment on this item on the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel website.

pomt-02022	"Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen has long record of voting against VA backlog fixes."	false	/florida/statements/2014/jun/06/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/ileana-ros-lehtinen-voted-against-va-backlog-fixes/	As President Barack Obama faced attacks over long waits for appointments at Veterans Administration health centers, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- the House Democrats’ campaign arm -- engaged in some finger-pointing. The DCCC sent out press releases claiming that Republican House members Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Miami, Sean Duffy of Wisconsin and Erik Paulsen of Minnesota voted against fixing the VA backlog. Here is part of the June 2, 2014, press release about Ros-Lehtinen headlined "Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen has long record of voting against VA backlog fixes." "As House Republicans shamelessly try to score political points over the crisis in veterans care, Congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen’s votes tell the true story of her record: when she had a chance to fix this problem, she voted against the fixes." The release went on to quote DCCC spokesman Josh Schwerin saying, "It’s a shame that when Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen had a chance to do something to help shorten the wait time at the VA she voted no. Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen voted against a commonsense solution to this problem and our heroes deserve better." We put those votes under a microscope to see whether Ros-Lehtinen has a "long record of voting against VA backlog fixes." VA backlog We should start by distinguishing between two related, but separate, issues relating to veterans. One concerns longstanding problems with handling benefits claims from veterans, including disability compensation, pensions, and compensation for surviving spouses or children of veterans who die as a result of their service. The other concerns long waits for service at VA hospitals. On the first issue -- benefits -- the backlog refers to requests that go unaddressed by the government for at least 125 days. PolitiFact found that the backlog nearly doubled from roughly 36 percent in the summer 2010 to 65 percent in June 2012. In April 2014, the Obama administration released numbers suggesting the backlog was shrinking, but veterans groups said they had serious doubts about the numbers. The second issue -- the wait for health care -- stemmed from news reports that revealed secret waiting lists at VA hospitals, and that some veterans died while awaiting care. This is what ultimately led to the resignation of VA Secretary Eric Shinseki on May 30. The DCCC essentially conflates the two issues in the quest to highlight any vote that portrays Ros-Lehtinen as voting against veterans’ interests. We’ll also offer a general word of warning about how political groups tend to cherry-pick the records of their opponent. It’s possible to dig up a vote made by virtually any member of Congress of either party and claim that the politician is for -- or against -- anything, including veterans benefits. So, just as the Democrats were able to find some votes in which Ros-Lehtinen voted against a service for veterans, spokespersons for Ros-Lehtinen and the National Congressional Campaign Committee were able to point to separate votes in which she voted for veterans’ services. Many of the votes that the DCCC cited were procedural moves or one particular vote out of a series of votes. In most of the instances, the votes broke down overwhelmingly on party lines, with Ros-Lehtinen joining her Republican colleagues. That said, let’s start with the votes that are directly about the backlog: The votes • Veterans Backlog Reduction Act: A bill sponsored by U.S. Rep. William Enyart, D-Ill., ordered the VA to provisionally pay any disability claim if the VA didn’t respond within 125 days. Enyart introduced the bill in April 2013 and it was referred to the House committee on Veterans Affairs. It never received a vote. The DCCC said Ros-Lehtinen voted against considering that bill by pointing to a vote on the "previous question" -- a parliamentary move to force a vote. During a debate about a higher education bill, Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y. stated "if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an amendment to the rule that will allow the House to vote on the Veterans Backlog Reduction Act." Enyart then explained his veterans’ bill and urged a "no" vote. His fellow Democrats complied and all voted "no" while the Republicans voted "yes," which defeated his effort. Something the DCCC omitted is that in October 2013, Ros-Lehtinen had voted to establish a commission or task force to evaluate the backlog of disability claims of the Department of Veterans Affairs. That measure passed, 404-1. • Increasing funds to reduce the backlog in disability claims: The DCCC said Ros-Lehtinen voted no, along with nearly every Republican, on a motion that would have added $9.2 million to hire an additional 94 VA claims processors tasked with reducing the disability claims backlog. The June 2013 motion was a "motion to recommit" on an appropriations bill to fund military construction and veterans affairs. A "motion to recommit" in the House refers to a last-ditch attempt by the minority party to amend a bill before it passes. Left unsaid: The overall bill, which did pass, provided money to address the backlog, just not as much as Democrats proposed. • Mental health funds: On June 2, 2011, Congress agreed in a voice vote to set aside $20 million for suicide prevention for veterans. On June 14, 2011, Ros-Lehtinen voted against a Democratic motion to recommit that would add $20 million for veterans’ suicide prevention. The GOP argued that such services were already funded, and the motion failed. Ros-Lehtinen, along with nearly every member of Congress, voted for the overall bill, which increased money for the military. The bill included an additional $20 million for suicide prevention outreach, according to Congressional Quarterly. • Medical and prosthetic research: In May 2012, Ros-Lehtinen joined all but three Republicans in voting against a motion to recommit that would have increased funding for veterans’ medical and prosthetic research by $28.3 million. Here too, Ros-Lehtinen joined the overwhelming majority in passing the overall bill. The bill provided a $1.7 million increase for medical, rehabilitative, health services and prosthetic research -- an amount equal to the Obama administration’s request, according to CQ. The DCCC also cited votes Ros-Lehtinen took leading up to the October 2013 federal shutdown. In August, she voted for a House Republican "continuing resolution" -- a stopgap funding bill -- that the Associated Press reported would "likely result" in the shutdown of the federal government. The bill passed 230-189. The shutdown led to a delay in death benefits for veterans among other delayed services, the Washington Post reported. DCCC also cited a pair of votes Ros-Lehtinen took in September, including one on a motion to commit to H.J. Res. 59, to make continuing appropriations that would have ensured veterans benefits wouldn’t be delayed during a shutdown. All but one Republican voted "no." However, left out of the DCCC’s account is that Ros-Lehtinen voted for in favor of H.J. Res. 72, the "Veterans Benefits Continuing Appropriations Resolution" -- a mini-funding resolution favored by House Republicans to reopen slices of the government. The measure passed the House with unanimous Republican support and overwhelming Democratic opposition. (Showing how both sides play this game, the RNC plucked out that vote to attack DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a claim we rated False.) Democrats also cited multiple other votes including a few that related to housing for veterans but Republicans could point to other votes on bills that did provide housing assistance. Veterans’ groups’ report cards Meanwhile, we found two veterans’ organizations that issue voting "report cards" for members of Congress: • American Veterans (Amvets) gave Ros-Lehtinen an A in 2013, based on eight pieces of legislation. (Ros-Lehtinen didn’t participate in a vote for one.) • Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA) Action Fund gave Ros-Lehtinen a C in 2010. The report card looked at 14 votes, plus whether lawmakers cosponsored certain bills. The group gave her an A in 2008. (Overall, the group gave Congress lower marks in 2010 than 2008.) Contacted by PoilitiFact, DCCC spokeswoman Emily Bittner said, "These Republicans’ votes speak for themselves. Taken in their totality, they show an unfortunate pattern of refusing to cross party lines and vote for commonsense fixes to the problems at the VA." However, we don't think the votes chosen show the "totality" of Ros-Lehtinen's record. Our ruling The DCCC said "Congresswoman Ros-Lehtinen has long record of voting against VA backlog fixes." The DCCC points to some votes that went against funding certain veterans’ services or addressing the backlog. However, the DCCC ignores that Ros-Lehtinen took other votes in favor of increasing funding for veterans’ services -- just not as much as Democratic proposals would have offered. The bigger issue is that most of these votes came within elaborate games of tit-for-tat, in which each side offers proposals that they expect will fail, just to get lawmakers on the other side to take votes that look superficially bad. The reality of Ros-Lehtinen’s voting record is much more nuanced than the DCCC’s cherry-picked account would suggest. This, combined with the "A" ratings she's earned from veterans' advocacy groups, undercut the DCCC's claim that she has a "long" voting record of voting against the interests of veterans. We rate the claim False.	None	Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee	None	None	None	2014-06-06T10:37:33	2014-06-02	['None']

pomt-02433	"Crimea became part of Ukraine only in 1954. Crimea was historically part of Russia, and (Nikita) Khrushchev gave it to Ukraine in a gesture that mystified some people."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/02/david-ignatius/historical-claim-shows-why-crimea-matters-russia/	President Barack Obama has been vocal in his opposition to Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin’s military intervention in Ukraine. Focus has shifted from the new government in Kiev, Ukraine’s capital, to Crimea, a region Russian troops seized control of Saturday. Meanwhile, politicians and pundits are divided over what the United States’ role should be in the conflict. Washington Post columnist David Ignatius criticized Putin’s actions on Face the Nation, saying Ukraine "is not prepared to go backwards" to a Russian regime. He then offered up some context about Crimea’s history. "Crimea became part of Ukraine only in 1954," he said. "Crimea was historically part of Russia, and (Nikita) Khrushchev gave it to Ukraine in a gesture that mystified some people." Ignatius was correct in saying that Ukraine has only controlled the Crimean Peninsula since 1954 -- a claim we also heard from U.S. Rep. Mike Roger, R-Mich., on Fox News Sunday. Not up on your Soviet history? We’ll review the facts. Crimea is an eastern Ukrainian peninsula located on the Black Sea. It’s connected to the rest of the country by a small strip of land. Out of its 2 million residents, about 60 percent identify as Russian. That’s the highest concentration of Russian speakers in Ukraine. Although the territory belongs to Ukraine, Russia stations part of its Black Sea fleet in Sevastopol as part of a pre-existing agreement between the two countries. As Ignatius pointed out, Crimea hasn’t always been part of Ukraine. Here’s a quick rundown of what’s happened in the region since the Ottoman Empire used the peninsula as a hub for slave trade. 1783: Russia annexed Crimea. 1853: The Crimean War began, lasting three years. Russia lost to an alliance of the Ottoman Empire, France, Britain and Sardinia. Crimea remained part of Russia. 1917: Crimea briefly became a sovereign state before becoming a base for the White Army of anti-Bolshevik forces in the Russian War. 1921: The peninsula, now called the Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, became part of the Soviet Union. 1942: Nazi Germany took control of Crimea. 1944: Joesph Stalin forcibly deported all Muslim Tatars, a group of 300,000 who had lived on the peninsula for centuries, due to members’ alleged cooperation with Germany during World War II. Many returned to Crimea in the 1980s and 1990s. 1945: After World War II, the autonomous Soviet republic was dissolved and Crimea became a province of the Soviet Union called the Crimean Oblast. 1954: Russian Premier Nikita Khrushchev transferred the Crimean Oblast to Ukraine. It’s often reported that it was a gesture of goodwill from Khrushchev, who had Ukrainian roots. 1991: The Soviet Union collapsed. Many expected President Boris Yeltsin, the new president of the Russian Federation, to take Crimea for Russia. But he didn’t bring it up during negotiations with Ukraine. 1997: Ukraine and Russia signed a treaty that allowed Russia to keep its fleet in Sevastopol. The agreement’s since been extended, so the fleet is set to remain there until at least 2042. As for Ignatius’ claim that Khrushchev’s decision to give Crimea to Ukraine in 1954, we found literature to support that. Slate’s Joshua Keating offered up possible reasons for the land transfer, including the 300th anniversary of Ukraine’s merger with tsarist Russia and Khrushchev’s ties to Ukraine. Though Khrushchev’s gesture had unclear motives, it didn’t seem like a problem for Russia at the time, only garnering a one-sentence write-up in the official Soviet newspaper. It became a bigger issue in the region once the Soviet Union collapsed decades later. So the story of the Crimean Peninsula is long and complicated, to say the least. And there could be more news to come as war threatens Eastern Europe. Today, Crimea’s residents are divided on the issue of Russia’s military intervention. Generally speaking, ethnic Russians support Russia’s involvement in the region, while Tatars and Ukrainians express pro-Ukrainian sentiments. Our ruling Ignatius said Crimea belonged to Russia until 1954, when Khrushchev gave the land to Ukraine, then a Soviet republic. Ignatius’ history lesson explains why Russians remain so intertwined with Crimea and why some Americans are worried that Russians will try to annex the peninsula. We rate Ignatius’ statement True. Correction: About 60 percent of people living in Crimea identify themselves as Russian. An earlier version of this story described the statistic differently.

pomt-04319	"New Jersey is the only state in the union that spent less on higher education than it did at the beginning of the decade."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/28/tom-kean-jr/tom-kean-claims-new-jersey-was-only-state-nation-r/	Republican state Sen. Tom Kean Jr. provided a stark but erroneous statistic comparing New Jersey’s investment in higher education to the rest of the nation. While touring William Paterson University to rally support for a bond referendum on the Nov. 6 ballot, Kean said in the last decade New Jersey was the only state in the country that took money away from higher education. If voters approve the referendum, New Jersey may borrow $750 million to fund construction projects at all of the state’s colleges and universities. "New Jersey is the only state in the union that spent less on higher education than it did at the beginning of the decade," Kean, the Senate minority leader, said to reporters on Oct. 17. "That's unfathomable that over the course of the last decade the state aid to higher education went down." Here, we’ll address Kean’s point that only New Jersey decreased aid over the last decade. On that point, Kean is wrong. The legislator’s spokesman, Adam Bauer, said Kean meant to refer to state appropriations for higher education in the two-year window between fiscal years 2006 and 2008. Over those years, New Jersey was the only state to decrease its aid for higher education, according to a Rutgers University analysis of data from the Grapevine report produced by Center for the Study of Education Policy at Illinois State University. New Jersey’s state tax funds for operating expenses of higher education fell by 0.3 percent in that time frame. As of fiscal year 2010, the Grapevine report has been produced in cooperation with the State Higher Education Executive Officers. According to the State Higher Education Executive Officers data on state and local support available for public higher education operating expenses, New Jersey’s appropriations have increased during the last decade. By that measure, New Jersey’s appropriations increased by 37 percent from 2000 to 2010. Other measures of state support for higher education also show increases of more than 30 percent over the last decade. But what about inflation? Depending on what index you use to adjust for inflation -- the State Higher Education Executive Officers uses an index specifically intended to take into account the increases in costs for colleges and universities -- the amount of the percentage increase in educational appropriations varies, but it is still an increase. The amount of per-student spending is another worthwhile way to compare higher education spending between states, according to experts. The State Higher Education Executive Officers calculates the educational appropriations for each equivalent of a full-time student in constant dollars. New Jersey spent $11,194 by that measure in 2000. By 2010, that amount had dropped to $7,300. But even by that measure, New Jersey’s far from alone. More than 40 states decreased educational appropriations per student over the decade. Our ruling "New Jersey is the only state in the union that spent less on higher education than it did at the beginning of the decade," said Kean. That’s not true. Kean’s spokesman said he intended to refer to the two-year period between fiscal years 2006 and 2008, but over the last decade, the raw numbers show appropriations for higher education in New Jersey have increased. Spending levels per student have decreased over the last decade. But data shows New Jersey is one of dozens of states to cut funding by that measure. We rate this statement False.

pomt-14404	"We understand that this heroin is primarily coming from Mexico, over the border."	true	/ohio/statements/2016/mar/14/rob-portman/most-heroin-us-comes-over-mexican-border/	Ohio Sen. Rob Portman has been busy in Washington touting the Comprehensive Addiction Recovery Act in response to a shocking number of heroin overdoses in Ohio. The bill just passed in the Senate, 94-1. (Nebraska Sen. Ben Sasse was the sole "nay," saying he believes that fighting addiction is a local issue.) Ohio ranks high on the list of states reeling from the national epidemic. In Montgomery County, which encompasses Dayton, Ohio, heroin-related deaths increased 225 percent between 2011 and 2015. Back in the 1970s, the heroin on U.S. streets was the "black tar" variety, and much of it came from southeast Asia. In 2010, 80 percent of the heroin in the world came from poppy fields in Afghanistan, according to the Office of National Drug Control Policy. So when Portman said that most of the heroin in America comes from Mexico’s border, we were skeptical. Portman, it turns out, has done his homework. The Drug Enforcement Administration’s National Drug Threat Assessment of 2015 says that Mexico is the primary supplier of heroin to the United States. "Southeast Asia was once the dominant supplier of heroin in the United States, but Southeast Asian heroin is now rarely detected in U.S. markets," the report state. "Mexico and, to a lesser extent, Colombia dominate the U.S. heroin market, because of their proximity, established transportation and distribution infrastructure, and ability to satisfy U.S. heroin demand." The report also says that Mexican "transnational criminal organizations," (the DEA’s term for drug-dealing gangs) "pose the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States; no other group is currently positioned to challenge them." The National Drug Threat report notes that Colombian gangs were traditionally the suppliers of wholesale cocaine and heroin to Mexican and Dominican groups. But cartels in Mexico are ramping up their roles on the supply side -- opium production in Mexico increased by 50 percent in 2014. Mexican labs also produce fentanyl, a synthetic painkiller that is 80 to 100 times stronger than morphine. Fentanyl is sometimes mixed with heroin or substituted for heroin, and the DEA reports more than 700 overdoses attributed to fentanyl between late 2013 and early 2015. Drugs get past the U.S. borders mostly "by land, not by sea," said Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson, in the same March 8 hearing with Portman. And a 2015 Washington Post series on the surge of heroin puts the border detection rate at a scant 1.5 percent. Smugglers’ creativity defies gravity: One successful bust came when agents caught two men flying a drone carrying 28 pounds of heroin from Mexico to California. Our ruling Portman said that heroin is coming to the United States primarily from Mexico. He hasn’t been studying drug facts for nothing. We rate this claim True.

pomt-08868	"In 2009, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council ranked Ohio 11th in the nation and 1st in the Midwest for overall business climate."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/04/ted-strickland/ted-strickland-boasts-ohios-small-business-climate/	In the race for governor, the story of the state’s attractiveness to business is a tale of two Ohios. In Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland’s version, the state’s tax laws, location and workforce make it appealing, especially to small businesses. In Kasich’s narrative, Ohio’s tax system and regulations are driving away all businesses. Each cites different studies to help make his case. "In 2009, the Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council ranked Ohio 11th in the nation and 1st in the Midwest for overall business climate," the governor said in a July 17 news release. We decided to take a closer look. Strickland, who made the statement in response to a Kasich ad that blamed the governor for Ohio’s jobs losses, was referring to a December 2009 study entitled "Small Business Survival Index 2009: Ranking the Policy Environment for Entrepreneurship Across the Nation." The study was produced by the Small Business and Entrepreneurship Council, or SBE, a trade group that represents small businesses and advocates for less government regulation. The 2009 study -- the SBE’s 14th survival index -- is a more objective look than say, surveys of CEOs or other business professionals, which do not rely on hard numbers. The SBE rankings evaluate states in 36 categories, including corporate and income taxes, gas and diesel taxes, government spending, health care and energy costs, inheritance taxes, and workers compensation costs. Business and tax experts agree that these are among key factors business owners and entrepreneurs examine when considering where to locate. Ohio does rank 11th overall in the 2009 SBE index. But whether Ohio is No. 1 in the Midwest depends on how you define the Midwest. Strickland relies on the Ohio Business Development Coalition, which supports the state’s economic development efforts. In a news release, it defines the Midwest as Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota. The U.S. Census Bureau defines the Midwest differently. It doesn’t include Kentucky, which lands in the South, but it adds Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, and South Dakota. Ohio still beats them all -- except South Dakota. While Ohio is more likely to compete with nearby states, the Mount Rushmore State’s ranking tops SBE’s entire survey. One reason: South Dakota is among a handful of states without a personal income tax. Small business operators find that attractive because, as the SBE and other groups often point out, about 90 percent of them file taxes as individuals -- sole proprietorships, partnerships and S-Corps -- and don’t pay corporate income taxes. Strickland’s critics like to cite the personal income tax rate, which is high compared to about half of the other states. The conservative Tax Foundation, which Kasich frequently points to, and others say Ohio’s personal income tax, coupled with local taxes, makes the overall tax burden unattractive to business. The Federation of Tax Administrators’ tally of total state and local tax burden ranks 29 states better than Ohio. But the Federation of Tax Administrators warns that state and local tax burden calculations don’t tell the whole story of any business climate. In Ohio, for example, tax reforms begun in 2005 replaced the corporate franchise tax with an activity tax, a move that has made Ohio more attractive to businesses. "What would make that a bad tax would be an increase in its rate," says Thomas Zaino, a tax attorney and Gov. Bob Taft’s state tax commissioner who helped lead the tax reform. "Where Ohio’s tax system is out of kilter with other states is with personal income tax, which includes both state and local and school income tax. We are way out of line." This brings us back the 2009 SBE survey. It looked at Ohio’s top personal income tax rate at the time of 5.925 percent. And it considers both personal and corporate taxes and other categories that reflect the state’s larger narrative about business climate. So while Strickland may overstate Ohio’s Midwest ranking, his claim about the SBE’s rankings is on point and the SBE’s methodology reflects the larger context of the tax debate. We rate Strickland’s claim Mostly True. Comment on this item.	None	Ted Strickland	None	None	None	2010-08-04T12:00:00	2010-07-17	['Midwestern_United_States', 'Ohio']

pomt-01742	"Mitt Romney did not run his campaign on the basis of arguing his experience in the business world was a reason to vote for him."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2014/aug/04/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-mitt-romney-didnt-run-his-busine/	Republican Gov. Scott Walker drew criticism in conservative circles when his campaign TV ads portrayed Democratic rival Mary Burke as an outsourcing profiteer at Trek Bicycle Corp. Walker was asked if the strategy was hypocritical, given that he criticized President Barack Obama’s relentless attacks on 2012 GOP presidential rival Mitt Romney as a greedy outsourcer in his private equity days at Bain Capital. "Fundamentally different," Walker was quoted as saying in the July 24, 2014 Wisconsin State Journal. Walker argued that, "Mitt Romney did not run his campaign on the basis of arguing his experience in the business world was a reason to vote for him. If he had, then I think it would be fair game to say then you need to look at all of his experience." Let’s hit the rewind button. Is Walker right that Romney "did not run his campaign on the basis of arguing his experience in the business world was a reason to vote for him"? Presidential politics, circa 2012 To back up the claim, Alleigh Marré, a Walker campaign spokeswoman, sent us 11 video examples of Romney criticizing Obama and his record, as well as touting his own plans. "The contrast Governor Walker was making between Burke and Romney in the statement you provided is that Romney was running a more robust and dynamic campaign that did not focus solely, or even primarily, on his business experience like Burke’s does," Marré wrote in an email. But Walker did not couch his remark that way; he said Romney didn’t offer his business experience even as "a" reason to support him. That’s a rewrite of history. Romney may have downplayed his tenure as Massachusetts governor. But from start to finish in the campaign, he hammered home his private-sector time, as did campaign surrogates including key Republican officials. A few examples: April 2011: Just 45 seconds into his announcement video, Romney ran through his 25-years-long private-sector resumé and emphasized how it could help him solve America’s economic woes: "I learned how America competes with companies in other countries, why jobs leave and how jobs are created at home." September 2011: "I spent my life in the private sector, not in government," Romney said in Orlando during a GOP primary debate. "I only spent four years as a governor. I didn’t inhale. I’m a business guy." August 23, 2012: Responding to Obama attacks, Romney defended and embraced the lessons of his private-sector years, writing in the Wall Street Journal: "The lessons I learned over my 15 years at Bain Capital were valuable in helping me turn around the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City. They also helped me as governor of Massachusetts to turn a budget deficit into a surplus and reduce our unemployment rate to 4.7%. The lessons from that time would help me as president to fix our economy, create jobs and get things done in Washington." August 30, 2012: At the Republican convention, Romney repeatedly used his acceptance speech to talk about the fundamental divide between he and Obama. "He took office without the basic qualification that most Americans have and one that was essential to his task. He had almost no experience working in a business," Romney said. "Jobs to him are about government. I learned the real lessons about how America works from experience." October 2012: In the second presidential debate, Romney cited his real-world work experience to bolster his credibility on tackling complex problems: "I want to make small businesses grow and thrive. I know how to make that happen. I spent my life in the private sector. I know why jobs come and why they go." And that list is just after a cursory review. Finally, we offer one more quote from the 2012 campaign trail: "We know that Mitt Romney had an incredible career in the private sector, turning businesses around that otherwise would have failed, and thousands of people owe their jobs to that today." That was from an introduction of Romney at a Nov. 2, 2012 campaign rally in West Allis. The speaker: Scott Walker. Our rating Walker said that "Mitt Romney did not run his campaign on the basis of arguing his experience in the business world was a reason to vote for him." To the contrary, Romney made frequent and high-profile use of his extensive private-sector credentials, making them the core of his deep and sustained criticism of Obama’s record on handling the economy. Nobody would know that better than Walker, who helped remind voters of nominee’s business-world record. The claim is inaccurate and ridiculous. Pants on Fire.

pomt-12191	"We've achieved a historic increase in defense spending to get our troops the support they so richly deserve."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jul/27/donald-trump/its-false-trump-achieved-historic-increase-defense/	President Donald Trump ticked off his presidential accomplishments in front of a warm crowd in Youngstown, Ohio, saying he was already keeping his promises to strengthen the military with record defense expenditures. "We've achieved a historic increase in defense spending to get our troops the support they so richly deserve," Trump said at a July 25, 2017, rally organized by his campaign. This isn’t the first time he’s trumpeted big spending for the military. In an address to Congress in March, Trump said his budget "calls for one of the largest increases in national defense spending in American history," which we rated Mostly False. His brag in Youngstown is more overblown, and more inaccurate. The White House did not provide information for this fact-check. The increase in defense spending is not historic. Trump’s proposed base spending cap for 2017-18 defense spending is $603 billion, a 9.4 percent increase. There have been 10 years since 1977 when the base level has gone up by more than that, and in some years, the increase more than doubled Trump’s. In 1981, President Ronald Reagan hiked the spending cap by 24.9 percent and by 20.4 percent the following year. More recently, President George W. Bush bumped spending by 10 percent in 2009. The Center for Strategic and International Studies mapped these changes below. Base defense budget doesn’t include war-related funding, though. If we were to include that funding, the statistics are less in Trump's favor. Trump’s proposed budget represents a 5.4 percent increase in the total defense budget, but we’ve also had greater increases in the past. President Jimmy Carter increased military spending by 25 percent in 1981 and President Ronald Reagan’s added another 20 percent the next year. President George W. Bush raised the defense budget by 27 percent in 2003, 13 percent in 2007 and nearly 12 percent in 2008. This time, Trump wasn’t just saying he proposed one of the largest increases; he said he had already "achieved" it. The spending has not yet been approved. To turn his proposal into a reality, Trump will need Congress to appropriate the necessary funding for fiscal year 2018 as well as change the budget caps currently in effect. "Trump’s defense budget is $54 billion above the budget cap already set in law," said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "And to change the budget cap he needs 60 votes in the Senate, so in some ways it’s actually more difficult to change the budget cap than to pass a health care bill." In Trump’s defense, Harrison said that his proposed defense budget is among the highest in history (though still not the highest) because the proposed increase comes on top of a defense budget that is already high by historical standards. But Trump was talking specifically about an increase. Our ruling Trump said, "We've achieved a historic increase in defense spending to get our troops the support they so richly deserve." The defense spending increase Trump laid out in his 2018 budget is not an unprecedented change, regardless of whether it includes war-related spending. It’s also not the done deal Trump described. In order to actually increase defense spending, Congress will have to appropriate the funding and raise the budget cap. We rate this statement False.

pomt-12975	"Emboldened by election, Texas Republicans kill Medicaid funding for kids with disabilities."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2016/dec/21/if-you-only-news/news-entertainment-service-incorrectly-says-texas-/	In case you missed it, Texas Republicans followed on Donald Trump’s election by wiping out aid to needy children. Except, we confirmed, that's not so. A news-entertainment website, IfYouOnlyNews.com, topped a Dec. 4, 2016, post, later pointed out to us by Facebook, with this headline: "Emboldened by election, Texas Republicans kill Medicaid funding for kids with disabilities." The next day, a debunker for Snopes.com said Republicans had cut some Medicaid funding, but they didn’t do so because they were emboldened by the 2016 general election. And when we emailed IfYouOnlyNews.com inquiring into the basis of its post, especially the headline, we didn’t hear back. Best we could tell, meantime, the site’s story didn’t back up its headline, instead piling on nonfactual wood: "In an all-out assault on the social safety net, Texas Republicans have seized the opportunity to finalize and enact a series of brutal budget cuts." Otherwise, the story drew on a Nov. 28, 2016, Texas news story quoting Carrie Williams, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, saying the agency would launch the legislated cuts in Medicaid rates starting Dec. 15, 2016, which was several months after the Texas Supreme Court agreed with an appeals court by declining to take up a challenge to the reductions. Plaintiffs had argued the cuts were so steep that providers would have to close their businesses and forgo seeing as many as 60,000 children. Not in the IfYouOnlyNews.com report: Williams further telling the Texas Tribune, "We will monitor the reduction of rates to ensure access to care is not impacted and that Texans around the state receive the much-needed therapies required to improve their lives." To our inquiry, Williams pointed out Rider 50, at the bottom of page II-99 of the 2016-17 state budget, which was passed into law in 2015. The rider directs the commission to reform "reimbursement methodology to be in line with industry standards, policies, and utilization for acute care therapy services while considering stakeholder input and access to care." The rider goes on to say that in each of the fiscal years through August 2017, the agency should achieve at least $50 million in state savings "through rate reductions" plus another $25 million a year through policy changes. But, the rider says, additional rate cuts should be imposed to the degree policy-related savings fall short. Overall, the budget builds in $373 million in reductions in state spending on Medicaid through the two years. For the fiscal year through August 2017, $26 billion in state money was budgeted for Medicaid. Williams also guided us to legislative records showing House and Senate votes on the budget; these show that a few Democrats joined ruling Republicans in voting for the final version of the budget -- including the fee-cut language. News organizations have widely tracked the results of the directive to reduce Medicaid payments to certain in-home child therapists. Those accounts show that no Medicaid funding was entirely killed and also that the reductions put in motion couldn’t have been connected to the November 2016 election results without time-machine trickery. An April 2016 Austin American-Statesman news story quoted state Sen. Jane Nelson, who chairs the Senate Finance Committee, saying lawmakers made the reductions based on information showing Texas’ rates had considerably exceeded Medicaid reimbursement rates in other states, a point disputed by some. Nelson, R-Flower Mound, said in 2016: "Forcing Texas taxpayers to accept billing rates that are in some cases double the rates in other states would be a terrible precedent. These are rate adjustments, not reductions in services, and the (budget) rider clearly directs the agency to preserve access to care as we bring these rates to an appropriate level." To our inquiry, Bill Noble, spokesman for the Texas Association for Home Care and Hospice, which opposed the fee reductions, reminded us by email that advocates for providers vigorously challenged the quality of the research behind the fee reductions. An August 2015 American-Statesman news story quoted Jenny Jones, vice president for governmental and public affairs at the Texas A&M Health Science Center, saying she didn’t know if fee data collected by A&M researchers showed Texas therapists were overpaid compared to peers elsewhere; that was the state commission’s interpretation, Jones said. Noble also emailed us a brief association critique of the research stating, in part, that researchers erred by comparing Texas rates for certain services with rates in other states for other services. Debate persists. For instance, Joe Straus, the Republican House speaker, said shortly before IfYouOnlyNews.com posted its story that he expects the House in 2017 to reverse the fee cuts. In a Tribune interview, Straus said the cuts were "well intentioned" but that "maybe they were a mistake." Around the same time, the Texas Conservative Coalition Research Institute, which advises conservative House members, updated its report stating that a reversal of the fee cuts "may not be prudent" given an "overabundance" of therapy providers in the state. Our ruling IfYouOnlyNews.com said: "Emboldened by election, Texas Republicans kill Medicaid funding for kids with disabilities." Cuts sure happened. But this headline claim, not backed up by the accompanying story, fumbles facts. Specifically, the Republican-majority 2015 Legislature requested fee reductions for specific services to certain children with disabilities--not killing all such Medicaid funding. Also, that action occurred more than 17 months before the November 2016 election. We find this claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-14375	"Given the results of the primary, the vote of one New Hampshire superdelegate is equal to the votes of about 10,000 grassroots activists."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/mar/18/new-hampshire-republican-party/nhgop-says-superdelegates-have-power-wipe-out-resu/	After Bernie Sanders’s 22-point victory in New Hampshire in February, his supporters were understandably excited. The Vermont senator was on the road to the nomination, they hoped, racking up most of the state’s delegates. But Sanders’s victory was perhaps less meaningful than it appeared. Thanks to the Democratic Party’s superdelegate system, 712 elected officials and party bigwigs also get a vote at the party convention. That’s some 15 percent of all 4,763 delegates who ultimately pick the nominee, according to CBS News. Unlike pledged delegates, who are selected in the primary, these so-called superdelegates are allowed to back whichever candidate they want. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, a party stalwart, has racked up an overwhelming number of endorsements from these superdelegates. A Washington Post story predicted she could ultimately win up to 90 percent of their votes. Even though Sanders won overwhelmingly in New Hampshire, his supporters were baffled and angry to find out that his 15-9 delegate count could actually become 15-17 by convention time, after the state’s eight superdelegates are factored in. Ever ready to needle the opposition party, the New Hampshire Republican Party leaped into the fray, launching an online petition Feb. 15 asking Democratic officials to honor the results of the primary. "Given the results of the primary, the vote of one New Hampshire superdelegate is equal to the votes of about 10,000 grassroots activists," the petition reads, citing some of the big-name superdelegates. "This means that Governor Hassan, Senator Shaheen, the senator’s husband William Shaheen and Congresswoman Kuster are going to cancel out the votes of 40,000 Granite State Democrats." Could one superdelegate vote actually be worth 10,000 ballots cast in the primary? We decided to check it out. It’s important to note that the phrase "grassroots activists" in the statement is imprecise. The rest of the paragraph suggests that it’s being used as a synonym for Democratic voters, but it’s a stretch to call every voter an activist. When we reached out to the state Republican party, spokesman Ryan Williams confirmed "grassroots activists" and "voters" were used interchangeably in this case. And in a statement sent from New Hampshire Republican Party Chairwoman Jennifer Horn about the same time, she correctly used the term voters, and not activists. The actual math involved is simple enough. New Hampshire Secretary of State Bill Gardner’s office tallies the total number of votes cast on each side of the primary. On Feb. 9, 2016, his office recorded 254,776 votes on the Democratic side. According to reporting from the Monitor, the state Democratic Party has 24 base delegates to award in the primary. Since he won 60 percent of the vote, Bernie Sanders was awarded 15 delegates, and Hillary Clinton was awarded 9. Simple enough. Enter the superdelegates. There are eight in the state. As the GOP correctly noted, they include Sen. Jeanne Shaheen and her husband, Billy Shaheen; U.S. Rep. Annie Kuster; and Gov. Maggie Hassan. Six of those superdelegates backed Clinton before the primary (sitting out were state Sen. Martha Fuller Clark and party Chairman Ray Buckley). Even after the primary, Fuller Clark and Buckley wouldn’t say who they stood behind, but it’s tradition for the state’s superdelegates to endorse the same candidate. According to a list from the party, the state’s two other superdelegates are Kathleen Sullivan and Joanne Dowdell. So the equation goes like this: Divide the 24 base delegates into the 254,776 ballots cast. Given the total number of voters, each delegate was selected by 10,616 voters. Each Democratic superdelegate, therefore, has an equal weight to more than 10,000 voters. But the superdelegates don’t live in a vacuum. As Buckley told the Monitor, superdelegates are free to change their votes at any time. Since the role was originated in the 1980s, they have never overturned the national consensus for one candidate or another, according to Bloomberg View columnist Jonathan Bernstein. There was concern in 2008, for example, that superdelegates supporting Clinton would tip the balance against then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama. But as Obama racked up primary wins and amassed delegates, he picked up uncommitted and defecting superdelegates. Sullivan, former chairwoman of the state Democratic Party , wrote a column for the Monitor in which she described how the state’s delegation voted in 2008: "At the convention, every superdelegate who had supported Hillary Clinton voted for Barack Obama. It is a New Hampshire tradition: The delegation supports the nominee unanimously." In other words, while many party insiders support Clinton, if Sanders pulls out a come-from-behind win, it’s unlikely that superdelegates would be willing -- or able -- to block him. Our ruling The New Hampshire Republican Party said that "Given the results of the primary, the vote of one New Hampshire superdelegate is equal to the votes of about 10,000 grassroots activists." For starters, "grassroots activists" are not the same as voters, which needed to be clarified. But strictly looking at the numerical breakdown of voters in the Democratic primary and the number of delegates, the math works out. We rate the the claim Mostly True.

pomt-01202	Rhode Island's legislature is "the strongest in the country."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/nov/30/lincoln-chafee/gov-lincoln-chafee-says-ri-legislature-strongest-u/	It’s a statement often heard in the Ocean State: Rhode Island’s state legislature is the strongest in the nation. And it was recently repeated by Governor Lincoln Chafee as he doled out advice to his successor, Governor-elect Gina Raimondo. Chafee was one of several people who were asked by The Journal what advice they would give to Raimondo as she prepares to take office Jan. 6. Their comments were published Nov. 17 in The Journal’s Political Scene column. "The only [advice] I would add is we all know ... that Rhode Island constitutionally has a very strong legislature," Chafee said. "That’s a fact, the strongest in the country … And it’s critical, to move your agenda forward, to have relationships ... build those relationships." Since this claim has been made so often, we decided to check whether Rhode Island’s General Assembly really ranks as the strongest in the nation. We asked Chafee’s office what facts he had to support his statement. It took awhile for his office to get back to us. Meanwhile, we reached out to nearly a dozen political science professors nationwide, the National Conference of State Legislatures, and others to get their views. All who responded generally shared the view that Rhode Island’s governor has relatively limited power compared with governors in many other states We were referred to "Governors and the Executive Branch," a chapter in the book "Politics In The American States: A Comparative Analysis." Its author, Margaret R. Ferguson, a political science professor at Indiana University-Purdue University Indianapolis, measured the institutional power of governors in each of the 50 states, based on various factors. Those included term limits; power to appoint without the involvement of the legislature; control over the budget; veto power; and whether the governor is the same political affiliation that controls the state legislature. Rhode Island placed dead last overall in Ferguson’s list for executive power, while Massachusetts placed at the top. The book also noted that Chafee was the only governor in the country in 2011 to face a legislature controlled by an opposing party. At the time, Chafee was registered as an independent; he changed his affiliation to Democrat in May 2013. We also looked to Rhode Island’s Constitution. It limits governors to two terms and specifies that the governor’s appointments of state officers be subject to Senate advice and consent. Pardons, too, need Senate approval. A veto by the governor can be overridden by a vote of three-fifths of members present in the House and Senate. One of the key provisions limiting a Rhode Island governor’s power concerns the state budget. Governors are required to submit budgets, but the documents are then subject to legislative cuts and additions, before the General Assembly passes its own version. In 44 other states, governors have so-called line-item veto authority, the power to reject individual items, while keeping the rest of the budget intact. In Rhode Island, the governor can only approve or veto the final budget, which usually prompts the Assembly to override a veto. When Chafee’s office got back to us, it shared emails sent to the governor’s staff by Peverill Squire, a University of Missouri political science professor who is widely known for his study of state legislatures. The email exchanges were part of the preparations for last year’s 350th anniversary of the Rhode Island Colonial Charter of 1663. "We can always quibble about rankings, but every accounting puts the power of Rhode Island’s governor at or near the bottom in terms of institutional powers," Squire said in an email to Jonathan Stevens, Chafee’s director of special projects. "Rhode Island’s governor enjoys only moderate appointment powers. The governor also has a weak veto and relatively little ability to influence the budget. A line-item veto and greater control over appointments would greatly strengthen the governor." "On a constitutional power metric, Rhode Island is among the most powerful state legislatures," Squire’s wrote. Squire confirmed the statements to PolitiFact Rhode Island via email and cited his book "The Evolution of American Legislatures, Colonies, Territories and States, 1619-2009," as well as an earlier book, "101 Chambers." We also heard from Jay S. Goodman, a political science professor at Wheaton College, who noted that the Rhode Island legislature had given up a certain degree of power over the past 20 years, including the appointment of Supreme Court justices, the revolving door limitations on jobs, ethics rules, and the "separation of powers amendment." Voters approved the separation of powers constitutional amendment in 2004 to curb legislative powers and remove lawmakers from state boards and commissions. "Those changes certainly strengthened the governorship," Goodman said via email. "But the overwhelming one-party rule coupled with iron discipline still makes the Speaker [of the House] the most powerful single person [in Rhode Island]." While the strength of the governorship might appear to be inversely proportional to the General Assembly’s power, Maureen Moakley, a political science professor at the University of Rhode Island, observed that a governor’s force of personality also factors in. She used the late Governor Bruce Sundlun, a Democrat, as an example. "He was a very forceful personality. The day he took office he faced a crisis. [The collapse of Rhode Island’s credit unions.] That gave him a lot of leverage through his administration, especially his first administration," Moakley said. "If a governor has the political savvy to be able to take the bully pulpit and turn [it] into a political force, it can go a long way to mitigating the limitations of the office," Moakley said. Their initial presentation of their agenda is critical, she said. Our ruling Governor Chafee said the Rhode Island state legislature is "the strongest in the country… " Our research found that Rhode Island’s governor has the least institutional power in the nation under the state Constitution. That would make the Rhode Island General Assembly the most powerful, supporting the governor’s point. We rule his claim True.

pomt-13933	"If Question 1 were to pass here in Nevada, we would have more restrictive gun laws here in Nevada dealing with the transfer of firearms than they do in California."	half-true	/nevada/statements/2016/jun/22/robert-uithoven/universal-background-checks-ballot-how-would-nevad/	Two major players in the debate over gun laws are bringing the fight to Nevada, where voters will decide in November on requiring universal background checks on the sale or transfer of firearms. Both the National Rifle Association and Everytown for Gun Safety are dumping millions of dollars into the state in the battle over Question 1. Veteran state Republican operative Robert Uithoven is leading efforts to defeat the measure, and recently criticized the initiative on a public-affairs television program and warned that passing the measure would make Nevada gun laws even more restrictive than its more liberal neighbor — California. "If Question 1 were to pass here in Nevada, we would have more restrictive gun laws here in Nevada dealing with the transfer of firearms than they do in California," he said in a June 6 interview on Nevada NewsMakers. The California/Nevada comparison is becoming a more popular talking point among opponents of the ballot measure, but would Question 1 actually make Nevada stricter than California on gun transfers? The answer isn’t so clear. What’s at stake? So what would Nevada’s proposed background check expansion actually mean for gun owners? If approved by voters, the initiative would create an escalating penalty (starting with a misdemeanor) for people without a license to sell firearms to sell or transfer guns without first going to a licensed dealer and having them conduct a background check. That would be a departure from current state law, where background checks are generally not required for gun sales or transfers between two private parties (lawmakers approved a change waiving fees for voluntary background checks in 2015). Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval vetoed a bill in 2013 that would have enacted a similar background check process on private gun sales and transfers, saying it would impose "unreasonable burdens and harsh penalties" on otherwise law-abiding gun owners. If approved, licensed firearm dealers would be required to conduct the background checks, which is done under the National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) and is generally completed fairly quickly (though delays can last up to three days). There are some exceptions built in to the ballot question, including sales and transfers between family members and for antique guns. Temporary transfers without background checks would be allowed in some specific cases, like on certified shooting ranges, in areas where it’s legal to hunt or while in the presence of the gun owner. Debate over the ballot measure echoes the national debate over gun control. Supporters say the majority of background checks are completed quickly and the measure closes an existing loophole, while opponents lambast the measure for being overly vague and unduly burdensome on gun owners. Transfers and Exemptions Approval of Question 1 would turn private party gun sales and transfers in Nevada into a process that would more closely resemble California’s existing system, but there are some differences that would persist between the two states especially in the area of temporary gun transfers, or loans. Uithoven told PolitiFact that California generally allows people "who are personally known to each other" to infrequently loan firearms for up to 30 days as long as the recipient has a valid firearm safety certificate and the loan is for a "lawful purpose." California also has exemptions for transfers as gifts, on gun ranges, for use as props in the entertainment industry, loans to minors under certain requirements and for licensed hunters during hunting season(though California lawmakers are debating rolling back several of the exemptions including the 30-day infrequent loans). Because the Nevada ballot measure don’t allow for a "temporary" transfer, or loan, between friends unless the gun owner is in the physical presence of the person handling the gun or under a several clearly stated, well-defined situations (like on a shooting range or legal hunting area), Uithoven says the new law would be stricter than what California requires. The ballot measure does have a broader definition of "immediate family member," as California only includes transfers between parents, children, and grandparents as exempt from transfer regulations. Question 1 broadens those family exemptions in Nevada and includes "parents, children, siblings, grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews." So California is stricter on which family members fall under the inter-family gun transfers label, but as Uithoven points out, the state does have an easier process for "infrequent" firearms loans (less than six times per calendar year) to people who are "personally known to each other," which could include friends or other family members. But those "infrequent transfers" still require firearm transferees to have completed the state’s Firearm Safety Certificate course, which is a $25 written test on firearm safety and general gun laws. That’s a regulatory hurdle that doesn’t exist in Nevada, with or without the ballot measure. As for any other non-familial transfers that don’t fall under exemptions, California is generally stricter than a post-Question 1 Nevada. So-called "private party transfers" in California require a proof-of-residency requirement, a safe handling demonstration requirement and a mandatory ten-day waiting period, whereas the Nevada proposal would only require passing a background check. Uithoven also says that the ballot measure allows licensed firearms dealers to ask for an undefined "reasonable fee" to conduct the background check, while California has a set dollar amount written into the state’s penal code. We also reached out to the pro-Question 1 Background Checks Initiative, who highlighted a handful of California regulations that Nevada would lack. California also has an "assault weapons" ban, which includes a ban on private sales or transfers of so-called assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Nevada has no such ban. The state has several additional regulations on private party gun sales compared to the proposed Nevada changes, but not all of them directly relate to firearm transfer rules. California generally requires a 10-day waiting period for any gun sale or transfer, including private party sales and transfers (though it’s being challenged in court). Again, this regulation doesn’t apply to the exempted transfers. California also prohibits buyers from purchasing more than one handgun in a 30-day period, but that’s only for retail sales — private party transfers are exempt. Our ruling NRA Nevadans for Freedom campaign manager Robert Uithoven said passing Question 1 would lead to "more restrictive gun laws here in Nevada dealing with the transfer of firearms than they do in California." Passing the ballot question would make Nevada look a lot more like California in terms of private party gun sales and transfers, with generally fewer regulations. Uithoven’s claim focuses specifically in on the process of firearm transfers. In some ways, Nevada’s law would be tougher, but in other ways it would not. Overall, California would have more regulations on firearm transfers if Question 1 passes but would be more lenient in exempting certain types of gun transfers. Uithoven’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context. We rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/58d554fc-0594-4176-8f93-379390f58bf5	None	Robert Uithoven	None	None	None	2016-06-22T16:23:14	2016-06-06	['Nevada', 'California']
pomt-07767	In 2009, Democratic Wisconsin state senators "rammed through a billion-dollar tax hike in 24 hours with no public input."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/23/scott-walker/wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-democratic-senator/	The Badger State’s old tourism slogan, "Escape to Wisconsin," is a come-hither aimed largely at the Land of Lincoln. But when the political temperature got too hot in Madison on Feb. 17, 2011, 14 Democratic senators escaped to Illinois and helped put Wisconsin somewhere near the center of the political universe. The absence of the 14 made it impossible for the Senate to get a quorum for a vote on Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s budget-repair bill. The senators said they fled because the bill -- which would strip away most collective bargaining rights from most public employees -- was being rushed to a vote. Two days later, Walker called on them to return, suggesting in a statement that they were being hypocritical. "These are many of the same senators who, two years ago, rammed through a billion-dollar tax hike in 24 hours with no public input," Walker declared. Walker repeated the call for the Senate Democrats to return in his televised "fireside chat" on Feb. 22, 2011, about the budget stalemate. And numerous readers have asked us to sort out this piece of the debate. So we will. We asked Walker’s spokesman, Cullen Werwie, to explain the governor’s charge. He said the reference was to a budget-repair bill introduced by Walker’s predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, in 2009. The content of Doyle’s and Walker’s repair bills -- which were needed midyear to balance the state budget -- are different, but the scenarios are similar. The Doyle bill was approved by a Democratic-controlled Legislature under a Democratic governor. Conversely, Republican Walker introduced his bill to an Assembly and Senate that are controlled by the GOP. (Ironically, the Wisconsin 14 fled two years to the day after the Doyle bill was introduced.) Walker’s statement has three major points: Who was involved Walker is correct in saying "many of the same senators" who retreated to Illinois voted for Doyle’s 2009 budget-repair bill. Indeed, 12 of the 14 did; the only two who didn’t, Tim Cullen of Janesville and Chris Larson of Milwaukee, weren’t elected until November 2010. What the bill involved Was the Doyle bill "a billion-dollar tax hike"? We found in a previous PolitiFact Wisconsin item that assessed the bill and how it was adopted that taxes, per se, would only be raised by an estimated $290 million. However, if a new fee on hospital revenue was included -- and news reports often referred to the fee as a tax -- the take would be an estimated $1.2 billion over three years. Doyle and Democrats argued the change was welcomed by hospitals and allowed the hospitals to bring in a greater amount in federal money. But it was real money filling a real hole. So, Walker’s claim of a billion-dollar tax hike is essentially accurate. How it was adopted Was Doyle’s bill "rammed through" in "24 hours with no public input"? Again, Walker is essentially correct. No public hearing was held on Doyle’s bill, which was approved by the Legislature the day after it was introduced. As Walker suggested, the Senate vote was strictly along party lines, with all Democrats voting for the bill and all Republicans voting against it. (In the Assembly, all but two Democrats voted yes and all Republicans voted no.) This is one budget-repair bill debate we can bring swiftly to a close. Accused by Senate Democrats of rushing a vote on his repair bill, Walker fired back with his own charge. He said that two years earlier, many of those senators had rammed through a billion-dollar tax hike contained in a Democratic repair bill -- in 24 hours and without public input. The record is clear. We rate Walker’s statement True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2011-02-23T15:45:16	2011-02-19	['None']
pomt-07500	"Libya supplies the oil for China. We get no oil from Libya."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/11/donald-trump/libya-sells-most-its-oil-europe-not-china/	Donald Trump has said he’s thinking about running for president, and while he’s gotten a lot of attention for questioning President Barack Obama’s birth certificate, he’s also made several provocative statements about foreign policy. In an interview on Fox News, Trump discussed the Middle East, starting out with the war in Iraq, then moving on to U.S. air strikes in Libya. "You know in the old days, when you won a war, to the victor belongs the spoils. You kept it," Trump said. "We win a war, and we hand it over to some people we don't know and we leave." "And we lose the contracts to China," interjected one of the Fox anchors. "Yes, China will be another one," Trump agreed. "By the way, Libya supplies the oil for China. We get no oil from Libya. What are we doing?" We thought Trump’s statement about Libya and China was interesting, so we decided to look into it. We asked a Trump spokesman for comment, but we didn't hear back. So we turned to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA), a federal agency that collects data on energy. We’ll take Trump’s statement in two parts. • Libya supplies the oil for China. Libya does supply some oil to China, but it’s not as large as Trump’s statement implies. The EIA showed that Libya’s No. 1 customer is Italy, which bought 28 percent of Libya’s exports in 2010. Italy was followed by France, at 15 percent, then China, at 11 percent. After that, Libya sold to Germany, 10 percent; Spain, 10 percent; Greece, 5 percent; the United Kingdom, 4 percent, and United States, 3 percent. (More on that 3 percent in a bit.) Other countries combined to buy 14 percent of Libya’s exports. We also wanted to know what share of China's imported oil comes from Libya. We found that in 2009, China bought most of its imported oil from Saudi Arabia, which supplied 21 percent. That was followed by Angola, 16 percent; Iran, 11 percent; Russia, 8 percent; Sudan, 6 percent; Oman, 6 percent; Iraq, 3.5 percent; Kuwait, 3.5 percent and then Libya at 3.1 percent. Libya is followed by Kazakhstan at 2.9 percent and Venezuela at 2.6 percent. Other countries combined supplied 17.4 percent of China’s imports. So China is a big customer of Libyan oil, but not the biggest, and there are many other customers. And Libya is far from being China’s chief supplier. It ranks ninth. • We get no oil from Libya. The United States doesn’t get much oil from Libya. In 2010, the U.S. imported 25.7 million barrels of oil from Libya, down from a recent high of 42.8 million barrels in 2007. The U.S. didn’t import any oil from Libya between 1982 and 2004, due to an oil embargo first imposed by President Ronald Reagan. Libya is such a small source that it doesn’t make it into the list of the top 15 countries from which the United States imports oil. U.S companies are working to develop Libya’s oil sector, however. In 2009, a deputy assistant secretary of state told Congress that U.S. companies are "probably the most active and the most successful" in helping Libya revitalize its oil sector. "They're seeking our technology because it's the best in the world and we're doing quite well," said the U.S. State Department’s William Hudson. "The Chinese are also active, but our companies have really taken the lion's share so far of bidding on plots for oil production." Trump said, "Libya supplies the oil for China. We get no oil from Libya." His point in the first sentence was clearly that Libya was a major supplier of oil for China. But the data do not support his claim. Libya is far from being China’s chief supplier. It ranks ninth. The second part of his statement is false -- the U.S. does get oil from Libya and the percentage is likely to increase.. On the whole, we rate Trump’s statement False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2011-04-11T17:12:09	2011-04-04	['Libya', 'China']
pomt-14380	"Six justices" on the U.S. Supreme Court have been "confirmed in presidential election years since 1912."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/17/mike-honda/mike-honda-shares-accurate-graphic-about-past-supr/	In a Medium post titled, "It’s Time for the Senate to Do Its Job," Rep. Mike Honda, D-Calif., urged senators to hold a vote on President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court nominee, Merrick Garland. Virtually since the moment it was announced that Justice Antonin Scalia had died, Democrats and Republicans have clashed over when he should be replaced. Senate Republicans have so far held firm in saying they will not vote on the nomination until the public weighs in after Election Day 2016. Democrats counter that this is out of step with Senate norms, and they have created a graphic to make that case. "Let’s give President Obama’s #SCOTUSnominee a fair hearing and timely vote," the graphic says. At the top of Honda’s March 16 Medium post is a graphic created by the House Democratic Caucus. Under the title, "6 justices confirmed in presidential election years since 1912," the graphic shows photographs of all six justices who fit that description. Is it accurate? Of the six examples cited in the graphic going back to 1912, five were both nominated and confirmed during a presidential election year. They are summarized in the following chart. (We’ve corrected the spelling of Clarke’s name, which is incorrect in the Democrats’ graphic). The sixth case involves a future justice who was nominated prior to an election year but was confirmed during one. Associate Justice Anthony Kennedy, who’s still on the court, was confirmed in February 1988, but President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, had nominated him in November 1987 to succeed the retiring Louis Powell. It’s worth noting that in June 1968, five months before the presidential election, Democratic President Lyndon Johnson made two nominations, though there was not technically a vacancy, and neither were approved. Johnson nominated Abe Fortas, who was a sitting justice, to succeed Earl Warren as chief justice, after Warren indicated he wanted to retire. Fortas hit strong opposition in the Senate Judiciary Committee and in the face of a filibuster, he asked that his name be withdrawn. (The hearings uncovered questionable speaking fees Fortas received, and he resigned from the court in 1969.) Johnson had also nominated Homer Thornberry to take Fortas’ place on the court. But that nomination, too, was withdrawn, since Fortas was never elevated. Finally, in October 1956, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower did something even more extraordinary than making a nomination less than a month before election day. He put William Brennan directly on the court with a "recess appointment" to replace Sherman Minton. He then formally nominated Brennan in January 1957. Our ruling The graphic Honda used said that "six justices" on the U.S. Supreme Court have been "confirmed in presidential election years since 1912." That is correct, so we rate the statement True.

pomt-10568	"One man sacrificed for his country. One man opposed a flawed strategy in Iraq. One man had the courage to call for change. One man didn't play politics with the truth. One man stands up to the special interests."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/07/john-mccain/one-man-found-his-winning-message/	In advance of the Potomac Primary on Feb. 12, 2008, Republican front-runner John McCain released a TV ad in Virginia, the District of Columbia and Maryland that has played to other markets in this primary process. "Never Surrender" is a 30-second spot that shows images of Sen. McCain as a prisoner of war, walking alongside Ronald Reagan and on the campaign trail. Its claims are well supported. • "One man sacrificed for his country." McCain served 22 years in the U.S. Navy, including five as a prisoner of war after his plane was shot down in Vietnam. He has been honored with the Silver Star, Bronze Star, Legion of Merit, Purple Heart and the Distinguished Flying Cross. Of his remaining Republican contenders, only Rep. Ron Paul has military experience. He served as a medical doctor in the U.S. Air Force from 1963 to 1965 in San Antonio, Texas, and in the U.S. Air National Guard from 1965 to 1968. He did not go to war as McCain did. That appears to be the distinction drawn here. ( Read our fact sheet on "Who was in the military?" here. ) • "One man opposed a flawed strategy in Iraq. One man had the courage to call for change. One man didn't play politics with the truth." Although he has been one of the Senate's strongest and most vocal advocates of the war in Iraq, leading recent debates against Democratic bills to set a timetable for withdrawal, McCain has also been one of the Bush adminstration's biggest Republican critics. As far back as mid 2003, shortly after the invasion of Iraq, McCain was warning that the United States needed to send more troops to Iraq and more money to Iraq reconstruction efforts, or else face a deep and long-lasting insurgency that would threaten America's mission there. Which, of course, is exactly what has happened. He was also a strident critic of former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, telling interviewers that he lacked confidence in Rumsfeld as far back as 2004 — meaty criticism for a top Republican on the Armed Services Committee. "There's not enough (troops), and we are in a very serious situation, in my view, a race against time. We need to spend a whole lot more money to get the services back to the people. We need to get the electricity going, the fuel, the water. And unless we get that done and get it done pretty soon, we could face a very serious situation," McCain told NBC's Meet the Press on Aug. 24, 2003. "Time is not on our side. People in 125-degree heat with no electricity and no fuel are going to become angry in a big hurry. The sophistication of the attacks on U.S. and allied troops have increased. And what we do in the next several months will determine whether we're in a very difficult situation or not, and there's still time, but we've got to act quickly." As for his claim that just "one man" opposed the strategy in Iraq, that's a bit of a stretch: Independent experts and many congressional Democrats have lavished criticism on the administration's strategy in Iraq. But among his Republican competitors for the presidential nomination, McCain is right. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has suggested that he, too, would take a different route in Iraq than the president, but McCain was clearly there first. • "One man stands up to the special interests." This is a reference to McCain's strong opposition to what he calls wasteful pork barrel spending and earmark projects. Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington-based group that watches for such things, says McCain holds the title of pork-fighter and has honored him with its "Treasury Guardians" award. Overall, it's an effective TV ad with accurate claims. We give it a True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-02-07T00:00:00	2008-02-06	['Iraq']

"Small business is where the jobs are, like a 30-year-old boat cleaning business employing 18 people," Brandes says as he stands near a pier. "But their jobs are on the line, all because government essentially says if they don't hire a lifeguard to watch their workers, they can't stay open. Even when the water's only a few feet deep." The screen flashes briefly to the words "Government: Do it our way or else." But is the government really forcing a business to hire a lifeguard or shut down? The case in question involves Scuba Clean Inc., a St. Petersburg company that earlier this year was cited for 19 violations by the U.S Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The company faces more than $200,000 in penalties. OSHA did indeed demand that the company hire a trained tender, someone to stand watch over divers for safety, and the fine for that violation is $49,000. A tender is generally similar to a lifeguard but with much more extensive training. Owner Phil Secord disputed the violations and contested the fines, but said he is closing his company over the citations. He laid off at least one worker, and turned over his customers to others who work as contract workers, he said. The three most serious fines stemmed from allegations that the company had workers in the water who weren't trained under the standards for commercial diving, and for using air through a line from the surface without a tender. However, there were 16 other unrelated violations alleged, including the company not having a supervisor on site, not having written safety procedures and equipment, and improper storage of chlorine and other chemicals. Secord said the government is indeed killing him with unneeded regulation. For example, he said his divers mostly clean boats in waters four to six feet deep at local marinas. Therefore, he said, employing a tender would be unnecessary and expensive. His case is headed to a Nov. 5 settlement hearing. It is true that OSHA rules don’t discriminate between people cleaning boat hulls in shallow water and commercial divers who work in deep water to do underwater construction, according to commercial diving trainers. "It's not a gray area. It's cut and dry. And it's a federal regulation," said Geoff Thielst, a 30-year commercial diver and program director of marine technology training at Santa Barbara City College. But Brandes said the business was threatened "all because" Scuba Clean didn't hire a lifeguard – the tender. The bulk of the alleged violations and fines that have put this business' future in doubt involved training of divers, equipment and safety practices, not just the absence of a lifeguard. Therefore, we rule this claim Half True.	None	Jeff Brandes	None	None	None	2010-10-28T15:57:51	2010-09-26	['None']
pomt-14110	If you don't buy cigarettes at your local supermarket, your grocery bill won't go up a dime. The same is true of the sugary drink tax. If passed, you can avoid paying the tax by not buying sugary drinks.	half-true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/may/11/philadelphia-daily-news/rating-philly-daily-news-claim-its-not-grocery-tax/	According to the monied interests fighting Mayor Jim Kenney’s proposed tax on sugary beverages, it’s not really a "soda tax." It’s a "grocery tax." This coalition of unions, businesses and others has released ads with the slogan "No Philly Grocery Tax," and last week held a rally outside of City Hall with beverages on a replica of grocery store shelves. Last month, the Daily News criticized the linking of the soda tax to a grocery tax in an editorial titled "Soda tax would benefit kids, which is why we support it." After discussing the anti soda tax group’s ads’ insistence on referring to the tax as a grocery tax, the editorial read, "If you don’t buy cigarettes at your local supermarket, your grocery bill won’t go up a dime. The same is true of the sugary drink tax. If passed, you can avoid paying the tax by not buying sugary drinks." Their criticism of the phrase "grocery tax" has been one of many. But will the prices of groceries be untouched by the proposed soda tax? Or is there a possibility grocery bills could increase even if consumers stop buying soda? Sandy Shea, the Daily News’ editorial page editor, stressed that the newspaper’s editorial board is convinced that calling the sugary drinks tax a grocery tax is disingenuous. "If you don’t buy sugary drinks in a supermarket," Shea said, "it’s not a grocery tax." As city officials have stressed, the three-cent-per-ounce soda tax is levied on distributors. From there, at least some of it will likely be passed through to the retail level. The owners of supermarkets, drugstores, corner stores or whatever businesses sell sugary beverages can choose to absorb the cost, or pass it onto the consumer. While most talk has centered on the possibility of rising soda prices, experts and research suggest it’s possible these businesses could raise the prices of other items similar to sugary drinks. Donald Marron, director of economic policy initiatives at the Urban Institute, said the prices of diet soda and pure juices might increase because demand for them could increase as people searched for alternatives to sugary beverages. But he doubted the increase would extend to items unrelated to the sugary drinks tax. "The question you always have to ask yourself is why would these stores be able to raise the price of these other goods," Marron said. "And if they’re able to why wouldn’t they already? If that were the profitable thing to do, they ought to raise the price of cereal anyway." In Berkeley, the only American city to enact a soda tax, researchers noted the price of Diet Coke increased by an average of .32 cents per ounce (regular sodas saw increases in the range .5 to .7 cents per ounce). They saw no significant increase in other diet sodas. Carl Davis, research director at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said it was possible the prices of other products would rise but not probable in most circumstances. He said smaller convenience stores would be more likely to raise prices on other products than larger grocery stores because they likely take in a greater share of revenue from soda sales. Still, they’d face limitations on how much they could increase prices of other goods given the lack of variety of items they sell and the need to keep profit margins high on soda if soda is a major revenue generator for them. "All that said, this soda tax proposal is novel enough that any answer to this question is going to involve some amount of speculation," he said. Last month in a 6ABC story, it seemed Mayor Kenney was suggesting other items could rise in price because of the soda tax. The station paraphrased the mayor like this: "The mayor said he believes the increased costs will be spread over thousands of retail items." Lauren Hitt, Kenney’s communications director, said the station’s paraphrase was incorrect: "He was referring to the supermarket’s ability to absorb the tax. I believe he was asked to respond to supermarket’s claim that they can’t absorb the increase in cost (if distributors pass it on) because they say they don’t make that much of a profit on soda. He responded by pointing out that because supermarkets sell so much more than just soda that they can absorb the price as part of their overall profits from all the different products they sell." Asked why the phrase grocery tax is being used, Philadelphians Against the Grocery Tax Coalition spokesperson Larry Miller pointed to a list of taxed products on their website. These products range from sodas to energy drinks to fruit juices that are not 100 percent natural. "Would you consider, let’s say, Minute Maid premium tropical punch a grocery item?" Miller said. "Would you consider Cranberry Ocean Spray cherry juice? Ocean Spray pomegranate? These are grocery items. Snapple Grape. These are all grocery items that people buy every day at the grocery store or the supermarket." Our Ruling In an editorial supporting the soda tax and condemning the use of the phrase grocery tax, the Daily News wrote Philadelphians would avoid the tax by not purchasing sugary beverages. Evidence, experts and studies say it’s possible a sugary drinks tax on distributors could lead to some rising prices elsewhere. But there’s not enough data and there’s also a chance those who don’t buy sugary drinks will bear some of the cost of the tax. We rule the claim half true.

Sure sounds suspicious, if true! But it’s not. The Last Line of Defense published an article on Nov. 4 with the headline, "UPDATE: Malia Obama among 10 arrested In racist Antifa attack." Another fake news site, Info Media, published an identical article that cites The Last Line of Defense as a source at the bottom. Popular News Today published a fake article on Nov. 6 that added a plot twist to the original fake news story: "BREAKING: Cop who arrested Malia Obama found dead under suspicious circumstances." None of this is true. The Last Line of Defense is a satirical site that tries to fool conservatives into clicking on false headlines. The author’s work, which we’ve debunked before, often ends up on other fake news sites. Beyond the site’s disclaimer, there are many other ways to show the story is fake. The article says that Malia Obama, and nine other Harvard students, attacked an elderly woman. The Cambridge Police Department daily log, an overview of the department's daily calls for service, does not mention an attack involving 10 assailants, Antifa or any of the names listed in the fake news article. The department’s News & Alerts page also does not have a post announcing the death of an Officer Patrick Farley, Malia’s fake arresting officer. The photo of the police officer used in the Popular News Today fake news article is not a photo of a person named Farley but a photo of Brad Miller, a former police officer in Arlington, Texas.

pomt-07628	Says it has offered $12 million in savings through 2011 and $184 million in savings over the next 25 years in contract negotiations with the City of Milwaukee.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2011/mar/18/milwaukee-police-association/milwaukee-police-association-says-it-has-offered-s/	After the Green Bay Packers won the Super Bowl in February 2011, news in Wisconsin centered on Gov. Scott Walker’s attempt to curtail the collective bargaining powers of most government workers and make those workers pay more for their benefits. Only police and other public safety employees were exempted. Yet on March 7 and 9, 2011, the Milwaukee Police Association ran a half-page ad in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel touting how the union had offered to make financial sacrifices worth millions of dollars. The reference was to contract talks between the union -- which represents 1,700 officers, detectives and other police employees -- and the City of Milwaukee. MPA offered $12 million "in immediate savings through 2011" and $184 million in savings "over the next 25 years," the ad announced. The claims were recited the next day in a news release issued by Milwaukee Ald. Bob Donovan. Let’s see if they’re true. Contracts for Milwaukee police and firefighters expired in 2009. Both unions are in mediation with the city over contracts that would be retroactive to January 2010 and continue through December 2011. Mayor Tom Barrett, who lost to Walker in the November 2010 gubernatorial election, asked the unions in March 2011 to agree to pay more for pensions and health insurance, as called for in Walker’s budget-repair bill. MPA president Mike Crivello said at the time his union would consider the request -- and he reiterated the concessions that MPA had already offered. That is, the $12 million in savings through 2011 and the $184 million over the next 25 years. There are quite a few figures, but hang us with us; we’ll walk through the three main ways the union claims the money will be saved. Pay freeze for 2010 and 2011 The ad says a two-year pay freeze would save the city $5.4 million per year. But Crivello acknowledged the ad is in error on this point and that $5.4 million would be the total savings through 2011, the two-year period of the contract. Where did the number come from? MPA arrived at the figure by assuming -- based on raises in newly-signed police contracts around the country -- that an arbitrator would award 2.5 percent raises for 2010 and 2011 if the union and the city could not agree on a contract, according to MPA vice president Mark Buetow. Let’s pause here for some perspective. First, the union assumes raises would be virtually automatic. But there is no way to know what an arbitrator would decide. Second, avoiding 2.5 percent pay raises through a pay freeze may be a figurative savings of $5.4 million for the city, but it’s not a literal savings. With a pay freeze, the city would still be spending as much on payroll as it does today. Reduced wage for training The ad says the city would save $1.04 million per year through a "reduced wage for training." That would be a total of $2.08 million through 2011. Crivello said the union would accept a reduced starting wage for new officers for the nearly six months they spend in training before hitting the streets. The $2.08 million in savings is based on the city hiring 200 new recruits per year. But that 200 is a big if. Crivello said 200 new hires would give the department roughly the number of officers that have been authorized as part of the city budget. But he acknowledged that the city commonly keeps roughly that many police positions vacant. Troy Hamblin, the city labor negotiator, said the city has hired an average of 79 police recruits per year since Barrett was elected mayor in 2004. Based on that number, he said the lower training wage would save the city $1.09 million through 2011 -- about half the union’s estimate. So, the union is banking on the city more than doubling its usual police hiring in order for the $2.08 million through 2011 to be saved. A more realistic number would be about half that. Those aspects relate directly to the immediate savings. The next is the central part of the claim of saving $184 million over 25 years. New hire pension contributions The newspaper ad says that if new hires make contributions to their pensions -- current employees represented by MPA make none -- the city would save $184 million "over the next 25 years." That’s an awful specific number, and 25 years is a long time away. Where did the figure come from? The union says the estimate -- based on today’s payroll -- is for what the annual savings would be 25 years from now. That is, the amount saved each year, once we are 25 years into the future. Why 25 years in the future? Since contracts allow police officers to retire after 25 years on the job, by that point nearly the entire force would be under the new provisions. (The city’s estimate, using that measure is $179 million in savings a year, based on today’s payroll. So, the two sides are not far off.) That may seem clear enough. But the wording in the ad -- savings "over the next 25 years" -- is confusing. We read it as the total amount saved during the course of those 25 years and think most others would as well. That figure is even harder to calculate, since it depends on how many officers retire or leave the force and at what point; how rapidly those officers are replaced and what happens to their salary in the meantime. Indeed, by that measure, the overall savings is likely much higher. The annual savings would grow as the force shifts over time from most being under the current no-contribution system, to most being under the new approach. Of course, the numbers in the short term on this point are stronger. As for the immediate savings in the contract, Crivello said that if new hires paid 7 percent of their base wage toward their pensions, the city would save $432,000 through 2011 (the city’s estimate is $462,000, so there is not a big disagreement on this one either). All right, let’s tally the estimated savings from the three areas to see if they back up the two major claims in the union ad. Those were the ones in large, bold print: $12 million through 2011 and $184 million "over the next 25 years." $12 million through 2011: Savings from a pay freeze are figurative, based on forgoing an assumed pay raise. The city’s payroll costs would actually remain flat, so there would be no direct savings to the budget. The reduced training wage would save the city about $2.08 million and pension contributions would save $432,000 -- both according to union estimates. That’s a total of $2.51 million (the city’s estimate is $1.55 million). And that’s a fraction of the $12 million claimed. So, the first of the ad’s two claims is wrong. $184 million "over the next 25 years": This claim focuses on the pension change. The city doesn’t quarrel much with the dollar estimate, which is an annual savings using today’s dollars. But it’s a figure that wouldn’t be reached until the entire workforce turns over, perhaps 25 years from now. There would be savings in the interim years, tallying over the intervening 25 years even more than that amount -- but no one knows how much. So, the second claim may actually be low, but it is also off -- potentially way off. One final note. An asterisk at the bottom of the ad says MPA offered the three concessions "in exchange for non-monetary and monetary items." In other words, it’s clear that the union would only make the three concessions if it gets something in return. MPA estimates the monetary items -- including higher life insurance benefits and higher pay for certain officers -- would cost the city less than $1 million per year, Buetow said. The city has not produced a complete estimate, but Hamblin said the union estimate appears reasonable. So, that would further reduce the savings claimed in the MPA ad. Time for the Truth-O-Meter. The Milwaukee Police Association said concessions it offered in contract talks with the City of Milwaukee would save taxpayers $12 million through 2011 and $184 million "over the next 25 years." A proposed pay freeze would affect current employees, but wouldn’t save the city any money, while changes in training pay and pensions would save money but affect only new hires. The savings through 2011 would be, using union estimates, $2.51 million -- a far cry from $12 million. On the second point, the MPA is correct there would be about $184 million in savings … in the 25th year. But the wording in the ad refers to the savings during that entire time frame. So this number is also off -- apparently by a lot. The MPA’s case would actually be stronger if they used a more accurate number, since during the previous 24 years the annual savings would ramp up until it reaches that projected $184 million in year in year 25. We rate the Milwaukee Police Association claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Milwaukee Police Association	None	None	None	2011-03-18T09:00:00	2011-03-09	['Milwaukee']
pomt-14359	"More people were killed by terrorists in 2015 than in any other year ever, after an 80 percent increase from 2014."	mostly true	/pennsylvania/statements/2016/mar/22/joe-pitts/rep-joe-pitts-said-2015-saw-80-increase-people-who/	Rep. Joseph Pitts, a Republican whose district encompasses Reading and Lancaster, used a recent Medium post to highlight the number of people killed by terrorists worldwide as he advocated for the continued usage of the U.S.’s Guantanamo Bay facility. The post, published at the end of February, opened with this statement: "More people were killed by terrorists in 2015 than in any other year ever, after an 80 percent increase from 2014." That seemed like a large increase, so we decided to check the claim. After an inquiry from PolitiFact, Pitts’ chief of staff Monica J. Volante said the statement should have read, "More people were killed by terrorists in 2014 than in any other year ever, after an 80 percent increase from 2013." So the actual statement is one year off. When the years in the statement are corrected, and based on that source, this appears to check out. The 2015 Global Terrorism Index published by the Australia-based Institute for Economics and Peace has, for the last three years, compiled information on terrorist activity dating back to 2000. It data comes from figures provided by the Global Terrorism Database hosted at the University of Maryland. The 111-page report states that 2014 was the deadliest on record worldwide, and 32,658 people died as a result of terrorism, representing an 80 percent jump from 2013 when about 18,000 people were killed. That increase is the largest yearly increase in the last 15 years, according to the report. The 2014 figure also represents a nine-fold increase compared to the number of people killed by terrorism worldwide in 2000. However, Pitts used the statement -- though the years were incorrect on first blush -- to segue into his views on keeping the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay open, where about 90 terrorism suspects are held on the southern tip of Cuba. President Obama has long called for the closure of the prison and in February released a plan to transfer the remaining detainees to other facilities, including ones in the United States. Pitts’ Medium post focused largely on threats from terrorist groups Al-Qaeda and ISIS. But the Global Terrorism Index that was the basis of his initial claim reports that most deaths were by Boko Haram, an Islamic extremist group based in Nigeria. In other words, those attacks have little to do with the argument Pitts builds upon: Proof that the U.S. should keep the detention center at Guantanamo Bay open. Nigeria saw the largest increase in terrorist deaths ever recorded in 2014 with 7,512 fatalities, a 300 percent increase from the year prior. Boko Haram accounted for 6,644 deaths and ISIS was responsible for 6,073. According to the Global Terrorism Index that Pitts’ office cited, much of the terrorism didn’t directly affect the United States. Of the deaths worldwide in 2014, 78 percent were concentrated in Iraq, Nigeria, Afghanistan, Pakistan and Syria. However, of the countries classified in the report as "the West," the United States had the most deaths from terrorism in 2014, with 18 deaths and 19 attacks. Of those, all but five were committed by individuals and were, according to the report, "largely motivated by right wing extremism or white supremacists." Our ruling The initial claim made by Pitts says, "More people were killed by terrorists in 2015 than in any other year ever, after an 80 percent increase from 2014." While his office corrected those years to 2014 and 2013, respectively, to PolitiFact, the original Medium post was not updated as of publication time to reflect the correct years. Though the claim is accurate when the years are corrected, it leaves out context that the vast majority of the terrorism worldwide in 2014 did not directly affect the United States. Instead, it was largely concentrated in Africa and the Middle East. We rule the claim Mostly True.	None	Joe Pitts	None	None	None	2016-03-22T10:43:16	2016-02-25	['None']

pomt-01056	"America is No. 1 one in oil and gas."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/21/barack-obama/obama-america-no-1-producer-oil-gas/	The United States is on top of the world in terms of energy production, President Barack Obama said during his sixth State of the Union. "We believed we could reduce our dependence on foreign oil and protect our planet," he said during his Jan. 20 address. "And today, America is number one in oil and gas. America is number one in wind power. Every three weeks, we bring online as much solar power as we did in all of 2008." We decided to check out the data and see if in fact the United States is the world’s top oil and gas producer. As it turns out, the United States passed Saudi Arabia about two years ago in terms of oil production. And we’ve been the top producer of natural gas for more than two decades. The U.S. Energy Information Administration, which tracks global energy production and consumption statistics, generally uses total oil supply production as its most relevant statistic for assessing the world oil market. This statistic includes crude oil, natural gas liquids, condensates, other liquids, such as biofuels like ethanol, and refinery gain. By this measure, in the third quarter of 2014 -- which includes the most recent available data -- the United States produced 14.2 million barrels per day. The next-highest producer, Saudi Arabia, produced 11.7 million per day; and Russia produced 10.5 million per day. Together, that’s about 40 percent of total global production. If we whittle down that number further just to look at crude oil -- what typically comes to mind when we think of "oil production" -- with no other liquids, the United States is third behind Saudi Arabia and Russia. But when natural gas liquids are added into the mix, the United States takes the No. 1 spot again with 12.9 million barrels per day of crude oil and natural gas liquids. A note: Natural gas liquids -- included in the oil production count -- are different from natural gas. Natural gas liquids are derivatives of petroleum (like kerosene) that are found in the same rocks as a natural gas deposit. Natural gas is methane that comes from the ground as a gas. It’s the gas that comes out of a gas stove and heats buildings. The United States produces significantly more natural gas than Saudi Arabia and a bit more than Russia. According to the Energy Information Administration, United States energy production is about evenly split between petroleum and natural gas. Saudi Arabia, on the other hand, primarily produces petroleum. Here is a chart showing the breakdown: The United States and Russia are the top producers of natural gas -- with the United States producing 29.5 trillion cubic feet in 2012, and Russia producing 23 trillion. Oil production growth has contributed to the United States’ ability to produce more oil than it imports for the first time in about 20 years. The Energy Information Administration expects American production to continue to grow in 2015, despite recent lower crude oil prices. The majority of U.S. oil production growth is concentrated in four regions: Bakken, N.D.; Eagle Ford, Texas; the Niobrara region in the Upper Midwest states; and the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. North Dakota and Texas together comprise almost 50 percent of all crude oil production in the United States -- compared to 2010, when the two states combined produced just 26 percent of all U.S. crude oil production. In 2013, energy markets consultant group PIRA Energy published a report that said shale production is one of the driving forces behind the country’s production growth. Shale oil and gas are commonly associated with hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, which is the process of using water pressure to fracture a rock to release natural gas and oil. The United States is the world leader in shale gas production. There is at least one piece of context to keep in mind when looking at the United States’ oil production compared with Saudi Arabia, noted Leonardo Maugeri, an associate at Harvard University’s Geopolitics of Energy project. Saudi Arabia has a higher capacity than the United States to produce oil, but it chooses not to use it all -- so as not to inundate the global oil market. "In other words, if Saudi Arabia produced at full capacity -- as the U.S. does -- its production would be higher than the U.S.," Maugeri said. Our ruling Obama said "America is No. 1 one in oil and gas " The latest global oil and natural gas production statistics back up Obama’s claim. The United States has been the world’s largest oil producer since 2012, and the largest natural gas producer for years. We rate his statement True.

pomt-05954	The United States is no longer "top nation in the globe on infrastructure," having fallen to 15th.	true	/tennessee/statements/2012/jan/25/steve-cohen/steve-cohen-pushes-democratic-claim-us-has-fallen-/	U.S. Rep. Steve Cohen says the United States has neglected its roads and bridges, but in November argued that the nation had an opportunity to repair them by passing President Barack Obama's jobs bill. In a speech on the House floor, the Memphis Democrat said the U.S. was lagging behind other nations. "No longer is America the top nation in the globe on infrastructure; it’s the countries in Asia and other places. We’re 15th on the list of infrastructure," Cohen said. That jobs bill may be going nowhere, but President Obama, in Tuesday’s State of the Union speech, called for "a broader agenda to repair America’s infrastructure." He said that "so much of America needs to be rebuilt" and that it was time "to do some nation-building right here at home." We wondered: Is the United States really falling behind other countries when it comes to infrastructure? Cohen's office says the source of his information was the Building America’s Future Education Fund, which bills itself as a "bipartisan national infrastructure coalition" and lobbies for more governmental spending on infrastructure -- especially roads and bridges. Cohen accurately quotes from the group’s report entitled, "Falling Apart and Falling Behind," which attributes the ranking to the World Economic Forum, a Switzerland-based international organization funded by more than 1,000 companies that promotes interaction among nations and conducts research with a declared commitment to "improving the state of the world." Actually, Building America’s Future slightly overstates America’s infrastructure rating by the World Economic Forum -- it’s No. 16 among 139countries in the 2011-12 rankings, not No. 15. The United States was 15th last year, having slipped from first back in 2005. The Forum infrastructure ranking is based on nine measures ranging from the number of airline seats available (we’re No. 1!) to the number of mobile phones per 100 residents (we’re No. 83). So it's worth noting that the overall ranking goes well beyond the point of the congressman’s speech, namely the need to build or repair roads and bridges. Still, on road rankings, perhaps the most relevant to Cohen’s commentary, the United States is listed 20th, just below Cyprus and just above Bahrain, so it's even lower than the overall number. Infrastructure is one of 12 "pillars" the World Economic Forum uses in compiling a "Global Competitiveness Index." (The United States ranked fifth in the overall index, down from fourth in the previous year and first as recently as 2008.) Our ruling So Cohen is off by a notch in the current overall rankings, while for roads and bridges, the U.S. actually ranks slightly lower, providing more evidence for his point. That's close enough to earn a True.	None	Steve Cohen	None	None	None	2012-01-25T16:00:12	2011-11-03	['United_States']

pomt-01566	A flight from Atlanta to Houston was canceled due to a "terrorist dry run."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/11/facebook-posts/facebook-post-claims-us-flight-canceled-after-terr/	A first-hand account of a supposed "terrorist dry run" on an American airplane is making its way around Facebook, with this July 29 post garnering over 90,000 shares. The account, written by a man named Tedd Petruna, describes how 11 passengers "in full Muslim attire" on AirTran Flight 297 from Atlanta to Houston made such a ruckus that the flight was canceled. Petruna claims that one of the men called a stewardess an "infidel dog," that two of the men were showing "footage of a porno video they had taped the night before," and that all 11 men screamed at the flight crew in Arabic. Eventually, Petruna says, Transportation Security Administration agents searched the men’s bags, and that when they allowed them back on, so many passengers left the plane that the flight was canceled. "The terrorists wanted to see how the TSA would handle" them, Petruna wrote. Only Fox News reported that the flight was canceled, Petruna says, and even they covered up the real "threat." Spoiler alert: Petruna’s report is a hoax, and not a new one either. The plane in question flew Nov. 17, 2009. In this fact-check, we’ll explain this conspiracy theory’s origin, then debunk it again for good measure. Remember chain emails? We reached out to Dwayne Chassion, the man who posted Petruna’s report on Facebook verbatim as it appeared in 2009, but didn’t hear back. After we messaged him, Chassion deleted the post from his Facebook account. The day after Flight 297, Fox News published a brief article from the Associated Press noting that Flight 297 departed for Houston two and a half hours late. According to the AP, "a crew member asked a passenger to turn off his phone," the passenger didn’t, and then the pilot returned the plane to the gate and "asked (the passenger) to get off the plane." Apparently, the man didn’t speak English -- he and his group of 11 others were travelling with a translator -- and was looking at pictures on either his phone or a camera. The full group of 13 men got off the plane when the pilot returned to the gate, but, after some discussion with airport officials, the men were allowed back on the plane. The two and a half hour delay pushed the original flight crew past mandated limits on hours worked. So AirTran subbed in a new flight crew and the plane left for Houston without incident -- minus 12 original passengers who, apparently uncomfortable, opted for later flights. That’s marginally similar to Petruna’s account, but the flight was not canceled and there certainly were no Arabic curses or homemade pornographic film. Within a few days of Flight 297, Petruna’s email began circulating. Eventually, it reached the websites of conservative pundits Glenn Beck and Debbie Schlussel. When AirTran got wind of Petruna’s email, they issued a point-by-point refutation. Long story short, Petruna wasn’t even on the plane because his connecting flight was late. Petruna later admitted that he embellished the details, and that he intended the account only for "a few friends." None of the other passengers corroborated Petruna’s assertion that the flight was canceled. One said that the passenger was Muslim -- but another said that he was actually speaking Spanish. According to a chaplain who arrived late but got on the plane after it returned to the gate, a passenger said that "12 men of Middle Eastern appearance stood up and began dancing and singing in an Arabic dialect." But no other passenger corroborated that, either. Either way, Flight 297 got off the ground, and although it may have been a tense flight, Petruna’s narrative was bogus then, and it’s bogus now. Our ruling Petruna’s 2009 account about a "terrorist dry run" leading to a canceled flight is going viral on Facebook. According to Petruna, 11 Muslim men were so uncooperative with their flight attendants that Flight 297 from Atlanta to Houston was canceled. But the airline, other passengers from the flight, and the Associated Press all disagreed. Petruna, although originally scheduled for the flight, never boarded. In actuality, a man who may or may not have been of Muslim descent didn’t speak English well enough to understand the flight attendant’s instructions to turn off his phone. Petruna’s account is outdated and riddled with inaccuracies. This claim rates Pants on Fire.	None	Facebook posts	None	None	None	2014-09-11T16:15:43	2014-09-11	['Atlanta', 'Houston']
pomt-14642	"Almost all of the polls that have come out suggest that I am a much stronger candidate against the Republicans than is Hillary Clinton."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/26/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-he-polls-better-against-gop-ca/	In the runup to the Iowa caucus, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has repeatedly said he has a better chance of beating the eventual Republican nominee in the Nov. 8 general election than fellow Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. "Almost all of the polls that -- and polls are polls, they go up, they go down -- but almost all of the polls that have come out suggest that I am a much stronger candidate against the Republicans than is Hillary Clinton," he told voters during a Jan. 19 town hall meeting in Underwood, Iowa. We took a look at the various national surveys, as compiled by RealClearPolitics and PollingReport.com to see how that assertion stacks up against the data. The only recent national poll to look at the question at the time Sanders made his comment was completed Jan. 13 for NBC News and the Wall Street Journal. If Donald Trump is the Republican nominee, it found, Sanders beats Trump by 15 percentage points compared to a 10-point win for Clinton. That certainly supports Sanders' claim, but that poll didn't compare him to any other GOP candidates. To find another poll to properly compare Clinton's and Sanders' relative strengths, you have to go back to a Quinnipiac Poll completed Dec. 20. There, Sanders beats Trump by 13 points while Clinton defeats him by 7 points. However, in a matchup against Republican Marco Rubio, Sanders loses by three points and Clinton wins by just a single point. Against Ted Cruz, Sanders loses by a point and Clinton ties Cruz at 44 percent each. So Clinton is performing slightly better, but these results are largely within the margin of error of +/- 2.9 points. A third poll, taken during the same timeframe as Quinnipiac by Public Policy Polling, found that Sanders would lose to Trump (by two points), Rubio (by three points), Cruz (by one point) and Jeb Bush (by one point). Clinton, in contrast, would beat Bush (by five points), Trump (by three points) and Cruz (two points), but lose to Rubio (by one point). Both Democrats would tie with Republican Ben Carson. The margin of error was +/- 2.8 percentage points. So the Public Policy Polling survey doesn't support Sanders either. (You can see a chart of the varying matchups and point differences at the end of this fact-check.) When we asked the Sanders campaign about the claim, they submitted a consultant's memo from Jan. 8, 2016, that focuses on the Quinnipiac study and two other polls, a CNN/ORC International Poll from Dec. 17-21 and an Economist/YouGov poll from Dec. 18-21. Neither the CNN/ORC survey nor the Economist/YouGov poll test Sanders in a general election against a Republican. Instead, the memo argues that Sanders, if nominated, is more likely to win in November because he polls better than Clinton among independent voters, he's "viewed more favorably than any other presidential candidate of either party," and Clinton's support is slipping against the Republicans. (For the record, the Economist/YouGov poll found that Clinton's favorability score was just as high as Sanders, with both at 44 percent. Of the 2,000 respondents, 39 percent were not registered to vote.) Whether high favorability ratings directly translate into votes in a general election is an open question. Our ruling Sanders said, "Almost all of the polls that have come out suggest that I am a much stronger candidate against the Republicans than is Hillary Clinton." The NBC News/Wall Street Journal national poll released before Sanders' statement supports his claim for Trump, but it has no data against Cruz or Rubio. Earlier polls say he doesn't outperform Clinton at all against Cruz, Rubio or Bush, and the narrow races combined with the margins of error make his contention even more dubious. Beating Clinton in only two of eight hypothetical matchups is far from "almost all." The statement is not accurate, so we rate it False.

pomt-02360	President Barack Obama spent "$5 billion paying Ukrainians to riot and dismantle their democratically elected government."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/mar/19/facebook-posts/united-states-spent-5-billion-ukraine-anti-governm/	It’s a conspiracy with mainstream crossover: The United States bankrolled the bloody political uprising in Ukraine. We saw the claim pop up recently in a story on RT (the Russian-funded English language cable network), and found lots of talk about it on reddit, Facebook and other websites. The claims have the same basic structure. While President Barack Obama publicly said Ukrainians have the right to determine their own future, the U.S. government pumped $5 billion into the country to promote regime change. In a Facebook meme, someone put it this way: Obama "spends $5 billion paying Ukrainians to riot and dismantle their democratically elected government." So is there any truth to this claim? PunditFact dove in. The roots The claim is rooted in a December 2013 speech by Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland to the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation, a non-governmental agency that promotes democracy in the former Soviet republic. Nuland had returned days earlier from her third trip to Ukraine in five weeks to assess the protests over President Viktor Yanukovych’s policies to move away from the European Union, she said. She made clear the United States supported the protesters’ fight and spoke of how she met with Yanukovych, pressing him to end the pushback from Ukrainian security forces because it is "absolutely impermissible in a European state, in a democratic state." She described how American taxpayer money has supported Ukraine’s democratic development despite the country’s challenges. "Since Ukraine's independence in 1991, the United States has supported Ukrainians as they build democratic skills and institutions, as they promote civic participation and good governance, all of which are preconditions for Ukraine to achieve its European aspirations," she said. "We have invested over $5 billion to assist Ukraine in these and other goals that will ensure a secure and prosperous and democratic Ukraine." Her eight-minute speech (video) attracted little to no media attention. The truth We had a feeling that folks repeating the claim missed important context from Nuland’s speech. Wasn’t Nuland talking about money given since Ukraine broke away from the Soviet Union? The State Department said yes. "The insinuation that the United States incited the people of Ukraine to riot or rebel is patently false," said Nicole Thompson, a State Department spokeswoman. Since 1992, the government has spent about $5.1 billion to support democracy-building programs in Ukraine, Thompson said, with money flowing mostly from the Department of State via U.S. Agency for International Development, as well as the departments of Defense, Energy, Agriculture and others. The United States does this with hundreds of other countries. About $2.4 billion went to programs promoting peace and security, which could include military assistance, border security, human trafficking issues, international narcotics abatement and law enforcement interdiction, Thompson said. More money went to categories with the objectives of "governing justly and democratically" ($800 million), "investing in people" ($400 million), economic growth ($1.1 billion), and humanitarian assistance ($300 million). The descriptions are a bit vague, which could lead people to think the money was used for some clandestine purpose. But even if it that were so, the money in question was spent over more than 20 years. Yanukovych was elected in 2010. So any connection between the protests and the $5 billion is inaccurate. And Obama was elected in 2008, so any connection between $5 billion and Obama also is inaccurate. The challenge We attempted to drill down and verify the expenditures independently but found that a difficult task. That’s a byproduct of the United States’ foreign aid investments, which rival no other country (though supporters note the spending equals only 1 percent of all federal spending). The massive check-writing across dozens of agencies to non-governmental organizations to scores of countries and regions around the world is almost impossible to untangle. "As it stands, it is nearly impossible to find a figure," said Nicole Valentinuzzi, communications manager of Publish What You Fund, a group that pushes for aid transparency across the world. "These kinds of things would be easily verifiable if people were given timely information." The State Department created ForeignAssistance.gov to help taxpayers, journalists and others find out where the money is going, but the data is limited in the number of years available and not reported by all agencies. "The Foreign Assistance dashboard is not capturing this information in an up-to-date, current way," Valentinuzzi said, "so responding to a humanitarian crisis is a bit untraceable while it happens, which we argue makes it less effective, basically." That said, the United States is working on being more transparent. The site started under the Obama administration and is a "work in progress," Thompson said. Eight agencies, such as U.S. AID, Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Treasury Department, have begun posting planning and spending data to the site. Still, 14 agencies, including the departments of Agriculture, Energy, Transportation, and Health and Human Services, have not. From that website, we calculated the United States spent $456.4 million in Ukraine since 2009. Again, that’s an incomplete picture based on incomplete data reporting. Some examples? The United States spent about $20 million on Peace Corps programs in Ukraine over the past four years. It spent about $40 million through U.S. AID on health programs in the countries since 2010 -- fighting HIV/AIDs, malaria and providing for maternal and child health. The United States spent an additional $80 million or so working on projects related to weapons of mass destruction, according to ForeignAssistance.gov. Our ruling Contrary to claims, the United States did not spend $5 billion to incite the rebellion in Ukraine. That’s a distorted understanding of remarks given by a State Department official. She was referring to money spent on democracy-building programs in Ukraine since it broke off from the Soviet Union in 1991. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-07103	"As the Democrats finally maxed out their government spending credit card Monday, Kurt Schrader continued to stand with his party leaders in failing to offer any viable long-term solution."	false	/oregon/statements/2011/jun/22/national-republican-congressional-committee/kurt-schrader-fault-maxing-out-government-credit-c/	Rep. Kurt Schrader is neither drunken (as far as we know) nor is he a sailor. But that’s not the portrait the National Republican Congressional Committee paints of Schrader, the second-term Democrat from Oregon who is likely to face another tough campaign in 2012. The NRCC is in the business of electing Republicans and defeating people like Schrader. So it’s not surprising that on May 18 the organization sent out a news release accusing Schrader of spending federal tax dollars like a drunken sailor and blaming him for pushing government debt to the $14.3 trillion limit. "Kurt Schrader and his fellow Democrats went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out," the press release said. That’s a pretty exact, and if true, damning statement at a time when most voters are highly worried about the nation’s debt and not enamored with any politician who’s prone to go on "spending sprees.’’ So let’s take a look to determine if it stands up. Our government gets some of the cash it needs by borrowing from foreign governments and other investors. As happens when your bills come due and your current income cannot keep up, the United States now needs to borrow even more. To get the money, Congress first must approve a debt limit higher than the current one of $14.294 trillion. This is a lot like living on a credit card and asking the bank for a higher limit, an analogy that Republicans happen to like. In an attack used in some variation against Schrader and 58 other House Democrats, the NRCC also claimed that Schrader and his fellow Democrats "went on a spending spree and now their credit card is maxed out." But is it the fault of Schrader and House Democrats that the federal credit card has been maxed out? Not exactly. You might remember the tax cuts championed by congressional Republicans and former President George W. Bush, tax cuts that were extended in December for two years under Democratic President Barack Obama. While some economists say these were needed to give the economy a kick, they also meant less money came in from tax revenue. Before the most recent extension, the Congressional Research Service said that the Bush tax cuts, with a 10-year price tag of $1 trillion, played a substantial role in the nation’s annual deficits. Some will argue that tax cuts can actually pay for themselves by stimulating economic growth, but PolitiFact has previously found that the Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers say that tax cuts lead to revenues that are lower than they otherwise would have been – even if they spur some economic growth. Last year, the Congressional Budget Office said that extending all of them permanently, as many in the GOP would like, would cost $3.3 trillion over 10 years and increase deficits. Then there’s the recent economic downturn, which also played a role. And the nation is still engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, with billions of dollars flowing out to pay for them. These began during the Bush years and continue under Obama. Schrader wasn’t in Congress when the war started. He has voted both for and against funding since he was elected. Despite the intensity of the recent debate, altering the debt ceiling - almost always up - has been routine practice in Washington for generations. The ceiling reflects the real world. With ongoing wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, a deep recession and less revenue as a result of tax cuts enacted under former President George W. Bush, the gap between income and expenses has widened. "Since March 1962, Congress has enacted 74 separate measures that have altered the limit on federal debt," the Congressional Research Service said in a May report. The CRS is Congress’ non-partisan and independent analytical organization. "Most of these changes in the debt limit were, measured in percentage terms, small in comparison to changes adopted in wartime or during the Great Depression. Some recent increases in the debt limit, however, were large in dollar terms. For instance, in May 2003, the debt limit increased by $984 billion and in February 2010 the debt limit was increased by $1.9 trillion," the CRS report said. The case is even more difficult to make against Schrader since he is actively involved with the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrats, whose sole purpose in life is to restrain federal spending. In fact, Schrader chaired the group’s Fiscal Responsibility Task Force, which aims to restrain federal spending and reduce debt. In that capacity, Schrader helped write a budget proposal earlier this year that called for $100 billion less spending over the next 10 years. Schrader has repeatedly called for President Obama to use recommendations offered by the president’s National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. He also voted against extending the tax cuts enacted by former-President Bush and he has returned $180,000 in unused funds from his own congressional account. To say that Schrader ran up the credit card is a pithy political slogan, but it ignores all the other spending and borrowing that factored into the debt. Were the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the tax cuts the chief culprits? Democrats say yes. Conservatives disagree, saying that amounts to cherry picking and ignores all other spending. Before ruling, we’re compelled to point out that since 2001, Congress has voted to raise the debt ceiling ten times, according to the Congressional Research Service. Seven of those hikes were under Bush, three under Obama. Schrader, like most Democrats, has selectively voted to boost spending. But he’s also offered proposals calling for deep and specific cuts. The NRCC attack ignores both the facts and the basic history of spending decisions that predate Schrader’s arrival in Congress but which contribute to the fiscal reality that lawmakers and all Americans must face. Taken together, those oversights are substantial and the reason we rate this claim: False. Return to OregonLive to comment on this statement and ruling.

pomt-13699	Says Trump ties are made "in China, not Colorado. Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/29/hillary-clinton/dnc-hillary-clinton-slams-donald-trump-making-prod/	Donald Trump’s merchandise doesn’t show a commitment to making America great again, Hillary Clinton said in her keynote address on the last night of the Democratic National Convention. "He also talks a big game about putting America First," Clinton said. "Please explain to me what part of America First leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado. Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin. Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again. Well, he could start by actually making things in America again." Are all these Trump-brand products really made abroad? Let’s check it out. Claim: Trump neckties are made in China. We saw a "made in China" label on a Trump tie for sale on eBay, and here’s another one on Amazon. Many are listed as "imported," and we haven’t come across any that were definitely made in the United States. Claim: Trump suits are made in Mexico. At least one image of a Trump suit with a "made in Mexico" label has surfaced, and Trump has acknowledged he has made some of his clothing line there. We also found examples of Trump suits made in India and China. But we actually found quite a few for sale on Amazon that were made in the United States. Claim: Trump furniture is made in Turkey. The Trump Home by Dorya line – described in a press release as "inspired by the diverse locations and architecture of Trump properties around the globe" – is manufactured in Turkey. Claim: Trump picture frames are made in India. We could only find one Trump picture frame, and the Amazon page does not indicate where it was made. It lists the producer as IMAX, which is an Oklahoma-based company, though it does have facilities in India. But not all Trump products are made overseas. Some Trump products are made in the United States, including the candidate’s iconic "Make America Great Again" baseball cap, which is manufactured in California. We gave a Pants on Fire rating in October to a claim made by Twitter users that the hats were made in China. In a previous fact check, we found that some Trump-brand bedding, cologne, Trump Natural Spring Water and Trump Wine are also made in the United States. Our ruling Clinton says Trump ties are made "in China, not Colorado. Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan. Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio. Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin." We found examples of Trump ties made in China, suits in Mexico and furniture in Turkey. We did not find a clear example of a Trump picture frame made in India. It’s worth noting we also came across suits listed as made in the United States, as well as other Trump-brand products that Clinton did not name, including the "Make America Great Again" baseball caps.

pomt-04596	Says Barack Obama's comments indicate he "believes in redistribution" of wealth.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2012/sep/20/mitt-romney/romney-goes-tape-attack-obama/	Mitt Romney, seeking to regain his footing after a recent controversial audio recording of himself was unearthed earlier this week, used an old tape of Barack Obama to put the president on the defensive. "There’s a tape that came out just a couple of days ago where the president said, yes, he believes in redistribution," Romney, the Republican Party presidential nominee, said during a fundraiser Wednesday afternoon in Atlanta. Romney first talked about the recording Tuesday in a Fox News interview, saying Obama "likes" redistribution. Romney then said he believes in free enterprise, not redistribution of wealth. His running mate, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., also has pounced on the Obama audio on the campaign trail. We were curious to find out if the Romney campaign accurately reflected what Obama said and meant in the recording. Here’s the sentence in which Obama specifically spoke about redistribution: "I think the trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution – because I actually believe in redistribution, at least at a certain level to make sure that everybody's got a shot." Obama apparently made those remarks, according to a pro-Romney website, at Loyola University in Chicago on Oct. 19, 1998, when Obama was an Illinois state senator. Obama campaign officials said Romney’s discussion of the recording was the sign of a desperate campaign. "Fourteen years ago, then-Sen. Obama was making an argument for a more efficient, more effective government — specifically citing city government agencies that he didn’t think were working effectively," Obama campaign spokesman Ben LaBolt said, according to ABC News. "He believed then, and believes now, that there are steps we can take to promote opportunity and ensure that all Americans have a fair shot if they work hard. Unlike Gov. Romney, he doesn’t believe that if you’re a student who applies for a loan, you’re looking for a handout." We asked the Romney campaign Wednesday afternoon for any additional information they thought may be useful and may address any concerns that their candidate took Obama’s 1998 remarks out of context. Romney officials sent us a transcript of Obama’s remarks and link to the audio. In the Fox News interview, Romney gave his interpretation of what he believed Obama meant. "The president’s view is one of a larger government. There’s a tape that just came out today in which the president said that he likes redistribution," Romney said. For months, the Obama and Romney campaigns have dueled over their drastically different ideals of what role the federal government should play in America. Earlier this week, a secretly recorded audio of Romney went public in which he said at a Florida fundraiser in May that 47 percent of Americans will vote for Obama "no matter what" because they are dependent on government and feel that they are "victims." PolitiFact has fact-checked several of the claims in the Romney audio. Romney has since said his comments could have been more elegantly stated, but he stands by his larger point that a "government-centered nation" is not good for America. Romney and Republicans have consistently portrayed Obama as a president who wants to expand government and engage in class warfare because of his proposal to increase income taxes on those who make more than $250,000 a year. In 2008, GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin said Obama wanted to "spread the wealth" because of his tax policy and "experiment with socialism" as president. PolitiFact rated that claim a Pants on Fire. The 96-second audio indicates Obama was near the end of his remarks at Loyola. The audio begins with Obama talking about policy research for the working poor. He then spoke about battling the notion that government action is ineffective. "There has been a systematic propaganda campaign against the possibility of government action and its efficacy, and I think some of it has been deserved," Obama said. In the audio, Obama is critical of the Chicago Housing Authority and Chicago Public Schools, saying neither has been a good model of policymaking. The portion of the recording that the Romney campaign has seized upon ends with Obama discussing redistribution. But Obama said more, NBC News reports. NBC News found an additional clip of the recording. Here’s what Obama said: "I think the trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution because I actually believe in redistribution, at least at a certain level to make sure that everybody's got a shot. How do we pool resources at the same time as we decentralize delivery systems in ways that both foster competition, can work in the marketplace, and can foster innovation at the local level and can be tailored to particular communities." So Obama is also talking about ways to encourage competitiveness and innovation, themes Romney consistently extols on the campaign trail. Romney, though, may disagree with Obama’s definition of competitiveness and innovation. Finally, Obama has long advocated raising taxes on the wealthy in order to avoid cuts to social spending programs for the middle and lower classes. Polls show most Americans support increasing taxes on the wealthy. That’s a form of "redistribution," though Obama doesn’t call it that today. Also, the progressive income tax code itself, which both parties have supported in the past, could fairly be called "redistribution." It enshrines the idea that the rich pay a larger share of their income for government services that benefit everyone. Our ruling: To review, Romney said Obama "believes in redistribution." Romney said on Fox in discussing the 1998 audio that Obama shows he believes in "a larger government." Obama said in the recording that he believes in structuring "government systems that pool resources" to make sure everyone has a shot. Obama didn’t specifically talk about making government bigger in those remarks. Obama was even critical of some government agencies in Chicago in the clip. Obama also spoke about ways to foster competition and innovation. Obama spoke of redistribution in a way that government can create an even playing field for everyone and encourage competition. The clip of the 1998 audio that Romney referenced to criticize Obama doesn’t tell the complete story. We rate Romney’s claim as Mostly True.

pomt-07935	"Since taking office, President Obama has signed into law spending increases of nearly 25 percent for domestic government agencies, an 84 percent increase when you include the failed stimulus."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/jan/27/paul-ryan/us-rep-paul-ryan-says-obama-increased-spending-nea/	U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s response to President Barack Obama’s State of the Union speech called to mind their face-to-face -- but civil -- sparring in January 2010. Back then, when Obama attended a House Republican caucus meeting, Ryan told the president in a televised exchange: "The spending bills that you have signed into law, the domestic discretionary spending has been increased by 84 percent." Ryan, R-Wisconsin, is now chairman of the House Budget Committee. Delivering the GOP response to Obama’s address, Ryan first threw Obama a bone ("There's no doubt the president came into office facing a severe fiscal and economic situation."). Then he criticized Obama’s stimulus plan, saying it "not only failed to deliver on his promise to create jobs, but also plunged us even deeper into debt." We were interested in what he said next: "The facts are clear: Since taking office, President Obama has signed into law spending increases of nearly 25 percent for domestic government agencies, an 84 percent increase when you include the failed stimulus." NFL coaches talk about "cleaning up" mistakes before the next big game. It appears that’s what Ryan did here -- at least in part. In the wake of the Nov. 2, 2010 election, we gave Ryan a Barely True for repeating to reporters his assertion from Baltimore about an 84 percent increase in the past two years. Ryan was on the right track in pointing to the federal stimulus package as a huge driver in spending increases under Obama. But Ryan used fuzzy math to make the year-to-year increase appear much larger than it was. The spending figures for non-defense discretionary spending did show a 24 percent jump -- from $434 billion in 2008 to $537 billion in 2010. Discretionary spending goes for such things as education, health and housing -- in contrast to mandatory expenditures such as Social Security and Medicare "entitlements." To get to 84 percent, Ryan -- and other GOP leaders who have repeated the claim -- put the one-time stimulus spending in 2010, not 2009 when the measure passed. That’s what made it artificially higher, creating a rocket-like impression instead of the roller-coaster effect -- up a lot and then down some -- created by the stimulus package. Experts said it was OK to include stimulus, if it was disclosed, and as long as it appeared as a one-time blip and was properly accounted for. That brings us back to Ryan’s revised statement. The numbers show a 24 percent increase from 2008 to 2010. Ryan accurately rounded it up to "nearly 25 percent." And he added the reference to stimulus package, to give a fuller picture of what was behind the numbers. But he continued to use the 84 percent. That’s an inaccurate number. It is created only when the stimulus is assigned to the wrong year. We were unable to reach Ryan spokespeople for this item. So let’s tie this up. Ryan has added the 25 percent figure into his public assertions of spending increases under Obama. And though he adds context with the stimulus disclaimer, the 84 percent is ultimately dubious. It exists only because of the accounting trick used to produce it. Ryan argues he is trying to capture the effect of stimulus funding. A worthy goal, but his method overstates the effect. We rate this statement, a mix of truth and exaggeration, as Half True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2011-01-27T15:01:17	2011-01-25	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-14023	"Today, it is more difficult to enlist in the U.S. military than it is to enroll in college."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2016/jun/01/dale-kooyenga/its-easier-get-college-military/	So, if three out of every four young adults are not eligible for the military, but two out of every three high school graduates go onto college, what does that say? To Wisconsin state Rep. Dale Kooyenga, a military intelligence officer in the Army Reserves and a veteran of the Iraq War, it says this: "Today, it is more difficult to enlist in the United States military than it is to enroll in college." That’s a broad claim from Kooyenga, a suburban Milwaukee Republican who made the statement in his April 1, 2016 constituent newsletter. He was asserting that "if we are going to continue to be the world’s military leader, we must also become a leader in education." Kooyenga seems to have a compelling talking point. But, as defense manpower specialist Beth Asch told us, it’s also "a mashup of a lot of ideas in one sentence." Post-high school Both the military and college are post-high school pursuits that require a high school diploma. But the similarities more or less end there. The military is looking for soldiers; colleges are looking for students. The minimum requirements to get into the military are pretty standard, even if they vary somewhat by branch. But the entrance requirements to get into Harvard are much different than those for getting into a community college. The military will pay you; but most students need to pay for college. So, in terms of Kooyenga’s claim: More difficult for whom? It’s more difficult for an overweight person with good grades to get into the military; but it’s more difficult for a fit person with bad grades to get into college. All that being said, Kooyenga does have some numbers on his side. The statistics Asch, an economist with the RAND Corp. think tank, said statistics Kooyenga cited to us to back his claim are generally on target. Military: Defense Department estimates dating back to at least 2009 say roughly 75 percent of Americans ages 17 to 24 would not qualify to enlist in the military. One reason is being overweight. Indeed, when first lady Michelle Obama said in 2011 that more than one-quarter of America’s young adults are too fat to serve in the U.S. military, PolitiFact Georgia rated her claim True. Other common reasons for being barred from the military, besides lacking a high school diploma: Conviction of a felony or serious misdemeanor; prior drug or alcohol abuse; and current prescription-drug use for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). College: Federal statistics, including one Kooyenga cited, show that roughly 66 percent of people who graduate from high school go onto college. (For 2015 high school graduates, 69 percent had enrolled in colleges or universities by October 2015, according to a federal report.) But, the two sets of figures reinforce the point that, while Kooyenga’s claim was broad, it really comes down to individual characteristics as to whether it’s more difficult for a person to get into the military versus college. Our rating Kooyenga said: "Today, it is more difficult to enlist in the U.S. military than it is to enroll in college." There isn’t definitive evidence to prove the claim, given that it mixes apples and oranges: The military and college are entirely different pursuits with different sets of minimum standards for getting in, and among colleges, the entrance requirements vary widely. At the same time, there are credible estimates saying that roughly 75 percent of young adults in America wouldn’t be eligible to enlist if they tried, while roughly two out of three high school graduates go on to a two- or four-year college. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.	None	Dale Kooyenga	None	None	None	2016-06-01T05:00:00	2016-04-01	['United_States']
pomt-07917	Says government is a barrier to innovation and development.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/31/paul-broun/rep-paul-broun-says-innovation-would-flower-if-gov/	Rep. Paul Broun, R-Ga., spent the State of the Union address sending a fusillade of tweets critical of President Barack Obama to his 3,000-odd followers. One of them in particular caught our attention. "If the govt would get out of the way, we could have innovation and development," Broun tweeted. (Since civility was a major issue surrounding the address, we should note that Broun didn’t tweet from the chamber while Obama was speaking. A spokeswoman told Roll Call that he watched the speech from his Capitol Hill office.) Broun’s office didn’t get back to us to elaborate on the substance of his tweet, but it is based on the assumption that government stands in the way of innovation and development. We’ve long heard complaints from conservatives like Broun that business is being stifled by over-regulation. Even Obama got into the act during the run-up to his address, issuing an executive order that would, as he described it in an op-ed, help to "root out regulations that conflict, that are not worth the cost or that are just plain dumb." But even if you concede that some deregulation is desirable, we wondered whether Broun was right that government, as a whole, is an impediment to innovation and development. So we looked at statistics and spoke to experts in the field. First, the statistics. According to the National Science Foundation, business did account for 67 percent of research-and-development expenditures in 2008. The federal government spent 25 percent, and universities and other nonprofits spent about 3 percent each. Industry dollars are especially important in applied research and the development of technologies for the market. However, the federal government shoulders the bulk of the burden in one crucial area of research -- basic research. This is the kind of fundamental scientific and medical research that has no immediate payoff. According to NSF, the federal government funds 57 percent of basic research, compared to less than 18 percent for business, 15 percent for colleges and universities and 11 percent for nonprofits. And business only funds about 6 percent of university-based scientific research -- one-tenth the share paid for by the federal government -- so a retreat by government could have wide collateral damage to university research. The government has been a major scientific funder for more than half a century. If you add up all the direct research spending in the U.S. since 1953, the federal government has poured in more than $3 trillion. Business has spent an additional $4.5 trillion over that period. (For a quarter century, government expenditures on research exceeded those by industry, but around 1980, the pattern reversed.) Government also helps support research in other ways. Since 1981, the federal government has given companies a tax break for research and experimentation, which has saved companies about $5 billion per year in recent years. Federal taxpayers fund the National Institute of Standards and Technology to the tune of almost $1 billion a year; among other things, NIST sets technical standards so that industry can work more efficiently. And the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office provides archived and ongoing patent information that private companies can access. And none of this counts the larger, but harder to quantify, investments by federal, state and local governments in elementary and higher education and infrastructure, all of which help set the stage for scientific innovation. When we showed Broun’s tweet to several historians, they said his view is, at best, incomplete. "Yes, the U.S. has the most dynamic and entrepreneurial economy in the world because it has less regulation and less top-down planning and micromanagement than other developed nations," said Margaret O'Mara, a historian at the University of Washington. "But the high-tech revolution since 1950, and the United States' central role in it, was the result of unprecedented government investment in science and engineering. The critical thing that government does -- and that private-sector research can't do -- is to provide the start-up capital for innovations that do not yet have a commercial market." The funding statistics cited earlier underscore this point. Businesses are much more eager to spend their research dollars on projects that have immediate prospects of earning money. "Private industry by and large doesn’t do (basic research) because it’s primarily interested in research that has a high likelihood of practical payoff," said Daniel Kevles, a historian of science at Yale Law School. Yet the experts we spoke to said that the biggest conceptual leaps have occurred at the level of basic research, where government is the primary funder, rather than the later stages of refinement, where businesses shoulder most of the cost. In addition, federal research typically gets made public, where it can be used by industry, whereas industry-funded research is often kept for the private use of its sponsor. The Internet is a good example of a technological innovation that was birthed by the federal government, specifically the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, said O’Mara, author of Cities of Knowledge: Cold War Science and the Search for the Next Silicon Valley. In 1973, DARPA began to research ways to link geographically scattered computers over a network, eventually coming up with widely used, standardized protocols for information sharing. In 1986, NSF established its own network which has become a major backbone of today’s Internet. "If we had left it to Lotus and IBM, we would have a couple of tiny, proprietary and fairly useless systems out there," added Diana Hicks, a science policy expert who chairs the School of Public Policy at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Other areas that experienced breakthroughs due to federal support include biotechnology, genomics, nanotechnology, nuclear physics, solid-state physics, organic chemistry and mathematics, said Paul A. David, an emeritus professor of economics at Stanford University. Federally funded discoveries "have become the foundation for whole domains of research from which new industries have arisen," David said. So while "the key to a vibrant entrepreneurial economy is having the government ‘get out of the way,’" O’Mara said, "that can only happen after there has been investment on a huge scale and that does not necessarily have an immediate commercial application. That's something that only the national government can provide." Broun could hardly get into the details of his science policy preferences in a 140-character tweet, and it's possible he didn't mean that he wanted government to get out of scientific research entirely. But we still feel it’s fair to take his comment to task. For starters, it was not an isolated comment -- the tweet we’re looking at here was just one of several he sent during the State of the Union that addressed the same theme, including "Entrepreneurship is great -- let's not kill it with taxes and regulations" and "Obama's policies kill free-enterprise." More broadly, portraying business as good and government as bad has been a consistent Republican talking point. But to base a tweet on the assumption that the federal government is bad for innovation and development ignores that the federal government -- through its direct research spending, its tax credits and its indirect investments that support technological research -- plays a crucial role in pushing it forward, and one that is unlikely to be ever picked up by the private sector alone. So we rate the claim that the government is a barrier to innovation and development False.	None	Paul Broun	None	None	None	2011-01-31T17:38:30	2011-01-25	['None']

pomt-05131	Women "earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/jun/24/david-cicilline/us-rep-david-cicilline-says-women-earn-only-77-per/	Some "facts" are repeated so often they become accepted wisdom. One of them, involving the gap between pay for women and men, was offered up by U.S. Rep. David Cicilline in a news release supporting the Paycheck Fairness Act, which failed a test vote in the House on June 5. "Nearly a century since suffrage was achieved, women continue to lag behind men in terms of compensation in the workplace," Cicilline said. "It is unacceptable that women continue to earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position. In many families, women have grown increasingly responsible for household income, and we must work to ensure that their pay keeps pace with their participation in the job market." The 77-cent figure has been repeated a lot by politicians and news organizations. President Obama has cited it. We saw it in a Cicilline fundraising letter after the GOP blocked the paycheck bill. It was the subject of an NBC "Meet The Press" exchange in which liberal commentator Rachel Maddow quoted the figure and Republican political strategist Alex Castellanos said the statistic was misleading. "For example, men work an average of 44 hours a week. Women work 41 hours a week. Men go into professions like engineering, science and math that earn more. Women want more flexibility," Castellano said amid a lot of overtalk. If the wage difference were so great, said Castellano, "every greedy businessman in America would hire only women, save 25 percent and be hugely profitable." An issue of discrimination The underlying issue here is discrimination and the question is whether the pay is truly different for men and women doing the same job. Because Cicilline said women earned only 77 cents for every dollar that men earned "in the same position," we decided to focus on his statement. When we asked Cicilline's office about the congressman's comment, spokesman Richard Luchette sent us to the usual source: a 2011 Census report showing the 77-percent level of female earnings to male earnings from 1960 to 2010. The data, in Figure 12 of the report, apply to full-time, year-round workers more than 14 years old. (The 77-percent number has been increasingly slowly, up from 60 percent during the 1960s and 1970s.) But that's not a job-by-job comparison. Luchette said Cicilline's statement is accurate because when he referred to "in the same position," the congressman meant "to refer to men and women who were in the same position in the labor force [full-time, year-round employees]." We believe that when someone says they are paid less "in the same position," most people would understand that to be a job-by-job comparison. That's the standard we will use in this fact check. There are different ways to measure gender differences and each has its drawbacks. For example, the census looked at annual salary, but that includes bonuses and other compensation that are more likely to boost the pay of people in higher-paying brackets. It also includes self-employed but fails to account for professions such as teaching, where the full-time jobs don't last for a full year. There are other -- and perhaps better -- ways to measure the gap. For example, among people with full-time jobs, men were more likely to work longer hours than women, which would make their annual income look larger than women's. If you look at weekly pay among full-time workers, women age 16 and older are paid 81 cents for every dollar men earned in 2010, according to Table 1 of a July 2011 report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. If you look at hourly pay for all workers (Table 9), women earned 86 cents for every dollar men earned that year. The amount rose to 95 cents if you looked at women who had never married, suggesting that marriage may be a factor. The rate was 97 cents among female college graduates, compared to male college graduates. Still, that's a gap. Perhaps the most revealing part of the report is Table 5, which looks at weekly earnings by the number of hours men and women work. Overall, women age 16 and older earned 75 cents in 2010 for every dollar men earned. But that hides some surprising numbers. If you look at part-time work (less than 35 hours), women earned $1.04 cents for every dollar men earned. Women who worked 35 to 39 hours earned nearly $1.13 cents for each dollar earned by their male counterparts. But as soon as the number of hours rose to 40 hours, women's earnings dropped to about 87 cents per dollar. By the job But that's still not the type of job-by-job comparison we believe Cicilline was talking about. The Bureau of Labor Statistics tried to do that, too. Table 2 of the report compared the weekly earnings for men and women -- all employed full time -- for 501 occupations. However, for nearly 8 out of 10 of those jobs, the analysts didn't have enough data on male workers or female workers to make a reliable comparison. Among the 111 categories for which a comparison was possible, women in 45 jobs were paid less than 80 cents on the dollar and women in 35 positions were paid 80 to 90 cents for every dollar paid to men doing same task. Only in 31 of the categories did women earn at least 90 cents for every dollar that the men earned. (Women were paid more in only four jobs. Pay rates for women were $1.05 for every dollar earned by men among people who worked as stock clerks and order fillers. The rates were $1.10 among female bill and account collectors, $1.12 for food preparation and serving workers, and $1.05 among social service counselors.) Even in professions where women have predominated, men made more, according to the report. Female elementary and middle school teachers earned 91 cents on the dollar compared to men. Female registered nurses made less than 87 cents. The Institute for Women's Policy Research has done a more-exhaustive evaluation of the database and concluded that women earned less in the most common, highest paying and lowest paying occupations. But, again, the data are limited. Even those numbers may be overestimating the gap. Three years ago, the U.S. Department of Labor released the results of a study by CONSAD Research Corp. that it had commissioned because, according to the preface by Charles E. James Sr., a deputy assistant secretary, "the raw wage gap continues to be used in misleading ways to advance public policy agendas without fully explaining the reasons behind the gap." Once adjusted for the fact that women are more likely to work part-time (where the pay for everyone tends to be lower), leave the labor force for children or elder care, and gravitate toward "family friendly" occupations where compensation is more likely to be in the form of health insurance or other fringe benefits, the gap shrinks to between 93 cents and 95 cents on the dollar, the report said. "The raw wage gap should not be used as the basis to justify corrective action," said James. "Indeed, there may be nothing to correct. The differences in raw wages may be almost entirely the result of the individual choices being made by both male and female workers." The report was released in January, 2009. Obviously, that hasn't stopped the debate. Our ruling David Cicilline said women "earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men in the same position." His spokesman said that was only a comparison among full-time, year-round workers. But we believe the average person would read his statement as a comparison of male and female workers in the same job, an indication that wage discrimination exists. But the source of that 77-cent figure is not based on a job-by-job assessment. It's an across-the-workforce number that fails to take into a host of factors that could skew the amount. All the data we examined showed pay gaps for women from as low as 58 cents to as high as $1.12 for every dollar earned by men. And when you look at weekly earnings among wage and salary workers who work less than 40 hours a week, women earn more than men. In citing the 77-cent figure, Cicilline ignores conflicting estimates suggesting that the gender gap is narrower or, perhaps, nonexistent when lifestyle choices are taken into account. He also skirts a key problem: for most occupations, there is not enough good data to make the kind of comparison he is talking about. In other words, his statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression: our definition of Mostly False.

Connie) Mack said. "You have to put family and friends above political ambitions, and that is what I have done." —March 25, 2011, Fort Myers News-Press "Connie Mack is running for the U.S. Senate. ...," said David James, a senior adviser. —Oct. 26, 2011, Miami Herald In March 2011, U.S. Rep. Connie Mack said he would make a major announcement on the Lee County Courthouse steps. It was the spot where his father, Connie Mack III, had announced a Senate run in 1987. Some assumed the Fort Myers Republican would enter the 2012 race to face Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson. Instead, he said his family would come first. He would seek re-election to his House seat rather than run for U.S. Senate. "I've got two small children and it’s hard enough to get to spend a lot of good quality time now. I have a wife. They are all very important to me and at the end of the day family has to be No. 1," Mack told the St. Petersburg Times. In July, when his friend state Senate President Mike Haridopolos dropped out of the Republican race for Nelson's seat, the question came up again. Mack had been seen in Washington, D.C., meeting with a political strategist. Might he be planning to step into the Senate contest? He told St. Petersburg Times reporter Alex Leary he was focused on his current job. "So you're ruling it out?" Leary asked. His reply: "Yeah." In August, he spoke to Lee County Women Republicans. He said he kept hearing his name mentioned as a candidate, the Fort Myers News-Press reported. "No, I'm not running for Senate," he said. But on Oct. 26, political reporters scrambled on reports he might be joining the race, after all. "He's getting in the race," adviser David James told the St. Petersburg Times. "Making calls, assembling a team. He will have more to say in an announcement in weeks to come." "Connie Mack is running for the U.S. Senate," James told the Miami Herald. 'He is making calls. He is assembling a team. And he will have more to announce about the run in the weeks ahead." "I can confirm that he is getting in," he told the News-Press. Mack has yet to make an official announcement. But an adviser speaking for him says he'll be running for the seat that less than a year ago he declared he wouldn't pursue for the sake of his "two small children."

pomt-13958	Last year, "244 suspected terrorists walked into gun shops and attempted to purchase a firearm; 223 were able to get the firearm."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/15/charles-schumer/charles-schumer-terror-watch-list-buy-guns-got-the/	The mass shooting in Orlando, Fla., June 12 reopened the debate over who should access to guns, with Democrats calling for stricter controls. During a June 14 news conference in Washington, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said most people suspected of terrorism in the United States haven't haven't found it difficult to purchase a weapon. "Last year, 244 people on the terror watch list tried to purchase guns; 244 suspected terrorists walked into gun shops and attempted to purchase a firearm; 223 were able to get the firearm. Only 21 went empty-handed," Schumer said. "Ninety-one percent of suspected terrorists, when they sought to purchase a gun, last year were successful, according to GAO." The GAO is the U.S. Government Accountability Office. First, some background on these "suspected terrorists." The FBI's Terrorist Screening Center maintains a list of people "known or reasonably suspected of being involved in terrorist activity." This list is secret but it's believed to have around 700,000 names collected by U.S. and global agencies. It's estimated that 10,000 of those names are Americans and the rest are foreigners. We looked at this issue in December when we examined U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy's tweet that "91 percent of suspected terrorists who attempted to buy guns in America walked away with the weapon they wanted." We rated Murphy's statement Mostly True. (Murphy, who is running in Florida's Democratic primary for U.S. Senate in 2016, issued the tweet after Republicans repeatedly blocked a bill that would keep people on the FBI list from buying guns.) Murphy was referencing a GAO report from March 2015. But Schumer's statement focused on the entire year of 2015. So we found the updated report. Issued March 7, 2016, it found — as Schumer reported — that only 21 of the 244 transactions attempted by people on the terrorist watch list at a licensed firearms shop were blocked. In 223 cases, the customers got their weapons. But there are important omissions in these numbers. So we don't know that 244 people on the list attempted to buy guns. We know that people on the list attempted to buy guns 244 times. On the flip side, the number of people on the watch list who legally purchased weapons may be far higher because the tally doesn't include transactions made at gun shows, where federal background checks aren’t conducted. Finally, there have been questions about the accuracy of the watchlist itself. A 2009 U.S. Justice Department audit showed that 35 percent of the people on the list were "associated with FBI cases that did not contain current international terrorist or domestic terrorism designations" and should have been removed from the list. There also are multiple entries for slight variations of the same name, which means people with the same name as a person on the watch list were stopped at airports, a problem that experts say has largely been resolved. Our ruling Schumer said that in 2015, "244 suspected terrorists walked into gun shops and attempted to purchase a firearm; 223 were able to get the firearm" according to the GAO report. He correctly notes that this is gun shop data from the GAO, but he is wrong to suggest that the report is a tally of the number of suspected terrorists trying to make a firearm purchase. As the report makes clear, it's the number of attempted transactions, some of which might have been done by the same individual. The statement is accurate but it needs clarification and additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/47d79ce0-3137-4146-834d-1d858403e397	None	Charles Schumer	None	None	None	2016-06-15T16:03:48	2016-06-14	['None']

pomt-03719	Says a gun bill before the Senate "is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/16/Arizona-Citizens-Defense-League/gun-rights-group-says-senate-bill-proposes-univers/	Just what’s in that new gun bill under debate in the Senate? Opponents would love to tell you all about it. "Stop Federal Universal Firearms Registration!" says the subject line of an email from an Arizona group this week. The message urges readers to contact their senators, warning: "In reality S. 649 is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners." The bill, known as the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013, would make all gun sales subject to the nation’s background check laws, with limited exceptions. Does it propose universal firearm registration? Background checks and registries We read the bill, and consulted experts, including legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, attorneys who helped represent security guard Dick Heller in his successful Supreme Court challenge to D.C.’s handgun ban, and the spokesperson for the Arizona Citizens Defense League. The bill would require "a background check for every firearm sale" — or transfer of ownership — with a few exceptions, such as for certain family members. Right now, federal background checks are only required for sales through licensed gun dealers. Here’s how background checks work. The FBI maintains the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. When you buy a gun from a federally licensed dealer, you fill out a form with personally identifying information. The dealer uses the NICS to match that information with various records to make sure you’re not, for example, a felon who’s not allowed to own a weapon. It’s a computerized process that’s only supposed to take about 30 seconds, but in the case of an unclear match, can take up to three days. If you’re cleared to purchase a gun, the government is required to destroy all identifying information about you before the next business day. Instead, the dealer is required to store the form. That’s right: Federal law requires destruction of records and bans creation of a federal gun registry. Does S. 649, sponsored by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., change that? Several attorneys we spoke to said no, it didn’t — it leaves those provisions in place. More people would be subject to background checks, but a federal database of that information would remain as illegal as ever. But Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, says the language of the bill leaves a door open for a new kind of record of sales between private sellers — as opposed to sales by federally licensed gun dealers — a record that may not be subject to the registry ban. "We have a real fear with this particular legislative language that this would result in new records being created," he said. He points to a legal phrase in the bill — "notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter" — as perhaps allowing creation and, later, collection of those records, even though existing law rules out "a system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions." So, even if there’s no intent to create such a loophole in the registry ban, the law doesn’t explicitly rule it out, he argues. Call it the possibility of a partial registry. "I don't think it's a crazy idea to say that if the records exist, there would be a push to use them for other things," Calabrese said. He contrasts the bill’s vague language with an amendment proposed by Sens. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., that would explicitly bar any such registry and adds the possibility of up to 15 years in prison for violators. But even if the federal government created a new type of record for gun sales between private sellers — and tracked them — that wouldn’t be "universal registration of all firearms and their owners," as suggested by the Arizona group’s email message. "There are at least 300 million guns in private ownership in America today, and I am not aware of any provision of S. 649 that would require the registration of those guns or assist the federal government in determining precisely who owns them," said Clark Neily, who was co-counsel to Dick Heller in District of Columbia vs. Heller. (Still, he said, mentioning the ACLU’s worry, the Arizona email "touches upon a genuine concern.") So what does the Arizona Citizens Defense League say about its claim that the bill "is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners"? Essentially, that the government will violate its own rules against keeping background check records. "This is where background knowledge of the issue is so important, and goes WAY beyond what is written in statute," said Charles Heller, a radio host and spokesperson for the Arizona Citizens Defense League. (He’s no relation to Dick Heller.) He says the FBI’s NICS system could illegally store results of all background checks. "This is simply a method to herd all transfers to being ‘on record,’ for later confiscation," he said. But the email message didn’t say the law would make it easier for the federal government to create an illegal gun registry. It said: "The true subject of S. 649 is the requirement to report all firearms transfers to the federal government via ‘universal background checks.’ In reality S. 649 is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners. As history has repeatedly shown us, and is currently being demonstrated in New York, registration is the prelude to confiscation." That’s simply not what the bill proposes. Robert Levy, the chairman of the board of directors of the libertarian Cato Institute, was in his own words, "a vigorous advocate for the right to possess firearms for self-defense" as co-counsel to Dick Heller in District of Columbia vs. Heller. He acknowledges the concern that expanding background checks creates a data trail that Americans must trust is being destroyed in a timely way by the federal government. Still, he says, "it's incorrect to assert that S. 649 is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners." Our ruling An email circulated to Arizona residents claims a bill before the Senate "is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners." The bill expands background checks to most gun transfers. But federal rules forbid the government from keeping a record of successful background checks for more than a day. The ACLU argues it’s possible the bill creates a new type of record for some sales that may not be subject to the ban, but that’s not the same thing as "universal registration of all firearms and their owners."

pomt-11015	"Chicago is experiencing right now the highest employment since 1950."	false	/illinois/statements/2018/jul/09/rahm-emanuel/emanuel-wrong-again-chicago-jobs/	Chicago’s unemployment rate is at its lowest point since the run-up to the Great Recession. And as of this spring, fewer city residents were jobless than at any other time in at least three decades. So there’s good news on the jobs front that Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel could reasonably tout. Instead, he is now clinging to a variation of a boast we rated as False when we first heard him utter it in January. Back then, he declared Chicago in 2017 enjoyed the "highest employment in the private sector in the history of the city." His revised variation narrows the comparison by more than a century and no longer explicitly confines it to workers in the private sector. "Chicago is experiencing right now the highest employment since 1950," Emanuel declared recently during a public television interview on WTTW’s "Chicago Tonight" program. A few minutes later in the interview, he repeated the point to underscore how attractive the city has become to employers. Is Emanuel now on more solid ground with his amended jobs claim than when we checked him early this year? We decided to take a second look. A numbers game Emanuel didn’t explain the basis for his new claim. We sought clarification from a mayoral spokesman, but he did not provide it. But, in a nutshell, the answer to our question is no. State and federal headcounters conduct different jobs tallies, but none render numbers that match the superlatives uttered by the mayor either now or in January. Underlying our skepticism of Emanuel’s initial claim was an obvious demographic reality: Chicago’s population has been shrinking for decades and, at 2.7 million residents, is 900,000 fewer than its 1950 peak recorded by the Census. Early this year, an Emanuel spokesman said the mayor’s numbers came from an annual report from the Illinois Department of Employment Security. That report does not tally jobs held by Chicago residents, but rather private-sector jobs located in the city held by Chicagoans and suburbanites alike. For 2017, that report showed 1.18 million private-sector jobs in the city, the highest number reported by the state since 1990 when it recorded 1.2 million private-sector jobs for Chicago. But the report series dates back to the late 1950s, and for most years prior to 1990, the city’s private-sector jobs count far exceeded its 2017 tally. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com It is also important to note that state officials say their private-sector jobs report has not been updated since Emanuel spoke last January, so nothing has changed in the intervening months that could make his false claim true based on state figures. Of course, Emanuel did not limit his WTTW comments to private-sector jobs. But his argument would fall just as flat if he meant to refer to the broader measure of all jobs held by Chicagoans—whether inside city limits or not. For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics pegged Chicago’s preliminary employment numbers for May, the most recent available, at 1,286,424. That is up more than 76,000 from May 2010 during the depth of the Great Recession. But in 2000, BLS numbers for Chicago employment exceeded today’s count by more than 32,000; in 1989 they were more than 60,000 higher; in 1984 more than 103,000 higher; and in 1976 nearly 215,000 greater. Our ruling Emanuel said the city is experiencing its "highest employment since 1950," a variation of a claim he made in January about Chicago’s private-sector employment hitting the highest level in city history. But Chicago has a much smaller population these days than it did in the post-war era, so it stands to reason that jobs numbers would shrink over the decades as well. And they have. Still, the city’s employment picture these days is indisputably brighter than it was just a few years ago. Preliminary federal figures for May show city jobless numbers at 48,602, down from nearly 170,000 in 2010. And the state’s private-sector jobs report, which the mayor’s office gestured to last time around, shows improvement as well—even if it doesn’t match the mayor’s rhetoric. Yet Emanuel continues to dwell on claims of job benchmarks that don’t exist instead of the ones that do. He was wrong the first time we checked him and he is wrong again now.

pomt-14198	Says it’s "absurd" to say there’s enough data to establish a link between playing football and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2016/apr/22/jerry-jones/pants-fire-jerry-jones-says-absurd-firmly-link-foo/	The owner of America’s Team says science hasn’t cemented a link between playing football and chronic traumatic brain injury. Jerry Jones got into the tender topic on March 22, 2016, during the NFL’s annual meeting in Boca Raton, Florida, Dallas Cowboys spokesman Rich Dalrymple told us by email. We’d reached out to Dalrymple after seeing a March 23, 2016, news story in The Washington Post quoting Jones saying he’s not convinced medical and scientific research have established a link between football and brain disease. According to the Post, Jones was asked to clarify whether there is, in his view, enough data to establish such a link. "No, that’s absurd," Jones told reporters. "There’s no data that in any way creates a knowledge. There’s no way that you could have made a comment that there is an association and some type of assertion. In most things, you have to back it up by studies. And in this particular case, we all know how medicine is. Medicine is evolving." Dalrymple emailed us a partial transcript indicating Jones was responding to a question about if data shows an established link between football and Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy, a specific progressive degenerative disease of the brain: REPORTER: "No data, in your mind, to have a relationship between CTE and playing football?" JONES: "No, that's absurd. There's no data that in any way creates knowledge. There's no way that you can have made a comment that there's an association or some type of assertion." Contrasting NFL comments We asked Dalrymple how Jones reached that conclusion. Dalrymple said Jones hadn’t said then and Dalrymple didn’t think there would be follow-up. What Jones said in Florida lined up with a February 2016 response by Dr. Mitch Berger, who leads the NFL’s subcommittee on former players and long-term effects of brain and spine injury. At the time, Berger was asked by Bruce Arthur, a Toronto Star columnist, if he believes the link between football and CTE had been established. He said, "No." But the next month, at a March 14, 2016, roundtable discussion held by the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, Rep. Jan. Schakowsky, D-Ill., asked Jeff Miller, the NFL’s senior vice president for health and safety, if the link between football and neurodegenerative diseases such as CTE has been established "The answer to that question is certainly yes," Miller replied. An ESPN recap characterized that response as "the first time a senior league official had conceded football's connection to the devastating brain disease." Boston University leads research So, has science established a link between football and CTE? It seems so. For instance, it’s been three years since the publication of "League of Denial," the book by ESPN reporters Mark Fainaru-Wada and Steve Fainaru that walked through research signaling that players who take a pounding on the gridiron--much like boxers, as established decades before--risk brain damage. According to the book, the Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy at the Boston University School of Medicine, home to neuropathologist Ann McKee, had quickly grown to be recognized as the nation’s leading authority of football-related brain effects--including CTE. The center, which says it collaborates with other institutions, partners and academic researchers to "expand our understanding of CTE," says on its website: "CTE has been known to affect boxers since the 1920s. However, recent reports have been published of neuropathologically confirmed CTE in retired professional football players and other athletes who have a history of repetitive brain trauma. "This trauma triggers progressive degeneration of the brain tissue, including the build-up of an abnormal protein called tau," the center says. "These changes in the brain can begin months, years, or even decades after the last brain trauma or end of active athletic involvement. The brain degeneration is associated with memory loss, confusion, impaired judgment, impulse control problems, aggression, depression, and, eventually, progressive dementia." McKee said at a press conference before the Super Bowl in 2009 (seven-plus years ago): "I have never seen this disease in the general population, only in these athletes. It’s a crisis, and anyone who doesn’t recognize the severity of the problem is in tremendous denial." More recently, a March 16, 2016, ESPN news story by the "League of Denial" authors said McKee has diagnosed 176 CTE cases in five years, including 90 of 94 former NFL players whose brains were examined; 45 out of 55 college players; and six out of 26 high school players. "It's overwhelming that this is occurring in professional players; we're just seeing it over and over," McKee said. National research perspective We tried to run Jones’ statement past McKee, hearing back from the center’s Chris Nowinski, a former pro wrestler and author of "Head Games: Football’s Concussion Crisis." By email, Nowinski pointed us to a web post by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, last updated in March 2015, stating the institute’s first "consensus workshop" of CTE scientists the month before had concluded that "thus far, this pathology has only been found in individuals exposed to brain trauma, typically multiple episodes. How common this pathology occurs at autopsy and the nature and degree of trauma necessary to cause this neurodegeneration remain to be determined." Nowinski also noted the March 16, 2016, ESPN news story both noting the scientific consensus and stating that brain bank studies had lately detected CTE "in a large percentage of former high school football players and other athletes" and scans newly showed "signs of the disease in NFL players decades after their retirement. All that said, ESPN reported, Dr. Walter Koroshetz, director of the National Institute for Neurological Disorders and Stroke, cautioned that much remains unknown about CTE such as how common it is, when and why symptoms develop, and how the disease -- associated with depression, dementia and memory loss -- spreads inside the brain. The story summed up: "Although many questions remain unanswered, the research appears not only to reinforce the connection between repetitive head trauma and CTE, but also suggests that the disease may be prevalent among people in the general population who played contact sports, not just former NFL players." Finally, the story noted an independent analysis of brain tissue from people who had played contact sports and those who had not. Researchers including Kevin Bieniek, a postdoctoral research fellow in the Mayo Clinic's Department of Neuroscience, reviewed 66 brains of people who had played contact sports -- primarily high school and college football, but also boxing, rugby, wrestling and soccer. They also examined the brains of 198 control subjects who hadn’t been exposed to contact sports. And in the end, they spotted CTE signs in the brains of 21 people who played contact sports -- at a rate of almost one in three -- but no such signs in the brains of the people who had not played contact sports. Other scientists We asked a Johns Hopkins medical expert, Kostas Lyketsos, to analyze Jones’ claim. Through Kristin Mears, spokeswoman for the Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center, Lyketsos emailed this statement: "In my view, there is good evidence to support ‘a link’ between playing football and long-term consequences of traumatic brain injuries such as developing CTE. The science, however, is still very limited in terms of the strength of the link and many other important aspects of this link. The research that would be necessary to clarify these issues is costly and will take a long time to complete." We also connected with Dr. Vassilis Koliatsos, a Johns Hopkins professor of pathology, who said by phone there’s a risk of CTE from any contact sport, including boxing, rugby and ice hockey. "The problem is not whether there is a risk," Koliatsos said, "but how much of a risk there is. The answer is we really don’t know." He said it would help to have a study following people over time bolstered by PET scans to look for tau buildups in the brains of living people. "What we have now is backward data, brains from people who did poorly. We don’t know about people who have done fairly well. That is the scientific issue," Koliatsos said. Our ruling Jones said it’s "absurd" to say there’s enough data to establish a link between playing football and CTE. In fact, scientists have reached consensus establishing this link, though research remains to be done on the degree to which football players and others involved in high-contact activities risk CTE. We find Jones’s "absurd" claim absurd. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

pomt-04528	Says Mitt Romney’s investments created zero jobs.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/01/workers-voice/union-backed-ad-says-romneys-investments-created-z/	For some voters, the mail recently brought a flier that said Mitt Romney’s investments created zero jobs. For years we’ve checked empty claims from Republicans that President Barack Obama’s economic stimulus created "zero jobs." Zero job creation makes for a catchy attack. But is it any more accurate about "Romney’s investments" than it was about Obama’s stimulus package? Uh, no. Romney made a personal fortune running private equity and venture capital firm Bain Capital, and super PACs are spending millions to show investments that ended with lost jobs and Bain profits. That’s an incomplete snapshot of Bain’s portfolio — in fact, at least several of Bain's companies mushroomed, creating thousands of jobs. Still, the ads and mailers keep coming, like this one the week of Sept. 17, 2012, from a super PAC associated with the union AFL-CIO. The mailer, spotted by POLITICO, calls Romney’s business model at private equity firm Bain Capital "un-American." It offered a chart titled "Mitt Romney by the numbers," which included this: "0: Number of jobs that Romney’s investments created." Zero? A footnote says the source is a May 21, 2012, article published by Businessweek.com. Eddie Vale, communications director for Workers’ Voice, pointed us to the final paragraphs of a BloombergBusinessweek story titled "Mitt Romney's Private Equity Nightmare." The story paraphrases a former Romney colleague at Bain as saying, "the main goal at buyout firms ... is never maximizing employment. ... It’s maximizing returns for investors." Vale said that was the point of the chart. "The goal of Romney’s investments was to maximize profits, not create jobs. We are not saying he never created a job. He needs people to feed his dressage horse and wash his cars," Vale said. "We are saying his investments were about maximizing profit. He did that by laying off workers and sending jobs overseas." But that doesn’t mean Romney’s investments created "0" jobs. Private equity vs. venture capital In fact, sometimes Bain profits and jobs grew together. Romney has repeatedly claimed that Bain was a job creator. "In the business I had, we invested in over 100 different businesses and net-net, taking out the ones where we lost jobs and those that we added, those businesses have now added over 100,000 jobs." Independent journalists, including us, haven’t been able to confirm that "net-net" Bain investments added 100,000 jobs. Bain won’t release enough information to do the math. But here are some things we do know. Sometimes Bain acted as a private equity firm, buying stakes in businesses, taking out loans to retool the companies and pay themselves fees, then selling their stakes at a profit. Thousands of workers lost their jobs. But some studies show that private equity in general results in minimal net job loss. Companies shed jobs, but mostly make it up with hiring later. Then there are the times that Bain acted as a venture capitalist, investing in young companies to help them grow. (Something that generally requires hiring workers, not laying them off.) That’s the case for companies like Staples, an example Romney loves to cite. And for good reason. Here are the most widely reported Bain job gains and losses, as rounded up by FactCheck.org from POLITICO and the New York Times: • Romney's campaign says three companies in which Bain invested alone have created more than 100,000 jobs: Staples (89,000), Sports Authority (15,000) and Domino's (7,900 jobs added since 1999). That's 111,900 jobs. (Two of those were venture capital investments; Domino’s was a private equity buyout.) • Companies that lost jobs include American Pad & Paper (385), Dade International (1,900), DDi Corp. (2,100), Clear Channel Communications (2,500) and KB Toys (3,400). That's 10,285 jobs. Other roundups with a narrower time frame — the years before Romney retired — also show tens of thousands of new jobs, and fewer job losses. None of these tallies is comprehensive. There’s also a fair question whether Romney deserves credit for all jobs gained — or blame for jobs lost. Some commentators say the issue isn’t that Bain companies shed jobs, but that they shed "good jobs." But this ad went way beyond that thoughtful criticism. It said his investments’ job creation was zero. Our ruling Workers’ Voice says the "number of jobs that Romney’s investments created" is zero. That ignores Bain’s role as a venture capital firm that helped build companies that hired tens of thousands of workers. The PAC, unable to provide data to back up its claim, said the goal of Romney’s investments wasn’t jobs, but profits. That doesn’t prove Bain’s job creation was zero. Nor do examples of Romney investments that lost jobs. This catchy claim comes up empty. We rate it Pants on Fire.	None	Workers' Voice	None	None	None	2012-10-01T14:15:04	2012-09-17	['None']
pomt-08289	The Fulton County vote count will be finished by 11:30 p.m. on election night.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2010/nov/05/barry-garner/fulton-elections-chief-pledged-quick-tallies/	You might say that a politician didn't make this election season's boldest promise. The head of Fulton County's Department of Registration and Elections did. In an article Tuesday in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Barry Garner vowed his office would report its results at a decent hour. "By 11:30 p.m., we'll be finished, " Garner said. "That's my pledge." We gasped. Fulton? Finishing early? Did he remember the 2008 elections? This is AJC PolitiFact Georgia's 100th take on the truth. The trusty Truth-O-Meter debuted in June, just as the state's primary battles began to heat up. Therefore there are few more fitting ways to celebrate this milestone than by fact-checking results from our first election season. So let's review Fulton's problems in 2008. Back then, another elections director was in charge. Absentee ballot processing went so slowly that Fulton County had to hire FedEx to ship nearly 4,000 ballots to voters overnight. FedEx billed the county more than $300,000. Poll workers counted absentee ballots for 53 hours after closing. State election rules require they stay on site until the count is finished, but crews were so exhausted they were sent home. The Georgia Secretary of State's Office blamed poor staffing and procedures. Because Fulton's count lagged, the U.S. Senate race took an odd turn. Democratic challenger Jim Martin and Republican incumbent Saxby Chambliss continued to campaign after the general election even though it was unclear whether they would compete in a runoff. They did go to a runoff, which Chambliss won. Fulton hired Garner the next year, after a half-dozen other candidates either rejected the job or didn't work out for other reasons. Garner, who came from Florida's Miami-Dade County, promised major changes. "We are not going to be the laughingstock of the election community anymore, " Garner said. "I guarantee you that. We will turn this thing round." Still, even before Tuesday, Fulton ran into trouble. Garner's office sent absentee ballots with incorrect precinct information to more than 200 voters. That's why his confidence piqued our curiosity. Could Fulton really make its self-imposed 11:30 p.m. deadline? Was Garner capable of a turnaround? We called Garner the day after the election. He clarified that he promised if the polls closed as scheduled at 7 p.m., his office would post results online by 11:30 p.m. He didn't tell poll managers about the goal. On Tuesday, 329 of the county's 333 precincts had sent their results to the Election Department's servers by Garner's deadline. That's 98.7 percent. It takes five or 10 minutes to transfer them to the Web, so numbers from slower precincts likely came online between 11:35 and 11:40 p.m. "With a few tweaks, we can meet our goal," he said. The four precincts that didn't make it experienced unusually high turnout. They remained open until the last voter in line by 7 p.m. finished. That happened at 9 p.m. Once voting is done, poll workers must complete state-mandated procedures before sending their results. There were no voting machine problems, Garner said. The county began transmitting its full election night tally to the Secretary of State's Office by about 1:30 a.m. They arrived by about 2 a.m., Secretary of State spokesman Matt Carrothers confirmed. There were no problems with transmission, tabulation or other issues. "This was pretty much in line with ... larger-population counties," Carrothers said. Fulton has made other improvements since 2008. The absentee ballots that caused so many problems were almost all done Tuesday night, Garner said. Those that weren't took extra time because they were twice as long. "Still, we should have been finished," Garner said. The election isn't officially over, of course. Military and overseas absentee ballots aren't due until the close of business Friday. And Garner is already thinking about the future. He hopes to meet his goal in 2012. "If we can do it in Florida, we can do it in Georgia," Garner said. We hope so. It can't get worse than Florida, home of the hanging chad. Overall, we found that Fulton County did well. The only precincts that missed the 11:30 p.m. cutoff kept their doors open late because of high turnout. Garner's promise was that he'd be finished by then if polls closed as scheduled, so it's fair to say he met his goal. Since workers counted almost all absentee ballots Tuesday night, results from precincts that closed on schedule arrived on time. Tallies appeared on the Web within minutes of deadline, and the department came extremely close to meeting Garner's high expectations. That makes Garner's statement Mostly True.

pomt-12557	"As chairman of the Fulton board of commissioners, I turned a $100 million deficit into a balanced budget."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2017/apr/14/karen-handel/karen-handels-dicey-balanced-budget-claim/	In the special election to fill Tom Price’s former House seat, Republican Karen Handel often reminds voters of a key line in her political resume. "As chairman of the Fulton board of commissioners, I turned a $100 million deficit into a balanced budget," she said in an 11Alive news report. The claim is the second sentence on her biography page on her website. Which raises the question: Did Handel actually turn a $100 million deficit into a balanced budget? The short answer is that while Handel was able to help balance the county budget without raising taxes, her specific claim ignores some critical facts about the Fulton County budget process. Let’s step back in time. Diving into the ‘deficit’ Handel took over as chair of the county commissioners on Nov. 12, 2003. Two days later, she was handed a proposed 2004 budget. It was a balanced budget because by law, it had to be. But in two of the county’s largest funds, the general fund and the special services district fund, the original budget planners saw spending topping revenues by a combined total of nearly $90 million. They didn’t call those deficits; they called them shortfalls. But the concept is similar. Additional shortfalls in other funds added well over $10 million to the gap, giving us the $100 million "deficit" in Handel’s claim. To keep the budget balanced, that original plan took $12 million from the county’s cash reserves (to boost the general fund) and raised property taxes by about $75 million. To be clear, the difference is not that Handel took an unbalanced budget and fixed it. Rather, she took a different approach to balancing the budget — which, again, by law, the commission had to do each year. Looking at news reports in January 2004, Handel gets credit for using a mix of spending cuts and deeper draws into cash reserves to deliver a balanced budget that avoided a property tax increase. Overall, her budget plan reduced spending by $46 million from the plan she saw when she took office. But that still didn’t close the gap between spending and revenues. The gap was half of what she started with. She filled that gap, not with more property taxes, but with money saved from past years and kept in reserve. In the words of a Jan. 22, 2004, Atlanta Journal Constitution article, "The budget calls for $49 million in deficit spending that pulls Fulton's two savings accounts below commission-mandated minimums." (Ultimately, the funds didn't dip as low as expected.) We spoke with Handel and her spokeswoman Kate Constantini. They rejected the idea that her plan included a "deficit" but agreed with the numbers. "I came in and got the budget in place so we didn't need to raise taxes," Handel said. "We did that through savings and realignment across the various funds." The Atlanta Journal Constitution praised her at the time. In an editorial, it called her plan "reasonable and even handed." "In this era of cruel budget-cutting in the face of dropping revenue, it’s a rare opportunity to adopt a spending plan that supports good services but doesn’t soak the taxpayers," it said. Our ruling Handel said she turned a $100 million deficit into a balanced budget when she became chair of the Fulton County board of commissioners. Certain parts of that story add up: The expected shortfall was over $100 million. Handel’s budget was balanced, and did so without a tax increase. However, her talking point omits that the county required balanced budgets — and the spending plan she was handed was balanced in the first place. Furthermore, if Handel called the $100 million in the original plan a deficit, then the same label would apply to the 2004 budget that she spearheaded. Her balanced plan also factored in a $49 million shortfall, even after spending cuts. The biggest difference is she avoided a hefty tax hike by drawing more from reserves. Words matter. Handel’s statement ignores that she was required to balance the budget, and her definition of deficit is inconsistent. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-04593	Says U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson "admitted" that Washington, D.C., "changed" him into an insider selling his influence to make millions from powerful special interests.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/21/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/democratic-group-says-thompson-admitted-washington/	Democrats and their allies are working overtime to convince Wisconsin voters that former Gov. Tommy Thompson isn’t the man he used to be. Three new ads use Thompson’s own words in building a case that the U.S. Senate candidate changed for the worse after leaving President George W. Bush’s cabinet and making millions in part by working on behalf of drug companies, financial firms and other interests. One spot, by the political arm of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal workers uses a snippet of a Thompson quote -- "... Washington changed us …" -- to bookend allegations that he’s changed so much he now "supports massive tax cuts for corporations that outsource Wisconsin jobs." Another spot, by Tammy Baldwin, the Democrat seeking the Senate seat, uses it in support of an allegation regarding Thompson and drug companies. The newest ad, by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, uses the same snippet to say Thompson "admitted" being a guy who flew off to D.C. and "hasn’t looked back." The list of grievances in the DSCC ad is long. Amid generic images of corporate deal-making, the spot says Thompson "sold his influence and connections, becoming a partner in a powerful Washington lobbying firm, working for Wall Street and the big drug companies, making millions from the special interests at our expense." It skips any mention of Thompson’s four-year stint running the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services before he went to work in 2005 as a legal partner at the Washington, D.C., lobbying firm of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld. The ad ends with the narrator saying, "Thompson even admitted…" before the screen cuts to Thompson remarking at a presidential debate during his 2008 run: "Washington changed us." Narrator: "Yes it did." Just what was Thompson owning up to in the quote? Return with us to the June 5, 2007 CNN-sponsored presidential debate in Manchester, New Hampshire. John Lewicke, an electrical engineer, posed this long question to a candidate panel that included Thompson and current nominee Mitt Romney: "In 2006, we saw the worst Republican defeat in living memory. If we do more of the same, why do we expect anything different? And I'd like to ask each of the candidates why their position is -- or how their position differs from the present administration's, so that we won't see a repeat of 2006 in 2008." A transcript shows the candidates gave answers along two themes: Curb spending (unlike Bush) and show some vision. Few gave any details on spending cuts, other than to suggest banning pork-barrel projects. Ron Paul said the Iraq War costs were too high. Enter Thompson, questioned by CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. BLITZER: "The question is what - what's President Bush's biggest mistake over these past several years?" THOMPSON: "Because we went to Washington to change Washington and Washington changed us. We didn't come up with new ideas. We got to transform health care. We got to wind -- we got to wind down the war in Iraq. We got to make sure that we really are conservatives. If we're going to spend money like - as foolishly and as stupidly as the Democrats, the voters are going to vote for the professional spending, the Democrat not the amateur spender, the Republican." (Laughter, applause.) There was no commentary on Thompson’s private-sector jobs. Rather, it seems clear Thompson’s "admission" concerned his regrets, however belated, over policy and budget matters during his days in the Bush cabinet. But the DSCC uses the quote in the ad to give the false impression Thompson was standing in self-judgment over his work at the time for Akin Gump and others. When asked about the quote, DSCC spokesman Matt Canter connected the dots this way: Most observers, he argued, would say that the new Medicare prescription drug benefit created with Thompson’s support under Bush was a giveaway to the big pharmaceutical companies. Thompson’s debate remarks talked about the failure to transform health care. Therefore, Thompson’s "Washington changed us" was an admission that such deals with special interests were wrong, Canter said. To be sure, there is a connection between Thompson’s cabinet experience and his subsequent private work. PolitiFact Wisconsin has noted that connection in earlier items -- and those items are cited as a source for many of the statements in the ad. We noted the connection when we checked a claim by Thompson’s GOP primary rival Eric Hovde that Thompson is "a big corporate lobbyist" and has been "lobbying during the middle of the campaign." We rated that Half True, noting that Thompson is not a registered lobbyist under the strict definition but "has sold his influence and connections to firms to whom it would benefit on Capitol Hill, but did so in a way -- as a consultant -- to avoid having to register." His link to these firms is clear, and his own disclosure reports show he has made millions in the private sector as a corporate consultant and advisor, executive, investor and speaker. But we’re examining the claim that Thompson candidly "admitted" being "changed" by Washington into a corporate influence peddler. Our rating In claiming that Thompson "admitted" he had been changed by Washington and had sold out to make millions, the ad jumbles a snippet from a quote about the failings of himself and other GOP officials while running Washington with his actions after leaving government service. The effect is to make it appear Thompson is condemning his own conduct and private-sector work. We rate the claim False.

pomt-13369	"These people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/29/donald-trump/trump-says-1800-people-who-were-going-be-deported-/	Right before the first presidential debate wrapped up, Donald Trump repeated his desire to "make America great again" and his views that the current state of the country is not good. "We are a nation that is seriously troubled. We're losing our jobs. People are pouring into our country," Trump said. "The other day, we were deporting 800 people. And perhaps, they pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption. But these people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens -- ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know." We wanted to know more about the hundreds of people Trump said became citizens instead of being deported. His campaign pointed to a CNN article published Sept. 20 about a report from the Inspector General of the Homeland Security Department about 858 immigrants who were supposed to be deported but were granted U.S. citizenship instead. "But the truth is the report is even worse than reported, with more than 1,800 individuals naturalized who should have been deported from the country," the CNN article said. Inspector General’s report The Inspector General of the Homeland Security Department issued a report Sept. 8 about "potentially ineligible individuals" being granted U.S. citizenship due to incomplete fingerprint records. Immigrants applying to become naturalized U.S. citizens are required to submit fingerprints, reveal other identities or names used and if they have been in deportation proceedings. U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) then runs the applicant’s fingerprints against DHS and FBI digital fingerprint databases to check for other possible identities, criminal arrests and convictions, immigration violations, deportations and links to terrorism. If there’s a match, USCIS determines whether the applicant is still eligible for naturalization. The Inspector General’s office determined that 1,029 people had become citizens even though they had final deportation orders under another identity. Of the 1,029 individuals, 858 did not have digital fingerprint records available in DHS’ fingerprint repository when USCIS was reviewing and deciding on their applications, the report said. (For comparison, roughly 701,000 people receive naturalization each year.) The people who received citizenship may have had old paper-based fingerprint records, but those are missing from DHS’ digital repository. Those old records were not digitized and uploaded into it when the repository was initially developed in 1994, the report said. The vast majority of those paper-based records are from the 1990s, DHS said. The Inspector General’s report does not specify the years when the individuals became naturalized citizens. The CNN article referenced by Trump’s campaign emphasized a footnote on the report, which said that as of November 2015, an additional 953 people had been naturalized while being subject to final deportation orders. The footnote said it was not known when the fingerprints of the 953 people were digitized or how many of their records were available in DHS’ digital files when their applications were being examined and decided. It seems likely the actual number of people ordered deported but who became U.S. citizens is actually 1,982 (the 1,029 plus the 953 identified in the footnote), said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring restrictions on immigration. "So Trump was actually understating the results," Krikorian said. A DHS spokesman said a review team is looking into hard copies of each file identified in the Inspector General’s report. A total of 1,811 cases are being reviewed -- the 858 for whom digitized records were not available during the naturalization process, and the 953 for whom it’s not known if their digital records were in the system when their applications were being reviewed and decided. DHS said more investigation is needed before it can be determined if people were naturalized when they shouldn’t have been. "It is important to note that the fact that fingerprint records in these cases may have been incomplete at the time of the naturalization interview does not necessarily mean that the applicant was in fact granted naturalization, or that the applicant obtained naturalization, fraudulently," said Neema Hakim, DHS spokesman. Hakim said the ongoing review found approximately 100 cases among those identified in the OIG report where the individuals were not in fact granted citizenship. Lack of digitized fingerprints During the debate, Trump said hundreds of immigrants who were to be deported became citizens perhaps because officials "pressed the wrong button, or perhaps worse than that, it was corruption." The Inspector General’s report does not outline corruption as a reason, but a lack of modernized records. "As long as the older fingerprint records have not been digitized and included in the repositories, USCIS risks making naturalization decisions without complete information and, as a result, naturalizing additional individuals who may be ineligible for citizenship or who may be trying to obtain U.S. citizenship fraudulently," the report said. Immigrants who become naturalized U.S. citizens can petition for others to come to the United States, may obtain security clearances or perform security-sensitive work (as was the case of three naturalized citizens identified in the report, their credentials have been revoked). Our ruling Trump said, "These people that we were going to deport for good reason ended up becoming citizens. Ended up becoming citizens. And it was 800. And now it turns out it might be 1,800, and they don't even know." Trump’s statement accurately references a CNN report that at least 1,800 people who had deportation orders had become naturalized U.S. citizens. An Inspector General report found that old paper records hadn’t been transferred to modern digital databases. There are a few details worth noting. An ongoing review found that about 100 cases identified in the Inspector General’s report were actually not granted citizenship. And, having a previous final deportation order does not always make an individual ineligible for naturalization. Trump’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/18e57605-51ba-4f32-a73e-f43c20b62112	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-09-29T13:48:17	2016-09-26	['None']
pomt-08874	"Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his (Ted Strickland’s) watch."	half-true	/ohio/statements/2010/aug/03/republican-governors-association/republican-governors-association-says-ohio-lost-40/	Like the refrain of a ubiquitous pop song, the phrase -- "Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his watch" -- is playing over and over on the airwaves. And like any good lyric, the phrase is catchy. Republican U.S. Senate candidate Rob Portman sings it about his Democratic challenger Lee Fisher, who is Ohio’s lieutenant governor and former head of the state’s economic development department. Republican gubernatorial candidate John Kasich sings it about incumbent governor Ted Strickland. Now the Republican Governors Association has made the phrase the central theme of three commercials attacking Strickland on behalf of Kasich. "Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his watch," is the opening line for one of the ads. With the phrase getting aired so often, we thought it was time to check the accuracy of the playlist. The Republicans are referring to the state’s net job losses since Strickland -- and by extension Fisher -- took office in January 2007. Ohio lost 386,600 non-farm jobs from January 2007 through June of this year, the latest figure available. So Republicans are largely accurate when they say Ohio has lost 400,000 jobs since January of 2007. Job losses were as high as 438,900 at the end of February of this year. But the claim breaks down when Republicans suggest that the governor -- or any one official -- is responsible for the job losses. Ohio has been losing jobs since January of 2000 - 568,300 according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Of those, 403,800 came in the manufacturing sector. It’s also worth noting, since campaigns are trying to blame those in charge when the state lost jobs, that Republicans held the governor’s office seven of those years and held both houses of the legislatures until January 2009. Republican George W. Bush was president for eight of those years. Strickland argues that Ohio - like Michigan and other Midwest states -- was especially hurt by forces beyond his control, namely a recession and the decline of manufacturing. Ohio and the nation have suffered through two recessions, one that started in 2001 and one that started in 2008, which triggered an avalanche of job losses here and was considered a global economic crisis. Strickland is not the only one making this argument. Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, a Republican elected in 2004 who is in his second term, says the same thing, at least he did July 22 during an interview in Cleveland. What makes the Daniels’ comments worth highlighting is that the rising GOP star was in town campaigning with Kasich. The two were beating up on Strickland for the state’s job losses. But Daniels became a bit defensive when questioned about Hoosier State less than stellar performance in the last several years. Indiana lost 174,000 net jobs since January of 2007 and the state has a current unemployment rate of 10.1 percentage points compared to Ohio’s 10.5 rate. "In a time when every state that is not sitting on a pile of natural gas is struggling, you bet we are," Daniels said. He argued that Indiana is adding jobs faster than other states and its "business climate" is better than Ohio’s. But, echoing the sentiments of other governors in defense of their states’ economic woes, he said, "To some extent, everybody is at the mercy of national and global events, and we are no different." That’s right. Daniels delivered the line that many Democrats make to defend themselves from the charge that the state’s job losses are all their fault. So even if the campaign phrase -- "Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his watch" -- is stuck in a voter’s head, the claim does not reflect the larger economic backdrop, one that both Democrats and Republicans in charge of states admit produced results out of their control. If the roles were reversed, and Ohio were led by a Republican governor and it was Democrats making the accusation, our rating would be the same.

pomt-03318	"Our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as they had at the same point in the last recovery, when there was no Obamacare."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/26/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-businesses-have-created-nearly-t/	During a speech on the economy in Galesburg, Ill., President Barack Obama touted his record on job creation. Referring to his Republican critics, Obama said in the July 24, 2013, speech, "They’ll bring up Obamacare -- this is tried and true -- despite the fact that our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as businesses had at the same point in the last recovery, when there was no Obamacare." We’ll first check whether Obama is correct about job growth, and then take a look at the impact of Obama’s health care law. The job numbers Because Obama used the term "recovery," we started by looking at Bureau of Labor Statistics job numbers for the first 49 months after the official end of the past two recessions -- that is, from November 2001 until November 2005, when George W. Bush was president, and from June 2009 until June 2013, during Obama’s tenure. Under Obama’s recovery, private-sector employment increased by a little under 6.05 million, compared to 3.17 million during the equivalent period during the Bush recovery. That’s "nearly twice as many jobs," as Obama said. And experts say this is a credible way of measuring the numbers. But it isn’t the only way. Instead of starting the clock at the official end of the recovery, one could start it from the low point in private-sector employment. These aren’t the same dates, because a low point private-sector employment isn’t the determining factor for pinpointing the end of a recession. Using this method makes Obama’s recovery less impressive. During the Bush recovery, private-sector employment continued to tumble all the way to July 2003 -- a year and a half after the recession’s official end. By comparison, during the Obama recovery, private-sector employment began to rise in February 2010, just eight months after the official end of the recession. So the extended slide in private-sector jobs under Bush artificially reduced the number of jobs created during the first part of his recovery. If you count from the low point in private-sector jobs instead, the Bush recovery produced 6.35 million private-sector jobs in the first 41 months, compared to 7.20 million in the first 41 months of Obama’s recovery. That’s modestly more private-sector jobs under Obama -- but it’s not "nearly twice as many jobs," as he had said. There’s also a third way to look at it -- looking at all jobs, not just private-sector jobs. Using this measurement casts an even more unfavorable light on the Obama recovery, since the government sector has been among the hardest-hit of any job category in the current recession. If you start counting private and government jobs from the low point in employment, the Bush recovery generated slightly more than 7 million total jobs, which actually exceeds the 6.58 million jobs created in the Obama recovery. Two economists we interviewed -- Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution and Tara Sinclair of George Washington University -- agreed that the alternative measurements are also valid. But by choosing the more favorable of the two statistics, Sinclair said, "I think he's cherry-picking. To in any way claim that this labor market is better than what we had in the mid-2000s just doesn't sound fair to me." To be fair, Burtless said, Obama did acknowledge elsewhere in his speech that, "I’m here to tell you today that we're not there yet. We all know that. We're not there yet. We've got more work to do." The role of Obamacare Obama used the line we’re checking as a way of countering Republican claims that the president’s signature health care law is a job-killer. The reality is that no one knows yet how much of a job-killer the law is going to be, or if it will be a job-killer at all. Many key provisions of the health care law haven’t kicked in yet. That includes new rules with fines for large businesses that don’t provide their employees with health care. Republicans say the new rules could drive some employers to shed employees or turn them into part-time employees. Sinclair said it’s possible that some companies may have pre-emptively cut down on employee hours or laid off workers due to the fear of looming Obamacare mandates, or due to certain Obamacare taxes being imposed. However, even if this is happening, it’s impossible to quantify the impact with any specificity. Obamacare’s impact on the currently available job data -- either positive or negative -- is still highly speculative. Our ruling Obama said, "Our businesses have created nearly twice as many jobs in this recovery as they had at the same point in the last recovery, when there was no Obamacare." Obama’s carefully worded claim uses the most advantageous time frame to measure job growth. Other metrics show that the job recovery he has presided over has been similar to, or even weaker than, the job recovery under Bush. So we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-07390	"State employees are actually going to get a pay raise."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/may/03/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-claims-state-workers-will-get-pay-/	Gov. John Kasich marked his 100th day in office with a news conference highlighting a long list of accomplishments. Among them were introduction of the "Jobs Budget," as he called it, and passage of Senate Bill 5. SB 5, described as "collective bargaining reform," would limit collective bargaining for public employees across the state. Kasich was asked during the meeting with reporters if the economic squeeze on workers and schools and local governments made it important symbolically for state lawmakers to take a pay cut. "I think they should be treated like all other state employees, and state employees are actually going to get a pay raise," the governor answered. A raise? In these times? While closing an $8 billion state budget deficit? PolitiFact Ohio was surprised. We asked the governor's office to explain, and looked for some background information on our own. Members of the General Assembly, we found, receive a base salary of $60,584 -- seventh-highest among state legislatures -- and stipends for leadership positions can raise it toward $90,000. Perks for Ohio lawmakers include public pension benefits and travel reimbursements. House Bill 41, introduced in January by Norwalk Republican Terry Boose, would cut salaries in the General Assembly and for elected executive officeholders by 5 percent. The bill has not yet had a hearing. Even if enacted, it would not affect legislator salaries during their current term of office. Legislators did not take the cut in pay that state employees have had for the past two years in the form of 10 mandatory furlough days, or unpaid days off. The governor's press secretary, Rob Nichols, told us that those days were what Kasich was referring to. "He was talking about the end of furlough days imposed under the previous administration," Nichols said. Kasich will allow the furloughs to end in July, so "state workers will, in fact, get a 3.2 percent pay increase. It's not technically a raise, but state workers are going to be getting more money. They will be getting their full salary," Nichols said. In other words, as the song says, they're going to get right back to where they started from. And where are we? Despite Nichols explanations, there is no pay raise. State workers will be getting more money in their paychecks, as Nichols noted. But that’s not because they’ll be getting paid more for their time. Those increases are a result of them working more days at the same rate of pay. When the furloughs end, state workers will no longer be forced to take unpaid days off from work. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Kasich’s claim as False.	None	John Kasich	None	None	None	2011-05-03T06:00:00	2011-04-19	['None']
pomt-00644	The lack of an automatic braking system that could have prevented the Philadelphia Amtrak crash "wasn't driven by a lack of funding. It just takes a while. They (Congress) just passed it in the recent past."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/may/18/megyn-kelly/did-money-have-nothing-do-amtrak-crash/	In the first hours after the Amtrak crash outside Philadelphia on May 12, 2015, some people looked to blame Congress for failing to fund critical infrastructure improvements. But the talking points changed when the nation learned the engineer was speeding. "Breaking tonight, 106 miles per hour," Megyn Kelly opened her May 13 Fox News show. "That is how fast the NTSB says an Amtrak train was traveling just moments before flying off the rails in Philadelphia last night. And while some of the wounded are still being treated and other passengers are still unaccounted for, there has been a predictable but no less despicable rush to turn this crash into a political talking point." Kelly then played a montage of Democrats and one Oklahoma Republican mayor saying the crash was a wake-up call to invest in infrastructure. Rep. Steve Israel, D-N.Y., said, "Last night we failed them. We failed to invest in their safety." Kelly said this blaming of "stingy Republicans" poured out before the fact was known that the train was more than two-times over the speed limit as it entered a curve. While a technology called positive train control (PTC) could have slowed the train in the case of human error, its absence in the Philadelphia crash, Kelly said, had nothing to do with Congress refusing to allocate money. "Congress had already mandated that it be installed, and it's being installed on all these tracks," Kelly said. "They hadn't gotten to this particular track yet. And according to our information, that wasn't driven by a lack of funding. It just takes a while. They just passed it in the recent past. So they were working on it. So it's not a failure of infrastructure. It's a failure of an engineer to obey the speed limit." The National Transportation Safety Board is continuing to investigate the reason behind the crash. But we wanted to dig into her claim about the lack of positive train control on that section of rail -- and whether congressional funding was an issue. What we found is that yes, Amtrak and Congress have been working for years to implement positive train control. And yes, the braking system -- which National Transportation Safety Board member Robert Sumwalt said would have prevented the crash -- is on schedule to be installed by the end of the year. But money from Congress could have pushed up that timetable, specifically when it comes to purchasing radio frequencies necessary for the braking program to work. The braking system and and the Amtrak crash Positive train control is a system that uses transponders on the tracks to communicate with controls on a passing locomotive. If the train is moving too fast, the system slows it down. Amtrak released a statement after the Philadelphia crash saying that "installation is largely complete south of Newark, N.J., but the system is only in service on 50 miles of the 226-mile route between Washington and New York." The statement said Amtrak is on schedule to have the system fully operational on the Northeast Corridor by the end of 2015. That, Amtrak said, will meet a deadline set by Congress in 2008. Put another way, the hardware for the new braking system was largely in place (though not specifically at the site of the crash). What was left was the final work to connect it to the trains and activate the system. PTC installation and funding The core of Kelly’s claim is that the installation of the PTC braking system was not about funding. To back that up, Fox News sent us a Reuters article about delays in implementing PTC nationwide. "Federal rules require the national rail network to have an operating PTC system by the end of the year, though many lawmakers have endorsed rail industry appeals for more time to comply," the article said. "In March, the Senate Commerce Committee voted to extend the deadline for implementing PTC until at least 2020. Both Republicans and Democrats supported the measure, which will now go to the Senate floor." That extension, however, served the needs of the freight and commuter rail companies who were unable to get their systems up and running by the end of 2015. Amtrak was a different story. David Hughes was Amtrak’s chief engineer until 2005 and now consults in the railroad industry. "Amtrak may be the only major railroad to meet the original 2015 deadline," Hughes told PunditFact. Amtrak’s specific system is called the Advanced Civil Speed Enforcement System. A heavy duty plastic transponder tied to a cross-tie in the track sends speed and location information to the locomotive, which in turn radios that data to a ground control station. If something is going wrong, the ground control station sends a command via radio back to the locomotive, forcing it to slow down. Amtrak had this system fully operational north of New York City, and was close to putting it online in the section between New York City and Washington, D.C. The question is, would money have advanced the timeline? Karl Witbeck is consulting engineer with the Stantec firm. "No doubt the lack of capital funding has paid a large role in the delay of finishing the implementation of PTC for Amtrak," Witbeck said. Witbeck studied a key link in the warning system, the radio communications needed to connect the ground control station with the trains. Witbeck, along with the Federal Railroad Administration and Amtrak’s Office of Inspector General, highlighted the lack of accessible, available radio frequencies as the single greatest barrier to completing the automatic braking system for all railroads, not just Amtrak. In 2012, the Amtrak Office of Inspector General called the radio link the "most serious challenge" to implementing the braking system. Why? When Congress mandated that every railroad in the country have PTC by 2015, it failed to require that the Federal Communication Commission set aside radio frequencies for the railroads to use. That sent railroad operators such as Amtrak out into the private market on a hunt for frequencies. The inspector general report said that Amtrak "faces the prospect of having to stitch together enough licenses in the 220 megahertz (MHz) range through piecemeal acquisitions, county-by-county, to ensure coverage along the NEC (Northeast Corridor)." Acquiring that coverage costs money, and this is where the story gets complicated. In its 2012 report and in a follow-up a year later, Amtrak’s inspector general aimed many criticisms at Amtrak’s inability to manage its capital investment projects. While the 2012 report said a "significant challenge is ensuring that Amtrak has enough funds available to implement PTC fully by the deadline," it underscored that Amtrak needed to request the funds for radio frequencies at least a year and a half before it planned to spend them, and Amtrak didn’t seem to be doing that. The request was missing from the railroad’s five-year financial plan and, according to the report, the cost estimates were "potentially incomplete and unreliable." We also found that Amtrak stopped listing PTC in its Fiscal Year 2014 and 2015 requests to Congress. In 2013, Amtrak’s inspector general skewered managers for failing to set clear priorities for its capital projects. It noted that the board had approved over $3 million to repair locomotives that were due to be replaced. Specific to PTC, it found that while the board had approved spending about $10 million in one year to knit together Amtrak’s system with that of the freight and commuter railroads, managers signed a multiyear contract costing $59 million. Clearly, Amtrak had internal problems managing its capital projects, including the system that could have prevented the fatal crash near Philadelphia. On the other hand, Congress has consistently given Amtrak about 60 percent of the money it requested each year to invest in its infrastructure. Year Amount requested Amount appropriated 2010 $975 million $594 million 2011 $1.02 billion $658 million 2012 $1.1 billion $657 million 2013 $1.4 billion $642 million 2014 $1.2 billion $800 million (Sources: General capital figures in Amtrak business plans, budget requests, and appropriations bills) The inspector general report noted that Amtrak’s "needs have exceeded the level of funding that it received each year." In the view of Hughes and Witbeck, Amtrak has always had to juggle how it would spend its capital budget and resolving the final issue of buying radio bandwidth for PTC was part of that. Our ruling Kelly said that the lack of a working fail-safe braking system at the site of the Philadelphia Amtrak crash, "wasn't driven by a lack of funding. It just takes a while. They (Congress) just passed it in the recent past." Congress actually passed the rule in 2008. The basis of Kelly’s claim was an article that said Congress had granted an extension for railroads to implement a positive train control system. But that extension had much to do with freight and commuter rail operators, not Amtrak. Amtrak is moving forward with its own braking system, and says it will be fully operational by the end of the year. Experts said additional resources to purchase radio frequencies needed to make the system work could have sped up the roll-out. Moreover, while Amtrak has been criticized for how it spends money on capital projects, it has consistently been funded at levels below what it has requested. Kelly’s statement is partially accurate.

In its May 9 decision, the High Court built on its earlier reasoning and has now made clear that a political candidate's renunciation of foreign citizenship needs to be complete before nomination, unless the foreign country's laws place "irremediable" obstacles in the way. Only then does the question of whether that candidate has taken "all reasonable steps" come into play. Lawyers for the five politicians had argued that it was sufficient for a candidate to have taken all reasonable steps within their power to renounce before nomination, regardless of the response by officials of the foreign country. The May 9 decision may have been the more likely outcome given the High Court's strict interpretation of section 44 in last year's the Canavan case. But based on Fact Check's own analysis and consideration of the views of three eminent legal experts, there remained the possibility that the court would rule otherwise. This was acknowledged in the Government's own legal advice. Until May 9 uncertainty remained: the fates of politicians who had taken "all reasonable steps" to renounce British citizenship but were delayed by UK Home Office processes were not "absolutely obvious and clear".

pomt-10553	RNC version of a Hillary Clinton valentine: "Roses are red, violets are blue, I'll raise your taxes and there is nothing you can do."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/14/republican-national-committee-republican/hunk-of-burning-love/	Its presidential nominee all but announced, the Republican National Committee is ready for the next challenge: love note writing. In a feature on its Web site, the RNC offers up free gifts for Valentine's Day. That is, cards from your favorite Democratic opponents. "If I could rearrange the alphabet, I'd put T and AX together," coos a sweet valentine from Sen. Hillary Clinton. "My liberal heart bleeds for you," intones Sen. Barack Obama. Six options await the last-minute shopper — and you can send it to 10 people at once! Many can appreciate the messages' snide sentiments, but here's the problem: While most of the Valentines are cute twists on criticisms of the two candidates, one is simply untrue. It's a Clinton valentine that reads: "Roses are red, violets are blue, I'll raise your taxes and there is nothing you can do." PolitiFact checked an earlier claim from the RNC that Clinton's campaign proposals would cost taxpayers more than $777.6-billion. We found that to be Mostly True. And Clinton has said she supports letting the Bush tax cuts of 2001 expire as scheduled in 2010 for people making more than $250,000 a year. Critics point to that as a sign she plans to raise taxes as president. But it's the "there is nothing you can do" line that draws the Truth-O-Meter's attention. Since when can a president raise taxes without the approval of Congress? And aren't voters encouraged to speak up about policies they oppose? We gave a Pants on Fire ruling to former presidential candidate John Edwards when he claimed king-like powers for the presidency. The RNC now makes a similar claim. Maybe the RNC should stick to the biting sarcasm of such sentiments as "On this Valentine's Day ... may higher taxes come your way!" (a Clinton card offering) or "Will you be my Valentine? Yes ... no ... present" (a shot at Obama's voting record in the Illinois state Senate). Or consider adding fact sheets with footnotes to its Valentines. For this day, it's Pants on Fire wrong.

pomt-14750	"Two months ago, Donald Trump said that ISIS was not our fight."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/15/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-claims-cnn-debate-donald-trump-said-isis-/	Republican presidential candidates Jeb Bush and Donald Trump faced off over what Trump did -- or didn’t -- say about ISIS during the CNN debate in Las Vegas. Bush said, "Two months ago, Donald Trump said that ISIS was not our fight. Just two months ago." Trump responded, "Never said that." Who’s right? We dug into the archives and found two quotes that shed some light on what Trump really said. The comments that fit squarely within Bush’s time frame came on Sept. 28, 2015, when Trump sat for an interview with CNN’s Erin Burnett. Here’s an excerpt from Trump’s comments: "(Syria is) a total catastrophe. It's a total mess, and we are helping to make it a mess. Now, we have ISIS and ISIS wants to go after (Syrian president Bashar al-Assad). But we're knocking the hell out of them even though it's not a very full blown thing. We're still dropping bombs all over the place. ... "You have Russia that is now there. Russia is on the side of Assad and Russia wants to get rid of ISIS as much as we do, if not more, because they don't want them coming into Russia. And I'm saying, why are we knocking ISIS and yet at the same time, we're against Assad? Let them fight, take over the remnants, but more importantly, let Russia fight ISIS if they want to fight them. Let them fight it. ... "Let Syria and ISIS fight. Why do we care? Let ISIS and Syria fight. And let Russia, they're in Syria already, let them fight ISIS. Look, I don't want ISIS. ISIS is bad. They are evil. When they start doing with a head chopping … these are really bad dudes. … Let Russia take care of ISIS. How many places can we be? … Russia likes Assad seemingly a lot. Let them worry about ISIS. Let them fight it out." When we checked with the Bush campaign, spokesman Matt Gorman said that the interview with Burnett was indeed the source that Bush was referencing during his debate comments. As it happens, another set of comments actually offer a closer fit in wording to what Bush referenced, but they came more than five months ago, in a July 8, 2015, interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper. Here’s what Trump told Cooper when he asked him to expand upon his previous remark that nobody would be tougher on ISIS than Donald Trump: "The situation with ISIS has to be dealt firmly and strongly. When you have people being beheaded -- I would love not to be over there. That's not our fight. That's other people's fight. That's revolutions, that's whatever you want to call it, religious wars." So it appears that Bush conflated two examples of prior Trump comments. In the quote from "two months ago," Trump didn’t say that ISIS is "not our fight." He did, however, say those words on a different occasion -- but that was more than five months ago, not two. More important, though, is whether Bush accurately captured the essence of Trump’s meaning. In the quote from two months ago -- the one the Bush camp says he was referencing in the debate exchange -- Trump does appear to suggest that Russia and Syria should be the countries to primarily fight ISIS. "Let Syria and ISIS fight," he said. "Why do we care? Let ISIS and Syria fight. And let Russia, they're in Syria already, let them fight ISIS." Our ruling Bush said, "Two months ago, Donald Trump said that ISIS was not our fight" -- something Trump immediately denied. Trump didn't use those words two months ago -- even though he did five months ago -- but in the comments from two months ago, Trump said something close to what Bush indicated. We rate Bush’s comment Mostly True.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-12-15T23:02:54	2015-12-15	['None']

pomt-07478	"When we lower tax rates, we generate more in revenues. That happened in '86 with the Reagan plan, happened in 2001, following the Bush plan."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2011/apr/15/saxby-chambliss/chambliss-makes-case-tax-cuts-citing-reagan-and-bu/	Georgia’s senior U.S. senator recently talked about one of the biggest problems facing the federal government -- the national debt -- and offered some solutions. Saxby Chambliss called for lowering personal income tax rates and corporate tax rates. He then gave a history lesson about how that has worked. "When we lower tax rates, we generate more in revenues," Chambliss, a Republican, told National Public Radio. "That happened in '86 with the Reagan plan, happened in 2001, following the Bush plan. So we know that's going to happen." Chambliss repeated this Monday in a presentation to the Rotary Club of Atlanta. "What we’ve always seen in this country is whether it was the ‘86 tax package or the 2001 tax package, revenues go up whenwe reduce [tax] rates," the senator said. We wondered whether Chambliss was correct. Chambliss was referring to two major tax changes by two Republican presidents: Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush. In 1986, Reagan persuaded Congress to gradually cut the top individual income tax rate from 50 percent to 28 percent and the top corporate tax rate from 46 percent to 34 percent by 1988. In March 2001, Congress passed the first of several Bush administration tax cuts that he hoped would stimulate the economy. There’s an ongoing debate about whether tax cuts for the wealthy help boost the economy. Most Republicans say tax cuts help business owners invest more in their companies and on workers. Many Democrats argue those in the highest income tax brackets need tax cuts the least. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, reluctantly agreed late last year to extend expiring Bush administration tax cuts for wealthy Americans for an additional two years. Obama said in a speech Wednesday that he wants to end those tax cuts as part of a plan to reduce the debt. Republicans quickly objected. Chambliss spokeswoman Bronwyn Lance Chester said her boss based his comments on federal revenue data from the Office of Management and Budget. The bulk of federal revenue, also called receipts, comes from individual income taxes. A portion comes from businesses in corporate taxes, and some federal revenue comes from taxes on Social Security. The OMB numbers show federal revenue rose from $769 billion in 1986 to $854 billion in 1987, the year after the Reagan-era tax changes were passed. It rose again in 1988 to $909 billion. The revenue change wasn’t as rosy following the 2001 tax cuts. In 2001, revenue was just below $2 trillion. The following year, revenue was $1.85 trillion. In 2003, revenue went even lower to $1.78 trillion. We also looked at revenue as a percentage of the nation’s gross domestic product. The percentage rose from 17.5 percent to 18.4 percent between fiscal years 1986 and 1987. It dropped slightly in 1988 to 18.2 percent. The percentage dropped from 19.5 percent in fiscal year 2001 to 17.6 percent in fiscal year 2002 and 16.2 percent in fiscal year 2003. The federal fiscal year runs from Oct. 1 to Sept. 30. Eric Toder, a former official in the U.S. Treasury Department, the Internal Revenue Service and the Congressional Budget Office, noted that the Reagan-era tax rate changes were not aimed at raising revenue, which is consistent with news reports from 1986. As for the Bush tax cuts, Toder, an institute fellow at the Washington-based Urban Institute, said it’s not accurate to claim there was an increase in revenue, pointing to the OMB’s revenue figures. Lance Chester told us revenue increases were "delayed due to the economic recession at the time." "But revenues did show a steady increase afterward," she added in an e-mail. Total revenue did not increase until 2004, according to the OMB data. Revenue as a percentage of the gross domestic product did not rise again until fiscal year 2005, OMB data show. We asked Toder and Sally Wallace, the chairwoman of Georgia State University’s economics department, whether Chambliss should get a pass on what he said about the Bush tax cuts, taking into consideration the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. They both said no, arguing it did not have a devastating impact on the economy. We were curious about what happened after another recent disaster in America. In fiscal year 2006, the year after Hurricane Katrina, revenue and its percentage of the gross domestic product actually increased, OMB data show. Wallace, a former Treasury Department official, looked at data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Brookings Institution, a well-known independent public policy foundation. Her numbers were slightly different with OMB’s but also led her to the conclusion that revenue rose in 1987 and fell in 2002. Wallace disagreed with the Chambliss camp’s argument about the recession’s impact on 2002 revenue, noting that they were still down in 2003 when the economy showed signs of growth. "Revenue should have rebounded after 2003, but it did not," she told us. We believe Chambliss is correct to say that federal revenue did rise after Reagan lowered individual income tax rates, but we note that his plan was aimed at being revenue-neutral. The numbers show federal revenue declined in the first two years after the 2001 Bush administration tax cuts, so the senator’s statement is off. The senator’s statement is partially accurate, but it omits some important details. Therefore, we rate it as Half-True.

pomt-03478	Currently, the intelligence community "can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/13/mark-udall/udall-says-americans-business-records-caught-surve/	While most Americans seem ready to support intelligence agencies casting a wide net against terrorists, they have some concerns about the scope of domestic surveillance. Congress began hearings on the surveillance of phone calls and Internet traffic that became public last week. On June 9, 2013, ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos aired footage of comments from Sen. Mark Udall, D-Colo. In a floor speech roughly two years ago, Udall urged his colleagues to narrow the reach of the USA Patriot Act, one of the key legal tools that allow the United States to gather intelligence. Udall had been briefed on the program that stored data on millions of phone calls made in the United States, but secrecy rules prohibited him from offering details. Instead, he warned broadly that the intelligence community "can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism." Udall’s office affirmed that they still reflect the senator’s position. So we wondered whether the law allows the intelligence community to legally "collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism." Udall cited Section 215 of the Patriot Act as the relevant part of the law. This provision was reportedly the one used by the government to obtain a broad sweep of "metadata" -- information on phone numbers, call durations and other information short of the actual conversations -- from Verizon customers. Section 215 allows the FBI to require "the production of any tangible things (including books, records, papers, documents, and other items) for an investigation to protect against international terrorism." However, the government faces some limits. The FBI must demonstrate to a special court, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, that it has reasonable grounds to believe that the tangible things being sought are relevant to an investigation involving terrorism. Approval must be renewed every three months. The law also requires steps to limit access to information beyond the scope of the investigation. After the Guardian published its article on the gathering of millions of phone records from Verizon customers, the director of national intelligence, James Clapper, addressed the "business records" provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. Clapper said the "program does not allow the government to listen in on anyone’s phone calls. The information acquired does not include the content of any communications or the identity of any subscriber. The only type of information acquired under the court’s order is telephony metadata, such as telephone numbers dialed and length of calls," Clapper said in a written statement. Gen. Keith Alexander, the head of the National Security Agency, acknowledged in a Senate hearing on June 12 that the NSA has collected millions of records under section 215. In short, the program that obtained the data on Verizon customers was deemed legal by the FISA court, and it produced what the government considered "business records" -- specifically, metadata. Information on millions of Americans was accessed, almost all of whom had no connection to terrorism. Udall’s claim appears accurate. Congress wrote the law and key lawmakers were kept apprised of the program; the FISA court approved it, apparently on multiple occasions. Former Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, an Intelligence Committee chairman until 2005, said the ongoing activity speaks to the soundness of its legal footing. "It is being done," Graham said. "Given the fact that it has not been successfully challenged in the courts, that would suggest that it is within the agency’s authority to do so." Steve Vladeck, professor of law at the American University Washington College of Law, concurred that the law seems to be on the government’s side. "Section 215 of the Patriot Act only requires that the data be ‘relevant’ to a national security/terrorism investigation, not that the individual whose data is seized have such a connection," Vladeck said. Still, we’ll point out a few things. First, just because the government is doing it and a court is approving it doesn’t mean that the metadata-collection program will be upheld as constitutional indefinitely. The American Civil Liberties Union has already begun to challenge the program, for instance. And the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a group focused on the intersection of technology and personal liberties, charged in a letter to Congress that the FISA court had overstepped its authority. The group said the government had failed to provide "reasonable grounds" for the collection of millions of Verizon telephone records. Second, there’s a distinction between collecting data and sifting through it. While the government has been storing phone call information in a giant database, it cannot legally access that information willy-nilly. Before it can drill down into actual phone calls, it has to meet a higher legal standard: The government must convince the court that it has a clear and reasonable suspicion that the calls are relevant to terrorist activity. Supporters of the program including the White House and lawmakers cite the need to get specific permission for database queries as an essential protection of individual privacy. Our ruling Udall said that currently, the intelligence community "can collect business records on law-abiding Americans who have no connection to terrorism." Recent news reports, which prompted acknowledgements by U.S. officials, confirm that intelligence agencies have been gathering a vast amount of phone metadata, which they argue falls under the category of business records. This metadata can be "collected" -- as Udall phrased it -- though it’s important to note that this data cannot be utilized directly in an investigation until a more stringent legal standard is met. Meanwhile, common sense tells us that millions of Americans who are having their metadata collected are not involved in terrorism, further bolstering Udall’s claim. Because this program was approved by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, it is, in a de facto sense, legal. That doesn’t mean the program wouldn’t be vulnerable to court challenges in the future, but until that happens, we rate the statement True.

pomt-07259	Says Republican-approved changes to "make it more difficult to participate in Ohio elections include reducing in-person early voting from 35 days to six."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/may/27/armond-budish/state-rep-armond-budish-says-gop-approved-changes-/	Ohio’s Republican-led House recently passed a set of voting regulations that overhaul the state’s elections system. The proposed changes in House Bill 194 include allowing voters to change their address online, requiring people casting provisional ballot to provide additional forms of identity, eliminating the requirement that poll workers direct voters in the wrong precinct to the correct one and prohibiting elections boards from mailing absentee ballots to voters. Among the controversial changes are new limits on early voting, which Democrats say amount to voter suppression. Republicans say the state needs more uniform voting regulations and less costly ways to manage elections. Under the bill, voting by mail is cut to 21 days before an election, from 35 now. And in-person voting would be restricted to 10 days before an election. This last point was one of several Democratic House Leader Armond Budish of Beachwood, railed against in a news release on May 18, the day the bill passed along party lines. "Changes in House Bill 194 that make it more difficult to participate in Ohio elections include reducing in-person early voting from 35 days to 6," he said. PolitiFact Ohio wondered how Budish came up with six days, given that the bill says 10 days. Specifically the House Bill 194 reads: "For all voters who are applying to vote absent voter’s ballots in person, ballots shall be printed and ready for use beginning on the tenth day before the day of the election." So how does Budish come up with 6 days? His chief of staff, Keary McCarthy, said pay close attention to the bill’s language. The bill goes on to say that in-person voting is prohibited on Sundays and must end the Friday before Election Day. Applying these restrictions to the 10 day-period, four days become off limits to voters: The first and last Sunday in the period and the Saturday and Monday immediately preceding Election Day. The Ohio Senate, also controlled by Republicans, passed Senate Bill 148 that also makes significant changes to the election laws and processes. It mirrors the House Bill in many ways but offers some differences, which will be worked out in coming days among Republican leaders representing both chambers. One of the differences between the two bills concerns in-person voting. The Senate’s version calls for in-person voting to begin 16 days before Election Day. But this window is also squeezed by prohibiting voting on Sundays and on the Saturday and Monday before Election Day. It also requires elections boards to close Saturday voting at noon. The House version allows for voting until 6 p.m. Applying these restrictions, the Senate bill takes away five days, leaving 11 days for in-person voting. Returning to the House bill and Budish’s assessment, his statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. On the Truth-O-Meter, Politifact Ohio rates his claim True.

pomt-02216	Women are paid 77 cents for every $1 men get for the same work.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2014/apr/21/jason-carter/carters-pay-gap-claim-strays-track/	What about Jason? That was the question one of our Twitter followers had for us shortly after we rated former President Jimmy Carter’s claim that women make 23 percent less than men for doing the same work Mostly False. Hasn’t Carter’s grandson Jason, a state senator from DeKalb County and Democratic candidate for governor, been saying the same thing? "What will @PolitiFactGA say about @carter4governor repeating the same falsehood as his grandpappy?" asked the political website, Georgia Unfiltered. We decided to take a look. Many Democrats have complained about a gender pay gap in what some analysts say is an effort to increase support among women as the congressional elections take place this fall. On April 8, Jason Carter’s Twitter account had a message about the pay gap. "Women are paid 77¢ for every $1 men get for the same work. (Retweet) if you agree women should get equal pay for equal work," it said. Carter posted a similar message on his Facebook campaign page the same day. "Women are still paid 77 cents for every dollar that men make for doing the same work. That's not OK. Share if you agree we should have equal pay for equal work," it read. Some questioned Carter’s claim on his Twitter page, while others backed him up. So is candidate Carter correct? We believe, like his grandfather, part of his statements clouded the accuracy of his claim. The claims by Jason Carter and others stem from a U.S. Census Bureau survey released in 2011. The study found women’s total wages were about 23 percent lower than the total amount of men's wages. But that large discrepancy was due in part to the fact that men generally work more hours. The study did not attempt to look at equal pay for the same work or the same number of hours worked. Other data -- including hourly wages tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, as well as data comparing the same jobs -- yield smaller wage gaps. The number does not take into account critical factors that could influence the figure, including specific occupation, time on the job and education level. And the gap drops dramatically if you compare men and women of similar education levels, job titles, time on the job and other relevant factors. Economists at the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis cited one survey, prepared for the Labor Department. It found that when such differences are accounted for, much of the hourly wage gap vanished. It shrinks to the low single digits. President Barack Obama, himself, made a verbal misstep on the campaign trail in 2012 when he said "women (are) paid 77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men." Our colleagues at PolitiFact in Washington rated that statement Mostly False for many of the same reasons we gave the same rating to the former president. Perhaps seeing the trouble with that statement, Obama said in his 2014 State of the Union address that women "make 77 cents for every dollar a man earns." That statement is more in line with the U.S. Census Bureau study because the president did not say that women were doing the same work and being underpaid. PolitiFact found other research that showed a smaller pay gap. PolitiFact rated Obama’s revised statement Mostly True. Bryan Thomas, a spokesman for Carter, told us via email that the candidate "believes it's wrong that women get paid less than men and is the candidate in this race who wants to do something to fix that problem." To sum up, Jason Carter said women were being paid 77 cents for every $1 men received for the same work. The widely cited U.S. Census Bureau study, though, did not attempt to look at equal pay for the same work or the same number of hours worked. Other federal data show smaller gaps when considering the specific occupation, time on the job and educational levels. Carter’s statements omit many of these factors. We rate it Mostly False.

pomt-14100	The University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee has "2.8 students per faculty" member, "tied for second-lowest in its history since 1994."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2016/may/13/scott-walker/scott-walker-way-saying-university-wisconsin-milwa/	Not to get all inside-baseball, but news releases issued by Gov. Scott Walker are usually pretty plain, like the white chalk lines that meet at home plate. So, it was a surprise to see Walker’s May 10, 2016 release about the faculty at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, which arrived like a pitch thrown at a batter’s chin. Walker called a no-confidence vote being taken that day by the Milwaukee faculty a mere "fuss." The professors were expressing "their collective groan" about budgeting and "job-for-life tenure." The school "should not be about protecting the interests of the faculty, but about delivering value and excellence to Wisconsin." For a Walker news release, pretty vitriolic stuff. But in another way, the release was more typical, as it was filled with bullets of factual claims -- including this one, about the ratio of students to faculty at UW-Milwaukee: "At 2.8 students per faculty," the release declared, "average student enrollment per instructor is currently tied for second-lowest in its history since 1994." Fewer than three students for every faculty member? That would be a swing and a miss. No-confidence votes UW-Milwaukee’s total enrollment of 27,000 (22,000 undergraduates) makes it the second-largest school, behind UW-Madison (43,000 and 31,000), in the University of Wisconsin System. The system is overseen by members of the Board of Regents, nearly all of whom are appointed by the governor. Since Walker took office in 2011, the system campuses have received budget cuts and professors have seen tenure protections partially weakened. Those are key reasons for a series of no-confidence votes directed at the UW System, beginning with one approved by UW-Madison faculty eight days before the UW-Milwaukee vote. Walker’s pre-emptive statement was issued less than two hours before nearly 300 Milwaukee faculty members unanimously passed their no-confidence vote. That represented roughly 40 percent of the full-time faculty. Walker’s figure To back the 2.8 ratio claim, Walker’s office cited a UW System chart on "average individual instruction." The latest figure, for fall 2013, shows a ratio of 2.8 for UW-Milwaukee. But that is not a ratio of the total students per faculty member, as Walker says in the news release. It is a much narrower measure. As the chart itself explains, that is the ratio is for "individualized instruction, such as independent study or thesis research." Indeed, you would expect a ratio of 2.8 students per faculty member for such one-on-one-style instruction. But Milwaukee’s overall ratio is much different. The actual ratio Robin Van Harpen, UW-Milwaukee’s vice chancellor for finance and administrative affairs, gave us figures for fall 2015. Using full-time-equivalents, the school had 22,491 total students and 779 faculty (faculty being full, associate and assistant professors). That’s a student-to-faculty ratio of 29 to 1. Moreover, in 1994, the year Walker referenced in his news release, the ratio was actually lower: 21 to 1. And it has steadily trended upward since then. In other words, the ratio of students to faculty at UW-Milwaukee is growing, not shrinking. Two final points: Lecturers and adjunct instructors, who also teach, are not considered faculty. But if you include them in the count, the current ratio is 19 to 1 -- still far above what Walker claimed. The day after the Milwaukee vote, Walker’s office essentially corrected itself in a statement on a no-confidence vote at UW-Green Bay. The statement cited the same 2.8 statistic as it applied to Green Bay -- but added a line to make clear that the ratio referred only to individualized instruction. Our rating Charging that the ratio of students to faculty at UW-Milwaukee is shrinking, Walker said the school has "2.8 students per faculty" member, "tied for second-lowest in its history since 1994." But Walker cited the wrong statistic. In fact, UW-Milwaukee has 29 students for every professor, associate professor and assistant professor -- and that ratio has been growing, not shrinking, since 1994. For a statement that is false and ridiculous, our rating is Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9b0f3e97-bf70-4e81-9fcb-0e2efdd28a55	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2016-05-13T12:16:40	2016-05-10	['None']

pomt-11438	Say Sean Hannity said in 2008 that Obama’s willingness to meet with North Korea was "disturbing" while Trump’s "willingness to meet with North Korea is a huge foreign policy win."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/14/blog-posting/hannitys-double-standard-north-korea-trump-and-oba/	An image shared widely on Facebook and Reddit chides Fox News host Sean Hannity for having a double standard on presidents talking to North Korea. It says that in 2008 Hannity said that President Barack Obama’s "willingness to meet with North Korea is one of the most disturbing displays of Obama’s lack of foreign policy experience." But in 2018, Hannity said President Donald Trump’s "willingness to meet with North Korea is a huge foreign policy win." We hit the transcripts and video files. For the most part, those words accurately reflect what Hannity said. 2008 and Obama A week before Election Day 2008, Hannity gave 10 reasons not to vote for Obama. No. 2 on his list concerned talking to unfriendly regimes. "One of the most disturbing displays of Obama's lack of foreign policy expertise came during last year's YouTube debate," Hannity said Oct. 26, 2008. "The junior senator from Illinois gave what many called a naive answer for a question from the audience about whether he would meet with the leaders of Syria, Venezuela, Cuba or North Korea without preconditions." Asked during that debate if he would be willing to meet with those leaders without preconditions, Obama said "I would," and compared that to previous presidents. "Ronald Reagan and Democratic presidents like JFK constantly spoke to the Soviet Union at a time when Ronald Reagan called them an evil empire," Obama said. "And the reason is because they understood that we may not trust them and they may pose an extraordinary danger to this country, but we had the obligation to find areas where we can potentially move forward." The image mentioned only North Korea, while Hannity listed several countries. 2018 and Trump When news broke that Trump was open to meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, Hannity voiced support. "A huge foreign policy win for President Trump," Hannity said March 8. "Little Rocket Man blinks. Now, the president’s tough rhetoric, his bold action, his severe sanctions, they appear to be working tonight. President Trump is accepting an invitation to meet with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un by May, and Pyongyang is agreeing to stop all nuclear and missile tests while these talks are underway. And the sanctions? They will continue." So the text in the image matches what Hannity said. But his criticism of Obama and his praise for Trump came in the context of different policies. Importance of preconditions Obama’s policy on North Korea grew more complicated over time. But initially, it was fairly simple, said Penn State international affairs professor Joseph DeThomas. Preconditions meant that in order for talks to happen, North Korea had to agree that the purpose was the complete denuclearization of North Korea. "During the campaign and early in his term Obama was very open to talks without preconditions," DeThomas said. For Trump, the picture is murkier. When Trump tweeted that he would meet with Kim Jong Un, North Korea had not taken any steps toward denuclearization. He said they had "talked" about it. "Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean representatives, not just a freeze," Trump wrote. "Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But for North Korea, denuclearization applies to the entire peninsula, which has implications for the American presence and military posture in South Korea. That is not the same as simply agreeing to a North Korea without nukes. DeThomas said testing halts are customary during talks with North Korea. Beyond that, North Korea made no concessions or took any steps toward ending its nuclear program. Trump has imposed stricter sanctions and has been more ready to hint at using military force against North Korea. But in terms of having direct talks between the leaders of both nations, DeThomas said this administration set a lower bar than what previous presidents have demanded. "The Trump precondition for talks was that North Korea had to halt nuclear and missile testing for some unspecified period of time prior to commencement of talks," DeThomas said. " In February, Vice President Mike Pence drew headlines when he said sanctions and direct talks could happen at the same time. To some observers, that meant the administration was willing to talk without the precondition of North Korea agreeing to a future free of nukes. DeThomas characterized such words as "loosey goosey," but not indicative of a major change. In that regard, when Hannity praised Trump, the administration’s overall policy was tougher than what Obama had articulated when he ran for president. But the fact remains that Trump had agreed to a meeting before North Korea had taken any concrete steps toward ridding itself of nuclear weapons. Our ruling The side-by-side quotes cast Hannity as criticizing Obama for being willing to talk to North Korea while praising Trump for his willingness to do the same thing. The quotations are pretty much accurate. But the image glosses over the different policy preferences of each man at the time Hannity spoke. In 2008, Obama said simply there were no preconditions for a meeting with the leader. In 2018, Trump’s administration voiced some relaxation on preconditions, but not a full rejection of them. At the same time, Trump agreed to a meeting before North Korea had done more than agree to hold off on testing during any talks. The image leaves out some context, but overall, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-01138	Since the United States began negotiations with Iran, "that's probably the first year and a half in which Iran has not advanced its nuclear program in the last decade."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/dec/21/barack-obama/obama-iran-has-not-advanced-nuclear-ambitions-us-n/	When you close out the year by ditching America’s 50-year isolation of Cuba, you can expect a few broader questions about your style on the international stage. President Barack Obama said in a year-end interview with CNN’s Candy Crowley that he has been "consistent in saying that where we can solve problems diplomatically, we should do so." Crowley pressed Obama to respond to the charge that he is too willing to cut deals that produce little in return for the United States. "The gist of it is that you're naive and they're rolling you," Crowley said, speaking of other world leaders. Obama shot back that on a couple of major fronts, his track record is looking pretty good. Russia now has a crisis on its hands as its economy stalls and the value of the ruble tumbles. On Iran, the president said there have been real gains. "Over the last year and a half, since we began negotiations with them, that's probably the first year and a half in which Iran has not advanced its nuclear program in the last decade," Obama said. The fear that Iran is developing nuclear weapons, a charge that Iran denies, has bedeviled the international community for over 15 years. We decided to take a closer look at whether Iran’s program has advanced or not. We found general agreement that in terms of curtailing the means to produce enriched uranium and plutonium, the essential fuels needed for an atomic bomb, negotiations between the United States, Iran and other United Nations countries contributed to real progress. However, some analysts define Iran’s nuclear program more broadly to include suspected efforts to design nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles. The negotiations don’t address those elements, however, and what Iran is doing or has done in that area is subject to much debate. By way of refresher, in November 2013, the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council, plus Germany, and Iran signed an agreement that temporarily stopped or rolled back Iran’s production of potentially weapons grade nuclear material. In November 2014, that agreement was extended by four months, with some additional restrictions on Iran. In exchange, Iran has been able to sell more of its oil and gain access to millions of dollars that had been frozen in overseas bank accounts. The key elements in the agreements Negotiators focused on nuclear fuel. This had three main aspects. Stopping the production and accumulation of uranium enriched to the 20 percent level of the isotope U-235 and converting a large fraction of what it had to a form harder to use in a weapon. Stop the installation of additional centrifuge machines at Iran’s two enrichment facilities. Centrifuges are essential to the enrichment process. Put the brakes on construction of Iran’s heavy water reactor in Arak. If it were operational, this reactor could produce enough plutonium in its spent fuel for one to two nuclear warheads. Importantly, Iran agreed to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency. That agency has found that Iran complied with the terms of the original November 2013 agreement. In its November 2014 report, the agency said, "All of the enrichment related activities at Iran’s declared facilities are under Agency safeguards, and all of the nuclear material, installed cascades, and feed and withdrawal stations at those facilities are subject to Agency containment and surveillance." To be clear, Iran continues to enrich uranium, but only to the level of 5 percent of U-235, a form that falls well short of the needs of weapon makers. Regarding heavy water facilities, the IAEA said that Iran had not stopped all work across all of its heavy water projects, but it had not installed any major components. What the experts say As far as nuclear material is concerned, the experts we reached said the agreements successfully, though perhaps only temporarily, curtailed production. "When President Obama says that for the first time in the past decade Iran has not advanced its nuclear program he is correct," said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a research group that advocates for arms control policies. "Leading up to the interim deal, Iran had nearly amassed enough 20 percent enriched uranium gas, which when further enriched to weapons grade is enough for one bomb." That material is no longer available, Kimball said. Matthew Bunn, a principal investigator with the Project on Managing the Atom at Harvard University’s Kennedy School, also said Obama basically has it right on Iran. "They don’t have any more equipment in place for producing bomb material than they had a year and a half ago," Bunn said. David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, a Washington-based group that aims to stop the spread of nuclear weapons, offered a more qualified view. Albright called progress on enrichment, centrifuges and the heavy water facilities in Arak, a "great accomplishment." But Albright noted that, "Iran continues to run almost 10,000 centrifuges, enriching and stockpiling 3.5 percent low enriched uranium." And Iran’s research on advanced centrifuges, with limits, is ongoing. Albright is also concerned that Iran has so far not allowed the international inspectors the access they need to learn more about any nuclear weapons research Iran had in the past. Matthew Kroenig, a professor of international relations at Georgetown University, also focused on the weapons side of the equation. Kroenig noted that the agreements that limited and rolled back the production of nuclear-grade material were silent on this front. "Iran's missile production continues, and we are uncertain about the nuclear weapons design work, although many experts believe that continues as well," Kroenig said. But Kroenig also described curtailing the production of nuclear fuel as the "most important" piece of the nonproliferation effort with Iran. Two notes on the time elements mentioned in Obama’s comments. He said this is the first time in a decade that Iran’s nuclear program did not advance. Iran restarted its uranium enrichment program in 2005. That would mean it has been a bit over nine years. Also, the president’s year and a half is a bit of a stretch. The first agreement with Iran was signed barely over a year ago, although the terms were announced earlier. Our ruling Obama said that we have seen "probably the first year and a half in which Iran has not advanced its nuclear program in the last decade." The agreement signed in November 2013 has made it harder for Iran to produce weapons-grade nuclear material. International observers report that Iran complied with the terms of the temporary agreement. The amount of enriched uranium is less, and the country’s facilities to produce weapons-grade material has been curtailed. But that does not mean the country has completely stopped all activities that could produce nuclear weapons material in the future. There is also concern about broader aspects of a nuclear weapons program, such as weapons design and missile development. We rate Obama’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-07587	Central Health "is the only hospital district in Texas that spends taxpayer dollars on abortions."	true	/texas/statements/2011/mar/26/wayne-christian/state-rep-wayne-christian-says-central-health-trav/	State Rep. Wayne Christian is behind legislation prohibiting hospital districts from using tax dollars to fund abortions, but the ban would affect just one hospital district statewide, according to the Republican from Center. "Currently the Travis County Healthcare District, known as Central Health, is the only hospital district in Texas that spends taxpayer dollars on abortions," he said in a March 15 press release. The only one? Responding to our query for more information, Jon McClellan, Christian’s chief of staff, passed on an e-mail from Joe Pojman, executive director of Texas Alliance for Life. "We know of no other hospital district that pays for elective abortions (abortions for reasons other than to save the mother’s life)," Pojman said. "To our knowledge, the only other hospital district that funded elective abortions was in Tarrant County, and they changed their policy to not fund elective abortions approximately 20 years ago." Pojman told us that he based his conclusion on news stories and websites for hospital districts in several counties, including Harris, Dallas, Tarrant, Bexar and Nueces. "None list abortion as a service provided," he said. "We also inquired with individuals in several other counties knowledgeable about their local hospital districts. All believe their local hospital districts do not fund abortions." Next, we contacted the Travis County hospital district, which was created in 2004 following a countywide vote. Central Health operates the Medical Assistance Program, which Austin created in the 1970s to provide low-income residents with subsidized health care services. According to its website, Central Health arranges health care services for Travis County residents who aren’t eligible for other insurance programs. Residents at or below the federal poverty line can qualify for full benefits, according to the site. Spokeswoman Christie Garbe told us that she couldn’t speak for other districts but said Central Health uses tax dollars to fund abortions. "Austin and Travis County has a long history of funding reproductive health services for women — the full range of health services," she said. The Central Health board voted unanimously in December 2009 to renew a $450,000, five-year contract with agencies to provide pregnancy termination services and counseling, according to a September 2010 Austin American-Statesman news article. Abortion funding accounts for less than half of 1 percent of Central Health’s $102.6 million budget for fiscal year 2011, Garbe said. About 60 percent of Central Health’s budget is funded from property taxes, Garbe said. The rest is funded by other revenue, including money from tobacco settlements and leasing income from hospitals the district owns, such as University Medical Center Brackenridge. Next, we tried to gauge whether other hospital districts put tax dollars toward abortions. Christine Mann, a spokeswoman at the Texas Department of State Health Services, told us the agency doesn’t track hospital district funding sources. But Mann pointed out that some facilities may provide abortions to women who are insured through Medicaid. Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman with the Texas Department of Health and Human Services, told us that in 2010, the Texas Medicaid program paid for one abortion in Brownsville. "In that case, the mother’s life was in danger," she said. Texas follows the federal standard imposed by the Hyde Amendment in 1976, which allows Medicaid funding for abortion only in cases of rape, incest and life endangerment. Goodman couldn’t tell us in what facility the Brownsville abortion took place because the agency tracks such Medicaid payments through individual medical claims — private information it can’t release, she said. Next, short of calling every hospital district statewide — Texas Hospital Association spokeswoman Amanda Engler said there are about 180 — we asked several in Texas’ larger cities whether they fund abortions with tax dollars. Candace White, a spokeswoman with Parkland Health and Hospital System in Dallas, told us that while Parkland funds reproductive services with some tax money, abortions aren’t included. Melinda Muse, a spokeswoman with tax-supported Harris County Hospital District in Houston, likewise said the nonprofit doesn’t subsidize abortions. Martha Althoff-Olivas, a spokeswoman with the University Medical Center of El Paso, told us the district doesn’t perform abortions unless the mother’s life is in danger. If the woman was insured through Medicaid, she assumed the procedure would be covered, she said. Both Diana Carroll, a spokeswoman with JPS Health Network in Fort Worth, and Leni Kirkman, a spokeswoman with University Health System in San Antonio, told us their districts don’t offer abortion services at all. Vicki Saporta, president of the National Abortion Federation, which represents abortion providers, said: "To our knowledge, no other hospital district in Texas provides coverage for medically-necessary abortion care for low-income women. However, federal Medicaid funds cover abortions in cases of rape, incest or life endangerment at Texas hospitals that are enrolled in Medicaid providers." A December 2009 Statesman news article also says Central Health "is now the only government entity in Texas that uses public money for abortions." Another December 2009 Statesman news article quotes Megan Peterson, director of advocacy for the Boston-based National Network of Abortion Funds, saying: "This idea of the city setting aside money to help pay for this is definitely unique to Austin." Admittedly, we haven’t checked every hospital district in the state, but we’ve found no information contrary to Christian’s statement. We rate this statement as True.

pomt-07043	Ethanol reduced gas prices by 89 cents per gallon in 2010, and if ethanol disappeared, gas prices could rise by as much as 92 percent.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/01/renewable-fuels-association/industry-warns-gas-prices-would-rise-89-cents-with/	We recently noticed an advertisement in the Washington, D.C. Metro system that made a striking claim about ethanol -- an alcohol made from fermented corn that is added to gasoline, usually comprising 10 percent of a gallon. First, some background to help explain the context of the ad. Supporters and critics of ethanol have battled for years over the wisdom of continuing longstanding ethanol subsidies. Currently, the Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit, or VEETC, offers a credit $0.45 for every gallon of ethanol blended with gasoline. The credit had been scheduled to expire at the end of 2010, but Congress extended it for another year. On June 16, 2011, the U.S. Senate approved legislation to end the VEETC subsidy, as well as end a separate, 54-cent-per-gallon tariff on imported ethanol. While the Senate measure is not expected to become law, it re-energized the debate over ethanol subsidies. With the law’s looming sunset at the end of 2011, the debate is likely to continue for at least the rest of this year. Those who favor rolling back ethanol subsidies argue that a roughly $6 billion subsidy is unsustainable given today’s rising national debt. However, the ethanol industry, represented by a group called the Renewable Fuels Association, has made an aggressive counterattack, arguing that ethanol is vital to keeping a lid on gasoline prices -- potentially a potent issue for Americans as gasoline hovers between $3 and $4 per gallon. The trade group's Metro station advertisement mirrors other information available on the group’s website. It says, "Ethanol reduced gas prices by 89 cents per gallon in 2010. Ethanol reduced the average American’s household gasoline bill by more than $800. If ethanol disappeared, gas prices could rise by as much as 92 percent." We checked these figures first with the Renewable Fuels Association, and then with outside experts. The RFA cited a study by two economists -- Xiaodong Du from the University of Wisconsin and Dermot J. Hayes of Iowa State University -- published in April 2011. Using mathematical modeling, the study concluded that in 2010, the presence of ethanol reduced gasoline prices by 89 cents per gallon. Meanwhile, the study said, if ethanol production came to an immediate halt, the estimated gasoline price increase would range from 41 percent to 92 percent. Meanwhile, the trade group extrapolated from the paper’s findings to produce the claim that "ethanol reduced the average American’s household gasoline bill by more than $800." "In 2010 alone, ethanol reduced the average American household’s gasoline bill by more than $800," RFA said in a news release, citing data from the Federal Highway Administration, the Environmental Protection Agency, and the Energy Department showing that the average American household consumed 900 gallons of gasoline at an average price of $2.74 per gallon in 2010. The group calculated that the average family’s annual gasoline bill was $2,470, an amount that would have been closer to $3,270 without ethanol. So RFA can point to a study by two university economists to back up its numbers. But what is the group leaving out? We’ll point out a few concerns. The study’s funding. In the paper, the authors acknowledged the Renewable Fuel Association "for their financial support." This doesn’t mean the study is right or wrong, but it does mean that the RFA is quoting research it helped support financially, so the findings deserve independent scrutiny. Choice of time period. The paper cited the 89 cent figure for 2010, but it also offered a longer-term calculation that’s less eye-popping, since it’s not based on a short period in which gasoline prices happened to be unusually high. Specifically, between January 2000 to December 2010, the authors found, ethanol reduced gasoline prices by 25 cents per gallon nationally. That’s still a notable amount -- and the ad’s wording accurately described the figure they were using -- but 25 cents per gallon is less than one-third the amount it was in 2010. This means that RFA was highlighting a time period that made the claim more striking. The paper poses an unrealistic scenario. The Senate bill would not have touched other federal laws that encourage ethanol production, including a "renewable fuel standard" initiated in 2005 that requires transportation fuel to contain a certain amount of renewable fuel blended with gasoline. So the standard by which the RFA-backed paper made its assumptions -- that "ethanol production came to an immediate halt" -- is not plausible in the real world. "This is a fantasy study dreamed up to answer a question that no one has asked: What would happen if ethanol disappeared?" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a group that has been critical of ethanol subsidies. "We are not arguing that ethanol should cease to exist, just that it make its way in the marketplace. Studies have clearly shown that absent subsidies like the tax credit and the mandate, there would be ethanol production. So it is irrelevant." To back up his claim that legislation now under consideration wouldn’t kill off the ethanol industry, Ellis pointed to research by Bruce A. Babcock, director of the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State University. Babcock cited a study he co-wrote with an Iowa State colleague, Jacinto F. Fabiosa. They found that between 2005 and 2009, margins in the ethanol industry were wide enough that "a large expansion in U.S. corn ethanol production would have occurred even if the subsidies and mandates had not been in place. The reason is that the return on investment in ethanol would have been so high that investors still would have brought their capital to the industry." The ad focuses on short-term impacts and ignores long-term impacts. Babcock said a big part of why ethanol production has kept gasoline prices low is that it has kept U.S. oil refineries, and to some extent world refineries, from having to operate at full capacity. That matters because when refineries operate at full capacity, they are able to charge higher prices. And if demand rises high enough, they’d have to pay to build new refinery capacity. But while Babcock says this "is a credible short-term and medium-term argument, over the longer term," oil companies would adjust their capacity so that "over time, the impact of ethanol on gas prices should shrink." Similarly, while the trade association is almost certainly correct that a price shock would result from a sudden disappearance of ethanol -- which, as we said, is a highly unlikely scenario -- the experts we spoke to said that a new equilibrium would eventually be reached, and that equilibrium would likely produce cost increases well below the immediate, price-shock figures cited in the trade group’s ad. RFA ignores other negative impacts of the subsidies in the economy. For starters, there is evidence that subsidies for corn used in ethanol have raised corn prices and, in turn, hiked prices for agricultural sectors that rely on corn for feed, such as beef production. While estimates of the impact have varied, the Congressional Budget Office estimated in a 2009 study that "the increased use of ethanol accounted for about 10 percent to 15 percent of the rise in food prices between April 2007 and April 2008. In turn, that increase will boost federal spending for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly the Food Stamp program) and child nutrition programs by an estimated $600 million to $900 million in fiscal year 2009." In addition, RFA’s ad doesn’t account for "all the coal, natural gas, diesel fuel, soil, ground water, etc., that were used up to produce ethanol," said Tad Patzek, an engineering professor at the University of Texas. "These valuable raw materials could have been used differently to produce more electricity, more food, lessen soil erosion (and) limit ground- and surface water contamination. All of these activities would be beneficial for the country, far outweighing a marginal and temporary increase of gasoline’s cost if ethanol subsidies were withdrawn suddenly, and its production collapsed." Finally, the ad doesn’t factor in roughly $6 billion direct hit to the Treasury (and, indirectly, to American taxpayers) from the subsidies, even though any comprehensive balance-sheet anaysis would include that. When we presented the gist of our analysis to the Renewable Fuels Association, the group made several points. Officials said they used the 2010 figures because they’re most relevant to current price conditions. They said that using their model, even a 25-cent increase in gasoline prices would amount to $34.5 billion per year in added costs for gasoline -- "far outweighing" the annual cost of VEETC. The group also argued that it’s unfair to include factors outside of the scope of a brief advertisement that focuses squarely on gasoline prices. "The ad focuses on gas prices," said Geoff Cooper, vice president of research and analysis with the Renewable Fuels Association. "Not food prices. Not corn prices. Not the cost of VEETC. Not lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions and energy use. We are more than willing to engage in a thoughtful discussion on those issues, but they are outside the scope of the paper on which the ad is based." If you include other factors beyond gasoline prices, fairness "would require you" to note that "the production and use of 13 billion gallons of ethanol last year helped create more than 400,000 jobs across the economy from agriculture to manufacturing to the service sector. Nearly 70,400 American are directly involved in the production of ethanol," said Christina Martin, executive vice president of the Renewable Fuels Association. Ethanol production adds nearly $54 billion to the nation’s gross domestic product, she said. Finally, on the issue of whether the immediate end to ethanol is realistic, Cooper said that "there have been recent calls to repeal the renewable fuel standard, kill the tax credit, and essentially undo all of the entire industry’s policy foundation. So, it is not entirely ‘unrealistic’ to envision a scenario in which ethanol production is significantly curtailed." Still, we’re not convinced. While the Senate bill would have ended certain subsidies, it would not have banned production outright, and even the changes proposed in the Senate bill would not have touched the renewable fuel standard, which aids the ethanol industry and ensures its partial or even complete survival. Even if more sweeping changes than those in the Senate bill were imposed, independent experts tell us that the likelihood of the industry’s sudden collapse would be remote. So while changing or eliminating the law on ethanol subsidies might have an impact on prices at the pump, it’s highly unlikely that the industry would cease to exist -- so the immediate impact on gasoline prices would be less than 89 cents, and even lower as markets adjust in the longer term. We rate the Renewable Fuels Association claim Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Renewable Fuels Association	None	None	None	2011-07-01T06:39:25	2011-06-22	['None']
pomt-01045	Online voter registration is a "more secure" way of doing voter registration.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2015/jan/23/jeff-clemens/online-voter-registration-more-secure-florida-stat/	Florida lawmakers have overhauled many aspects of our elections laws in recent years, but one aspect has remained untouched: Voters can’t register online. The statewide association of elections supervisors, which represents officials in both major parties, wants lawmakers to change that during the upcoming session. Supporters of the legislation argue one of the benefits is that it’s more secure. "This is actually just simply a more secure, accurate and cost-efficient way of doing voter registration," said Sen. Jeff Clemens, D-Lake Worth, said at a Senate Ethics and Elections committee hearing Jan. 20. Clemens is sponsoring a bill for the upcoming session. Pasco Supervisor of Elections Brian Corley, a Republican in favor of online registration, made similar remarks at the hearing. Citing information from a former elections official in Arizona -- the first state to use online registration -- Corley said that "there is a reduction in fraud." Is online registration more secure? We decided to check it out. The current system Today, Florida voters fill out a paper form and submit it to a county elections official, or an entity such as a third-party group can submit it for them. Additionally, under the National Voting Rights Act (also known as "Motor Voter"), a person can verbally relay their voter registration information while applying for a driver’s license. Traditional paper registration opens up the window for fraud or errors in multiple ways, according to Tammy Patrick, an elections expert at the Bipartisan Policy Center and former elections official in Maricopa County, Ariz. Some voters hand over personal information to strangers who sign up voters, and it may sit around somewhere until submitted several days or weeks later. Then elections officials have to decipher the forms and input the information. (In Florida, third parties must submit forms within 10 days.) With online registration, the exchange and verification of information happens immediately. Clemens’ bill would allow applicants to submit their voter registration applications online, and the state would compare the information with driver’s license records. Floridians could still choose to register to vote by paper. Many advocates of online voter registration say that it saves money, reduces the opportunity for errors from data entry or illegible handwriting and has been successfully used in both blue and red states. We’ll dive more into the security issues below. At least 20 states currently offer online voter registration for new applicants and a few more are in the works. The Presidential Commission on Election Administration, co-chaired by lawyers for the campaigns of Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, recommended online registration in their 2014 report. A research report from the Pew Charitable Trusts concluded that online registration systems "reduce the potential for fraud while improving the accuracy of voter rolls. All states have security procedures and protocols in place, including data encryption and tracking, while limiting those who have access to their system internally. No state has reported a security breach, including Arizona, where voters have been registering online for more than a decade." How much fraud has occurred nationwide in terms of paper registration? That is difficult to quantify because it depends on how someone defines "fraud." Some fraudulent applications are rejected by elections officials (for example, Mickey Mouse), while others might get registered but then not vote. In 2008, ACORN in Florida turned over to law enforcement hundreds of registration applications collected by some of their workers that they deemed suspicious -- including one for the deceased actor Paul Newman. But those forms were never filed with elections officials, and ACORN, a liberal group, later disbanded amid nationwide problems. In 2012, the Republican Party of Florida fired vendor Strategic Allied Consulting amid reports of fraudulent registration forms. Wendy Underhill, an elections expert at the National Conference of State Legislatures, says comparing security in online and paper systems is like comparing apples and oranges. "When people talk about security for online voter registration systems, they’re thinking of hacking and cyber security breaches," she said. "When people talk about security for paper-based registration, the questions are whether the registration application is transmitted to the elections people or never quite makes it there, and whether data from the forms is taken by the groups doing registration drives, and is that secure." Cybersecurity experts have raised some concerns about a couple of state systems, including Maryland. In 2012, cybersecurity experts wrote to Maryland officials suggesting they take steps to better protect the online system. The driver’s license number is based on a formula involving the voter’s name and date of birth -- so the experts said that if someone had that information, they could alter the registration. (Security experts raised similar concerns about the system in Washington state.) No security breach actually occurred, said Nikki Charlson, Maryland’s deputy state administration for the elections board. However, in response, the state now requires that applicants provide additional information, including their Social Security number and date that their driver’s license was issued. (Washington election officials told us they didn’t have a breach either but have since made changes.) Loyola Law school professor Justin Levitt, an expert on election administration, told PolitiFact Florida that it is difficult to make direct quantifiable comparisons between online and paper systems. "In my rough sense of the comparative frequency and magnitude of the risks, I'd agree with the Florida state senator that online registration ends up more secure, accurate, and cost-efficient, as he says," Levitt said. "But I doubt you'll find anyone who's got a reliable study directly comparing the security of the two different methods, just because the precise rate of security breaches is so difficult to assess. (Indeed, it's more difficult to assess in the offline system than the online one.) It's certainly true that the most publicized significant breaches in the past have been with the offline system -- but that's the system states have been deploying for a whole lot longer." Hans Von Spakovsky, an elections expert who works for the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that online registration for individuals for whom the state already has a record, such as driver’s license information, is not a problem. That’s the method recommended by the presidential commission. "You will find that the states that have implemented online registration have almost all limited it to registration for individuals for whom there is already an existing state record that has been verified and where there is an existing signature," he said. The National Republican Lawyers Association is among the groups that support online voter registration. "When designed and implemented properly, online registration can be a more secure, accurate and cost-efficient way of doing voter registration," said Michael B. Thielen, the executive director. Our ruling Clemens said that online voter registration is a "a more secure" way of doing voter registration. Experts who study online registration say there have been no reports of actual security breaches or fraud. If designed in a way to account for security, online registration reduces opportunities for fraud and errors. However, experts warned that both online and paper systems can have potential pitfalls -- the question is how do elections officials protect each system. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-01420	"The only candidate pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal is Mitch McConnell."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/oct/08/alison-lundergan-grimes/alison-lundergan-grimes-says-mitch-mcconnell-not-s/	Not everyone agrees there’s a war on coal, as Republicans often charge, but there’s no question there’s a war over the war on coal in Kentucky’s high-profile Senate race. For months, Democrat Alison Lundergan Grimes and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell have lobbed accusations at each other, saying their opponent is too weak in supporting the state’s abundant fossil fuel. The latest salvo comes from Grimes, who has sustained accusations by McConnell that she wouldn’t fight back against the Environmental Protection Agency’s new proposal for regulating carbon emissions. In a recent ad — which begins with her "approving" the ad while appearing in a mine, helmet and all — she parries McConnell’s claim by launching her own coal-themed attack. "What Mitch McConnell doesn’t want you to know is that he and his wife personally took $600,000 from anti-coal groups, including New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s anti-coal foundation," Grimes said. "The only candidate pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal is Mitch McConnell." We’ll assess two parts of this claim. First, is McConnell "pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal"? And second, is he the "only candidate" taking money from anti-coal activists? McConnell’s money When we asked Grimes for evidence that McConnell has received $600,000 from those who oppose coal, a Grimes spokeswoman said that McConnell’s wife, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, sits on the board of directors of Bloomberg Philanthropies, a charitable organization founded by the former New York City mayor and billionaire founder of the Bloomberg media conglomerate. In 2011, Bloomberg Philanthropies promised $50 million over four years to the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Initiative. The recipient had a decidedly anti-coal agenda, including an effort to close coal plants in many parts of the country. According to Yahoo! News, Bloomberg said, "Ending coal power production is the right thing to do, because while it may seem to be an inexpensive energy source the impact on our environment and the impact on public health is significant." However, Chao didn’t join the board until 2012. Bloomberg Philanthropies spokeswoman Meghan Womack told PolitiFact, "The decision to provide funding to Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal initiative took place before Elaine Chao joined the Bloomberg Philanthropies board. Bloomberg Philanthropies’ board members do not vote on individual initiatives or program spends." But the claim really goes off the rails when the ad says McConnell and Chao took $600,000 from anti-coal groups. Chao made far less than that — $9,400 — for serving on the board of Bloomberg Philanthropies, according to the organization’s latest annual filing in 2012. So how does the Grimes campaign get to $600,000? They also count the $684,186 in fees, stock options and other compensation that Chao made while serving on the board of directors for Wells Fargo. How can a bank be anti-coal? According to Yahoo! News, in 2013, Wells Fargo announced it would stop investing in companies that engage in mountaintop removal, a practice that involves extracting coal more or less by blowing up mountain summits. "We recognize the significant concerns associated with this practice and we also acknowledge the significant investments made by our coal customers in their mine operations, which were entered into in good faith and in accordance with applicable regulations," Wells Fargo wrote in a report titled Environmental and Social Risk Management. "As a result of our deliberate approach and the broader movement of the industry toward other mining methods, our involvement with the practice of (mountaintop removal) is limited and declining. Wells Fargo will not extend credit to individual MTR mining projects or to a coal producer that receives a majority of its production from MTR mining." That’s not an insignificant development, but as the Washington Post Fact Checker noted in its own analysis of the ad, that only tells part of the story. For instance, Wells Fargo told the Washington Post, "Given that we still finance coal companies, we would certainly not characterize ourselves as ‘anti-coal.’ " Environmental groups, too, don’t agree that Wells Fargo is out to destroy coal. On the contrary, in 2012, Rainforest Action Network, Sierra Club, and BankTrack named Wells Fargo one of the top five worst banks on coal due to "their relationship to and control over these dirty dinosaurs." An updated report card from the groups released in 2014 gave Wells Fargo a "B" for its mountain-top removal investments, but the bank still scored a "D" for its ties to coal-fired power plants. There are certainly banks with a cozier relationship with coal and energy companies. But even though Wells Fargo says it does "not finance coal-power plants on a stand-alone basis," Wells Fargo remains a bank that "provided $1.9 billion in financing as a lead arranger or lead manager in transactions with coal-fired power companies," according to the environmental report. Grimes’ money How about the other side of the equation — that McConnell is the only candidate "pocketing big money" from anti-coal groups? As it happens, Grimes’ campaign has benefited some from groups and individuals that are critical of coal use. For starters, her campaign reported a $1,000 donation from Frances Beinecke, the president of the Natural Resource Defense Council. The NRDC was instrumental in helping the Obama administration develop the new carbon regulations on existing power plants. In October 2011, Susie Tompkins Buell, the founder of the women’s clothing line Esprit and a noted climate change activist, held a fundraiser for Grimes at her California home. Grimes’ campaign points out the McConnell has also accepted money from some donors with anti-coal ties. For example, McConnell received $2,000 in campaign contributions from David Litman, a Texas businessman who started Texas Business for Clean Air to oppose new coal plants there. Meanwhile, Grimes’ campaign has also benefited indirectly from outside groups that have helped in the ongoing ad wars in Kentucky without officially coordinating with her campaign. CREDO, a progressive organization with a campaign focused on fighting "dirty coal," has spent $35,000 to air anti-McConnell ads so far, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a campaign finance watchdog. Meanwhile, the Senate Majority PAC, a political arm of Senate Democrats, has put $4.3 million into the race. The PAC has received significant funding — about $5 million so far — from billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer. That’s not to say that Grimes’ campaign is bankrolled or heavily influenced by anti-coal organizations. Indeed, environmental groups have not jumped into the Kentucky Senate race to back Grimes with the same intensity as they have to help Democrats in states like Colorado and Michigan. But there’s enough financial support from anti-coal entities that Grimes’ claim of entirely clean hands is significantly misleading. Our ruling A Grimes ad claimed that "the only candidate pocketing big money from people who want to destroy coal is Mitch McConnell." The assertion is that McConnell and his wife took $600,000 from anti-coal organizations. But the overwhelming bulk of that was earned by Chao from sitting on the board of directors for Wells Fargo, a bank that, despite some steps to curb its support of mountain-top removal mining, still maintains $1.8 billion in coal investments, environmental groups say. Meanwhile, Grimes’ campaign has directly and indirectly benefited from money and ads from environmental groups and activists critical of coal. We rate the claim False.

pomt-07359	Benzene has "never been proven to be harmful."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2011/may/07/rick-hardcastle/state-rep-rick-hardcastle-says-benzene-has-never-b/	During House debate, state Rep. Rick Hardcastle brushed off a colleague’s concerns about benzene emissions near Texas schools. "Are you aware benzene is also a compound in soap?" Hardcastle said April 28. "Found at every car wash in this state — and several other industries in this state? And it’s never been proven to be harmful." The Vernon Republican was opposing an amendment by Rep. Lon Burnam, D-Fort Worth, that would prohibit the Oil and Gas Commission from issuing drilling permits for gas wells within 1,200 feet from a public school unless they meet a set of conditions, including installing emission controls and ensuring certain pollutants, such as benzene, fall below certain concentrations. Members tabled Burnam’s proposal. Still, we wondered if benzene has really never been proven harmful? First, a benzene primer: According to the federal Environmental Protection Agency, benzene is an organic chemical compound found most often in the air as a result of emissions from burning coal and oil, drilling for natural gas or in gasoline vapors, car exhaust, cigarette smoke and other sources. The chemical also is used as a solvent for inks, paint and plastics and to manufacture detergents. EPA spokesman Joe Hubbard told us benzene is a "widely used chemical formed from both natural processes and human activities." Still, in 1986, the agency classified benzene as a "human carcinogen and hazardous air pollutant," he said. When we reached Hardcastle, he agreed that benzene is "a proven carcinogen" but said that’s only so when a person is "overly-exposed to it" for a long period of time. Otherwise, he said, it hasn’t been proven harmful. "It’s a carcinogen, but everything’s a carcinogen," he said. "You eat too much white bread and it’s a carcinogen." Texas Commission on Environmental Quality spokesman Terry Clawson told us that benzene is harmful depending on its concentration in air and how long someone is exposed to it. "Typical outdoor concentrations" of benzene, less than one part per billion, are "much lower than concentrations that have been shown to cause harmful effects in people," he said. But exposure to higher concentrations, tens of thousands of parts per billion, over a period of many months to years "has been shown to cause harmful effects on blood," he said. Longer exposures, over many years, have "been shown to cause leukemia in workers," he said. A fact sheet issued by the agency in October 2007 says as much: "Permitted levels of benzene should not cause adverse health and welfare effects," but breathing high levels of the chemical compound can damage blood cells, human studies indicate. "Some occupational workers, who have been exposed to some of the highest air concentrations of benzene for years, experienced a decrease in the number of white blood cells circulating in their blood." According to the EPA’s web page on hazards associated with benzene, chronic exposure for a year or more has caused blood disorders, including reduced numbers of red blood cells and aplastic anemia — a risk factor for developing acute non-lymphocytic leukemia. The EPA site says short-term exposure to benzene may cause drowsiness, dizziness, headaches, eye, skin and respiratory tract irritation, and, at high levels, unconsciousness. And a February 2009 study funded by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences found that leukemia risks could be greater at ambient levels of benzene exposure — that is, benzene in the air where people live, rather than where they work — than previously thought. A 2009 EPA summary says that some studies, such as those gauging links between childhood exposure to benzene and childhood cancer, are equivocal. A 2001 study found a connection between Hodgkins lymphoma and young children who lived in high-traffic ares with higher concentrations of benzene during pregnancy or early childhood, while a 2002 study found no connection between childhood cancer rates and benzene concentrations in high-traffic neighborhoods. Closer to home, a 2010 study by researchers at the University of Texas and the Texas Department of State Health Services found that women living in Texas neighborhoods with high levels of benzene (more than 3 micrograms per cubic meter of air) were more likely to bear children with spinal bifida — a serious birth defect that can cause paralysis and neurological disorders. According to an August 2007 benzene fact sheet published by the federal Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry, "some women who breathed high levels of benzene for many months had irregular menstrual periods and a decrease in the size of their ovaries." But, according to the fact sheet, "we do not know for certain that benzene caused these effects." Recent studies have found that environmental exposure to benzene increases the risk of childhood cancer, birth defects and lowers birth weight, he said. "Cancer is not the only concern. "While it’s true that the only ‘proven’ effects are in occupationally exposed workers, studies strongly suggest that adverse effects on children and pregnant women are probably at lower environmental levels. Finally, Martyn Smith, a toxicology professor at the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley, who has studied the health effects of benzene, told us that Hardcastle is "wrong." There is no known threshold for when benzene becomes carcinogenic, Smith said. According to a study Smith authored that was published in the Annual Review of Public Health in April 2010, "there is probably no safe level of exposure of benzene, and all exposures constitute some risk." Where does that leave us? It’s true that benzene is a common air pollutant and is found in everyday products such as detergents. But to claim that airborne benzene has not been proven harmful flies in the face of scientific evidence that long-term exposure in the workplace can cause cancer and other negative health effects — not to mention studies suggesting lower levels of environmental exposure may also be unsafe.

pomt-09430	“Bill White ...offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants.”	false	/texas/statements/2010/mar/14/cathie-adams/gop-chair-cathie-adams-says-bill-white-gave-sanctu/	Republicans had former Houston Mayor Bill White in their sights well before he won the Democratic nod for governor this month. In February, Cathie Adams, who chairs the Republican Party of Texas, distributed a fund-raising letter calling White an extreme liberal with the kind of record only a Chicago politician — like President Barack Obama — could admire. Her letter levels six charges. For this ruling , we're zeroing in on the one that gave us the biggest workout (and we address her other statements in separate Truth-O-Meter items.) Adams wrote: “Bill White ... offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants." Who knew? We wanted to learn more. To back up Adams, the Republican Party pointed us to a report updated by the Congressional Research Service in 2006 that lists Houston among 32 localities -- Austin and Katy were the other two in Texas -- with sanctuary policies. White was about midway through his six years as mayor when the report came out. Broadly, the report states, so-called sanctuary cities “have their roots in the 1980s religious sanctuary movement by American churches. These churches provided sanctuary to thousands of unauthorized Central American migrants fleeing civil war in their homelands. Most cities that are considered sanctuary cities have adopted a ‘don’t ask-don’t tell’ policy where they don’t require their employees, including law enforcement officers, to report to federal officials aliens who may be illegally present in the country.” The report continues: “Localities, and in some cases individual police departments, in such areas that are considered ‘sanctuary cities,’ have utilized various mechanisms to ensure that unauthorized aliens who may be present in their jurisdiction illegally are not turned in to federal authorities.” The report doesn't state why each locality made the list. Houston's officialdom, including White and Police Chief Harold Hurtt, disputed the characterization, noting there's no city ordinance designating Houston a sanctuary. A 2007 U.S. Department of Justice report (brought to our attention by White's campaign) said its researchers found only two jurisdictions receiving at least $1 million a year in federal aid to incarcerate "criminal aliens" had official sanctuary policies posted online--California's city and county of San Francisco and the state of Oregon. Harris County, home to Houston, was getting more than $2 million in annual aid at the time; presumably, it was included in the DOJ review. In short, Houston has no official sanctuary policy. Still, such a city may have other policies that "interfere or shield people from detection" by U.S. Immigration Customs Enforcement, said Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Washington-based Center for Immigration Studies, which has done studies on the costs of illegal immigration. In fact, Houston police do not ask people what their immigration status is during routine patrols. "We have limited resources" and leave it to the federal government to enforce immigration laws, said HPD Assistant Chief Dan Perales. Houston is in Harris County, whose sheriff, Adrian Garcia, likewise defends the practice of not checking the immigration status of residents who aren't in jail. Garcia said: "You don’t want to create a chill factor. You don’t want people to spend time wondering whether they're going to be asked about their immigration status versus (officers) getting information on the gang member who just shot somebody." Other cities do the same. Austin Police Department policy states: "Officers will not stop persons for the sole purpose of determining immigration status." However, Harris County is in a federal program called 287(g) that authorizes local law officers to enforce immigration laws. When Houston police arrest people for crimes more serious than Class C misdemeanors, they are turned over to the county, which was an earlier adopter of the Department of Homeland Security's Secure Communities program. That program enables fingerprints of arrested individuals to be checked against federal crime and immigration databases. After the shooting of a Houston police officer by an illegal immigrant in March 2009, White asked the federal government to expedite the city’s entry into the 287(g) program, according to The Houston Chronicle. But White shifted course in October, saying that joining the Secure Communities program instead would entail no special agreement with the Department of Homeland Security nor cost as much, the newspaper reported. The Houston Police Department joined Secure Communities and started using the same databases in mid-December. Perales said they have helped the city identify possible illegal immigrants plus individuals wanted in other states for other reasons. The Houston Police Department joined the Secure Communities program and started using its databases in mid-December. Perales said the data has helped the city identify possible illegal immigrants plus individuals wanted in other states for other reasons. Vaughan said that because the county and city have stepped up efforts to identify illegal immigrants, she no longer views the city as much of a sanctuary. Vaughan said in a blog posted Friday, however, that from early March 2008 to Sept. 30, 2009, the Secure Communities program as employed by Harris County failed to identify nearly half the illegal immigrants snagged via the county's 287(g) participation. "Why the difference?" her blog states. "Secure Communities can only flag those aliens whose (fingerprints) or identifying information is already in immigration databases." She writes that the results gap "represents underachievement on a large scale." None of this proves Adams' claim that White "offered sanctuary to illegal immigrants." The Congressional Research Service did list Houston among localities with sanctuary policies. Yet the only overt action on White's watch was the decision, at the end of his six years in office, to join the Secure Communities program -- a federal initiative intended to make it harder, not easier, for illegal immigrants to remain in this country. Whether the White administration's approach helped make illegal immigrants feel at ease in Houston is another question -- and not the one Adams raised. We rate her sanctuary statement as False.

pomt-03115	"There are more guns than there are people in the United States."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/19/eleanor-holmes-norton/del-norton-says-more-guns-people-us-navy-yard-reac/	In the wake of Monday’s Navy Yard shooting, Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., addressed national and civic security. Holmes, the nonvoting delegate to Congress representing the District of Columbia, praised the quick police response, but she also noted that no one is entirely insulated from criminal acts. "We understand that in an open and democratic and free society, you cannot make yourself impenetrable, especially when there are more guns than there are people in the United States today," she said in a press conference. Are there really more guns than people? We wanted to dig into the data. Let’s pin down the easy number: population. The U.S. Census Bureau puts the 2010 population at 308.7 million people. We can get even closer with their nifty population clock, which on the day we checked it estimated a population of nearly 317 million, based on migration, birth and death rates. Now that we have a frame of reference for Norton’s comparison, let’s move to the question of the number of civilian guns in the country, a murkier subject. As we’ve noted, federally sponsored gun research is scarce. Most of the available studies are estimates. Since most states don’t register guns or license owners, there’s no concrete thing to count, said Jon Vernick, co-director of the Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. This June, at President Barack Obama’s request, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report rounding up what we know about firearm ownership and usage. It offered a 2007 estimate of 294 million guns, but with a pretty hefty caveat: "Basic information about gun possession, acquisition, and storage is lacking," the report read. "No single database captures the total number, locations, and types of firearms and firearm owners in the United States." The National Rifle Association usually describes the number as "approaching 300 million," spokesman Andrew Arulanandam wrote in an email. Daniel van Hoogstraten, Norton’s spokesman, pointed us to a Congressional Research Service study that goes with a slightly higher ballpark: 310 million as of 2009. He made the case that gun proliferation in the country has been increasing at a quick enough rate to exceed the population. While that’s an interesting theory, we found no evidence to back it up. Since the CRS number is from 2009, the closest apples-to-apples comparison we can make is using the U.S. Census population from 2010. So that's about 310 million guns to 308.7 million people. Again, we can't get a firm grip on how much the guns number has changed since then, but the population has gone up by almost nine million, according to the Census estimate. Our ruling Norton claimed there are "more guns than there are people in the United States." There’s no way to know for sure how many guns there are, given the available data. The highest credible guns number we saw was 310 million, which bests the 2010 population by over a million. But it falls short of the 2013 population estimate. We don't have any reliable gun surveys to approximate 2013 numbers. There's a chance Norton is right, but the available evidence isn't definitive. We rate Norton’s claim Half True.

pomt-08857	"Florida is now the No. 1 state in the country for automobile accident fraud."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/aug/05/holly-benson/holly-benson-claims-florida-leads-country-automobi/	Fraud was a hot topic during the July 31, 2010, debate between Pam Bondi, Jeff Kottkamp and Holly Benson, all Republican candidates for Florida attorney general. At one point, Bay News 9 anchor and debate co-host Al Ruechel asked, "Why is it that Florida is so ripe for all sorts of fraud? Mortgage fraud, Medicaid fraud, and what can the AG's (Attorney General) office do to cut that down?" Benson was the last candidate to answer the question, beginning her response by saying, "You know, even yesterday I read that Florida is now the number one state in the country for automobile accident fraud." She then returned to Medicaid and went on to say that she would put in place "laws with teeth" so that the "bad guys would get put away" and that they wouldn't be able to use Medicaid as a money-making scheme. We've heard a lot about mortgage and Medicaid fraud, but not so much about automobile accident fraud, so we decided to look into it. Benson's office sent us a link to an article published by the South Florida Sun Sentinel, on May 11, 2010. The article points to a May 2010 report from the National Insurance Crime Bureau, which describes itself as a "leading not-for-profit organization exclusively dedicated to preventing, detecting and defeating insurance fraud and vehicle theft." Nearly 1,100 property and casualty insurance companies and self-insured organizations support the NICB, according to the group's website. The NICB report says that questionable claims involving possible staged accidents increased 46 percent from 2007 through 2009. Broken down by state, Florida leads the pack, with 3,006 questionable claims submitted. New York came in second, with 1,680 claims. On a city level, New York City was the clear winner -- 1,304 questionable claims were submitted by NICB's insurance members between 2007 and 2009. Tampa was second with 562 claims submitted during the same time period. Right away, we notice that the NICB report that Benson's campaign seems to be relying on is not a ranking of the number of auto insurance fraud convictions by state. As Frank Scafidi, director of public affairs for the NICB, explained to us in an e-mail, "Our staged accident reports ... are based on the voluntary submission, or referral, of insurance claims deemed 'questionable' by the companies handling them. These are claims that are suspicious and may contain some indication of potential fraud so companies can elect to refer them to us for further review and investigation." Just because a claim is submitted as questionable, however, does not necessarily indicate that fraud occurred. "The mere referral of a claim in no way deems it fraudulent and many questionable claims turn out to be perfectly legitimate," Scafidi said. Unfortunately, NICB was unable to provide us with the number of questionable claims that turned out to be legitimate. We also contacted the Insurance Research Council, an industry-backed group that provides "timely and reliable empirical research to all parties involved in public policy issues affecting risk and insurance." David Corum, the group's vice president, told us that the organization conducted its own analysis of auto insurance fraud. The report, published in November 2008, looked at more than 42,000 claims submitted by 22 insurance companies that represented 57 percent of the U.S. private passenger market in 2006. The claims were reviewed for evidence of either fraud or buildup. The group defines fraud as a "specific material misrepresentation of the facts of a loss." Buildup, on the other hand, sometimes also referred to as soft fraud, is defined "as the inflation of an otherwise legitimate claim." The report found that Florida led the country both in terms of the number of claims suspected of fraud and buildup. More specifically, 22 percent of bodily injury claims submitted in Florida involved apparent fraud and 41 percent involved apparent buildup. Among Florida personal injury protection claims, the apparent fraud rate was 10 percent, and the rate of apparent buildup was 30 percent. Finally, we spoke with James Quiggle, director of communications for the Coalition Against Insurance Fraud, a nonprofit anti-fraud watchdog group. He told us that "Florida is arguably the nation's epicenter of counterfeit crashes, the eye of the no-fault hurricane." Still, as the organization's own website points out, "no single national agency gathers omnibus fraud statistics. Insurance fraud data thus are relatively piecemeal, making our understanding of insurance fraud an ongoing work in progress." To recap. Benson claimed that Florida is now the No. 1 state in the country for automobile accident fraud. We spoke with industry experts and reviewed existing literature on the topic, and found that she was largely correct. Data from both the National Insurance Crime Bureau and the Insurance Research Council show that Florida had the biggest number of claims that either the insurance companies or independent reviewers found of questionable legitimacy. Still, those figures only represent likely or potential fraud, not confirmed cases of fraud. We rate this Mostly True.	None	Holly Benson	None	None	None	2010-08-05T18:22:00	2010-07-31	['None']
pomt-07290	"If you take the population growth here in Virginia, we are net zero on job creation since (Bob McDonnell) became governor."	true	/virginia/statements/2011/may/21/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-mcdonnell-job-creation-effort-hasnt/	Former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe was not kind to Gov. Bob McDonnell’s jobs record in a recent speech. McAuliffe, who ran unsuccessfully in the 2009 Democratic gubernatorial primary, said the state’s employment situation has regressed since McDonnell, a Republican, became governor in January 2010. "We have not gone forward. We have gone backwards," McAuliffe, who is considering another run for governor in 2013, said in a May 7 speech at a Democratic rally. "I know Bob is for jobs, talks about these great press releases. But if you take the population growth here in Virginia, we are net zero on job creation since he became governor." Has Virginia’s population growth outpaced its job growth since McDonnell became governor? We decided to check. Levar Stoney, McAuliffe’s spokesman, told us the information came from a January 2011 report by The Commonwealth Institute for Fiscal Analysis, a think tank that focuses on economic issues facing low and moderate-income residents. The study said if the pace of Virginia’s job growth between February through December of 2010 continues, it would take until 2022 to return the state to its pre-recession employment levels. That report, however, does not include the specific statement McAuliffe made about the state’s job growth trailing its population increase under McDonnell. So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics figures to see if McAuliffe was right. The BLS compiles monthly figures from a survey of households showing how the size of each state’s working-age population compares to its number of residents who are employed. Working-age population is defined as the number of people 16 or older who are not in the military, incarcerated or in mental institutions. We’ll start with February 2010, McDonnell’s first full month in office. Virginia’s working-age population was 6,049,306 that month. The number of employed residents was 3,891,279. That means 64.3 percent of the state’s working-age population had jobs. In March, 2011 -- the latest BLS figures -- Virginia’s working-age population was 6,125,642. There were 3,931,679 employed Virginians -- 64.2 percent of the working-age population. So in March 2011, the percentage of the state’s working-age population with jobs was one-tenth of 1 percent lower than in February 2010. The working-age population had risen 76,336 over the span, while the number of employed residents went up by 40,400. McAuliffe is right that the state’s population increase has outpaced the rise in number of jobs. But that trend is not is not unique to Virginia. Between February 2010 and March 2011, only a dozen states saw their number of employed residents rise faster than the increase in their working age populations, according to the BLS. Nationwide, the percentage of working-age people with jobs was at 58.5 in February 2010 and in March 2011. Virginia has easily outperformed the national average every month during that span since McDonnell became governor. We don’t point this out to take McDonnell’s side. We merely note there is a universe of employment statistics that politicians sift to paint favorable pictures of their own performance creating jobs and disparage the work of opponents. McAuliffe did not address the record of his fellow Democrat Tim Kaine, who preceded McDonnell as governor. But Kaine, who is running for the U.S. Senate next year, is open to the same criticism McAuliffe aimed at McDonnell. In February 2006, Kaine’s first full month in office, 66.5 percent of the state’s working age population had a job. By December 2009, Kaine’s last full month, it dropped to 64.2 percent. Virginia’s working-age population rose 275,496 during Kaine’s term while the number of employed people only increased by 48,249. To sum up: McAuliffe said that since McDonnell became governor in January 2010, the state’s population growth has outpaced its job growth. McDonnell is a Republican. McAuliffe does not note that the same trend existed when his fellow Democrat Tim Kaine was governor from from 2006 to 2010. Economists say governors have little control over economic conditions. Virginia has consistently had one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation this century. Those points aside, McDonnell bills himself as a job-creating governor. McAuliffe accurately summarized one set of statistics about employment in Virginia during McDonnell’s term. We rate his statement True.

Referring to an inspector general’s report on the IRS scrutiny of conservative groups, Bachmann said, "So now we find out these people are making decisions based on our politics and beliefs, and they're going to be in charge of our health care There's a huge national database that's being created right now. Your health care, my health care, all the Fox viewers health care, their personal, intimate, most close to the vest secrets will be in that database, and the IRS is in charge of that database? So the IRS will have the ability potentially -- will they? -- to deny health care, to deny access, to delay health care? This is serious! Based upon our political beliefs? That's why we have to repeal Obamacare. And I still think it's possible." We’ll be looking at a few claims from this exchange. In this item, we’ll focus on whether it’s accurate to say that "the IRS will have the ability potentially" to deny or delay health care. In an interview with PolitiFact after Bachmann’s appearance on Van Susteren’s show, Dan Kotman, a spokesman for Bachmann, said she stood by the concerns she expressed. "Now that we know the IRS has abused its power for political purposes, it is reasonable to ask what other steps would they take to punish their political opponents," Kotman said. This is an especially big concern, Kotman said, in the wake of revelations that Sarah Hall Ingram -- the former commissioner of the IRS' tax-exempt and government-entities division -- is now in charge of an IRS office that oversees tax-related issues relating to the health care law. Kotman argued that it would be possible for the IRS to use the information it collects on taxpayers and their health coverage for political purposes. "Based on that information, one possible outcome is that they can levy punitive taxes that could force employers to drop coverage," Kotman said. The IRS has a number of roles in implementing the health care law -- the agency has posted a list that includes everything from levying additional payroll taxes on certain high-income Americans to taxation of medical devices and brand-name drugs. Its best known role, beginning in 2014, is to confirm that a taxpayer has health insurance and to assess a financial penalty if they do not. (The penalties start at $95 per adult in 2013 and rise to $695 per adult in 2016.) None of the above, however, supports the idea that the IRS can "deny" or "delay" health care for an individual or a family. But there is one area in which IRS actions could delay Americans from getting health care. It stems from the agency’s role in approving federal subsidies for purchasing health insurance on the newly created insurance exchanges. Let’s recap how this part of the law works. The law establishes "exchanges" that are intended to be operational by 2014. Using these exchanges, people who need insurance will be able to comparison-shop for plans that suit their needs. While some people will pay all of the resulting premiums, many will qualify for subsidies. The subsidies operate on a sliding scale, and are available to those who earn between 133 percent and 400 percent of the federal poverty level. An estimated 28.6 million Americans might be eligible for the subsidies in 2014, though the Congressional Budget Office has suggested that many fewer Americans will actually sign up, at least at first -- 6 million in 2014 and 22 million in 2017. Even if the lower estimates of signup rates are true, that will mean that millions of Americans will need to secure approval from the IRS to obtain subsidies. This process is supposed to start this fall, to enable applicants to purchase coverage in time for calendar year 2014. So will the IRS be ready? An IRS spokeswoman said the agency "is on track with implementing its role in the Affordable Care Act," but otherwise directed inquiries to the Department of Health and Human Services. In a statement to PolitiFact, HHS said applicants for financial assistance will be part of the exchange process and that verification "will take place in near-real time" with several federal databases, including an IRS database. Experts we contacted for this story said that Bachmann’s scenario -- that the IRS picks and chooses who gets a subsidy based on an applicant’s political beliefs -- is almost impossible to imagine, even after the recent revelations. But they said it was more plausible that mundane logistical challenges could delay individuals’ efforts to secure subsidies. At a bureaucracy as large as the IRS, and with laws as complicated as this one, it’s possible that individuals could -- indirectly and inadvertently -- find themselves delayed or denied in getting health coverage. It’s not hard to imagine glitches cropping up and delaying someone from getting approval to purchase insurance on the exchange. It could be especially tricky for Americans who don’t file returns because they don’t owe taxes beyond what’s taken from their paycheck. We "don’t know what will happen if the IRS is unable to make these determinations in a ‘timely' way," said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush and who is now a health policy consultant. And even in the best of situations, computer systems aren’t perfect. "One big concern about whether the exchanges will work is whether computers from different government agencies can talk to each other," said Michael Tanner, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute. Brookings Institution senior fellow Elaine Kamarck recently suggested a possible scenario in which the federal online system for exchanges "may not be able to interface with statewide data and eligibility could become a lengthy bureaucratic process." We should emphasize that if these delays do come to pass, it won’t be about "political beliefs," as Bachmann put it, and it won’t be something IRS intended to happen. It would be about something much more mundane -- bureaucratic snags. "She is trying to make the IRS sound like it has a malevolent power to limit medical care that it does not have," said Jonathan Oberlander, a professor of social medicine and health policy and management at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill. Our ruling Bachmann said "the IRS will have the ability potentially" to deny or delay health care. She makes it sound like the IRS would purposefully deny or delay people from getting health coverage, perhaps based on an applicant’s political beliefs. Experts told us that was extremely far-fetched. But if complicated logistical challenges are not met, there is a chance that IRS could inadvertently end up delaying some of the millions of uninsured Americans seeking subsidies from purchasing insurance on the exchanges. We rate Bachmann’s claim Mostly False.	None	Michele Bachmann	None	None	None	2013-05-20T12:01:56	2013-05-15	['None']

pomt-09700	"As a result of the House Republican bill, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office now confirms that families will see their health care premiums reduced by up to 10 percent."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/06/mike-pence/us-rep-mike-pence-says-cbo-confirms-gop-health-pla/	A day after the GOP released its 219-page alternative health care bill, U.S. Rep. Mike Pence, chairman of the House Republican Conference, sent out a press release boasting that the "the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office now confirms that families will see their health care premiums reduced by up to 10 percent." Lowering health care costs -- rather than reducing the ranks of the uninsured -- has been the primary focus of many Republicans in Congress, and so we wanted to check out Pence's claim. First, a few words about the Congressional Budget Office, or CBO. The nonpartisan budget agency calculates how much bills in Congress will cost the government. Political leaders and others regularly turn to the CBO as the definitive source for budget projections. And here's what the CBO concluded about how the GOP health care plan would affect private health insurance premiums: • For the small group market (generally businesses with two to 50 employees -- about 15 percent of the private market), the GOP plan would reduce average premiums in 2016 by 7 to 10 percent compared with amounts under current law. • For the individual market (just over 5 percent of the private market), the GOP plan would reduce premiums in 2016 by 5 to 8 percent. • And for the large group market (which represents 80 percent of private premiums), the GOP plan would reduce premiums in 2016 by 0 to 3 percent. The CBO cautioned that those estimates are "very preliminary and are subject to an unusually high degree of uncertainty" because of the difficulty in trying to untangle how various proposals in the plan might affect premiums. But you can see what Pence has done. The Indiana congressman cherry-picked the most favorable number to put the GOP plan in the best light. Yes, for people in the small market group, the CBO estimates they could see average premiums reduced in 2016 by "up to 10 percent" compared with amounts under current law. But only 15 percent of the total private premiums fall into that category. The overwhelming majority, 80 percent of people paying private premiums, are in the large market group. And for them, the CBO estimates the GOP plan would reduce premiums in 2016 by 0 to 3 percent. But Pence did say "up to," providing himself with some very broad wiggle room. And so we rate Pence's statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a2bc5368-e052-449d-b9e1-d63c5904a6fb	None	Mike Pence	None	None	None	2009-11-06T13:58:24	2009-11-05	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-13384	In New York City, "murders are up."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/27/donald-trump/donald-trump-base-saying-murders-are-new-york-city/	Two New Yorkers, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton, mixed it up over crime stats in the Big Apple at the first presidential debate in Hempstead, N.Y. Here’s their exchange, prompted by Donald Trump’s suggestion that police should expand the use of "stop and frisk" policies to curb crime. Trump: "Stop and frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City, tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact." Clinton: "Well, it's also fair to say, if we're going to talk about mayors, that under the current mayor, crime has continued to drop, including murders. So there is -- " Trump: "No, you're wrong. You're wrong." Clinton: "No, I'm not." Trump: "Murders are up. All right. You check it." And so we will. Is it correct that "murders are up" in New York City, as Trump said? The most recent statistics from the New York Police Department show that murders in New York City are falling. The data, which cover the period between Sept. 12 and Sept. 18, 2016, compare various crimes, including murder, over a series of time frames. Here’s the summary: Period 2015 murder figure 2016 murder figure Increase or decline Week to date 6 3 -50 percent Past 28 days 35 24 -31.4 percent Year to date 257 246 -4.3 percent 2 years ago to date -- -- +7.9 percent 6 years ago to date -- -- -36.1 percent 23 years ago to date -- -- -82.7 percent So, in five of the six time periods offered by the NYPD -- including the past year to date, the figure most commonly cited in the media -- crime has fallen. In only one time frame, comparing year to date 2016 to year to date 2014, did the number of murders increase. And in fact, this is essentially what the Trump campaign pointed to when we asked them to support the candidate’s claim. They noted that during the full year of 2014, there were 333 murders, a number that rose to 352 in the full year of 2015. That’s about a 6 percent increase. Still, this is just one cherry-picked time frame. And a NYPD spokesman rejected Trump’s statement via Twitter during the debate. J. Peter Donald, the NYPD's assistant commissioner for communication and public information, tweeted, "Additionally, #NYC is on pace to have one of the safest years on record for crime. Murders, shootings are (down arrow) significantly." In the meantime, we’ll note that the data in the NYPD release went on to compare year-end data from 2015 to four previous years and found that it is well below its previous levels -- consistent with a quarter-century decline in violent crime. According to the NYPD data, murder was down by 45.8 percent compared to 2001, down by 44 percent compared to 1998, down by 81.7 percent compared to 1993, and down by 84.4 percent compared to 1990. The year-to-date data for rape, felonious assault and grand larceny are up by between 1 percent and 3.5 percent. But Trump was specific about referring to murder. And statistics released by the FBI the morning of the debate that showed murders rose nationally by 10.8 percent in 2015, the biggest one-year percentage jump since 1971. But again, those are national figures, not murders in New York City. So among the time frames released by the NYPD, there’s only one comparison where Trump would be correct -- today compared to two years ago. In general, murders are down in New York City for almost any time period you can look at. Our ruling At the debate, Trump said that In New York City, "murders are up." For virtually any time frame you can look at, including the year to date, murders in New York City are down. We rate the statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1c058516-fb5d-4fc7-8530-1291324b44f8	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-09-27T15:42:07	2016-09-26	['New_York_City']
pomt-15168	"The federal government right now does not deport criminals."	false	/florida/statements/2015/aug/26/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-obama-administration-not-deporting-c/	Jeb Bush says that the federal government needs to start deporting criminals. "The federal government right now does not deport criminals," he said at a town hall in New Hampshire on Aug. 19. "I don't believe that we should take people that are here in the shadows and deport them all -- the cost of that would be in the hundreds of billions of dollars, it would rip up communities -- it's not appropriate. But criminals should be deported, and right now the Obama administration is not doing that." Bush was essentially bashing GOP frontrunner Donald Trump for his immigration plans, which include deporting millions of illegal immigrants. But is Bush correct that Obama's administration is not deporting criminals? In a word, no. Deportations under Obama The Bush campaign sent us news articles and reports including a fact-check by PolitiFact showing that tens of thousands of criminal illegal immigrants have avoided deportation. This has been a particularly hot topic since a convicted felon who had previously been deported five times murdered a woman in San Francisco this summer. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has written stories about criminals who have avoided deportation. For example, a West African drifter who spent 15 years in state prison for sexually battering a woman walked out of an Atlanta jail and ignored orders to report to federal immigration authorities seeking to deport him and instead disappeared. The newspaper reported in May 2015 that U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement authorities based in Atlanta were hunting 8,647 fugitives with criminal convictions ranging from minor drug offenses to murder in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. But while there are cases of criminals who have avoided deportation, there are still tens of thousands of people who have, in fact, been deported. The Immigration and Customs Enforcement, called ICE, removed 315,943 illegal immigrants in fiscal year 2014. About two-thirds were caught while attempting to cross the border, while one-third were removed from the interior. About 85 percent of all interior removals were individuals previously convicted of a crime. That means that 86,923 convicted criminals were deported for a crime outside of breaking an immigration law. The ICE removal statistics did not provide details about the types of crimes committed, except to state that about 1 percent were suspected or confirmed gang members. We were not able to get complete data from ICE by our deadline to show what percentage of deported illegal immigrants had been convicted of felonies. However, the New York Times published an analysis in April 2014 based on government data obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. The newspaper found that since Obama had taken office, "two-thirds of the nearly two million deportation cases involve people who had committed minor infractions, including traffic violations, or had no criminal record at all. Twenty percent — or about 394,000 — of the cases involved people convicted of serious crimes, including drug-related offenses, the records show." The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University published an analysis in 2014 that looked at deportations during the previous year. It found that 1,172 were deported for homicide, 3,325 for sexual assault, and 47,249 for traffic offenses. The deportation guidelines changed in November 2014, when Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson issued a memo saying that the new top priority would include those suspected of terrorism, gang members and convicted felons. The second priority level includes those convicted of serious misdemeanors. The guidelines are more narrow and specific than the ones it replaced from 2010-11. The Migration Policy Institute estimated that 13 percent of illegal immigrants fall into the new priorities compared with 27 percent previously. These policies have come in for criticism by those who would like to see more vigorous enforcement of immigration law. "It’s true that a large percentage of the people deported have criminal convictions," said Jessica Vaughan, an expert at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration. "It’s also true that the Obama administration is choosing not to deport many convicted criminals, and also choosing to release many deportable criminals, while offering them generous due process (which they often abuse) instead of using the most efficient due process that is more likely to result in deportation." Our ruling Bush said, "The federal government right now does not deport criminals." Bush points to reports that many criminal illegal immigrants have been released, and there is evidence that it sometimes happens. But it is an exaggeration to say that none are deported. Last year, ICE deported about 86,000 illegal immigrants convicted of previous crimes. We rate this claim False.	None	Jeb Bush	None	None	None	2015-08-26T10:36:09	2015-08-19	['None']
pomt-12285	"Leonardo DiCaprio explains why he’s moving to Casselberry, Florida."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/30/blog-posting/no-leonardo-dicaprio-isnt-moving-orlando-suburb/	Leonardo DiCaprio may have signed up for Elon Musk’s trip to Mars, but he isn’t moving to Casselberry, Fla., anytime soon. In an undated fake news post, kbr31.com announced that DiCaprio told an undisclosed magazine in an interview he would be moving to Casselberry because he is looking for a "big change" in his life. "I’m just tired of the L.A. lifestyle and I feel like, at this point in my life, I’d rather just live in a place full of real, genuine people," the post quotes him as saying. "I’ve been to Casselberry, Fla., a couple of times over the years and the people there are real… they’re genuine, and yeah every community has its problems but the people there are good, decent people and they care about their community. Those are the things I find most important in deciding where to live." Casselberry is a real city, located ten miles north of downtown Orlando. But it isn't the Oscar winner’s new hometown. This isn’t the first time DiCaprio is quoted as saying this, though, nor is Casselberry the celebrity’s only alleged haven from the L.A. lifestyle. Fake news sites have announced DiCaprio’s moves to Gilroy, Calif., Woodstock, Ill., Temple, Ariz., Warren, Mich., Swedesboro, N.J., and even to small towns overseas, including Naas in Ireland and Guilford in England. The stories appear on a chain of websites that seem to bank on readers clicking on particular versions of the post to generate advertising revenue. The sites’ names sound like official media outlets, like "WCRK 35" or "Q 102." The sites are also known for including various versions of stories that falsely claim an event has happened. We previously debunked a fake news story that celebrities’ cars were breaking down in small towns. Every version of these stories is almost identical, though, with a different town name.The other element that sometimes changes is the name of the celebrity leaving L.A. in search of "good, decent people" who care about their community. If you believe these Internet rumors, you will find that Will Ferrell is moving to Yuba City, Calif.; Ben Affleck to Delray Beach, Fla.; Miley Cyrus to Sedalia, Mo.; Eminem to Rocklin, Calif.; Scarlett Johansson to Clovis, Calif.; Matt Damon to Missoula, Mont.; and Bill Murray to Salisbury, Mass. Needless to say, there is no evidence any of these celebs are packing their bags and heading to your suburb any time soon. Although there is no banner on this or any of the other posts announcing they are fake, a disclaimer on the website announces that kbr31.com is a satirical and fantasy website. "None of the articles on kbr31.com should be considered true and are simply works of satire or fantasy meant for entertainment purposes," the disclaimer said. "The satirical and fantasy articles on kbr31.com poke fun at our celebrity obsessed cultures and the politically correct world we’re forced to live in."

pomt-05187	Says under Mitt Romney, Massachusetts was 47th in job creation.	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/jun/13/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-under-mitt-romney-massachusetts/	Praising President Barack Obama at the expense of his likely Republican opponent, San Antonio’s mayor told fellow Democrats that Mitt Romney is not the best solution to the nation’s unemployment. "As governor, his state ranked 47th in the nation in job creation -- almost dead last," Julián Castro said in his speech June 8, 2012, on the main floor of the Texas Democratic Party State Convention. This claim is one PolitiFact has tackled before in similar forms: Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod hung the jobless ranking on Romney on June 19, 2011, and on June 3, 2012. Both times, PolitiFact rated the statement Half True, saying that Massachusetts’ 47th-place ranking was correct but that it was inaccurate to say Romney was responsible. In our first fact-check on this number, PolitiFact traced the claim back to the Democratic National Committee, which cited a 2010 Wall Street Journal news story. PolitiFact also ran the numbers itself, using Bureau of Labor Relations data, and asked the taxpayer-backed Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, which does nonpartisan analysis of the state's financial and economic statistics, to do the same. Every way PolitiFact sliced the jobs numbers, Massachusetts was 47th. But in that item and many others, economists have consistently told us that policies of a governor have a relatively small impact on a state's economy. Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, warned us not to put too much stock in any governor's influence over their state's rate of job growth. The ability for governors to manage the state economy is vastly overrated, Widmer said. States are tied to larger economic forces, he added, and governors often claim too much credit when things are going well and no blame when things are going poorly. Castro’s political consultant, Christian Archer, sent us a June 5, 2012, New York Times news story supporting the statistic, and also said that as a co-chair of Obama for America, the mayor has received material from the president citing the same ranking. Archer said Castro was offering the ranking as evidence Romney would not be as strong on job creation as Obama. Our ruling The job-creation ranking for Massachusetts is right; the implication that Romney is solely to blame for the state’s low standing does not hold up. We give Castro, like Axelrod before him, a Half True.	None	Julián Castro	None	None	None	2012-06-13T11:18:13	2012-06-08	['Massachusetts', 'Mitt_Romney']

pomt-06597	Says he "got lobbied" by a woman with late-stage cancer about vaccinating Texas girls against a virus that can cause cervical cancer.	false	/texas/statements/2011/sep/23/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-he-got-lobbied-woman-late-stage-ca/	In the Sept. 22, 2011, Republican presidential debate, Gov. Rick Perry again defended his foiled 2007 attempt to require Texas girls to be vaccinated against a virus that can cause cervical cancer. Perry, responding to U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann’s charge that his Feb. 2, 2007, order intended to mandate the shots for human papillomavirus, or HPV, was an inappropriate result of lobbying by his former chief of staff, said: "I got lobbied on this issue. I got lobbied by a 31-year-old young lady who had stage 4 cervical cancer. I spent a lot of time with her. She came by my office, talked to me about this program." Did a cancer patient urge Perry to issue the order later nulled by Texas legislators? Nearly three weeks after Perry issued the order, it was widely reported that a Houston woman with late-stage cervical cancer had visited with him. As reported in the Feb. 20, 2007, Austin American-Statesman, Heather Burcham of Houston spoke to reporters summoned by Perry as numerous legislators were indicating they would try to cancel the order. Burcham said then: "The vaccine has done its job if it saves one person from cancer, let alone knocks out cervical cancer altogether." She also signed up to testify at a Texas House hearing, the Statesman reported, but left before she was called to speak. Earlier in the day, she said she wanted to spend the time she had left sharing her story: "It's my wildest dream come true that I get to maybe reach one person, that my life would not be in vain, that I have lived for a purpose and that I won't die and never have done anything," she said. Fast forward. Shortly after the Sept. 22 debate, ABC News said Perry did not meet Burcham until after he’d issued his order. Its news article says Perry "met Burcham while she was lobbying the Texas legislature to uphold the governor’s executive order. The Legislature ultimately ruled against Burcham and Perry and did away with the vaccine mandate." The network, crediting a recent report by Houston’s KTRK-TV, said Perry and Burcham "struck up a friendship despite the Texas Legislature revoking the governor’s mandate. Perry invited Burcham to a ranch, rode motorcycles with her and even sat at her bed during her final days. Burcham died in July 2007." A pre-debate ABC News post, dated Sept. 15, 2011, specifies that Perry and Burcham struck up the friendship after he issued the order. According to a Sept. 23, 2011, Houston Chronicle blog post, Perry spokesman Mark Miner confirmed that Burcham met Perry when she began lobbying the lawmakers to uphold his order. The post quotes Miner saying: "It was a very inspirational passionate story that he heard from her and he met with her away from the cameras and really built up a relationship with this young girl. Yes, he had (already) signed it, but it was still going through the legislative process. It had a heavy impact on him." As noted Sept. 17, 2011, by Fort Worth Star-Telegram columnist Bud Kennedy, Perry’s YouTube posts include a video of Burcham, in a hospital bed, shown at a May 2007 Perry press conference. Seated in a bed, Burcham says: "I want to change as many people’s lives as I can because I know there is nothing I can do for my own life, but there is something that I can do for others ... It is so important that parents get their children this vaccination." Finally, we interviewed Houston developer Craig Wilson, who said Burcham lived with his family off and on for about a decade before she died. Wilson said he doesn’t recall the exact date that Burcham met Perry, though they developed a relationship when she was urging legislators not to unplug the order. "He did everything he could to make her life better," Wilson said, ultimately spending three hours at her bedside before she died and later delivering a eulogy. "This shows his character as a human being." Our ruling: Perry had an ally in Heather Burcham in 2007, but only after he issued his order. In the debate, in contrast, Perry brought up Burcham’s heartfelt advocacy while not speaking to criticism he had been lobbied into the order by a former aide representing a drug company. His statement misled by creating the impression Burcham swayed him to proceed with the executive order. In reality, by all accounts, that just didn’t happen. We rate Perry’s statement False.

During an extended interview with NBC’s Meet the Press from Ottumwa, Iowa, Trump addressed the situation on the Korean peninsula, where North Korea re-emerged in the news in recent days with the purported test of a hydrogen bomb by the regime of Kim Jong Un. "We have 28,000 soldiers on the line in South Korea between the madman and them," Trump said, referring to Kim. "We get practically nothing compared to the cost of this." This is not the first time Trump has used this talking point. In 2011, we checked this claim about South Korea: "We have 25,000 soldiers over there protecting them. They don't pay us. Why don't they pay us?" We rated the claim that South Korea doesn't pay False, noting that South Korea had picked up the tab for nearly $700 million in the most recent year for personnel, logistics and construction costs. On Meet the Press, Trump made a slightly less absolute statement. Rather than saying, "They don't pay us," he said, "We get practically nothing compared to the cost." So we took another look at this assertion. The Joint Security Area at the demilitarized zone between North Korea and South Korea in 2009, with South Korean soldiers in the foreground and a North Korean soldier in the distance. (Wikimedia Commons) We found that South Korea does still pay for the U.S. presence, which currently includes roughly 28,500 military personnel. (That’s far smaller than the roughly 500,000 South Korean service members on active duty, plus many more South Korean reserve troops.) In fact, South Korea pays quite a bit more than they did in 2011. In the most recent agreement, announced in early 2014, South Korea said it would pay $866.6 million that year to support the U.S. presence. That was 5.8 percent higher than the 2013 amount, and that could grow by as much as 4 percent annually through 2018. So is this "practically nothing compared to the cost" of a U.S. military presence, as Trump argues? Calculating the South Korean financial burden on a percentage basis is tricky, because it’s difficult to determine how much it "costs" the United States to station military personnel in South Korea. Do you include the annual salaries and benefits for the troops in question, or do you also include their equipment and past training? If you look at the most straightforward amount -- salary and benefits for 28,500 troops, which according to experts is roughly $100,000 a head -- then South Korea’s payments account for slightly more than 30 percent of U.S. costs in 2014. "It's hard to argue that more than $800 million annually is ‘peanuts’ or ‘next to nothing,’ " said Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University. Beyond that, several experts said Trump’s apparent premise -- that the United States is giving a growing, affluent country what amounts to a charitable gift -- is wrong. The United States itself benefits from the military investment in South Korea, they said. "U.S. forces are no longer there strictly to defend South Korea," said William W. Stueck, historian at the University of Georgia. "They are there to enhance regional stability as well. The point is that we have vital interests in East Asia and the Western Pacific, so why shouldn't we pay part of the bill for our force presence?" Janda concurred: "The traditional argument for keeping troops in South Korea is that it deters North Korea from attacking South Korea, stabilizes the region politically, socially, and economically, and gives the United States bases from which it can project military power throughout the western Pacific. In addition, he said, the military expense helps protect countries that buy U.S. products, he said. Allan R. Millett, a historian and director of the Eisenhower Center for American Studies at the National World War II Museum in New Orleans, agreed. "Alliances are not to be measured in dollars, but in their effectiveness at deterring conflict," he said. It’s also worth pointing out that South Korea’s willingness to share the costs means that it’s cheaper for U.S. military to support those 28,500 troops, compared to having them stationed elsewhere, even at bases in the United States. Reasonable people can disagree, Janda said, about whether South Korea is paying "enough," and whether the United States might be better off protecting South Korea with air and naval power rather than a sizable ground presence. Janda added that it’s possible to argue that the U.S. military presence "is partially destabilizing because it makes the Chinese and North Koreans nervous, and that we are too quick to see the world in purely military terms." Still, he said, "I don't hear Trump making nuanced arguments like that." Our ruling Trump said, "We get practically nothing compared to the cost of" keeping U.S. military forces in South Korea. Currently, South Korea pays well over $800 million annually to support the United States’ troop presence, an amount that doesn’t qualify as "practically nothing." And while Trump makes it sound like the United States’ willingness to pay the rest of the freight amounts to a gift to South Korea, he overlooks that the United States actually benefits significantly on a strategic level from the arrangement.

pomt-00806	"Not a single unarmed white person has been shot by the police" in New York in about 45 years.	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/01/fran-lebowitz/fran-lebowitz-claims-nypd-has-never-shot-unarmed-w/	Don’t get sardonic New York City writer Fran Lebowitz started on Rudy Giuliani. She is no fan of the former New York mayor and conservative pundit, especially after he loudly questioned President Barack Obama’s love for the United States. HBO host Bill Maher got an earful on the subject when he invited Lebowitz to appear in a panel about Giuliani’s rhetoric. Lebowitz said the explanation for Giuliani’s remarks is simple: His policies have been racist since his first election when he campaigned on a nostalgic 1950s-era platform, and this racism extended to longstanding disparate treatment of blacks and whites by the New York Police Department. "When Giuliani was the mayor, every five minutes an unarmed black guy was shot in the back. Constantly, you know, and it was always a different excuse from the cops," she said. " ‘He had something in his hand, I thought it was a gun.’ It was a candy bar. ‘He had something in his hand, I thought it was a gun.’ It was a keychain." Maher said, "Well, that hasn't changed, and that's not just New York." "In the entire time I've lived in New York, which has been many decades, not a single unarmed white person has been shot by the police," Lebowitz said. "Not one. Not one. You think the odds would be? Not one. So that is the reason they're shot, period." Lebowitz made two claims — that "every five minutes an unarmed black guy was shot in the back," and "not a single unarmed white person has been shot by the police" in the entire time Lebowitz has lived in New York. A reader asked us to hone in on the second claim, brushing off the first as hyperbole. Contacting Lebowitz Lebowitz moved to New York City from New Jersey sometime in the late 1960s. Our rough math: She was born in 1950, and this New York Times profile says she moved there after high school. So, to Lebowitz, an unarmed white person has not been shot by New York police in at least about 45 years. We reached her through representatives at the Steven Barclay Agency. Sara Bixler told PunditFact, "Fran Lebowitz tells me that to her knowledge, this is true — she meant it non-hyperbolically. She said that if she is wrong, she would like to know, of course." No simple data The difficulty in judging Lebowitz's statement is that there is no comprehensive database that details police shootings across the country, much less New York City. That means there is no go-to source that shows shootings by race and whether those shot were unarmed or armed. Reporting to the FBI is optional, and most of the country’s 18,000 law enforcement agencies choose not to report. The gap in data gained prominence after last fall’s shooting of Michael Brown by officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Mo. The New York Police Department likely can prove Lebowitz right or wrong. But the agency ignored our calls and emails spread out over more than five weeks. Our request was "under consideration" six days after the first email we sent Feb. 25. NYPD did not respond to our March 26 query for information. An early 1970s study So what information is available? We located a study of NYPD officer shootings from 1971 to 1975 by James J. Fyfe. His study, "Shots Fired," spans 700 pages and relies on access to detailed NYPD shooting incident records. Fyfe broke down the shootings by race and by weapon. More than half of the black residents who were shot by police were carrying a handgun, compared to 48 percent of Hispanics and 32 percent of whites. The white "opponents," as Fyfe calls them, were more likely to be shot while not carrying a weapon or while using physical force. Crucially for this fact-check, Fyfe's data show 56 whites were unarmed when police shot at them during those years (1971-75), and another 34 whites were shot when using physical force. Of the more than 1,800 primary opponents of police shootings during those years, 19 percent were white, 58 percent were black, and 23 percent were Hispanic. "She is simply wrong about unarmed whites ‘never’ being shot," said David Klinger, a University of Missouri St. Louis criminology professor who tracks police use of deadly force around the country. However, Fyfe’s report does include holes pivotal to our specific question. We can’t drill down on the circumstances in which the white residents ended up getting shot at by police. Racial categories are also very difficult to assess sometimes. And we can't ask Fyfe, who died in 2006. "Is a Spanish-speaking white person ‘Hispanic’ and thus non-white? Are English-speaking biracial people from immigrant backgrounds non-white?" said Candace McCoy, City University of New York criminology professor (McCoy and Fyfe were married). "New York is so incredibly diverse. It's hard to find people who are unequivocally what we consider as ‘white’ sometimes." What NYPD data says and doesn’t say NYPD has released an annual report outlining officers’ firearm discharges since 1971. That was a particularly brutal year for both shootings of cops (47 injured, 12 killed) as well as the number of people shot and killed by police (221 injured, 93 people killed). Those numbers have fallen substantially since the 1970s. In 2013, the latest year for which data is available, three officers were shot and none was killed, and officers shot 17 people and killed eight. We found several, but not all, reports online. And of the ones we found, many did not include critical racial data. The last chart in the appendix of recent reports outlines "intentional discharges" of firearms during adversarial conflicts, as well as the race and age of the person involved. Most often, this is when an officer shoots at a person armed with a gun in self-defense, though there are also categories for shootings of subjects with imitation firearms, threat or use of knives and other cutting objects, blunt instruments, or a final category called "use/threaten the use of overwhelming physical force." "Overwhelming physical force" covers times when an unarmed person physically attacks or threatens to attack an officer, such as gang assaults, pushing an officer from a roof or subway train platform, or trying to take the officer’s firearm. We compiled the following chart, filling in blanks for the number of whites shot each year and how many were unarmed if reports were available online. We could only go back to 1995. As you can see, many did not have the information we need. Year Number of whites shot Number whites unarmed 2013 2 0 2012 3 0 2011 7 0 2010 5 0 2009 0 0 2008 2 0 2007 2 unknown 2006 no race data kept 2005 no race data kept 2004 no race data kept 2003 no race data kept 2002 no race data kept 2001 no race data kept 2000 no race data kept 1999 no race data kept 1998 no race data kept 1997 26 unknown 1996 32 unknown Some observations after scouring the NYPD reports: • Whites are shot at less frequently than blacks and Hispanics. • The whites who were shot at by police were allegedly carrying a firearm, a blunt weapon, imitation gun, threatening others with weapons, or using their vehicles as weapons. • And most importantly in this quest, several years’ reports did not include information on the race of the victim. The last point was a bone of contention with the New York Civil Liberties Union, which in 2008 complained before the city council about the police not reporting the race of victims since 1998. The department was, however, reporting on the breed of dogs its officers shot. "That the department is providing more information about the dogs it is shooting at than people who are its intended targets is deeply disturbing and must be connected," the NYCLU said. We will note that these years cover some of Giuliani’s mayoral tenure from 1994 to 2001. The department has offered more descriptive accounting of officer-involved shootings in recent years after pressure from the NYCLU and media coverage. Other ideas We searched news articles from New York and found no case that explicity fits Lebowitz's criteria. We also consulted several experts on criminology and police shooting statistics looking for additional information. James Acker, a University of Albany-SUNY College of Criminal Justice professor, pointed us to a New York Daily News investigation that found in 179 officer-involved shootings, 86 percent of victims when race was known were either black or Hispanic. But we still do not know what percentage were white with certainty and whether they were armed. Fewer than one-third of the people who died were unarmed, as examined by the Daily News. Acker also suggested New York's vital statistics reports for deaths caused by legal interventions and then sorting by race/ethnicity. Using that tool, we know 15 whites were shot by police in the city from 2000 (the earliest starting point for the database) to 2012. That’s an undercount from the chart above. But we do not know whether they were armed. Contrary to Lebowitz’s broader point, Klinger notes, police violence actually fell under Giuliani. Victims in police shootings by NYPD cops fell from 90 people (29 fatals) in 1994 to 30 people in 2001 (11 fatal), Klinger said, citing his own records. D. Brian Burghart, editor and publisher of the Reno News & Review, created his own website, Fatal Encounters, to document fatal police shooting. Using his database, we found about a dozen examples of former, off-duty and current New York City police officers fatally shooting white people or killing them with their cars in accidents from pursuits or driving while intoxicated and off-duty. But most were armed with knives, guns or other weapons, or were killed during vehicle pursuits. Many showed signs of mental illness. There were no examples of an unarmed person being shot by a cop. Our ruling Lebowitz said, "Not a single unarmed white person has been shot by the police" since she has lived in New York. This was a bear of fact-check to wrestle to the ground, in part because of the lack of cooperation from the New York Police Department, in part because we were looking at a time period that spanned about 45 years, and in part because it is clear that African-Americans and Hispanics were clearly shot at by New York police much more than whites. All that said, an analysis of police data show police shot dozens of unarmed white people during the early 1970s, the early side of Lebowitz’s life in New York City. While we wish we had complete data on police shootings by each victim’s race and armed status for the 1980s on, we don’t necessarily need it to judge Lebowitz’s particular statement. It is very accurate to say blacks are shot at more often by police than whites. But that is not what Lebowitz said. She said "not a single unarmed white person has been shot," and that is not true. We rate her claim False. Note: This claim was fact-checked as part of a reward to our Kickstarter campaign to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union. Thanks to all who contributed.

pomt-00197	"When (Ron DeSantis) was asked what cancer patients should do without health insurance, DeSantis said 'show up to the emergency room.'"	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/oct/18/andrew-gillum/florida-democrats-say-ron-desantis-wants-send-canc/	Democrats are capitalizing on Ron DeSantis’ opposition to the Affordable Care Act in an ad that portrays him as having little concern for cancer patients. "In Congress, Ron DeSantis demanded that any new health law eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions," said an ad for Andrew Gillum's campaign produced with the Florida Democratic Party. "He’d let insurance companies deny them coverage. And when he was asked what cancer patients should do without health insurance, DeSantis said 'show up to the emergency room.'" We will explain the context of the comments by DeSantis about cancer patients and the emergency room. In a related fact-check we will explain the ad’s evidence related to his stance on pre-existing conditions. DeSantis, a longtime critic of the Affordable Care Act, was first elected to Congress in 2012 and resigned in September to focus on his race for governor against Gillum. A DeSantis campaign spokesman didn’t respond for this fact-check. CNN interview The statement about the emergency room stemmed from a March 8, 2017, appearance by DeSantis on Erin Burnett’s OutFront on CNN about a House Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act. The show included a clip of an interview with Republican Tiffany Koehler, who found out she had cancer shortly after she lost a race for the Wisconsin State Assembly. Koehler said she could only afford chemotherapy as a result of her state’s Medicaid expansion. Burnett asked DeSantis about Koehler’s situation (the bold emphasis is ours): Burnett: "I want to start with Tiffany's story that you just heard there because of course, the GOP House plan that we've seen does roll back the Medicaid expansion. And I know you think it doesn’t quite do enough on that front. What do you say to Tiffany? I mean, she's a Republican, but, you know, she wouldn't be alive, she wouldn't be here without that Medicaid expansion and Obamacare." DeSantis: "Well, if you remember when Obamacare was enacted, there were millions of people who had their health care canceled. And so there are stories of people who had certain needs, cancer or whatnot who got pushed into policies that they didn't want, and then they didn't have the same coverage that they had because of the broken promise. So I think this law has really created a lot of different aspects. "I would say though, and people who supported Obamacare used to make this point a lot before it passed, there really is no lack of health care. If people really need it, if they show up to the emergency room, they do get care, it just gets passed on --" Burnett: "But not -- I mean, she had $1 million in cancer treatments. You're not going to get that by showing up in an emergency room." DeSantis pivoted to his opinion that the health care law isn’t sustainable. For the rest of the interview, neither DeSantis nor Burnett brought up anything about patients showing up at an emergency room. So DeSantis did make the statement that if people need care they can go to the ER, but he was speaking broadly and not only about a cancer patient. A few days later at a testy town hall over health care at Bethune-Cookman University, DeSantis addressed his emergency room comment. He said "he had conflated two ideas" and that going to the emergency room "was not the way to handle that situation," according to the Daytona Beach News-Journal. (PolitiFact was unable to find a full video of that town hall.) Because emergency rooms by law cannot turn patients away, they can become a health care provider of last resort. President Barack Obama had expressed hope that the Affordable Care Act would lower emergency room use. In 2017, we found that there was strong evidence that emergency room usage hadn’t declined much, if at all, since the law largely took effect in 2013. There’s also evidence that it has increased. Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, told PolitiFact the problem with cancer treatment in emergency rooms is the lack of continuity of care. "Many hospitals, especially public hospitals, will have clinics and similar programs to treat people in a more ongoing way," she said, "but it still tends to be a very expensive way to receive care." Our ruling A Gillum ad said, "When he was asked what cancer patients should do without health insurance, DeSantis said 'show up to the emergency room.'" What he said is not that cut and dried. DeSantis did bring up the requirement that everyone be treated in the emergency room when a CNN host asked what he would say to a cancer patient who benefited from Medicaid expansion. In context, however, he appeared to be talking more broadly about "how there really is no lack of health care." He side-stepped the direct question, for sure. But he did not straight-up say that cancer patients should seek care at the ER. At a town hall a few days later, DeSantis said "he had conflated two ideas" and that going to the emergency room "was not the way to handle that situation." We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-05764	Says Connie Mack "failed to pay his child support."	false	/florida/statements/2012/feb/29/george-lemieux/lemieux-says-connie-mack-failed-pay-his-child-supp/	Judging from his latest Web ad, George LeMieux thinks his rival for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate is a loser on par with Hollywood bad boy Charlie Sheen. The ad parodies "Two and a Half Men" -- the show Sheen infamously quit in a snit -- to target U.S. Rep. Connie Mack, whom the ad mockingly calls "Half Mack." In the ad, we see an animated "Half Mack" in a series of buffoonish outfits as the ad makes its stinging charges: "Connie the fourth took seven and a half-years to finish college. … Drunken Brawls. … Arrested. … Road rage. … His only real job in the real world? An 'events coordinator' for Hooters! "In Congress, Half Mack bounced checks, didn’t pay bills, was sued by his Yacht club, stiffed his lawyer, even failed to pay his child support." There’s a lot of claims in that ad, and viewers can find background about much of it in a Miami Herald article that examined Mack’s past. We’ll be looking at a number of these claims in the days ahead. In this item, we will tackle the serious charge that Mack "failed to pay his child support." The ad shows many notices sailing by, each stamped "urgent," "overdue," or "past due." Mack (whose real name is Cornelius Harvey McGillicuddy IV) filed for divorce from his wife Ann McGillicuddy in August 2005 in Lee County Court. On July 12, 2006, the lawyer for the congressman filed a response to his estranged wife’s motion for contempt. The document states that Mack agreed to pay $1,700 a month in temporary support to his estranged wife starting May 1, 2006. His annual congressional salary in 2005 was $162,100, the Herald reported. That payment was apparently late. When we asked LeMieux’s campaign for evidence, they referred us to a court document from Mack’s divorce posted on the Herald’s website showing a single late payment in connection with the $1,700. The court record filed by Mack’s attorney showed he transferred $400 to Ann’s account July 3 while on vacation. Once he realized he made a mistake, according to the court filing, he transferred $1,000 on July 10, $164.49 on July 11, and $135.51 on July 12, as well as $175 on July 12 to cover any returned checks. We should note that the document said "temporary support" and "temporary alimony," and not child support, though news reports from the time indicated Mack had two children ages 3 and 5. The LeMieux campaign said the money should count as child support. "Financial support of the children is part of family support, and Connie Mack did not make the payment on time," LeMieux spokeswoman Anna Nix said in an email. Mack campaign spokesman David James said this was an alimony payment -- not child support. James told PolitiFact that the divorce wasn’t final on the dates in question, and negotiations were still ongoing. "The terminology of ‘late’ is one attorney’s interpretation of the facts." We were unable to reach Mack’s ex-wife or her attorney. We did speak with Carolyn Swift, the congressman’s attorney. She said the document the Herald posted specifically referred to the $1,700 that was agreed upon for temporary alimony, in addition to him paying other expenses, including the mortgage on their Virginia residence. Swift sent us a copy of a May 2006 agreed-upon order that described the $1,700 payment as "temporary alimony." The marital settlement agreement filed in late July said that the congressman would pay the mortgage in lieu of child support until the home was sold, Swift said. An addendum in 2007 set child support at $1,645 a month. Our ruling LeMieux’s ad said that Mack "failed to pay his child support," and the visuals of multiple "past due" notices suggest a pattern. LeMieux can’t prove that charge, though. Instead, LeMieux points to a court document that showed Mack was once 12 days late in paying for part of a $1,700 "temporary alimony" payment. LeMieux’s campaign argued that Mack’s late alimony payment could have been used to pay for their children’s expenses. We think saying that Mack "failed" to pay his child support is quite a stretch. It’s based on a single partial late payment of less than two weeks, and the payment was classified as alimony by the courts. We rate this claim False.

Assuming the new rules pass the Victorian Parliament, the state will have the lowest cap on political donations in the nation. It will also have the equal lowest disclosure threshold for donations and among the most transparent reporting requirements, while also casting its net widely to include third party political campaigners. Furthermore, penalties for breaches will be equal to the toughest in the country. Even so, the new rules are far from perfect. While foreign donations will be banned in Victoria (as they are in NSW and Queensland), Victoria won't be banning donations from property developers, or from tobacco, liquor and gambling businesses, as NSW has done. Because of Victoria's failure to match NSW's list of banned donors, one expert out of four contacted by Fact Check argued that Mr Andrews' proposed laws do not go far enough to qualify as the "strictest".

pomt-02489	Says David Jolly "supports privatizing Social Security."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/feb/17/florida-democratic-party/democrats-say-david-jolly-david-jolly-supports-pri/	Issues affecting seniors continue to drive a lot of the attack ads in the race to fill the seat held by the late U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young. One of the more persistent claims lately has been Democratic accusations that David Jolly wants to fundamentally change Social Security. In a robocall that began targeting Pinellas County’s independent seniors on Feb. 6, 2014, the Florida Democratic Party reinforces the attack. "Lobbyist Jolly also supports privatizing Social Security, which could force seniors to gamble with their retirement on the stock market, and Jolly even praised the Ryan Budget that turns Medicare into a costly voucher program," a woman’s voice says during the call. We’ve been over claims about Jolly’s actions on Medicare and the Ryan budget before, but does he want to privatize Social Security? This sound bite ends up being quite a mouthful. Securing Jolly’s platform Former congressional aide-turned-lobbyist Jolly has faced repeated attacks over his past advocacy of other issues before. Part of the evidence for this claim is that one of his old clients, Free Enterprise Nation, was run by a man named James MacDougald. Jolly in 2009 lobbied U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., for issues relating to Medicare and Social Security -- namely that future years of debt aren’t readily apparent to taxpayers, according to the Republican candidate. He listed only "Social Security Reform" as one of the topics of the meeting on a lobbying disclosure form. His campaign said he was "critical of the Ryan budget" in the meeting with the congressman. Ryan’s budget plans over the years called for revamping the Social Security Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program by allowing workers younger than 55 to divert some of their contributions from Social Security to voluntary personal savings accounts. The money in the accounts would be invested, overseen by the government, instead of paying for current retiree benefits. MacDougald has favored a similar approach, calling for a "defined contribution" plan for anyone younger than 50. That means the government would make a set contribution to workers, who then would have investment options. (MacDougald is now Jolly’s campaign finance co-chairman.) Jolly has said he doesn’t support this idea, but "anybody that has an intellectually honest conversation knows we have to have long-term entitlement reform in order to balance the budget." He told the Tampa Bay Times that in any such discussion, in the newspaper’s paraphrasing, "everything should be on the table, including private accounts in which workers make their own investment decisions, as well as the important role of Social Security as a safety net." Democrats have subsequently used the wording as proof Jolly supports privatization. "David Jolly has been very clear on his position that he supports preserving Social Security," campaign spokeswoman Sarah Bascom said in a statement. "In fact, that is one of the reasons he is on record saying he would not have voted for the Ryan budget because of certain changes to the Social Security program." Democrats are making hay about the fact that Jolly said "there was a lot of good in the Ryan budget" during the Dec. 8, 2013, edition of Bay News 9’s Political Connections. That portion of the quote doesn’t tell the whole story, however. "I think we have to be careful on the Ryan budget for a couple of reasons," he said on the show. "Entitlement programs — Social Security, Medicare — we know what that means to the community here. I have said from the very beginning, we have to protect the promises that have been made, to everybody." When pressed about whether he would have voted for the budget proposal with House Republicans, Jolly said he "would have to examine the details of the Ryan plan." He has also referred to his position in a Feb. 3, 2014, interview on Tampa Bay TV station WFLA. "On Social Security and Medicare, I came out very early, in a Republican primary, full of Republican conservative voters, and suggested one, I would have voted against the Ryan plan," he said. "And two, I believe we do have to protect benefits not just for current beneficiaries, but for those who have already vested into the program as a result of working 40 quarters." A quarter of coverage is a period of time based on a worker’s total wages or income over the year. A maximum of four quarters can be earned per year, and 40 quarters must be earned to become fully vested (or "fully insured," as the Social Security Administration calls it) for retirement benefits. That means a worker would have to put in a minimum of 10 years in the employment pool to qualify for full benefits, if they earned all four quarters in a year. So generally speaking, Jolly is saying he wants to particularly protect those who have worked for 10 years, while looking at changes for young workers. Jolly told the Tampa Bay Times editorial board in a Dec. 9, 2013, meeting before the primary that he supported keeping Social Security and Medicare the same except for the youngest workers. Jolly referred to similar phrasing in a Feb. 3 debate with Democratic opponent Alex Sink and Libertarian hopeful Lucas Overby, adding "long-term entitlement reform is the only way to reach a balanced budget." Our ruling Democrats say Jolly "supports privatizing Social Security," using a paraphrased statement that private accounts should be on the table in discussing future reforms. They also point to the fact Jolly had a meeting with Ryan to discuss the program. Jolly says he’s been very clear where he stands on Social Security, but we don’t think it’s all that apparent. Saying private accounts should be an option doesn’t denote advocacy, but rather a willingness to explore options. Which option Jolly favors isn’t so clear, beyond setting some kind of benefit guarantee for people who have already qualified for Social Security or are currently receiving payments. He hasn’t said whether private accounts were at the top of his list of potential fixes, only that they should be considered. Democrats are attempting to make it sound like he is 100 percent behind the idea, but don’t offer any proof beyond a paraphrased statement. We rate the statement Mostly False.

pomt-04952	Says he has seen Border Patrol signs near the Mexico border in English, Spanish and Chinese.	true	/texas/statements/2012/jul/26/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-hes-seen-border-patrol-signs-e/	Republican U.S. Senate hopeful David Dewhurst, saying the U.S.-Mexico border is dangerously porous, said in a July 17, 2012, debate in Dallas that he has even witnessed suspicious signs. "I’ve seen the Border Patrol signs that are now in English, Spanish and Chinese," Dewhurst said in the debate with Ted Cruz, his opponent. Six days later, Dewhurst similarly referred to such signs in the pair’s last debate before the July 31, 2012, primary runoff. Border signs in English and Spanish, sure. But Chinese? Dewhurst’s camp did not respond to our inquiry about this. But Daniel Milian, a Border Patrol supervisor in the agency’s Rio Grande Valley sector, told us such signs are posted next to "rescue beacon" towers arrayed in the rough brush country that covers much of the Texas-Mexico border region. In a telephone interview, Milian said the towers, 40- to 50-feet tall, are visible from great distances, the idea being that border crossers in danger of falling ill or dying spot them and come close. He said the signs instruct individuals to press a button to summon authorities. And, Milian said, the signs are in English, Spanish and Mandarin, which is the group of dialects most widely spoken in China. The point, Milian said, is to deliver the message in ways that border crossers can understand. He said Mandarin was chosen because immigrants from China are second to immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries among border-crossers apprehended by the Border Patrol. How exactly did this transpire? In a March 3, 2009, Border Patrol press release, the Rio Grande Valley sector said it was deploying two beacons in preparation for summer heat and to "reduce the possibility of heat-related injuries and death." The release says the beacons were "designed for deployment to remote areas along the border and to provide people, who perceive themselves to be in a life-threatening situation, with a mechanism for summoning assistance." "The beacons will be embedded in established illegal alien and smuggling routes and are designed to provide a means by which persons in distress may locate, activate and summon emergency assistance," the 2009 release says. The release quotes Ronald Citiello, chief patrol agent in Falfurrias, as saying: "We work very hard to ensure that our borders are secure and safe, but many lives are still lost as a result of people not fully comprehending the inherent dangers of illegally crossing through the remote areas and not being aware of how quickly heat related distress can occur. More recently, an April 27, 2012, Border Patrol press release stating that Border Patrol agents at the agency’s Falfurrias station, which is in Brooks County, saved the lives of two illegal immigrants that day after the pair activated a beacon. The release says the Border Patrol has six rescue beacons "strategically placed on ranches throughout the area Since Oct. 1, 2011, the release says, Border Patrol agents in the region had "saved the lives of more than 120" illegal immigrants, "whose lives were in jeopardy due to a variety of circumstances. Nationally, Border Patrol officers apprehended about 340,000 illegal residents through the latest federal fiscal year, from October 2010 through September 2011, the agency says, including nearly 126,000 along or near the Texas-Mexico border. We failed to determine how many of the apprehended individuals were Chinese. But a July 2011 "fact sheet" from the Department of Homeland Security states that nationally, immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries comprised more than 95 percent of Border Patrol apprehensions over the five fiscal years through September 2010 with immigrants from China accounting for 0.3 percent or fewer of each year’s apprehensions. In the year running through September 2010, 1,157 apprehended individuals were of Chinese nationality. Our ruling While we did not learn where Dewhurst saw the signs, his statement rates True.

pomt-03460	"The United States has never stood by and seen innocent people slaughtered to the extent that's happening in Syria."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/18/saxby-chambliss/saxby-chambliss-says-us-has-never-stood-and-seen-i/	Last week, the United States announced that it was convinced that the Syrian regime led by Bashar al-Assad had used chemical weapons, thus crossing a line set by President Barack Obama that would trigger U.S. involvement in the three-year-long rebellion and resulting civil war. On CNN’s The Situation Room, Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., made the case for U.S. involvement in Syria. Chambliss serves as vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. "The United States has never stood by and seen innocent people slaughtered to the extent that's happening in Syria," Chambliss said. "The United States does not need to be the world's policeman, but the United States does need to step in when tyrants like this, really, in a very militant way, kill innocent people on a regular basis." We wondered: Is there a precedent for the United States failing to intervene in the slaughter of innocents on a scale as large as, or larger than, the conflict in Syria? The first part of answering this question is to determine how many people have been killed in Syria. As in the case of most conflicts, estimating the number of deaths tends to be imprecise. However, an office of the United Nations reported this month that the death toll in Syria reached at least 93,000 by the end of April. Of course, the United States has combated, in one way or another, cases of mass civilian deaths, including World War II Japan, North Korea during the Korean War, the former Yugoslavia, Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, and Taliban-led Afghanistan. A spokeswoman for Chambliss said the senator was referring to "tragedies like Bosnia, where the United States had full knowledge of the abuses occurring, and had the ability and resources to intervene. The United States now has confirmation that Assad used chemical weapons on his own people, and so appropriate action must be taken." But there are numerous examples in which the U.S. had initelligence about mass killings and chose not to intervene. The most obvious example of a genocide not directly challenged by the United States, of course, is the Holocaust. "You need search no further" to debunk Chambliss’ comment than the genocide of European Jewry, said Debórah Dwork, director of the Strassler Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Clark University. All told, Nazi Germany "deliberately killed about 11 million noncombatants, a figure that rises to more than 12 million if foreseeable deaths from deportation, hunger, and sentences in concentration camps are included," Timothy Snyder, a Yale historian, has written. The United States fought Nazi Germany in World War II, of course. The U.S. government had a pretty good idea what was going on by at least April 1943, when the U.S. and the United Kingdom called a conference in Bermuda to discuss refugees amid growing public urgings to save Jewish populations in Europe, Dwork said. But the parties to the conference essentially sidestepped the question, and diverting military assets to directly challenge the infrastructure of the Holocaust remained off the Allies’ agenda until the war ended in 1945. There are other examples -- lots of them. While politics and historical uncertainty makes it impossible to create a perfect list, there are quite a few examples that would seem to undercut Chambliss’ claim. • Communist China. While the United States was hardly friendly toward Mao Zedong’s China prior to President Richard Nixon’s rapprochement in the 1970s, the U.S. didn’t directly intervene when millions in China were killed in such government programs as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. Frank Dikötter, a Hong Kong-based historian, told the British newspaper The Independent that in just the four-year period between 1958 and 1962, at least 45 million people were worked, starved or beaten to death. Measuring a longer period, the death toll would surely be higher. • The Soviet Union. As for the United States’ World War II ally, Snyder estimates that a variety of policies under Josef Stalin -- including the elimination of relatively prosperous peasants known as "kulaks," ethnic cleansing, preventable famine and political purges -- resulted in the deliberate killing of 6 million noncombatants and the preventable deaths of an additional 3 million. • Cambodia. Dictator Pol Pot, leader of the Khmer Rouge, is believed to have killed approximately 2 million people between 1975 and 1979 through execution, starvation and disease. • The Armenian genocide. The widespread killing of Armenians in the Ottoman empire starting in 1915 is hotly contested historical turf between Armenians and present-day Turks, but the University of Minnesota’s Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies has estimated that a total of 1.5 million Armenians died over the course of several years. • Ethiopia. Ethiopian dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam is blamed for as many as 500,000 deaths as a result of his "red terror" political campaign in 1977 and 1978, according to Amnesty International. A subsequent famine, for which he is at least partially blamed, claimed the lives of an estimated 1 million. • Biafra. From 1967 to 1970, Nigeria went to war against the breakaway state of Biafra. The war, combined with a resulting famine, may have claimed 1 million people. • Rwanda. In just 100 days, perhaps 1 million ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Earlier this year, former President Bill Clinton told CNBC that if his own administration had acted sooner, 300,000 lives might have been saved -- an enormous regret for the former president that led to the creation of his nonprofit foundation. "If we'd gone in sooner, I believe we could have saved at least a third of the lives that were lost," he said in the interview. "It had an enduring impact on me." • Uganda. During his rule from 1971 to 1979, Ugandan dictator Idi Amin is blamed for between 300,000 and 500,000 deaths. • Darfur. Over the course of a decade, Sudanese government attacks in the southwestern region of Darfur led to the deaths of an estimated 300,000 people. • Liberia. Liberian Dictator Charles Taylor and the wars he started are blamed for the deaths of more than 300,000 people. • Bangladesh. The war that led to the creation of Bangladesh in 1971 -- previously a geographically isolated portion of Pakistan -- led to the deaths of 269,000 people, according to a study in the British Medical Journal. • Burundi. Ethnic violence starting in 1993 led to the deaths of about 200,000 people in Burundi. All in all, Chambliss’ statement "is clearly incorrect," said Herbert Hirsch, a political scientist who specializes in genocide at Virginia Commonwealth University. Indeed, the list above is not comprehensive. University of Hawaii political scientist R.J. Rummel lists no fewer than 219 cases between 1900 and 1987. "While I definitely do not endorse Rummel’s entire catalog, his basic point is surely sound: Government-led or government-caused slaughter has been a good deal more lethal than traditional state-on-state war," said Ted R. Bromund, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. "I would therefore not be able to agree with Sen. Chambliss's statement." Bromund and Brookings Institution senior fellow Michael O’Hanlon did agree, however, that the decision on whether to intervene in Syria needs to be made on its own merits, not decided by adherence to the United States’ track record. "There are many cases where we’ve stood by with much larger death tolls," O’Hanlon said. "But that doesn’t really justify inaction in Syria." Then again, "adopting a rule to intervene against all and any regime that kills innocents on a regular basis would mean getting involved in numerous countries around the globe," said Robert Gellately, a historian at Florida State University. "Rushing into a hot conflict like the one in Syria does not appear to be prudent at this stage." Our ruling Chambliss said, "The United States has never stood by and seen innocent people slaughtered to the extent that's happening in Syria." That claim is undercut by myriad examples in which more than 100,000 civilians were killed yet the United States did not take direct and significant action. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-08995	Says Democratic opponent is "too Republican to stand up for us."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2010/jul/14/vincent-fort/fort-contends-opponet-republican-democratic-clothi/	It doesn’t get much nastier than this in Fulton County politics. State Sen. Vincent Fort (D-Atlanta) finds himself under a withering political assault from upstart Graham Balch, a 36-year-old biology teacher at Grady High School, a former Peace Corps volunteer, a Barack Obama supporter and a man who has the backing of some true heavyweights in the Atlanta business community. A renegade in the state Legislature who has never shied away from confrontation, Fort now finds himself in a fierce, under-the-radar firefight to save the District 39 Senate job he has held for 14 years. It just might be the biggest battle in Georgia this year for a legislative seat held by an incumbent. But there have been no debates or even joint appearances by Fort and Balch. This fight to the finish is being played out in direct-mail broadsides and so-called robo attacks (recorded telephone calls). Senate District 39 runs from East Point in the south up through Midtown and into Buckhead. It includes portions of southwest Atlanta. It’s a diverse district with a majority black (62 percent) population. It contains some of Atlanta’s richest and poorest neighborhoods. And it’s always been a sure win for Democrats. That will be the case again this election cycle. Fort and Balch are the only candidates running. And they have both signed up as Democrats. But there’s a twist, at least according to Fort. The veteran politician and college history professor contends Balch is not much of a Democrat at all. In a mailer sent to District 39 residents, and in subsequent media interviews, Fort argued that Balch is little more than a Republican masquerading as a Democrat. That’s a politically incendiary charge in District 39. One Fort mailer has a photo of Balch on the front. Below are photos of three elephants doing tricks with GOP stickers on their bodies. The headline reads: "How Republican is Graham Balch? The headline on the other side reads: "Graham Balch. Too Republican to stand up for us." It’s a point Fort has continued to hammer home to supporters and reporters. "He’s a Republican in Democratic clothing," Fort said in an interview with PolitiFact Georgia. Rubbish, Balch said. He accused Fort of twisting the facts to smear him. "I am 100 percent a Democrat, and I’m very proud of that." Balch said. But is Fort correct? Or is the veteran lawmaker and political firebrand simply playing the party card to discredit the only real challenger he has faced in more than a decade? Fort stands by his mailer. "He worked for a Republican congressman and he voted in the Republican primary," Fort said. "That makes him a Republican." Balch agreed with Fort that he did intern for a Republican congressman while working on his thesis about the GOP’s impact on environmental policy. He interned for then U.S. Rep. Sherwood Boehlert, a moderate Republican from New York known for his environmental activism. And Balch said he did vote in the 2000 and 2004 GOP primaries in Pennsylvania, where he lived at the time. But he did so, Balch said, to cast a write-in protest vote against George W. Bush. Georgia voters, unlike those in Pennsylvania, do not register by political party. "I have done some protest votes against Bush because I think he stole the 2000 election (both in winning the Republican nomination and the general election) with dirty politics, and because I consider him the worst president in U.S. history," Balch said. "That protest vote is why I am listed that way in Pennsylvania." A review of voting records in Pennsylvania shows Balch is listed as "Republican" and "inactive." There is no independent way to determine why Balch voted in the Pennsylvania GOP primary. So PolitiFact Georgia sought more recent records. We went to VoteBuilder, which touts itself as a "partnership between the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Party of Georgia." It’s an effort to identify and target people who consistently vote for Democrats. VoteBuilder gives Balch an 83 percent rating as a Democrat. It places him in its "strong Democrats" category. Balch is also an elected member of the Fulton County Democratic Party, according to its Web site. He holds Seat 2 in House District 59. Fort is unimpressed. "A corpse could get elected to that position," Fort said. "It’s a social club." A check of financial contribution records also shows Balch has given money to Georgia Win List, a group that backs female Democratic candidates. And he specifically contributed to the campaign of state Rep. Margaret Kaiser, a Democrat from Atlanta. There was no indication he has ever contributed to Republican candidates. The Fort-Balch race has taken on some of the overtones of last year’s slugfest between Kasim Reed and Mary Norwood for mayor of Atlanta. That race was nonpartisan, but Reed’s camp accused Norwood of being too cozy with Republicans. Reed narrowly won the hard-fought contest. "He’s saying to himself, ‘Hey, this worked for Kasim Reed against Mary Norwood, so let’s try it again,’ " Balch said in a telephone interview with PolitiFact Georgia. Reed has endorsed Fort and held a fund-raiser for him, spokeswoman Sonji Dade said. Fort was a staunch supporter of Reed in the mayoral race. Fort has repeatedly said that Balch’s contributors are Republican. But a check of those records indicates they come from both political camps, many of them with strong ties to the business community. Fort accuses the business community of trying to run him out of office because of his aggressive stand against the privatization of Grady Memorial Hospital. He was a frequent vocal critic of the move. And Fort was even hauled away in handcuffs after he disrupted one Grady board meeting. Contributors to Balch’s campaign include Metro Chamber of Commerce President Sam Williams, former Cousins Properties CEO Tom Bell and Lisa Borders, a former president of the Atlanta City Council who is now president of the Grady Foundation. "The good ol’ boys are out to get me," Fort said during a recent telephone interview with PolitiFact Georgia. Fort would have been correct if he had said Balch is strongly backed by Atlanta’s business community. But the state senator appears to be on shaky ground accusing his opponent of being a Republican. We give Fort a Barely True on this one. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

Obama said a broad coalition of supporters including "doctors and nurses, workers and businesses, hospitals and even drug companies — folks who represent different parties and perspectives, including leading Democrats and many leading Republicans" were pushing reform forward. "Just this week, the Senate Finance Committee approved a reform proposal that has both Democratic and Republican support," he said. It was the last statement that caught our attention. Leaders of the majority party often boast about bipartisan support when in fact they have only a handful of votes from the minority. But in this case, Obama so far has just one Republican in the Senate. The Senate Finance Committee voted to approve a version of the health care overhaul on a vote of 14-9 on Oct. 13. Sen. Olympia Snowe, a Republican from Maine, voted with the Democrats. Every other Republican on the committee opposed the measure. Sen. Charles Grassley of Iowa, the ranking Republican member on the committee, called the measure partisan and deeply flawed. So Obama is technically correct that the proposal had "Democratic and Republican support." But he didn't mention that it got only one Republican vote, which meant the nine other GOP senators voted against it. That's not exactly a robust example of bipartisanship. So we rate his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06790	"The governor having a meeting ... isn't covered by the open meetings act."	true	/georgia/statements/2011/aug/16/sam-olens/olens-governor-isnt-covered-open-meetings-laws/	For a few brief minutes, a breakfast meeting featuring Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens became a grievance-fest. In May, Gov. Nathan Deal used Georgia State Patrol troopers to block a Fox 5 reporter from a news conference where Deal signed a controversial immigration bill into law. The station had just aired a story questioning his daughter-in-law’s role in raising money for the governor’s campaign. Three months later, members of the Atlanta Press Club, which sponsored the breakfast, were still angry, and they pelted the state’s top lawyer with questions. One asked whether it was legal for Deal to use troopers to keep reporters from a news conference. "Well, time for me to go home now," Olens quipped. He continued: "The question presented from a legal context is whether the state’s open meetings act precluded that activity. And the answer is no. The answer is the governor having a meeting isn’t, frankly, subject to the open meetings act," Olens said. "It’s the governor, it’s one person, it’s not a board," he said. "So if you literally look to the wording of the act it doesn’t relate to that kind of activity." The most powerful elected official in the state isn’t covered by state open meetings law? We thought this claim was worth a second look. First, a word about open meetings. These laws are the reason why any citizen can pull up a chair at a county commission meeting and watch elected officials debate whether they should let developers build a new shopping center or ban residents from owning pit bulls. This scrutiny is supposed to keep politicians honest. When he took office, Olens said he would push for reforms that would strengthen open meetings and records laws. A hearing on the proposed changes is scheduled for Aug. 30 at the state Capitol. Now back to Olens’ claim that "the governor having a meeting isn’t, frankly, subject to the open meetings act." The state Attorney General’s Office pointed us to Title 50, Chapter 14 of Georgia’s open records law. We took a good look. The law says that gatherings of a quorum of the members of a governing body must be open to the public and announced at least 24 hours in advance. Agencies must make agendas available to the public before the meeting and release minutes within two business days afterward. The statute says state departments, agencies, boards, commissions, public corporations and authorities, counties, municipal corporations, school districts, and a host of other bodies are covered by the law. But it doesn’t say a thing about the governor. The law doesn’t apply to governors, said Hollie Manheimer, executive director of the Georgia First Amendment Foundation "Mr. Olens' interpretation is correct," Manheimer said. This is not to say that the governor can meet up with anyone in private, Manheimer said. If he meets with any of the bodies mentioned in the state’s open meetings law, those public officials would have to comply with that law. And the governor can choose to abide by the law, even though he’s not technically subject to it. State and federal statutes often protect or exempt chief executives from open meetings law, said Mark Caramanica, an expert on freedom of information laws at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press. For instance, he said, a White House Cabinet meeting is closed to the public. David Hudson, an Augusta attorney who is counsel for the Georgia Press Association, said that Georgia law was drafted this way decades ago because the priority was to ensure boards that have the authority to vote, act on and implement public policies would conduct their business publicly. A governor, as a single person, does not have this kind of power, Hudson said. It’s worth noting that the Georgia Legislature is exempt from open meetings law, too, thanks to the 1975 state Supreme Court decision Coggin v. Davey. Members of the media sued to complain that they were excluded from a General Assembly committee meeting, but legislators argued they weren’t covered by the open meetings law. The General Assembly won. So there you have it. Of all the elected officials covered by Georgia’s open meetings laws, Nathan Deal isn’t one of them. We rule Olen’s claim True.

pomt-07911	"Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican-controlled state legislature have added over $140 million in new special interest spending"	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2011/feb/01/one-wisconsin-now/one-wisconsin-now-says-scott-walker-and-legislatur/	With his first "state of the state" address the night of Feb. 1, 2011, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker likely will tout some of his early legislative victories. Among them: Three tax breaks worth an estimated $140 million. But one of Walker’s political antagonists, Madison-based One Wisconsin Now, has slammed the three bills. In a Jan. 28, 2011, news release, the liberal advocacy group said: "Gov. Scott Walker and the Republican-controlled state legislature have added over $140 million in new special interest spending." So, which is it? Tax cuts or spending? We know that state government folks are pretty crafty. But is it really possible for them to spend money they’ve decided not to tax in the first place? One Wisconsin Now’s statement cites three of the measures taken up by lawmakers since Walker called them into special session just hours after being inaugurated on Jan. 3, 2011. Here’s a look at each of the bills and their financial impact as estimated by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the Legislature’s non-partisan research agency. Economic development tax credit Signed into law Jan. 31, 2011, this bill increases the state’s economic development tax credit fund to $98.1 million, up from $73.1 million. The fund provides a tax credit for job creation, capital investment or related activity. The additional $25 million in credits is not expected to be claimed during the 2011-2013 biennium. So, if employers create new jobs and claim the credits, they would pay less in taxes to the state. No spending would be involved. Health Savings Account deduction Also signed into law, this measure allows people to deduct contributions they make to Health Savings Accounts from their state income taxes, as they can from their federal income taxes. Nearly every other state already allows this. The deductions will reduce state revenue by an estimated $20.7 million in 2011-2012 and $27.3 million in 2012-2013. Tax deduction for creating jobs Under this bill, which is awaiting Walker’s signature, employers would receive a tax deduction for each job they create. They would pay an estimated $33.5 million less per year in income and franchise taxes. In other words, the bill doesn’t result in any spending, but the state would take in less tax money. See a pattern here? The bills in question don’t create any expenditures -- those are done in budget bills, which Walker has yet to introduce. But they do mean the state will take in less money. One Wisconsin Now says they apply to "special interests." They may be targeted for specific purposes, but they also hit a wide range of people, including small business owners and any working person who has an HSA. We asked Scot Ross, One Wisconsin Now’s executive director, how his organization could say the state would be spending $140 million when the effect of the three bills would be that the state would have $140 million less to spend. His reply: "When money would otherwise be in the treasury which is no longer going to be there as a result of legislative action, that is the definition of spending." Actually, it’s just the Legislature making the treasury smaller. But we decided to ask the question again. Ross: "If no action had been taken, this money would have been in the treasury. It will now no longer be in the treasury. We feel that is a form of spending." Hmmm. Ross is no dummy. He has a B.A. from the University of Pittsburgh and an M.A. from George Washington University, according to a political bio. He’s worked for a number of Democratic politicos, including Wisconsin congressman Ron Kind. He even worked as a journalist. And Ross isn’t alone with his spending notion. David Riemer, who was budget director under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, said the concept of a "tax expenditure" dates back some 50 years to Stanley Surrey, an assistant U.S. treasury secretary. The idea, Riemer said, is that tax breaks with a particular purpose that could be accomplished by direct spending should be considered expenditures. "Their way of viewing this," Riemer said of One Wisconsin Now, "is a legitimate, honestly grounded approach. But there’s also legitimate arguments on the other side." OK, let’s go to the other side. George Lightbourn, who was secretary of administration under two Republican Wisconsin governors, said that what One Wisconsin Now is claiming is "ridiculous" -- "there’s nothing being spent, there’s not an appropriation being made." "From a political standpoint, I could see where you’d make that argument," Lightbourn said, referring to One Wisconsin Now. "But it wouldn’t hold water with the accountants." Or with the average taxpayer. We decided to try Ross a third time. This time, he tried to make his case by pointing out that Walker had described the federal stimulus bill as spending, even though the bill included tax cuts. Tax cuts and credits did make up about one-third of the $862 billion stimulus-- but two-thirds was spending. Three strikes is enough. One Wisconsin Now called $140 million in state tax breaks "spending." It’s estimated that the three bills in question would bring in $140 million less to state coffers. But that’s not spending. You can’t spend what you don’t have. We rate the statement Pants on Fire. Update: The day this PolitiFact item, One Wisconsin Now executive director Scot Ross modified the way he described the three tax break bills. Rather than calling them spending, he said in a news release issued by the liberal Citizen Action of Wisconsin that the bills are "deficit-hiking corporate giveaways."

pomt-13417	"I never said" that Muslims would be subject to profiling under his policies.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/21/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-he-never-called-profiling-muslim/	During an interview with Fox News’ Bill O’Reilly, Donald Trump pleaded innocence when asked whether he supports profiling Muslims as a way of preventing terrorism. O’Reilly asked Trump, "When you say that you're going to profile certain Muslims, are you ever worried that the peaceful Muslims, and there are millions of American … are you worried that sometimes when you say these things, (that) peaceful Muslims will be the victim of backlash, the victim of people just lumping everybody into the terror jar?" Trump responded, "Well, first of all, I never said that they were Muslims. You did. You told me Muslims. I didn't say that. I am saying ... people that maybe look suspicious. I didn't say they were Muslims." Is it true that Trump didn’t suggest profiling Muslims as a security measure? We checked Trump’s past comments and concluded that he’s correct only in the narrowest sense. The O’Reilly interview The strictest way to interpret Trump’s comment is that he only denied saying those words in O’Reilly’s interview. But even this limited claim has some problems. Earlier in the interview, O’Reilly had asked, "You want to profile Arab or Muslim men. How would that work?" Trump responded, "Well, we have no choice. Look, Israel does it. And Israel does it very successfully." This wasn’t the first interview in which Trump had accepted a question premised on the idea that he wants to profile Muslims. In a June 19, 2016, interview with John Dickerson on CBS’ Face the Nation, Dickerson asked, "Are you talking about increasing profiling of Muslims in America?" Trump responded, "Well, I think profiling is something that we're going to have to start thinking about as a country. And other countries do it. And you look at Israel and you look at others, and they do it. And they do it successfully. And I hate the concept of profiling. But we have to start using common sense, and we have to use our heads." Previous statements A more common pattern we found in Trump’s past comments was to talk explicitly about the specific security measures he would consider for Muslims, but without using the word "profiling." A good example is surveillance of mosques, which seems like an obvious case of a policy that targets a security procedure to people of a specific religion. For instance, in an interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe on Nov. 16, 2015, Trump was asked about shutting down mosques. "Well, I would hate to do it, but it's something you're going to have to strongly consider." He repeated the call in another appearance that day, saying, "You're going to have to watch and study the mosques, because a lot of talk is going on at the mosques." He echoed this call five days later in remarks at a rally in Birmingham, Ala., saying, "I want surveillance of certain mosques if that's okay. We've had it before." And on two more recent occasions, he revived the call for mosque surveillance. One came on June 13, 2016, in comments on Fox & Friends: "We have to be very strong in terms of looking at the mosques, you know, which a lot of people say, 'Oh, we don't want to do that. We don't want to do that.' We're beyond that." The other came in the interview we cited earlier with John Dickerson on June 19, 2016. Dickerson asked, "And you said you would check respectfully the mosques. How do you respectfully check a mosque?" "Well, you do as they used to do in New York, prior to this mayor dismantling," Trump said. "By the way, if you go to France right now, they're doing it in France. In fact, in some instances, they are closing down mosques. People don't want to talk about it. People aren't talking about it. But look at what they're doing in France. They are actually closing down mosques." Then there was the statement from the campaign on "preventing Muslim immigration," personally signed by Trump on Dec. 7, 2015. "Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country's representatives can figure out what is going on," the statement said in part. We should note that we found one case in which Trump expressed caution about a kind of special security treatment for Muslims -- access to guns and ammunition. In the interview with CBS’ Dickerson, the host asked Trump, "When you talk about political correctness, should a Muslim buying ammunition and weapons get extra scrutiny?" Trump answered, "I don't know about that." The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling Trump told O’Reilly that he "never said" Muslims would be subject to profiling under his policies. On two occasions -- including once earlier in the same O’Reilly interview -- a questioner asked him about his proposal to profile Muslims, and Trump did not object to that description. He has also repeatedly suggested other types of security policies that would specifically target Muslims, including mosque surveillance and an ban on Muslims entering the United States. The statement is not accurate, so we rate it False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-09-21T15:33:16	2016-09-19	['None']
pomt-03785	Says "$1,100 of the tuition paid by every Oregon university student annually goes just to pay the costs of PERS."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2013/mar/29/dennis-richardson/does-1100-tuition-paid-every-oregon-university-stu/	PolitiFact Oregon is no stranger to claims about just how much the Public Employees Retirement System drives state spending. Not too long ago, we checked into Gov. John Kitzhaber’s claim that half of the $1,000 per student increase in spending in primary and secondary education in the next biennium was due to the retirement costs. (The statement was true.) So when fiscal conservative Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point, made his own retirement system claim, our ears perked right up. In a newsletter to constituents, Richardson noted that "$1,100 of the tuition paid by every Oregon university student annually goes just to pay the costs of PERS." The representative's source was a presentation by Jay Kenton, the Oregon University System’s vice chancellor for finance and administration. Kenton had given a presentation on what drives the cost of higher education. Naturally, retirement and health care costs are a big piece of the equation. Essentially what Kenton had done was to take the total retirement costs of employees -- both faculty and staff -- paid in part from tuition. He then prorated the total by actual percentage of it paid with tuition dollars. After all that math, he found that the projected share of an individual student’s annual tuition going toward university staff retirement benefits for the 2012-13 year was $849. That’s actually about on par for what it was the previous year, too. So how did Richardson get the $1,100 figure? Well, that’s where Kenton’s projections put the figure for the 2013-14 school year, should Kitzhaber’s proposed reforms not be enacted. With the technical bits out of the way, we went back to Richardson’s statement. He said that "$1,100 of the tuition paid by every Oregon university student annually goes just to pay the costs of PERS." He’s right, but only if the projections come to pass. In other words, we may get there, but we haven’t yet. As it is now, that figure is closer to $850. It’s still high, to be sure, but it’s about $250 less than the figure Richardson is using. The ruling: Richardson’s statement reads as if we’ve been at the $1,100 mark for a while, when in truth we haven’t actually gotten there. If the Legislature passes significant reforms this year -- a big if -- we may never get there. If we were writing a newsletter, we’d have gone with the most recent solid figure from the 2011-12 school year, which is about $850. Or, we would have made it clearer that the $1,100 was an extrapolation, a prediction. Richardson did neither. Though his claim is accurate, it requires additional information. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Dennis Richardson	None	None	None	2013-03-29T14:27:04	2013-03-15	['Oregon']

pomt-11121	"I left the White House $16 million in debt."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/05/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-16-million-debt-monica-lewinsky/	Asked about his past in the context of the #MeToo movement, former President Bill Clinton said he did the right thing in the aftermath of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and claimed he didn’t go unpunished thanks to the red ink that followed. "I felt terrible then, and I came to grips with it," Clinton said during an NBC News interview. "Did you ever apologize to her?" Craig Melvin asked. "Yes," Clinton said, following some hesitation. "And nobody believes that I got out of that for free. I left the White House $16 million in debt. But you typically have ignored gaping facts in describing this, and I bet you don’t even know this. This was litigated 20 years ago." But Clinton didn’t have his own facts straight. Later in the interview, Clinton admitted he never talked to Lewinsky in the aftermath of the affair. He only apologized publicly, and to a long list of people involved. As for his claim about leaving the White House with $16 million in debt, that’s an exaggeration. We previously looked at a claim by Hillary Clinton that she and Bill came out of the White House "dead broke." A closer look at Clinton’s 2001 financial disclosure form for the Senate shows they possibly had more liabilities than assets, but it doesn’t show that conclusively. Bill Clinton’s claim is different, however. He did not clarify whether he was talking about net or gross debt, or how exactly those debts came to be. He did suggest that the legal fees played an important role. So we took another look at Hillary Clinton’s 2001 Senate financial disclosure form, which gives us a public look into hers and her husband’s finances. Hillary Clinton reported that legal debt for the Clintons and former staff members came to a minimum of $1.75 million and maximum of $6.5 million. Bill Clinton’s spokesman, Angel Ureña, pointed us to a Washington Post report from 2007 that said the Clintons "left the White House with an estimated $12 million in legal debts rung up during the Whitewater, campaign fundraising and Monica S. Lewinsky investigations." Several news reports echoed a similar estimate of legal costs, but we were unable to track down the source of that amount. The burden of legal costs didn’t entirely fall on the Clintons. Established in 1998, the Presidential Legal Expense Trust defrayed personal legal expenses through donations from U.S. citizens (government employees or registered lobbyists were not allowed). That was the second trust set up to pay off the Clintons’ legal expenses. In July 2001, The New Yorker reported the fund raised $8.8 million. "Even after expenses, that covered much of the eleven or twelve million dollars in legal fees that the Clintons have incurred so far," the report reads. (Clinton left the White House in January 2001.) That legal debt was gone by 2004, according to Hillary Clinton’s financial disclosure form. Jeff Hoopes, an accounting professor at University of North Carolina, told us there were numbers that may not have made it into the disclosure form, such as mortgages or loans from relatives. Mortgages could realistically have added a burden. In 1999, the Clintons bought a five-bedroom home in Chappaqua, N.Y., for $1.7 million. In December 2000, just as they were leaving the White House, they bought a seven-bedroom house near Embassy Row in Washington for $2.85 million. Citibank lent the Clintons $1.995 million to buy the Washington house. Hoopes emphasized that whatever the value of debt, the Clintons were unambiguously not suffering financially after leaving office. "They had a huge amount of earnings potential, and to keep suggesting they were suffering financially is disingenuous," Hoopes said. Hoopes’ point: The Clintons may have taken on debt but had a clear path to getting out of the red. And they sure did. Forbes, using Hillary Clinton’s tax returns, estimated the Clintons earned more than $240 million from 2001-15. Our ruling Clinton said he "left the White House $16 million in debt." Hillary Clinton’s 2000 Senate financial disclosure form shows a debt of anywhere between $1.75 million and maximum of $6.5 million. Bill Clinton’s spokesman said the Clintons’ legal fees reached $12 million, but a large portion of that was covered by a legal defense fund. We rate this Mostly False.

pomt-13069	Newt Gingrich has been a proponent of selecting a president by popular vote instead of the Electoral College.	true	/georgia/statements/2016/nov/16/various-media-reports/newt-gingrich-has-said-he-favors-using-popular-vot/	Newt Gingrich, a loyal Donald Trump surrogate and former Georgia congressman who became speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, is poised to play a key role in the 45th president’s new administration. But if Gingrich, who is a key player on the Trump transition team, had gotten what he wanted not so long ago, things would be different. According to news reports, Gingrich just a few years ago backed electing U.S. presidents through the so-called popular vote and not the Electoral College, which propelled Trump to victory last week over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Clinton is still leading the popular vote count. But under our current system that is irrelevant. It is the candidate who gets 270 Electoral College votes who wins. That is the way it has been throughout U.S. history. PolitiFact was curious. Had Gingrich backed vanquishing the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote -- a change that might have shoved him into political obscurity instead of where he stands now at center stage. The easy answer: Yes, he did. U.S. citizens only indirectly vote for the president and vice president. The U.S. Electoral College was established by Article II of the United States Constitution. Under that system, voters in each state choose a slate of "electors" pledged to vote for a party's candidate. In the 2016 election, Trump is expected to get 306 electoral votes to Clinton’s 232. In a Nov. 10 article, Mother Jones pointed to a 2014 letter to the group National Popular Vote by Gingrich. The nonpartisan group promotes legislation that would guarantee the presidency to the candidate who receives the most popular votes nationally. In the letter, Gingrich writes, "America would be better served with a presidential election process that treated citizens across the country equally." We reached out to Gingrich spokesman Joe Desantis. He pointed us to a statement made by Gingrich on Sunday’s "Face The Nation." When asked whether he was still a fan of getting rid of the Electoral College, Gingrich said, "I think, in the long run, you want to find a way to have the whole country represented." But for now, the only competitions that matter are the ones in the swing states. The GOP, Gingrich said, all but writes off traditional Democratic states such as California, which have huge popular vote totals. "Remember, in 49 states, he (Trump) had a 2.2 million-vote majority, and then there’s California," Gingrich said during his Sunday interview. "We don’t compete in California. He said GOP strategists don’t invest in California because they assume the party will not carry the state. "So it gets worse every year," he said. "If this had been a general election, where the total vote mattered, we would have competed in California". Kerwin Swint, a political scientist at Kennesaw State University in metro Atlanta, said Gingrich and a number of others, both Republican and Democrat, have voiced support for the National Popular Vote Compact. Under that compact, member states would pledge to cast its electoral votes for the winner of the nationwide popular vote. "The compact kicks in when enough states join the agreement that would equal 270 electoral votes," Swint said in an email "So far, enough states have joined that would equal 165 electoral votes, and they are all Democratic states." Swint said abolishing the Electoral College would require a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress. Then comes the really tough part -- 38 out of 50 states would have to ratify it. "Not bloody likely, at least not in our lifetimes," he said. "Even Donald Trump criticized the Electoral College in 2012, but I bet he wouldn't now!" University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said he doubts there is any new momentum to abolish the Electoral College by the party soon to be in charge of the White House and both chambers of Congress. "Not only have two GOP presidents been elected in the past 16 years by the College, despite losing the popular vote, but all five cases in history of the popular vote winner being denied the Presidency disadvantaged Democrats (1824, 1876, 1888, 2000, 2016)," Sabato wrote in an email. "Somehow I don't think reforming or abolishing the Electoral College will be a high priority going forward, even though Gallup has repeatedly shown that large majorities of Americans want the popular vote to pick the President." Our ruling Several media outlets have recently reported that Newt Gingrich previously advocated for electing U.S. presidents by popular vote instead of the Electoral College. Our research shows Gingrich was definitely an advocate of the popular vote option. We rate the reports True.	None	Various media reports	None	None	None	2016-11-16T06:00:00	2016-11-10	['Newt_Gingrich']
pomt-09205	“In three days last week, (Gov. Rick) Perry flew to five cities at taxpayers’ expense, holding press conferences, delivering $2,325,000 in checks.”	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2010/may/23/bill-white/white-says-taxpayers-paid-perry-fly-texas-deliveri/	In a Facebook post Wednesday, Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White suggests Gov. Rick Perry wasted government dollars flying to Texas cities to give out money. “In three days last week, Perry flew to five cities at taxpayers’ expense, holding press conferences, delivering $2,325,000 in checks,” White’s 8:43 p.m. post states. Did Perry burn tax dollars to hand out checks? Katy Bacon, White’s spokeswoman, pointed out news releases issued by the governor’s office reflecting Perry’s stops May 11-13 in Corpus Christi, Dallas, San Antonio, Palacios and San Juan. The releases state that Perry announced spending awards of $150,000, $175,000 and $2 million, respectively, in Dallas, Palacios and San Juan. Perry did not ballyhoo funding awards in the other cities, according to the releases. That’s close to what White said on Facebook: Three days, five cities, $2,325,000 in checks handed over by Perry. We wondered, though, at White’s description of Perry’s flights as costing taxpayers. For years, Perry has funded considerable out-of-town travel, for state business or campaign purposes, from non-state sources including his campaign kitty — an approach often mentioned in news articles, including a July 26 report in White’s hometown newspaper, the Houston Chronicle. The Chronicle article quotes Perry’s gubernatorial spokeswoman, Allison Castle, noting that “Perry's travel is not paid by taxpayers.” It continues: “Texas One, a corporate-finance foundation, pays for much of Perry's business development travel. Other travel is paid for by his political committee or campaign donors. And some is financed as in-kind contributions from specific wealthy donors or interest groups.” As for the flights Facebooked by White, Bacon told us in an e-mail: “These were all ‘official’ trips and events under the Office of the Governor, and this type of travel is typically paid for by taxpayers.” Not so, said Castle, who informed us the flights under fire, on private planes, were funded by Perry’s campaign. “The majority of the governor’s travel is paid for by his campaign,” she said. For each of the five stops referenced by White, she said, one state-paid travel aide and a press aide accompanied Perry. There is another cost the public pays for every Perry trip — his security detail. In a follow-up interview, Bacon took no issue with gubernatorial security expenses. Bacon also stood by White's characterization of the travel as taxpayer-funded, saying it would take time to confirm, with documents, that Perry's flights were not paid for by the state. Then again, Bacon said, spending campaign funds on the flights also doesn't pass muster. "Either way, this is wrong," she said. "He’s running around handing out taxpayer dollars to get headlines for his political career. He’s using campaign dollars to hand out state checks." She showed us that Perry's campaign excerpted two press releases from the latest trips in a campaign e-mail blast. Bacon's charge shifts the focus from who paid for Perry's trips to the purpose of his stops. That's not what White critiqued on Facebook. All in all, White got several things right — five cities visited, press events, money awards. And it's true the state pays some costs any time the governor goes anywhere. But White's crucial assumption — that Perry's flights were at taxpayers' expense — is wrong. It's a misstep the candidate might have avoided by reading his local newspaper. Pants on Fire!

pomt-05100	Says the federal health care law upheld by the Supreme Court "has improved or saved the lives of more than 4,000 Texans" otherwise prevented from obtaining health coverage due to pre-existing conditions.	true	/texas/statements/2012/jun/29/becky-moeller/becky-moeller-says-over-4000-texas-lives-have-impr/	Celebrating the U.S. Supreme Court decision upholding the 2010 federal health care overhaul, a Texas labor leader said thousands of Texans have already benefited from it. In a June 28, 2012, statement, Becky Moeller, president of the Texas AFL-CIO, said of the new health care law: "It has improved or saved the lives of more than 4,000 Texans who otherwise would have run afoul of ‘pre-existing condition’ clauses preventing them from obtaining insurance." The law has helped that many Texans with pre-existing conditions? Refresher: The 2010 Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act bars insurers, starting in 2014, from denying coverage to individuals due to pre-existing conditions. Until then, the act also provides for pre-existing condition insurance plans to be available to individuals who have been uninsured for at least six months because of a pre-existing condition, according to a timeline for the law posted online by the federal government. As the act was under debate, advocates said that without such provisions, coverage for people living with certain conditions including diabetes, cancer and HIV/AIDS would remain financially out of reach. By email, AFL-CIO spokesman Ed Sills told us Moeller’s figure traces to the White House, which has a web page showing a map of the United States under this headline: "What Health Reform Means to Your State." Clicking on Texas delivers a pop-up stating ways that the law is benefiting Texas, including: "4,029 people who were uninsured because of a pre-existing condition now have coverage." But those pop-out statistics are not sourced. As we mulled Moeller’s figure, state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, aired the same count in a statement lauding the court decision. Van de Putte’s spokesman, Lee Nichols, told us she drew the number from a document on the impact of the federal health law prepared by the Progressive States Network, a liberal-leaning public policy group. By email, the group pointed us to a February 2012 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services stating that 27 states operate their own Pre-Existing Condition Insurance Plan, while 23 states (including Texas) chose to depend on federally run plans. It says, too, that the plans are helping 50,000 Americans who were previously unable to afford health coverage. And the report’s Appendix A says the Texas plan, which started in August 2010, had 4,029 individuals enrolled for coverage extending through December 2011. Through that month, Texas had the third-highest number of plan members, behind California, at 5,599, and Pennsylvania, at 4,567. We recognized this figure was not up to date. Fortunately, spokesman John Greeley of the Texas Department of Insurance alerted us to a June 15, 2012, posting on a website managed by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Through April 2012, according to the post, 5,684 individuals were enrolled in the Texas plan. We paused, finally, over whether it’s fair to assume that each Texan in the program saw their lives improved or even saved, as Moeller puts it. Sills of the Texas AFL-CIO conceded by telephone that it’s possible some of the newly insured individuals subsequently experienced worsened conditions or died. Still, he said, it’s a reasonable inference that somebody who has insurance who didn’t previously have it has an improved life. "Even if they did die," Sill said, "it’s perfectly conceivable that they received treatment that made the rest of their lives better." Our ruling Moeller’s count of the Texans benefiting from newly having insurance despite pre-existing conditions is a bit understated. And while there’s no certainty that every beneficiary saw their lives improved or saved, we agree that's a reasonable supposition. We rate the claim True.

But a new Obama campaign ad says Romney's economic record in Massachusetts shows he was unsuccessful and out of touch. The ad, dubbed "We’ve Heard it all Before," rattles off negative outcomes from Romney’s gubernatorial term: losses in manufacturing, near-the-bottom job creation, billions in public debt. This one caught our attention: "Instead of hiring workers from his own state, Romney outsourced call center jobs to India." Sending American jobs overseas is a touchy topic these days. We did some digging and found that the image in the ad -- a darkened Massachusetts workplace juxtaposed with an Indian man wearing a phone headset -- doesn’t tell the complete story. Origin of the charge The Obama campaign pointed us to news accounts of a budget issue in 2004, the second year of Romney’s term. The Democratic-controlled Massachusetts legislature sent Romney a budget with an amendment that "would prohibit Massachusetts from contracting with companies that ‘outsource’ the state's work to other countries," according to the Boston Globe. At the time, many states were contracting with companies that outsourced some form of their work overseas. The Government Accountability Office found that in 2005, 43 states had contracts with companies administering state programs in which some of the work, primarily customer service and software development, was done overseas. Expenditures for services performed offshore were relatively small, the GAO found, and services performed offshore constituted a tiny fraction of the total services provided through the contracts. But it was enough of a hot button that 38 states were considering similar bans on contracting with companies that outsourced, the Globe wrote. Romney, then, was forced to weigh two competing interests: protecting jobs in his state vs. saving taxpayers money. The Globe pointed out that lawmakers in Kansas considered a similar measure but pulled the plug when they learned it would cost the state an additional $640,000. Massachusetts’ proposal was favored by labor unions but opposed by some economists who said it didn’t make economic sense for taxpayers to pay more for low-skill jobs. Ultimately, Romney vetoed the measure because he said that even if those jobs were back in the United States, they would not necessarily have been in Massachusetts. He said,"There's no question we are affected by outsourcing, as is every other state. Any job that leaves is a big loss, and you want to fight to keep every job in the Commonwealth. The legislation I vetoed was not designed to do anything for Massachusetts employers. It might help ‘call center’ states, but it didn't necessarily protect a single job here. But it had the potential of costing our citizens a lot more money. Ultimately, how you compete with low-cost countries is having a more educated, innovative, hard-working, and capable workforce. And that means that you invest in two things: education and innovation." At the time Massachusetts had a $160,000 a month contract with Citigroup to process debit cards for food stamps. Citigroup outsourced its customer service call center to a facility in India. A small but important detail: the state didn’t outsource the work -- a state contractor did. The GAO report looking at all states’ outsourcing found that 43 states had some form of outsourcing at work, so Massachusetts was not unique. The Bay State also had offshore contracts through its child support enforcement and unemployment insurance programs in 2005, the GAO said. The controversy popped up again in 2006 when then-Sen. Edward Kennedy criticized Romney for "jumping on the offshoring bandwagon,'' according to a Boston Herald story. A Romney official told the newspaper that by then, only a handful of overseas workers were still working on a Medicaid subcontract. The food stamp contract previously held by Citigroup (later JP Morgan Chase) had expired and the new contract was awarded to a company whose call center was in Utah. Our ruling Obama’s ad charges that "Romney outsourced call center jobs to India." The Obama campaign's wording suggests a broader, more deliberate policy when the state was sending some work overseas. But in choosing to veto the bill, Romney let the arrangement continue. The statement leaves out important information. We rate it Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-06-11T16:30:49	2012-06-04	['None']
pomt-04185	Says state schools superintendent candidate Don Pridemore "voted for the largest cuts to public education in our state history" and for "$2.3 billion in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/dec/12/one-wisconsin-now/candidate-wisconsin-schools-chief-backed-biggest-e/	The liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now has long been critical of state Rep. Don Pridemore, especially when blasting bills he authored that would affect police treatment of immigrants and require voters to present photo identification. Now that Pridemore, a Republican from suburban Milwaukee, is challenging state schools superintendent Tony Evers in the April 2013 election, One Wisconsin Now has made a new attack. In a news release Dec. 3, 2012, the day Pridemore announced his candidacy, the Madison-based group claimed Pridemore "voted for the largest cuts to public education in our state history -- nearly $2 billion between K-12 and the University of Wisconsin and Wisconsin Technical College Systems -- in favor of $2.3 billion in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy." Both the funding cuts and tax cuts parts of this claim are similar to claims we've rated before. How do they stack up when combined? Education funding cuts To back the first part of the claim, One Wisconsin Now executive director Scot Ross cited a February 2012 Truth-O-Meter item that evaluated a nearly identical statement. In that item, we rated as True an attack by Kathleen Falk that GOP Gov. Scott Walker enacted "the biggest cuts to education in our state’s history." Falk ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination to challenge Walker in the June 2012 recall election. We found that Walker’s 2011-2013 state budget, which Pridemore voted for, cut $1.11 billion in state aid to school districts, the university system and technical colleges. But that’s far short of the nearly $2 billion that One Wisconsin Now claimed. Moreover, the claim ignores the fact that school districts and other local governments were able to offset the cuts by forcing employees to pay a greater share of their health care and pension costs. One Wisconsin Now highlights just one side of the equation. Ross said his math puts the total cut at nearly $2 billion because the budget reduced by $800 million the amount of property taxes that local school districts can levy. But limiting a school district’s ability to raise taxes is not the same as a straight budget cut, which is what One Wisconsin Now claims in its attack on Pridemore. Tax cuts The second part of the group’s claim against Pridemore -- that he voted for "$2.3 billion in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy" -- is similar to a One Wisconsin Now claim we rated in July 2011. In that item, the group said Walker’s budget has "tax breaks for corporations and the rich that will cost the state of Wisconsin taxpayers $2.3 billion over the next decade." We rated the statement Half True. We found that Walker’s budget -- along with other tax provisions adopted in 2011 -- will result in a total reduction of $2.3 billion in general fund tax revenue over 10 years. However, while many tax breaks go to corporations and individuals with higher incomes, some go to small businesses and to average taxpayers. Pridemore and other Republicans have argued that the tax cuts give incentives to employers to create more jobs. What’s more, One Wisconsin Now pairs up the 10-year figure with an annual one for school funding, skewing the comparison. Our rating One Wisconsin Now said Pridemore voted for "the largest cuts to public education in our state history" -- nearly $2 billion -- and for "$2.3 billion in tax breaks for corporations and the wealthy." Pridemore voted for the largest cuts to education -- but they amount to about $1 billion, not nearly $2 billion, over two years. And Pridemore voted for $2.3 billion in tax breaks, but they don’t benefit only corporations and the wealthy. We rate One Wisconsin Now’s claim Half True.

pomt-01092	"The average family not in the top 10 percent makes less money today than they were making a generation ago."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/13/elizabeth-warren/warren-average-family-bottom-90-percent-made-more-/	Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., believes the government’s economic policies over the past few decades have "cut the legs out from underneath America's middle class." At the AFL-CIO National Summit on Raising Wages Jan. 7, Warren spoke about growing income inequality, particularly since the 1980s, when the "trickle-down economics" policies gained traction under former President Ronald Reagan. She argued that this theory -- that giving tax breaks and other economic benefits to corporations and the wealthy will benefit the poor by improving the economy overall -- hasn’t worked. Warren, a former law professor and expert on the economic challenges of the middle class, cited a number of statistics to support her point, including: "Well, since 1980, guess how much of the growth in income over the last 32 years -- how much of the growth in income did the 90 percent get? Zero. None. Nothing. In fact, it is worse than that. The average family not in the top 10 percent makes less money today than they were making a generation ago." We wondered if that was true -- that the bottom 90 percent of earners in America have a lower income than they had more than 30 years ago. The statistic comes from data compiled by well-known economists Thomas Piketty and Emmanuel Saez, who study income inequality. Their World Top Incomes Database specializes in cataloging the highest level of incomes over time in more than 20 countries. To check out Warren’s claim, we looked at average income data from 1979 to 2012 for the top 10 percent and bottom 90 percent of earners. (The time frame Warren used in her speech was "a generation," which is vague, but in context it’s clear she’s talking about since the 1980s.) The Saez-Piketty data comes from millions of tax returns filed over the past century. The data supports her claim. Adjusted for inflation, the top 10 percent of earners in the United States made, on average, $144,418 in 1979 and $254,449 in 2012. That’s about 76 percent growth. The bottom 90 percent of earners, on the other hand, made $33,526 in 1979 and $30,438 in 2012. That’s a decrease of about 9 percent. This chart generated on the Saez-Piketty top income database shows the growth of the top 10 percent of earners’ average income over time, compared to the relatively stagnant progression of the bottom 90 percent of earners’ average income. Compare this to the 30 years prior, where -- according to Saez and Piketty’s data -- the average income for the bottom 90 percent of earners grew alongside the top 10 percent, albeit at a slower pace. However there is some context to consider. Mainly, not everyone approves of the Saez-Piketty approach to cataloging income. Their approach uses pre-tax income and includes realized capital gains. Because the richest Americans earn a lot of capital gains and pay a lot of taxes, this arguably magnifies their income. On the other hand, the approach lowballs the income of lower-level earners -- the bottom 90 percent in this case. The income calculation does not include government payments, such as Social Security, unemployment insurance, food stamps and the earned income tax credit. Salim Furth, an economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, also noted that the data looks at "tax units" -- individuals or married couples filing together -- rather than households, which may artificially lower average incomes. For example, a young adult living with his parents are two separate tax units; together they are one household or family. The Saez-Piketty data captures that the young worker has a very small income, but not the fact that he lives in a house with multiple incomes. Also, tax law has changed over the past 50 years to increase the number of units, Furth said. Of the general trend in income growth, he said, "Data sources that are more widely used show solid, though not fantastic, income growth for most of the income distribution through 2007. There are big losses in the Great Recession, and then an incomplete recovery since then." The Congressional Budget Office produced a report in November 2014 showing that the bottom 80 percent of earners (measured by households rather than tax units) saw income increases of about 16 percent between 1979 and 2011. The top 81-99 percent, on the other hand, saw increases of about 56 percent over the period. And the top 1 percent alone saw their household income grow 174 percent. That report also found that if it includes government benefits in its income calculation, all income brackets saw even more income growth. Still, this data shows that top earners’ incomes are growing at a faster pace than everyone else’s -- which supports Warren’s broader point. Richard Burkhauser, an economist at Cornell University, pointed us to a paper he co-wrote on income inequality that compares Saez-Piketty-style data to other income measurements. The results are consistent with the Saez-Piketty data until households are adjusted for size, and capital gains taxes and government payments are factored in. With those controls, incomes have grown across the board, and income inequality has also grown -- but not at as dramatic a rate as the Saez-Piketty data implies. Ultimately, Burkhauser’s report concludes that different measurements work for different policy questions. If Warren’s talking specifically about market income -- that is, income earned before taxes and before government payments -- the Saez-Piketty data "is appropriate, and undoubtedly income inequality has grown substantially in recent years, and the middle class is struggling." If the question is, alternatively, whether government programs are doing something to close the gap and help the middle class -- other measures show that programs like food stamps and Medicaid are helping to a certain extent, at least for people who qualify. (And of course not everyone in the bottom 90 percent of earners does qualify.) Arguably, in a speech directed at working and middle-class Americans at a summit on raising wages, the context of Warren’s remarks give credence to the fact that she was referencing data that emphasizes earned income over government-provided income. In the speech, Warren wasn’t advocating for new government programs that give out payments to individuals in need. She was making a policy argument against the idea of trickle-down economics and in favor of broad economic policies that she believes would improve Americans’ job-earned income, like raising the minimum wage and breaking up the Wall Street banks. "We can make new choices," she said. "And one way to make those choices is to talk openly and honestly and directly about work, about how we value work, and how we value those who do the work." Our ruling Warren said, "The average family not in the top 10 percent makes less money today than they were making a generation ago." According to one measurement, the bottom 90 percent of American earners had a lower income in 2012 than they had 30 years ago. By other measurements -- mainly ones that include government payments such as Social Security -- incomes have grown across the board. However, this data still supports Warren’s overall point that income inequality is growing. Additionally, given the context of her speech at a forum about wages, it makes sense that Warren would reference data that gives more weight to pre-tax income. She’s arguing that middle-class wages haven’t increased enough over the past couple decades. We rate Warren’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-01199	The poorest counties in the U.S. are in Appalachia and "happen to be more than 90 percent white."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2014/dec/01/jim-webb/jim-webb-says-poorest-us-counties-are-appalachia-a/	Former Sen. Jim Webb recently announced he’s considering a 2016 presidential run and placed economic fairness high on his agenda. In his video announcement, Webb urged people to travel to inner cities to view the "poverty, crime and lack of opportunity that still affects so many African Americans." "Or travel to the Appalachian mountains, where my own ancestors settled and whose cultural values I still share, and view the poorest counties in America -- who happen to be more than 90 percent white, and who live in the reality that ‘if you’re poor and white, you’re out of sight,’" Webb said. Are the poorest counties in the U.S. located in Appalachia and more than 90 percent white? We asked Webb for proof. Amy Hogan, Webb’s daughter and occasional spokesperson, sent us links to the WikiPedia pages for Clay County, Ky. and Leslie County, Ky. -- two Appalachian counties located in the economically-distressed eastern portion of that state. But Hogan didn’t point to any information that indicates those counties are the poorest in the U.S., although the Clay County WikiPedia page says its per capita income and median household income make it one of the poorest counties in the country. So we set out on our own search for the poorest counties, relying on data by the U.S. Census Bureau measuring the average yearly wealth from 2008-2012. As our colleagues at PolitiFact National noted in a July story, there are several ways to gauge the poorest counties. We compiled Bottom 10 lists based on three criteria. Lowest Median Household Income: Owsley County, Ky., $19,624 Jefferson County, Miss., $20,281 Wolfe County, Ky., $21,168 Brooks County, Texas, $21,445 McCreary County, Ky., $21,758 Hudspeth County, Texas, $22,083 Hancock County, Tenn., $22,205 Jackson County, Ky., $22,213 Clay County, Ky., $22,296 Holmes County, Miss., $22,335 Six of these counties are in Appalachia, according to a listing by the congressionally-funded Appalachian Regional Commission -- the five in Kentucky and Hancock County, Tenn. All six have populations that are more than 90 percent white. The two counties in Mississippi are about 85 percent black and the two in Texas are more than 77 percent Hispanic and Latino. Highest percentage of people below the poverty line: Shannon County, S.D., 49.5 percent Clay County, Ga., 47.7 percent East Carroll Parish, La., 44.9 percent Sioux County, N.D., 44.8 percent Todd County, S.D., 44.6 percent Hudspeth County, Texas, 42.7 percent Holmes County, Miss., 42.6 percent Corson County, S.D., 41.7 percent Wolfe County, Ky., 41.4 percent Humphreys County, Miss., 41.2 percent The only Appalachian county on that list is Wolfe County, Ky., which is 90 percent white. Hudspeth County, Texas is 78 percent Hispanic and Latino. Of the other eight counties, the ones in North and South Dakota are mostly Native American and the ones in Georgia, Louisiana and Mississippi are at least two-thirds black. Lowest per capita income: Wheeler County, Ga., $8,809 Shannon County, S.D., $9,136 Hancock County, Ga., $11,225 Todd County, S.D., $11,417 Starr County, Texas, $11,537 Jefferson County, Miss., $11,771 Willacy County, Texas, $11,895 Zavala County, Texas, $11,919 McCreary County, Ky., $12,213 Holmes County, Miss., $12,278 There’s one Appalachian locality on this list: McCreary County, Ky., which is 90 percent white. Hancock County, Ga. is 60 percent white.The counties in Mississippi are about 85 percent black, the ones in South Dakota are about 90 percent Native American, and those in Texas are at least 87 percent Hispanic and Latino. In sharing these lists, we don’t mean to downplay the very real existence of poverty in Appalachian counties that span 13 states, including Virginia. The Appalachian Regional Commission says there are 311 U.S. counties that are economically distressed based on measurements of unemployment, poverty and per capita market income. About 10 percent of all U.S. counties fall into this category. Ninety of the 420 counties in Appalachia are economically distressed. In other words, 21 percent of the counties in the region fall into the category -- more than twice the national average. Louis Segesvary, a spokesman for the commission, told us the major issue facing these Appalachian communities are their geographic isolation in the mountain range. Our ruling Webb said that the poorest U.S. counties are in Appalachia and "happen to be more than 90 percent white." No doubt, some of the poorest are in Appalachia, particularly eastern Kentucky. But looking at several different measures of county poverty results in a more complex picture than Webb suggests. Measured by median household income, overwhelmingly white Appalachian counties comprise six of the 10 U.S. counties with the lowest median household income. But measured by the poverty rate, only one mostly-white Appalachian county ranks in the 10 poorest. The other nine -- in the South, the Dakotas or Texas -- have larger majorities that are either black, Native American, or Hispanic and Latino. That pattern pretty much holds up when you rank the poorest counties by lowest per capita income. So Webb’s statement is partially accurate, but needs context. We rate it Half True.

He had a field manual of prayers."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/18/duncan-hunter/hunter-perpetuates-common-myth/	Appearing on Fox News in October, Duncan Hunter proclaimed his support for allowing a religious slant on the flag-folding ceremony at U.S. military funerals. To defend his position, Hunter tapped a reliable and potent source to justify weaving church and state: George Washington. "This is supposedly done under the separation of church and state, but you can't separate a veteran from his flag," Hunter told interviewer Bill Hemmer. "And, you know, our first president and our first commander in chief prayed every day. He had a field manual of prayers." Whether Hunter knew it or not, Washington wasn't the most religious founding father. And the story of his personal prayer book was debunked in the early 20th century. His remarks actually tap into a debate among scholars about the extent of Washington's religious convictions. Many argue he was more a deist than a Christian. "It's a tricky area that keeps coming up again and again," said Phil Chase, a senior editor at the Papers of George Washington Project at the University of Virginia. "People tend to attribute their own views to someone in the past. ... It happens a lot with Washington." Evangelical minister Tim LaHaye, author of the Left Behind series, is the latest. In his book about the founding father's faith, LaHaye wrote that the fact that Washington "was a devout believer in Jesus Christ and had accepted Him as His Lord and Saviour is easily demonstrated by a reading of his personal prayer book, written in his own handwriting." Except that's not true. Washington scholar Rupert Hughes wrote in 1926 that no evidence connects Washington to this prayer book, which was found nearly a century after his death in a old trunk. Hughes consulted a penmanship expert who proved it wasn't even in Washington's handwriting. "We are very confident that this prayer book is not Washington's prayer book," Chase said. Fortunately for Hunter, it's a common myth. Otherwise, we might give him a Pants-on-Fire ruling.	None	Duncan Hunter	None	None	None	2007-12-18T00:00:00	2007-10-31	['None']

pomt-01831	Says the Obama administration never responded to his 2012 letter flagging the uptick in unaccompanied children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/jul/18/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-obama-didnt-respond-his-warning-ab/	In an interview, Rick Perry charged the federal government with failing to tune in when the Republican governor of Texas wrote the Democratic president two years earlier about an increasing flow of children across the U.S.-Mexico border. "This president, I will suggest, is totally and absolutely either inept," Perry told Fox News, his voice rising, "or making some decisions that are not in the best interests of American citizens, particularly from a public safety standpoint. We flagged this issue in 2012 and have yet to even have a response, as far as I know, from, not just, not from the president, but not even from his administration." We previously checked other claims Perry made in the June 17, 2014, interview on Fox & Friends, rating as True his statement that a record number of immigrants not from Mexico were being apprehended at the border, a spike that was in full swing by 2012. We found Pants on Fire his suggestion that recent border-crossers are coming from terrorism-linked countries like Syria. And did Perry flag the surge in unaccompanied children years ago to no federal response? Perry cites two letters To our inquiry, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed said Perry was referring to letters sent to President Barack Obama and a Department of Homeland Security official, respectively, by Perry and a gubernatorial aide in May 2012. Perry’s May 4, 2012, letter to the president, covered at the time by the Texas Tribune and Dallas Morning News, accused the Obama administration of failing to work with the home countries of immigrant children to arrange for their return. His letter said in part, "as your administration is fully aware, there is a surge of unaccompanied illegal minors entering the United States." It said later: "Inaction encourages other minors to place themselves in extremely dangerous situations. The vast majority of these unaccompanied illegal minors come from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, as well as Mexico." Urging Obama to immediately consult the governments of such countries, Perry closed: "This must stop, Mr. President, and it is your responsibility to make that happen." Six days later, Perry adviser Chelsea Buchholtz sent a letter to a Department of Homeland Security official, Kelly Ryan, thanking Ryan for a conference call on May 4, the day that Perry’s letter was sent. Buchholtz’s letter said the call brought together federal agencies including Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Health and Human Services to speak with the governor’s office regarding the unaccompanied children surging into Texas. In her letter, Buchholtz asked 18 questions starting with the number of unaccompanied children apprehended in Texas and the number of children remaining in the state "after completion of their immigration cases." Other questions focused on the number of children in specific categories including those with gang affiliation, with a criminal a record or placed into foster care. "Please provide this information categorized by nationality for the last 10 fiscal years," Buchholtz wrote. No replies? Via the Texas Public Information Act, we asked Perry’s office for texts, emails, letters or other documented evidence of federal responses to the letters. Gubernatorial attorney Chris Sterner replied by email there was "no information responsive to your request." We shared Sterner’s response with the White House. Obama spokesman Shawn Turner replied by email that while Perry’s letter "did not make any requests of the president, we did respond to his concerns. We thought it was important to expand our dialogue with the governor and his staff so we held a number of briefs and engaged in several conversations with the governor's team. The briefs and discussions were intended to give the governor’s team a clear understanding of the administration’s focus on the immigration issues at the border and discuss steps we’re taking to deal with the situation." We requested dates and times of the briefings. Turner said he didn’t have such such specifics. Perry’s office didn’t respond to our inquiry about briefings. Our ruling Perry said the Obama administration failed to respond to his 2012 letter flagging an uptick in unaccompanied children crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. The day Perry sent his letter, Obama administration officials joined a conference call with his office about the crossings. It’s not clear whether this call was in response to the letter or vice versa, but it does seem to show the border situation had the attention of federal and state authorities. Otherwise, we found no documentation, in Austin or Washington, D.C., of a formal administration reply or of briefings like the ones referenced by the White House spokesman. On balance, we rate Perry’s statement as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

During a news conference on Oct. 14, 2015, Scott called for tax cuts beyond the $400 million the Legislature approved earlier in the year. Scott had promised to cut taxes by $1 billion over two years, but lawmakers are already signaling that may not be possible. When a reporter asked Scott how he can push tax cuts and still guarantee public schools the capital funding they need, Scott repeated a boast he’s made before: "We have the highest funding in (the) K-12 system in the history of the state." Scott and Florida Republicans have been making the claim since his 2014 re-election campaign that school funding has been at historic levels, but it’s simply not a complete picture of the education budget. (Scott intends to release his full budget proposal in December.) We decided it was time to revisit this particular claim. Total vs. per-pupil vs. inflation The education budget has been a prickly issue for Scott since he recommended major cuts in his first year in office. State tax revenues have recovered with the end of the recession, and Scott has pushed to move the budget back up each year since, which has led to his current claim. While Scott and former Gov. Charlie Crist squabbled during the 2014 gubernatorial campaign over who held the spending record, we noted they both could stake a claim: Scott had the largest budget in total dollars, while Crist spent the most per student back in 2007-08. With Scott well into his second term, the same is still true today. After winning re-election, Scott wanted to bump up spending in his January 2015 budget proposal, to $19.75 billion total and $7,176 per pupil. That would have been about $850,000 higher than the previous year’s budget, and $50 higher per student than the record of $7,126 under Crist. But the Legislature has the final say, and faced a budget deadlock over several issues, including a debate about potentially expanding Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. After a special session in the summer to hammer out a budget, the Legislature didn’t give Scott the amount he wanted. We checked the latest calculations for the Florida Education Finance Program, a pot of state and local money for schools that is adjusted periodically throughout the year to factor in tax receipts and enrollment. We found that for the 2015-16 school year, the K-12 system is getting a total budget of about $19.7 billion, or about $7,105 per student . Let’s take a look at the past few years to get a better idea of how much money has been going to education spending. Fiscal year (governor) Total K-12 budget Per pupil spending K-12 enrollment 2007-08 (Crist) $18.7 billion $7,126 2.63 million 2008-09 (Crist) $17.9 billion $6,846 2.62 million 2009-10 (Crist)* $18 billion $6,846 2.63 million 2010-11 (Crist)* $18.2 billion $6,897 2.64 million 2011-12 (Scott) $16.6 billion $6,217 2.67 million 2012-13 (Scott) $17.2 billion $6,376 2.70 million 2013-14 (Scott) $18.3 billion $6,769 2.705 million 2014-15 (Scott) $18.9 billion $6,915 2.74 million 2015-16 (Scott) $19.7 billion $7,105 2.77 million *Includes federal stimulus money There are some details about the funding that we won’t explore in much detail. The two years marked with an asterisk were years when Florida used about $900 million each in federal stimulus money for the budget, for example. Also, the amount of property taxes collected through what is known as the Required Local Effort can change from year to year. Scott's office said the budget is at its highest level ever in terms of total dollars. But you would expect it to be, considering the K-12 school system also has its highest enrollment ever. There are about 100,000 more students today than when Scott took office, and about 140,000 more than when Crist oversaw the highest per-pupil spending in 2007-08. The money in today’s budget isn’t exceeding the record level in terms of sheer dollars per student, but that’s even less so when we factor for inflation. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index inflation calculator, which is somewhat imprecise but can give us broad insight on the subject, even Scott’s January 2015 request to best Crist’s spending by $50 per student lags far behind. Just to match 2007’s $7,126, per-pupil spending would have to be in the neighborhood of $8,190 today. Using this method, the current total budget would have to be in excess of $21.4 billion. We’ve rated claims similar to this one Half True in the past, but it’s apparent that Scott’s claim is misleading. Any reasonable person would expect a growing education system to naturally have a larger budget after nearly a decade. In this case, the dollars simply don’t go as far as they once did. Our ruling Scott said, "We have the highest funding in (the) K-12 system in the history of the state." That’s accurate in one sense, because the state’s total education budget is at an all-time high of $19.7 billion. But enrollment is also higher than in years past. Per-pupil spending is still below historic dollar totals and remains far below equitable levels when adjusted for inflation. Education spending has essentially stood still over the last nine years. Scott’s claim obscures that. The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2015-10-15T16:14:32	2015-10-14	['None']

pomt-10761	"Going to public financing really disadvantages Democrats because you're not able to raise funds between the day you win the primaries and the time you're officially nominated."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/26/bill-richardson/its-not-as-risky-as-he-says/	In an Oct. 5, 2007, interview on CNN, New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson said Former Sen. John Edwards would be at a disadvantage by accepting public matching funds for the primary race. The suggestion to Democratic voters was that Richardson would be a better nominee than Edwards, who said he would take public money, because Richardson wouldn't be hamstrung by the restrictions that come with publicly subsidized campaigns. Other Democratic candidates have made the same point, noting that Edwards would have to cap spending at $50.9-million during the primary period. That period begins Jan. 1, 2008, and formally ends at the party convention next August. Critics argue that if Edwards were the nominee, presumably in the spring, he wouldn't have enough money left to defend against Republican attacks over the summer. That's not entirely true. First, it's incorrect to categorically say Edwards wouldn't be able to raise money between the primaries and the nomination. If Edwards' spending was short of the $50.9-million cap after the primaries, there's nothing in federal regulations that would prevent him from raising more primary money. But let's assume the predictions are true that the current campaign cycle will break spending records. Let's say Edwards spends all the way up to the $50.9-million cap on his way to becoming the presumptive nominee. Yes, the rules would prevent his campaign from spending any more at that point. But is he automatically disadvantaged, as Richardson suggests? Not necessarily. Richardson's statement does not consider that the Democratic Party could spend millions on a summer campaign if a clear nominee emerged by then. Independent groups and individuals also could chip in. Consider the last presidential election. Total spending by the parties, independent groups and individuals on behalf of candidates totaled $192.4-million in 2004 — up from $14.7-million in 2000. What's more, Edwards could help raise money for the party, which could "spend unlimited funds on his behalf," said Steve Weissman, associate director for policy at The Campaign Finance Institute. "So it's not exactly true that Edwards would have no resources," he said. The caveat: The law sets a limit on how much money the party and Edwards could spend while coordinating their efforts. The bulk of the money would have to be spent without coordination. Not being able to coordinate with the party can be a less efficient way to operate, Weissman said. "It would be more difficult for Edwards," he said, "but I wouldn't say impossible." In addition, Richardson's statement doesn't contemplate the possibility of John McCain being the presumptive Republican nominee. In August, McCain became the first presidential candidate to qualify for federal matching funds in the primaries, and he has indicated he might accept the money. Should McCain accept public financing and emerge as his party's presumptive nominee, he and Edwards would be in the same boat when it came to fundraising. The general point that Richardson makes is valid: a candidate's hands are tied by rules governing federal matching money — especially the state-specific spending limits that are based on voting age population instead of political reality. But he overstates the case that Edwards' campaign would be "really" hurt during the important months before the convention. We find his statement Half True.

pomt-04919	Says Milken Institute rated San Antonio as nation’s top-performing local economy.	true	/texas/statements/2012/aug/01/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-milken-institute-named-san-anto/	With the announcement that San Antonio’s mayor will deliver the Sept. 4, 2012, keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention, we revisited his keynote at the Texas Democratic Party convention. In that June 8, 2012, speech -- which we’ve previously dipped into twice -- Julián Castro said his city’s investments in infrastructure and education paid off "late last year when San Antonio was ranked as the top-performing local economy by the Milken Institute." San Antonio topped Milken’s 2011 list of the nation’s best-performing large metropolitan areas, rocketing up from 14th place the year before. Its rise is part of a recent trend in which Texas cities have dominated the list as the nation recovers from the 2007-09 recession. The economic think tank’s annual list, which Milken spokesman Conrad Kiechel told us by phone has been issued in its current form for "more than a decade," was described in a Dec. 30, 2011, Texas Tribune news story as "a ranking that measures American metropolitan areas based on their ability to create and sustain jobs." Milken’s 2011 report on the best-performing cities says the index gives priority to job and pay gains, then some weight to several technology measures in relation to national averages: the local growth in high-tech gross domestic product, the concentration of tech industries and how many of 25 specific tech industries are concentrated there. Some measures are weighed across five-year spans, to flatten out extreme swings, and the most recent year, "to capture recent momentum." In recent years, the Tribune said, "companies have flocked to San Antonio, making it an economic center rivaling Houston and Dallas." In contrast to those cities, though, "San Antonio has attracted high-wage jobs, capitalizing on its booming medical research industry." The Tribune story said InCube and Medtronic were the latest bioscience companies to move to San Antonio, which was already home to global headquarters for Valero Energy, Clear Channel Communications, USAA insurers and the H-E-B grocery chain. The San Antonio Express-News credited the city’s rise to reasons "including military base realignment, drilling in the Eagle Ford Shale and the growth of health care" in a Dec. 16, 2011, news story. Texas cities held four of the top five spots on Milken’s 2011 big-cities list, with Austin/Round Rock at fourth. Back in 2008, Austin was Texas’ only top-five city, but the state claimed most of those slots in 2009, 2010 and 2011. The other chart-toppers for 2011 were No. 2, El Paso; No. 3, Fort Collins/Loveland, Colo.; and No. 5, Killeen/Temple/Fort Hood. Texas’ rise in the ranks, the Express-News wrote, came partly because of downturns in other parts of the country. The story quoted research economist James Gaines of Texas A&M University’s Real Estate Center: "Our growth rate and advancement isn't all that wonderful. We've managed to stay flat or have very small positives. But because everybody has so many negatives, we look so much better." A Philadelphia Inquirer columnist interviewed Milken’s chief research officer, Ross DeVol, and wrote Dec. 16, 2011 that "Technology and energy explain why nine Texas cities placed in the top 25 of the 2011 Milken ranking." Our ruling San Antonio hasn’t just been holding steady in the economic downturn; it’s been gaining ground, even compared to other Texas cities. Castro’s statement rates True.

pomt-14266	Says Bernie Sanders "wants higher standards for toy guns than real guns."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/08/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-bernie-sanders-wants-higher-s/	Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders is putting gun manufacturers ahead of the Sandy Hook victims, says opponent Hillary Clinton. Twenty school-age children were killed in the 2012 shooting massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Now, some family members of the victims are attempting to sue gun manufacturer Remington, which produced shooter Adam Lanza’s weapon, as well as the wholesaler and a local retailer. But it’s questionable whether this lawsuit will be able to proceed, given a 2005 law that put restrictions on the gun industry’s liability for crimes committed using their products. As Clinton often points out, she voted against this law, while Sanders voted for it. "I voted against it," Clinton said on CNN April 6. "President Obama voted against it. Because clearly it was an effort to bypass legal accountability. And so here we have this remarkable situation where you cannot question the liability or the behavior of gunmakers and sellers. I thought Sen. Chris Murphy from Connecticut really summed it up. He said Sen. Sanders wants higher standards for toy guns than real guns." The claim that Sanders wants higher standards for toy guns than real guns caught our attention. We wondered if Sanders’ support for this law indicates that he thinks toy manufacturers should be more open to lawsuits than gun manufacturers. We talked to a number of experts on gun law and products liability, and they disagreed over whether Clinton is standing on solid ground. A liability gap? The law at issue is the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush and seen as a victory for gun rights advocates. The purpose of the law is to protect gun dealers and manufacturers from lawsuits when their products are misused, meaning if a gun dealer legally sells a person a gun, and then the buyer uses the gun to commit a crime, the gun dealer and manufacturer cannot be held liable for the crime. The law arose after victims, cities and states started to bring lawsuits against gunmakers that pursued new legal paths, such as one that argued manufacturers Glock Inc. and China North Industries had oversaturated the market, producing so many guns that it was inevitable some would fall into criminal hands. Most judges dismissed these kinds of lawsuits, but a minority allowed them to proceed. There are several situations that are not protected from lawsuits under the law. It does not protect gun dealers who transfer a gun knowing it would be used for criminal purposes, nor those who knowingly break state or federal law if the violation results in harm. Gun manufacturers can also be sued if the gun, when used properly, causes injury because the product is defective. Opponents argue that the law stops some victims from having their day in court because the liability immunity is so broad and ambiguous, while the exceptions are narrow. Supporters, though, say the law protects gun dealers and manufacturers from frivolous and expensive legal proceedings. We’ve written before that Congress has passed laws giving some other industries varying levels of immunity. A couple experts told us Clinton’s statement is unsound because the law sought to impose equivalent, rather than fewer, standards for gun makers that are already established for manufacturers of other products. As it stands, the victim of a crime committed with a toy — say, if a person seriously injured another person by shooting them with bb gun pellets — generally cannot sue the toy manufacturer, just as they can’t sue Toyota or Budweiser if they’re struck by a drunk person driving a Prius. The 2005 law "basically put gun manufacturers in the same position that other product manufacturers are in," said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles. "They’re responsible for defectively manufactured and designed products but not for failing to prevent criminal misuse of their products." Additionally, toy guns and real guns pose fundamentally different risks because real guns are much more likely to be used in a crime than a toy gun, said Timothy Lytton, a Georgia State University law professor who edited a book on suing gun industry. So before the law, the gun industry was subject to a wider range of liability that just doesn’t apply to a toy. As such, it’s hard to imagine a realistic incident with a toy gun that would cause someone to bring a suit against the toy company, yet they would not be able to sue a gun manufacturer for an equivalent situation involving a real gun. A hypothetical situation might be if a city experienced an epidemic of deaths or injuries that resulted from a prevalence of realistic-looking toy guns; think of the recent story of Tamir Rice, a Cleveland child carrying a toy gun who a police officer shot and killed, said Alexandra Lahav, a professor of civil procedure at the University of Connecticut School of Law. In that case, a city might want to bring a suit against the toy gun manufacturer or seller for creating a public nuisance. But under the 2005 law, a city cannot sue a gun company if there is an epidemic of people being injured or killed by their guns. Lahav added, though, that she thinks the idea someone would bring a suit like this against a toy company is highly unlikely. In theory, there might be a liability gap between toy guns and real guns, but that wouldn't necessarily play out in reality, she said. Toy and real gun manufactures can be sued for product defects that cause injury when the product is used as intended. But if an injury is caused by a product defect coupled with a criminal misuse of the product, a toy gun manufacturer could be held liable, but a real gun manufacturer could not under the 2005 law, said Adam Winkler, also a UCLA law professor and an expert in the Second Amendment. That limits the gun industry’s incentives to make their products as safe as possible. The fact that a party cannot even attempt to bring these kinds of lawsuits against real gun manufacturers sets them apart from other industries, including toys, said Mark Geistfeld, a law professor at New York University and an expert in products liability. Such lawsuits against the gun industry might be destined to fail, but the 2005 law doesn’t even allow for the arguments to be tested. "You’ve granted an immunity to the gun industry that you haven’t granted to any other industry," Geistfeld said of Sanders, noting that this supports the gist of Clinton’s point: that Sanders holds guns to a lower standard. Lytton noted, though, that he would not presume to know whether Sanders would grant similar immunity to the toy industry if the opportunity arose. "It’s not fair to basically enter into hyperbole that somehow he treated firearms differently he would come down harder on toy guns," Lytton said. Consumer safety votes We also wanted to note another piece of evidence the Clinton campaign sent us to show that Sanders supports higher standards for toy guns. They pointed to Sanders’ congressional votes in favor of the 1993 Child Safety Protection Act and the 2008 Consumer Product Safety Improvement Act, both of which became law. These bills dealt with things like putting warning labels on toys with choking hazards, increasing civil penalties on companies that produce defective products, and limiting lead in toys. Experts told us that these votes do not have any impact on Clinton’s argument one way or another because they are about product safety regulations, which are a totally different ballgame than tort law and product liability. Though he thinks Clinton’s claim is on point because of the points discussed earlier, Geistfeld called these votes a red herring. "You don’t have to love that (2005) law to see that it’s a very different thing," said Lahav of the University of Connecticut. "I would have never thought to compare these things." Our ruling Clinton said Sanders "wants higher standards for toy guns than real guns." Clinton points to the fact that Sanders voted in favor of a 2005 law granting the gun industry certain immunity from lawsuits. In her camp are scholars who believe the law made the gun industry less susceptible to liability than other industries, including the toy gun industry. But other scholars think the law made the gun industry’s liability about the same as that of a toy gun manufacturer. And because real guns carry so much more risk for injury than toy guns, it’s hard to compare them effectively. This is a complex legal question, on which reasonable minds can disagree. Given this disagreement, and the fact that it’s impossible to know how Sanders would vote if a similar legislation concerning the toy industry were to arise, we rate Clinton’s claim Half True.

pomt-05880	"If you take into account all the people who are struggling for work, or have just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/feb/08/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-broader-measure-national-unemploy/	The last time we rated a Mitt Romney claim on unemployment, we dinged him with a Half True for using a big number without describing it accurately. This time, he got it right. In a speech after winning the Nevada caucuses on Feb. 4, 2012, Romney said, "If you take into account all the people who are struggling for work or have just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent." That's much more accurate than his statement at the Tampa debate on Jan. 23, when he said that "we have 25 million Americans out of work." We rated that Half True, concluding that Romney had used a valid number but had described it incorrectly. Here’s the background. Every month, the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics surveys a cross-section of Americans to determine, among other things, their employment status. The respondents are characterized as either being in the labor force or out of it. Those who are out of the labor force are not considered as seeking work at present. Some have no intention of working anytime soon -- they may be full-time students, stay-at-home parents, retired or physically unable to work. But others in this category are considered "marginally attached" to the labor force. They want work, are available to work and have looked for a job sometime in the prior 12 months -- but by the BLS definition, they do not qualify as being in the labor force because they have not actively searched for work in the previous four weeks. Now let’s look at those considered to be in the labor force. They are categorized as either employed or unemployed. The "employed" group also has a sub-category -- part-timers who would rather be working full-time but who aren’t due to economic conditions. For the best-known unemployment rate figure, the BLS divides the total number of the unemployed (that is, those without jobs who are actively looking for work) by the number of people in the labor force (that is, unemployed workers plus employed workers, both full- and part-time). However, some critics have argued that this definition of unemployment is too limiting. So BLS also offers a broader, alternative measure of "labor underutilization" known as "U-6." It calculates this by dividing the sum of three groups (unemployed, marginally attached to the labor force and working part time for economic reasons) by the sum of the labor force plus marginally attached workers. To make this methodology more concrete, let’s compare how those numbers looked in January 2012, the most recent month available. The regular unemployment rate was 8.3 percent. However, the U-6 rate was significantly higher -- 15.1 percent. The difference stems from the fact that many workers are employed part-time when they’d rather be full-time or have given up looking work, at least for now. (Here's a comparison of various BLS measures.) So Romney is right when he says that "if you take into account all the people who are struggling for work or have just stopped looking, the real unemployment rate is over 15 percent." This is an improvement from his phrasing in the Tampa debate, when he didn’t preface his statistic by noting that he’s referring to the broader, U-6 methodology. A final bit of context: While it’s certainly bad news to have 15.1 percent of the workforce either unemployed or under-employed, it’s worth noting that this statistic, like the more commonly used unemployment rate, is heading in a favorable direction. After rising as high as 17.2 percent in October 2009, the U-6 is now as low as it’s been since February 2009, the second month of Barack Obama’s presidency. That said, this level is still historically high. Since the statistic was first published in 1994, it has only broken into double digits for stretches following two previous recessions -- the recessions that hit in 1990-91 and 2001. And the U-6 peaks for those recessions were 11.8 percent and 10.4 percent, respectively -- well below even today’s improved level. Our ruling While the U-6 measurement is not the official gauge of unemployment in the United States, it’s a valid statistic to consider in conjunction with others. It's true that BLS describes it as a "labor underutilization" rate rather than an "unemployment" rate, since some of the people it counts are part-time workers who aren't officially "unemployed." While this distinction is important to PhD economists, we don't think it's a major problem for a speech made to the general public. In other words, for a general audience, we think "the real unemployment rate" is acceptable shorthand for "the labor underutilization rate," especially when a brief description of the measure is provided. So we rate this claim True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-02-08T15:31:51	2012-02-04	['None']

pomt-06481	"The proudest accomplishment (of my tenure) was leaving the state with a $1.2 billion surplus, which was the largest we’d ever had, and getting spending under control and a balanced budget."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/17/christine-whitman/christie-whitman-says-she-left-state-more-1-billio/	Once upon a time, New Jersey had a surplus in the billions of dollars, according to a former governor. There were surpluses in the state budget and there were surpluses in pension funds. "The proudest accomplishment (of my tenure) was leaving the state with a $1.2 billion surplus, which was the largest we’d ever had, and getting spending under control and a balanced budget," former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman said in a Sept. 19 interview on NJTV. Since she is a governor who has been accused of shortchanging pension contributions to fund tax cuts, PolitiFact New Jersey decided to check her statement. David Rosen, the Legislative Budget and Finance officer for the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, confirmed that Whitman left the state with a $1.2 billion surplus. And at least since 1986 – the first year the state’s budgets are available online – that surplus was the state’s largest, PolitiFact New Jersey found. There have been larger surpluses since she left office. As for balancing the budget? That’s not an accomplishment. State law requires it. But we questioned the part of Whitman’s statement in which she said she controlled spending. Let’s review some of the spending during her tenure. Whitman reduced payments to the state’s pension funds to balance a 30-percent income tax cut enacted after she became governor in 1994. Three years later, Whitman had the state borrow $2.75 billion to deposit in the pension funds to address that liability. The stock market at that time was doing well and the infusion helped create a surplus in the accounts -- for a while. Then the stock market took a downtown. But the pension issue wasn’t the only significant debt during Whitman’s tenure. She also approved an $8.6 billion school construction bill that was largely funded during the Jim McGreevey administration. Taken together, that’s more than $11 billion in debt. Experts, however, told us that governmental standard accounting practices do not include debt in an annual budget. Debt is included in the state’s financial statements, said Richard F. Keevey, who was budget director for former Gov. Jim Florio. Keevey, who teaches public budgeting systems and federal finance at Rutgers Newark, also served as a deputy budget director and budget director for former Gov. Tom Kean. What’s included in the budget is debt service, or the amount paid toward the total debt. Rosen also noted that New Jersey and the country had a strong economy during the Whitman years, from 1994 to Jan. 31, 2001. Whitman left office in the middle of her second gubernatorial term to become administrator at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in Washington, DC. "We were certainly in a surplus position as was the federal government," Rosen said. "Nationally the economy was doing very well and governments generally were doing quite well. Most states had large surpluses, the federal government was in surplus and New Jersey was as well." James DiEleuterio, who was state treasurer from 1994 to 1997, said in an email that Whitman controlled spending by reviewing each of the 32,000 line items in the state budget, cutting unnecessary expenses, streamlining operations and cutting the state’s payroll by 5,000. He also cited the 30 percent tax cut and changes in tax policy that he said improved the state’s economic climate. "Finally, I want to ensure it is clear that Governor Whitman's surplus was not funded by pension funds," DiEleuterio wrote. "Her tax cuts, and subsequent surplus, were funded the only way they should be: with true spending cuts and a balanced budget." Our ruling Whitman says her proudest accomplishment as governor was leaving the state with a more than $1 billion surplus, controlling spending and balancing the budget. Her surplus number is accurate, and two financial experts tell us that basic government accounting principles do not include debt in budgets. Whitman’s former treasurer also claims the governor made traditional spending cuts during her tenure. But how is skipping payments to pension funds controlling spending if those and other bills aren’t being paid in full, or are being deferred to later administrations? We rate Whitman’s claim Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Christine Whitman	None	None	None	2011-10-17T05:15:00	2011-09-19	['None']
pomt-12568	On whether NATO is "obsolete."	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/apr/12/donald-trump/donald-trump-nato-i-said-it-was-obsolete-its-no-lo/	President Donald Trump seems to have warmed up to NATO, declaring publicly that he no longer thinks the U.S.-European alliance is "obsolete." During the 2016 election, Trump criticized NATO because, he said, member countries aren’t contributing their fair share to the alliance financially, and the organization isn’t designed to fight terrorism. His comments precipitated some concern among the United States’ allies. But months later, during an April 12, 2017, press conference with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, Trump affirmed the United States’ commitment to the alliance and praised its seven-decade history. He said NATO is now doing more to fight terrorism, and as a result he no longer thinks the organization is obsolete. "The secretary general and I had a productive conversation about what more NATO can do in the fight against terrorism," Trump said. "I complained about that a long time ago, and they made a change. Now they do fight terrorism. I said it was obsolete. It’s no longer obsolete." That’s a big departure from comments he made on ABC in March 2016: "I think NATO's obsolete. NATO was done at a time you had the Soviet Union, which was obviously larger, much larger than Russia is today. I'm not saying Russia's not a threat. But we have other threats. We have the threat of terrorism and NATO doesn’t discuss terrorism, NATO's not meant for terrorism." However, the premise leading to Trump’s change of heart — the idea that he prompted NATO to start fighting terrorism — is false. He’s talking about the fact that in 2016 NATO created an assistant secretary general for intelligence and security to head a newly established Joint Intelligence and Security Division. Experts said the change was not especially significant, and Trump wasn’t the catalyst. The development had been in the works for years. "It is comical to suggest NATO would change its counterterrorism policy in response to anything Donald Trump has said about it over the course of his campaign," said Matthew Fay, a defense policy analyst with the Niskanen Center, in a prior PolitiFact interview. Further, Trump’s comment gives the incorrect impression that NATO wasn’t responsive to terrorism until the new division was created. In reality, NATO has been actively dealing with terrorism since the 1980s. And since 9/11, it has played a significant role in the War on Terror, including deploying troops in Afghanistan for more than a decade. We should note, though, that experts also told us that NATO’s structure and role has made it an imperfect vehicle for counterterrorism because of problems with coordinating among the member countries. Even before the election was over, Trump hinted that he thinks NATO is making itself more relevant in the fight against terrorism. But at the April press conference he made his change in opinion clear, saying, "I said it was obsolete. It's no longer obsolete." It’s up to voters to decide how they feel about Trump’s reversal on NATO. We rate the change of position a Full Flop.

pomt-09819	"Cap-and-trade is wildly unpopular with Americans."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/03/ibdeditorialscom/ibd-editorial-board-claims-cap-and-trade-unpopular/	The editorial board of Investor's Business Daily says the supporters of a cap-and-trade bill face an uphill battle. In a Sept. 2, 2009, op-ed about the European stake in a climate change bill passed by the House of Representatives, the editors wrote, "Cap-and-trade is wildly unpopular with Americans. No matter how many suave European continentals you send here, it won't change voters' minds." To support their claim, the board included a June 28-29 Rasmussen poll that shows that 56 percent of Americans said they wouldn't pay more taxes to cut greenhouse gases. The question — and the op-ed — leave out the important fact that the bill doesn't impose new taxes (though it's likely people would see higher utility bills as the result of cap-and-trade, which would raise the cost of energy at least slightly). But the claim piqued our interest nevertheless, so we decided to check other polls to see how the plan is playing among voters. The background: Cap-and-trade is a way to slow climate change by reducing carbon emissions. The idea is to cap emissions and require firms to either buy polluting permits or upgrade to cleaner technologies. House lawmakers included such a plan in a bill passed on June 26 that will lower carbon pollution by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. So let's look at how much support it has. A Washington Post /ABC News survey published on June 25, a day before the bill was passed, showed that 75 percent of Americans think the government should regulate greenhouse gas emissions to reduce global warming. About 52 percent support a cap-and-trade program to accomplish that. Opposition has grown to 42 percent, up from 34 percent in the summer of 2008. The same pollsters did a follow-up survey Aug. 13-17 and found that support for cap-and-trade was unchanged. This time, however, the poll provided more detail. About 58 percent said they would support the idea if it raised monthly electric bills by 10 dollars. But when that cost went up to 25 dollars, support dropped to 39 percent. (We've already explored different opinions on how much the legislation might cost, and you can read about them here .) Meanwhile, a Zogby poll published on Aug. 11 found that 71 percent of Americans support the legislation that was passed in the House. It's worth noting that all those numbers are up from polls that were taken earlier in the year, before the bill was debated and passed in the House. For example, in April, a Zogby poll found that 30 percent of respondents supported cap-and-trade. And a CNN poll done one month later found that 44 percent favor a cap-and-trade plan. So, given the most recent polling, it would be fair to say that a slight majority of Americans support cap-and-trade but that those numbers may decrease depending on how much it would cost in higher utility bills. Even so, at its lowest, nearly 40 percent of Americans would still support cap-and-trade even if it meant heftier energy bills. In no case do polling numbers show that cap-and-trade is "wildly unpopular," as the editors of IBD claim, so we give this one a False.

pomt-02462	"A majority of drunk driving deaths and injuries are caused by drunk driving offenders with no prior convictions."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/feb/24/mothers-against-drunk-driving/madd-says-most-drunken-driving-deaths-caused-first/	In assigning Wisconsin one of the lowest grades in the nation in its annual report card, Mothers Against Drunk Driving made an interesting claim about first-time offenders. "‘First-time’ offenders are rarely first-time drunk drivers," said a MADD news release on Feb. 11, 2014. "Conservative estimates show that a first-time convicted OWI offender has driven drunk at least 80 times prior to being arrested." MADD continued: "According to the Wisconsin Department of Transportation, a majority of drunk driving deaths and injuries are caused by drunk driving offenders with no prior convictions." The group spoke out as part of a push for greater use of in-vehicle breath tests, sobriety checkpoints and other measures. Now, we’ve heard state lawmakers argue that drunken-driving remedies should not hammer first-time offenders, who in Wisconsin alone face no criminal liability upon that first conviction. But the MADD national office counters that, saying first timers are involved in a majority of fatal and injury drunken-driving crashes. Are they right? MADD's evidence MADD told us it relied on statements in the "Alcohol Traffic Facts" booklet published in 2003 by the Wisconsin Department of Transportation. While dated, it was the latest such research made public by WisDOT at the time of MADD’s news release -- and it was the best source we could find in researching this item. The WisDOT study found that over a 12-year period from 1991 through 2002, three out of four drivers who had been drinking before a fatal or serious-injury crash had no prior convictions for OWI on their Wisconsin driving record. "Drivers who have previously been convicted of one or more OWI offenses do not comprise the bulk of drivers in fatal and non-fatal serious injury crashes involving drinking and driving," the WisDOT study said. (emphasis theirs) So MADD’s "majority" claim hits the mark, based on the WisDOT research. Beyond the age of the study, there some are other things to bear in mind. First, DOT noted that drivers’ records are not always complete, and that only post-1989 convictions were counted as "prior," under the law at that time. Second, the statistic focused on drivers who had been drinking, a somewhat broader category than the "drunken drivers" in MADD’s claim. Other evidence We found additional evidence generally supporting MADD’s claim, though none of it was directly on point. The best data we saw does not get at who caused these accidents. The Century Council, a distilled spirits trade group, cites 2012 federal government crash data showing that among fatal drunken driving crashes in Wisconsin, 87 percent involved a driver with no prior OWI conviction and 11 percent involved a driver with a prior OWI conviction in the past 3 years. (Three years is the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration standard for repeat offender.) That data does not cover injury crashes, though, just fatal crashes. And we note that the NHTSA, the federal agency that collects the data, does not recommend breaking out its data down to the state level. Nationally, NHTSA says, 93 percent of drivers in fatal crashes with a blood-alcohol level of 0.08 or higher had no previous drunken driving conviction in the previous three years. Nina Emerson, a veteran drunken-driving researcher in Wisconsin, studied Wisconsin cases of homicide by intoxicated use, and found that three out of four defendants had no prior drunken-driving conviction. For 20 years, Emerson directed the University of Wisconsin Law Schools Resource Center on Impaired Driving, which closed in 2013 when WisDOT ended its funding. One caution: She defined third offense and beyond as "repeat offenders" because second offense is the first criminal violation in Wisconsin. Emerson and other researchers emphasize an important truth about the research. "By most estimates, although repeat drunk drivers comprise a relatively small proportion of the total population of drivers, they are disproportionately responsible for alcohol-related crashes and other problems associated with drunk driving," Emerson and researchers Michael S. Scott, Nina J. Emerson and Joel B. Plant wrote in a drunken driving guide for the Center for Problem-Oriented Policing. That guide concluded: "However, even though repeat offenders are disproportionately involved in traffic crashes, most alcohol-related crashes are caused by drivers who have not previously been charged with drunk driving, so police must pay attention to both repeat and first-time offenders." Our rating MADD claimed that "a majority of drunk driving deaths and injuries are caused by drunk driving offenders with no prior convictions." While repeat offenders are overrepresented in such crashes compared to their share of the population, it’s clear that a strong majority of such crashes involve first-time offenders under several different definitions of the term. The research doesn't match up perfectly with the language in MADD's claim, but the best numbers are tilted heavily in the group's direction. We rate the claim True.

pomt-00276	John Kerry is "now working on the behalf of foreign terrorist governments."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/02/rickey-padgett/republican-candidate-claims-kerry-working-behalf-t/	A day after President Donald Trump slammed former Secretary of State John Kerry for private meetings with a top Iranian official, a North Carolina state Senate candidate lobbed similar accusations in a tweet of his own. "When will the President Strip Former Sec of State of his Security Clearance," said Republican Rickey Padgett, who is running to unseat Democrat Mike Woodard in District 22. "With John Kerry now working on the behalf of foreign terrorist governments (Now) should be the answer. Drain the Swamp now! John Kerry should be next!" Before Trump’s decision in May to withdraw from the 2015 Iran nuclear deal — which had lifted some economic sanctions on Iran so long as Iran discontinued its pursuit of nuclear weapons — Kerry worked behind the scenes to preserve the pact, according to a May 4 report by the Boston Globe detailing the quiet lobbying efforts as described by anonymous sources. Who has Kerry been meeting with? Specifically, Kerry met with Iranian Foreign Minister Javad Zarif and made several phone calls to European officials and members of Congress in an effort to rescue the deal. Kerry, who was the nuclear deal’s chief architect under President Barack Obama, said during an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, that he met with Zarif three or four times to discuss the agreement. Kerry’s private meetings have sparked an outcry from congressional Republicans, who say he may have undermined U.S. foreign policy interests. On Sept. 18, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., sent a letter asking the Justice Department to investigate the meetings, according to a press release. Previously, PolitiFact found claims that Kerry met secretly with Iranian officials in Paris to be unsubstantiated. PolitiFact also gave several websites Pants on Fire ratings for false reports that Kerry was facing prison charges under the Logan Act, which prohibits unauthorized American citizens from working to subvert U.S. foreign policy. But Padgett’s claim that Kerry has been "working on the behalf of foreign terrorist governments" seemed particularly sweeping, so we decided to give it a look. When asked for comment, Padgett said he stands by his statement and suggested Kerry has been compromised and should be examined under the Logan Act or brought before the Senate for hearings. "His efforts appear to represent the interests of the Iranian government more than American citizens right here on American soil," Padgett said. "He is part of the previous administration and he should stop trying to ink deals (in the) foreign interest as though he is still part of President Trump’s administration." How normal is this? Kerry spokesman Matthew Summers acknowledged that Kerry has maintained contact with his counterparts from other countries. But he explained that other secretaries of state did the same and that Kerry told Secretary of State Mike Pompeo during a phone conversation earlier this year about the discussions he had with Zarif at international conferences. "At those conferences, (Kerry) urged Iran to keep its commitments under the Iran nuclear agreement," Summers said. "He was advocating for what was wholly consistent with U.S. policy at the time, as the United States was still a part of the Iran deal." David Wade, Kerry’s former chief of staff, also pointed to an email newsletter from Diplomacy Works, a pro-diplomacy organization that includes Kerry on its advisory council, addressing the idea that Kerry’s meetings were secret and illegal. Citing Kerry’s interviews with Hewitt and Fox News host Dana Perino, the email said his meetings with Zarif were routine and occured at a time when the Iran nuclear deal was still U.S. policy. "There’s nothing unusual, let alone unseemly or inappropriate, about former diplomats meeting with foreign counterparts as Secretary Kissinger has done it for decades with Russia and China," Summers said. "But certainly anyone can agree it doesn’t constitute working ‘for’ another country." We consulted some experts, and they agreed. "Of course Kerry did not work on behalf of Iran," said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. Peter Feaver, a professor of political science at Duke University and a former National Security Council staff member, said there is "nothing unusual or untoward about formers continuing or extending relationships they fostered while in office." "Former national security officials like John Kerry meet with foreign leaders all the time," he said. Feaver said such meetings can be useful for relaying messages back to current policymakers, and that departed diplomats are usually very careful to emphasize that they are not advocating or creating policy. Still, although Kerry’s meetings were fairly standard practice, Feaver noted that it’s not strange that they raised some eyebrows among Republicans. "Based on published reporting, it is possible that former Secretary Kerry’s interactions danced close to the line — a line measuring professional norms, not legal restrictions — in terms of discussing ways to thwart current Administration policy," he said. "The Obama Administration would have been angry if former Bush Administration officials had crossed that line and so it is understandable that the Trump Administration is suspicious of Kerry’s activities." "One can have a good debate about the Logan Act," O’Hanlon added, referring to the law prohibiting unauthorized citizens from working to undermine U.S. policy. Padgett said the government should look into Kerry’s meetings as a potential violation of that statute. How does the Logan Act play into this? But as PolitiFact has noted before, there are only two known instances where Americans have been indicted for violating the Logan Act. The most recent of the two indictments came in 1853, and neither led to a conviction. Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas, told the Boston Globe that the act probably would not apply to what Kerry has been up to, even if it was commonly enforced. "If all Kerry is doing is working to keep in place something that’s still technically a ‘measure of the United States,’ I don’t see how the statute would apply even if someone was crazy enough to try it," Vladeck said, according to the Globe. So Kerry may have come close to "a line measuring professional norms," as Feaver said. But his meetings are unlikely to warrant prosecution under the Logan Act, and they certainly did not amount to "working on the behalf of foreign terrorist governments." For the record, Feaver also said the Iranian regime would more precisely be described as "major state sponsors of terrorism," not foreign terrorist governments. Our ruling Padgett said Kerry is "now working on the behalf of foreign terrorist governments." Experts we consulted said that is not the case. Kerry’s meetings with Zarif were not unusual, and there is no clear evidence that his efforts to salvage the Iran deal were undermining current U.S. policy because the meetings occurred before Trump actually moved to scrap the deal, when the deal was still consistent with U.S. policy. More to the point, there is no evidence that Kerry has been in cahoots with or working for Iran. We rate Padgett’s statement False.

pomt-09958	A public option for health care would end private insurance "because the private insurance people will not be able to compete with a government option."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/may/19/mitch-mcconnell/some-private-health-insurance-can-surviv/	With high-profile support from President Barack Obama, Congress is preparing a major overhaul of the nation's health care system. The details have yet to be revealed, but that hasn't stopped critics in Congress from going on the attack. Obama and the Democratic leadership have proposed broad outlines for the overhaul. The centerpiece of their plan remains the employer-based system, where most people have private health insurance through work. To rein in costs, the government would invest in electronic medical records and encourage efficiency and preventive care. To get coverage for people who don't have health insurance, the plan would increase eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. Finally, the plans seek to create a health insurance exchange, where individuals and small businesses can easily comparison shop for insurance coverage. One of the exchange plans would be a public option run by the government. It's the public option that has fueled Republican attacks. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said on Fox News Sunday that a public option would destroy the private insurance system. It "would mean a government plan that would inevitably put the government between you and your doctor, and there would be no more private insurance," McConnell said. Asked why by interviewer Chris Wallace, McConnell said, "Because the private insurance people will not be able to compete with a government option." McConnell is incorrect — the Democratic plan does not intend to do away with private insurance. His statement that private insurance "will not be able to compete with a government option" is challenged by nonpartisan health care experts who disagree. McConnell's view is that if the government offers a cheaper, public plan, people will dump their private insurance to get lower health care premiums. Over time, this would errode the private health care system. In theory, it makes sense that people would want the health plan that saves them the most money, and experts do say some private insurance companies might struggle to survive against a government competitor. In practice, however, researchers don't believe public options would destroy the private insurance industry. "Every time I hear these claims I'm astonished," said Cathy Schoen, senior vice president for the Commonwealth Fund, a foundation that studies health care and advocates more coverage for the uninsured, minorities and people with low incomes. She said a public plan could pressure private insurers to lower premiums or negotiate better rates with hospitals, but it would not put private companies out of business. "The public plan could get a reputation of not being good. The private plans could say, 'Let's change our behavior so we don't lose business,'" Schoen said. Another nonpartisan research group, the Urban Institute, reached similar conclusions. "Private plans would not disappear. Private plans that offer better services and greater access to providers, even at somewhat higher costs than the public plans, would survive the competition in this environment," wrote John Holahan and Linda Blumberg of the Urban Institute's Health Policy Center. One of the problems right now is that private insurance is not as competitive as you might think. Both the Commonwealth Fund and the Urban Insitute have noted that most health care markets are dominated by a small number of big insurers. "The increased concentration has made it difficult for the nation to reap the benefits usually associated with competitive markets," Holahan and Blumberg wrote. Not that a public option will solve all problems. They concluded that a public plan is not sufficient to control growing health care costs, and that other cost-containment strategies would be necessary. Finally, we should point out that it remains to be seen how the Democratic plan will deal with the public option, which could be structured in several different ways. McConnell flatly states that the public option would run private plans out business because they "will not be able to compete with a government option." Even though we have limited details on how the plan would be implemented, there is enough in the administration proposal to conclude that McConnell's worst-case scenario is unlikely. That brings us to Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-05553	Under the House Republican budget, "if these cuts were to be spread out evenly … the year after next, nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/06/barack-obama/president-barack-obama-says-gop-budget-cuts-financ/	Welcome to the Budget Games. The strategy: Offer a proposal with broad outlines and as little detail as possible. When opponents attack, declare, "That’s not what our budget does!" Meanwhile, fill in missing details in the other guy’s budget with the least flattering interpretation you can calculate. Repeat. President Barack Obama filled in some details of the GOP budget resolution passed by the U.S. House of Representatives in a speech to a meeting of news executiveson April 3, 2012 — using his own assumptions. "This new House Republican budget ... proposes massive new cuts in annual domestic spending — exactly the area where we’ve already cut the most. And I want to actually go through what it would mean for our country if these cuts were to be spread out evenly. So bear with me. I want to go through this — because I don’t think people fully appreciate the nature of this budget. "The year after next, nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each." He went on, listing nearly a dozen specific ways the plan from House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan would cut programs — again, assuming cuts were evenly spread. Then he clarified that Republicans "don’t specify exactly the cuts they would make." Still, he doubles down on his list: "This is not conjecture. I am not exaggerating. These are facts. And these are just the cuts that would happen the year after next." We thought we would start by asking: Is that true? If cuts were spread evenly, would nearly 10 million college students see their aid cut by more than $1,000 each? The Pell Grant program We asked the White House to explain Obama’s math. We talked to the House Budget Committee, looked through the budget documents and reached out to other budget experts. The House Budget Committee says such a claim about college aid cuts is simply false. More on that in a minute. Obama’s claim relies on funding in the Ryan plan for federal Pell Grants. The program provides the largest source of grant funding for needy college students, with more than 9.7 million students expected to get grants worth up to $5,635 in 2013, according to the Education Department. It goes without saying that’s the only way some students might afford to go to college. But the costs of the program have been soaring, with discretionary costs more than doubling since 2008, according to the Education Department — mostly because there are more eligible students. House Republicans accompanied the budget with a report that spells out ways to rein in the Pell program. For example, keeping the Pell maximum grant award in 2013 at this year's level of $5,550. The House Budget Committee says it would stay at that level for the full 10 years of the budget, key to the argument that Obama’s claim is false, though that's not clear in the report. But there’s disagreement between the House Budget Committee and the White House Office of Management and Budget over how seriously to take House recommendations that aren’t in the actual budget resolution. In the absence of direction from the budget resolution, OMB says it’s justified in applying the Republican budget’s cuts to nondefense discretionary spending across the board, leading to Obama’s statement that "if these cuts were to be spread out evenly … the year after next, nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each." The Ryan plan Let’s be clear about what a budget resolution actually is — merely a guidance document for policymakers. "Even in places where it makes assumed cuts to get to its budget numbers, it doesn't actually have the ability to force them to happen," said Steve Ellis, vice president for Taxpayers for Common Sense. House committees propose legislation to do that. Still, the budget passed by the House on March 29, 2012, provides an outline. What does it say about Pell Grant funding? Nothing. But the accompanying House Budget Committee report on the budget resolution offers a series of "illustrative options" to achieve its savings, saying, "The committees of jurisdiction will make final policy determinations." The suggestions include requiring that students attend school at least half-time and changing the maximum income limit to be eligible. (It doesn’t actually specify what that new limit might be. Jason Delisle, an education budget expert at the New America Foundation, has made some guesses.) Among those suggestions: "To get program costs back to a sustainable level, the budget recommends a maximum award of $5,550." It says the award would be fully funded through discretionary, rather than mandatory, spending. (That means an even bigger funding crunch in a shrinking pool of discretionary dollars.) Moira Mack, spokeswoman for the OMB, points out that recommendation isn’t included in the actual budget resolution passed by the House — which does include policy statements on big issues such as Medicare and Social Security. Meanwhile, she says, the report isn’t clear about whether the maximum applies just to the coming year or to the entire 10-year-window covered by the budget. (The language just before the "illustrative options" is specific to fiscal year 2013.) So the OMB calculates that the Ryan budget keeps the maximum grant at $5,550 in 2013 only. In 2014, the budget’s 14.3 percent cut in nondefense discretionary spending from the year before — applied evenly to the Pell program — would push the maximum award amount down to to $4,595 and leave some students with nothing at all, with an average cut of more than $1,000 per student. (The president’s budget doesn’t clarify how it cuts spending in order to increase the maximum award — but compared with Ryan’s plan, there’s more funding available for nondefense discretionary spending, such as Pell grants.) Budget experts at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities made a calculation similar to Obama's. "The $1,000 was in the range of what we estimate would happen if you eliminated the mandatory funding and made a few other policy changes but did not significantly reduce the number of people who are eligible," said James Horney, vice president for federal fiscal policy. It’s just as possible that lawmakers could reduce eligibility, rather than cut the maximum award — leading to a different sort of statistic. Say, "Millions of students would lose access to the Pell Grant program." Or lawmakers could choose to protect both eligibility and the $5,550, leading to bigger cuts in other programs. So is Obama’s math fair? Ellis, of Taxpayers for Common Sense, says it’s tricky to say. "Averaging cuts isn't an accurate way to describe what a budget does," he said. "That said, the budget is not that prescriptive, so saying it wouldn't lead to something being cut is hard to argue as well." But that’s precisely what the House Budget Office argues. "Our budget ensures that we maintain the current maximum Pell award," said Gerrit Lansing, press secretary for the House Budget Committee, sustaining the 2012 award amount in the Ryan plan for 10 years. "... Yet again, the president has made assumptions about our budget that can't be sourced to our budget. The president is arguing: 'While Ryan doesn't assume X, let's just say he does so that I can get my talking point to work.'" William McBride, an economist at the business-backed Tax Foundation, echoes that idea, saying, "As far as I know, there is no clear basis for the president’s claim. There is nothing in the Ryan budget that would suggest that. The burden of proof is with the president." Roberton Williams, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, says there simply isn’t enough detail in the Ryan plan to say how it might affect people when it’s all in place. And in that case, estimating cuts across the board is reasonable. Delisle, the education funding expert at the New America Foundation, developed his own set of assumptions to evaluate the Ryan plan’s effect on Pell funding. "The Ryan budget doesn't truly reveal what it's doing … which gives the Obama administration a lot of latitude to assume something radical," he said. Our ruling Obama declared in his speech to news media that in the absence of information about cuts in the Ryan plan, he would extrapolate what might happen if those cuts were applied evenly across programs. He included such a detail about Pell Grants, saying "the year after next, nearly 10 million college students would see their financial aid cut by an average of more than $1,000 each." To his credit, Obama clarified that Republicans didn’t specify those cuts themselves and that they might apply cuts in ways other than the president assumed. But he hurts himself when he engages in a detailed analysis based on his own assumptions and then declares, "This is not conjecture." Budget experts tell us that applying cuts evenly in the absence of other information is fair, assuming he’s clear about what he’s doing. But Obama's figure was based on the assumption that savings would be achieved by, among other things, reducing the maximum grant level in 2013 and beyond. The problem is, House Republicans say that their report expresses a preference to maintain a maximum award of $5,550. But that preference isn’t in the budget resolution passed by the House. The president's statement is accurate using his set of assumptions, but his assumptions ignore a preference that House Republicans say was reflected in the report accompanying the Ryan budget — that Pell grant maximums not be reduced beyond 2013. And, if other means were used to reduce spending on Pell Grants, such as lowering income eligibility, the impact could be different. Those are important details to leave out, which leads us to a rating of Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-04-06T16:34:55	2012-04-03	['None']

pomt-07835	Since Sept. 11, 2001, "270,000 Americans were killed by gunfire at home."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/14/doonesbury/doonesbury-strip-says-270000-americans-have-been-k/	In the Sunday, Feb. 13, 2011, installment of the comic strip Doonesbury, Mark Slackmeyer -- a longtime character in the strip who is a liberal radio host -- makes a point about gun violence. "What are we like as a people?" Slackmeyer muses to himself in his studio. "Nine years, ago we were attacked -- 3,000 people died. In response, we started two long, bloody wars and built a vast homeland-security apparatus -- all at a cost of trillions! Now consider this. During those same nine years, 270,000 Americans were killed by gunfire at home. Our response? We weakened our gun laws." At that point, a whirring sound comes from off-panel. In the final panel, we see that his guest is a space alien, who says, "Fail. Cannot Comprehend." To which Slackmeyer cracks, "Well, you may be a little jet-lagged." A reader asked us to fact-check it. So we’ll look at whether since Sept. 11, 2001, "270,000 Americans were killed by gunfire at home." We began by contacting Garry Trudeau, the cartoonist who has drawn Doonesbury for more than four decades. He got back immediately with a summary of his methodology. "The final figure lacks precision, because it's extrapolated," Trudeau wrote us, noting, correctly, that the most recent data for gun deaths from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is from 2007. "What I had were six years -- 2002-2007 -- of a remarkably stable number, around 30,000" gun deaths per year, Trudeau wrote. "So in my judgment, multiplying 30,000 times nine yielded a figure reasonable and accurate enough for rhetorical purposes without using hyperbole. If anything, it may be slightly on the low side." We found that Trudeau was basically right. We went to the same CDC database he used -- the Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (or WISQARS for short) -- and got virtually identical numbers. Our number came out slightly higher -- 281,757 -- because we not only extrapolated out through the end of 2010 in our calculations but also included the final three months of 2001. We should note the details of Trudeau’s definition of gun deaths, which is also the definition we would have used if we’d been starting from scratch. It includes the following categories: • Suicides: 102,002 between 2002 and 2007 • Homicides: 73,148 between 2002 and 2007 • Accidental: 4,185 between 2002 and 2007 • Legal shootings: 1,999 between 2002 and 2007 • Undetermined: 1,427 between 2002 and 2007 -- Total: 182,761 between 2002 and 2007 So on the numbers, Trudeau’s methodology was accurate. The only thing that threw us was how the strip had described where the deaths occurred -- "270,000 Americans were killed by gunfire at home" (our emphasis). Initially, we took that to mean that 270,000 Americans were literally killed in or near their homes. And we knew that couldn’t be right, because the number both we and Trudeau calculated included all gunfire deaths, wherever they had occurred. When we asked criminologists for guidance on what percentage of gun deaths occur at home, they said the statistics on that question are scattershot. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, provided data on Chicago homicides from an amicus brief he wrote for a Supreme Court case. Since 1965, the ratio of outside-the-home handgun homicides in Chicago to those occurring at home has tended to bounce around from about two-to-one in the 1970s to about five-to-one in the 1990s. So if one interprets "at home" to mean in or near someone’s home, the numbers Trudeau calculated wouldn’t be correct. When we raised this point with Trudeau, he said that wasn’t what he meant: "I didn't say ‘in the home,’ I said ‘at home’ as opposed to abroad, where the wars are. Failure to communicate clearly, I guess. Rats." Reading through it again, we think Trudeau’s explanation sounds reasonable. But we decided to mark Trudeau down slightly because we think it’s also reasonable for people to make the same initial assumption we did, that "at home" means in or near one’s home. So we’ll rate the comment Mostly True.	None	Doonesbury	None	None	None	2011-02-14T15:41:08	2011-02-13	['United_States']

pomt-06633	"Two-thirds of Granite Staters oppose the Tea Party" and its agenda on labor unions.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/sep/16/new-hampshire-democratic-party/democrats-say-majority-new-hampshire-residents-do-/	The New Hampshire primary has many fine traditions: house parties in cramped farmhouse parlors; town hall meetings with substantive questions from well-informed voters; and icy storms that punish Washington-based reporters who thought duck boots were a crime against fashion. Yet another tradition is sniping from state party officials who try to inflict a little collateral damage on the other team’s candidates, especially the front-runners. Such is the case with New Hampshire Democratic Party chairman Ray Buckley, whose team of operatives has been especially focused on Republican Mitt Romney, who proved in his 2002 gubernatorial victory in Massachusetts that he can appeal to suburban, independent voters. When Romney earlier this month decided to attend a Tea Party Express event in Concord, Buckley issued a news release deriding "Mitt Romney’s Official Tea Party Debut." "The Tea Party does not represent the majority of Granite Staters," Buckley asserted. "This is evidenced by the Tea Party-backed State House Republicans here, who in only nine months have amounted to one of the most unpopular legislatures in New Hampshire's history. "Two-thirds of Granite Staters oppose the Tea Party and Romney’s Right to Work for Less agenda, and even more oppose the GOP plan to end Medicare as we know it." For this fact-check, we're examining Buckley's claim that two-thirds oppose the tea party and its support for a controversial "right-to-work" bill in Concord. Considering that tea party voters helped fuel a huge Republican victory in New Hampshire legislative races in 2010, Buckley’s statement, if true, would indicate a rather abrupt change of heart. Asked for backup for Buckley’s claim, New Hampshire Democratic Party spokeswoman Holly Shulman cited a New Hampshire Tea Party website that strongly endorses legislation that would weaken unions’ clout by preventing them from collecting dues or fees from nonmembers covered by union contracts. She also cited polls by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center that show strong support for the right to collectively bargain. There is no doubt that the New Hampshire Tea Party Coalition news release for a May 25, 2011, rally identifies the "right to work" bill as "the most important piece of legislation for the future health of the New Hampshire economy that will be considered in this session or any other session." And Romney, does, indeed, support "right-to-work" laws, and has specifically spoken in favor of the GOP bill in Concord, which would end a practice allowing union contracts to include a clause requiring non-union workers to pay a share of collective bargaining costs. New Hampshire Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat, vetoed the bill, and supporters have been unable to muster an override. But there are two major issues with Buckley’s claim: First, it suggests that two-thirds of New Hampshire voters oppose the tea party, not just its agenda on labor issues. And secondly, it distorts what is known about public opinion on the union issue. Polls show Buckley is correct in saying the tea party doesn’t represent "the majority" of Granite Staters, but to suggest that two-thirds oppose the group is a big stretch. UNH Survey Center director Andrew Smith said his group’s most recent poll, in July 2011, showed that 27 percent of New Hampshire adults supported the tea party, 35 percent were opposed, and 38 percent were neutral or said they didn’t know. "This has been pretty consistent for the past year," he said by e-mail. Shulman also referred PolitiFact to a New York Times/CBS News poll on Aug. 5, 2011, and wrote, "Recent national polls show the tea party is very unpopular." That national poll, incidentally, found 20 percent of Americans with a favorable view of the tea party, 40 percent unfavorable, and 39 percent saying they were either undecided or hadn’t heard enough about the group. But Smith told us that opinion on the tea party in New Hampshire tracks closely along political affiliation -- support among Republicans, opposition among Democrats, and mixed opinion among independents, with more than 50 percent of them neutral about the group. "I can see what (the Democrats) are trying to do, but I don’t think that saying that two-thirds of people in New Hampshire oppose the tea party accurately reflects public opinion," Smith said. He also takes some exception with how Buckley’s team is characterizing the polling data on unions. The UNH Survey Center poll in May, which Democrats cited, asked respondents whether public- and private-sector workers should have the right to form unions and negotiate pay and benefits. And, indeed, there is support for unionization on that front in both sectors. Sixty-six percent of respondents said workers should have the right to unionize, with only 20 percent opposed, and the numbers for government workers, specifically, weren’t much different. But Smith said his polling specifically avoided using "right to work," which refers to laws outlawing compulsory dues paying. Using the phrase "right to work," Smith said, "doesn’t accurately reflect" what his poll question asked. Our ruling Buckley said "Two-thirds of Granite Staters oppose the Tea Party" and its agenda on labor unions. But UNH polls show the opposition to the tea party is about 35 percent, about half as much as Buckley says. And while New Hampshire voters support the right to form unions and negotiate, the polls Democrats cite don’t ask about the also contentious issue of compulsory union dues. We rate Buckley's claim Mostly False.	None	New Hampshire Democratic Party	None	None	None	2011-09-16T13:51:10	2011-09-04	['None']

pomt-13950	"ISIS is running through a border made porous by Barack Obama’s policies."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2016/jun/17/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-makes-unfounded-claim-about-isis-runni/	At the May 2016 Republican Party of Texas convention, Gov. Greg Abbott told thousands of delegates that the Islamic State group, which has ravaged parts of the Middle East, was at work along the Texas-Mexico border. "Our country better wake up. We’re facing an existential threat," he said. "ISIS is running through the border made porous by Barack Obama’s policies." ISIS has seized vast territory in Iraq and Syria wielding heavy weapons of war. It terrorizes civilians and broadcasts footage of sadistic executions. Does it also operate over the 1,254-mile Texas-Mexico border? Rumor says they do, though we’ve found previous claims short of factual footing. In October 2014, we rated False then-Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst’s claim that prayer rugs had been found at the border, suggesting an ISIS presence. The same month, we rated False a claim by U.S. Rep. Duncan Hunter that 10 ISIS fighters had been caught at the border. In April 2015, we rated False a report by conservative watchdog Judicial Watch stating that ISIS was running a camp in Mexico just over the border from El Paso. Most recently, in December 2015 we rated Mostly False Abbott’s claim that Texas had seen three ISIS-related incidents, finding his definition of "ISIS-related" extremely loose. So, here we go again. Abbott’s data Abbott, who in 2015 touted and signed into law the state’s $800 million border security package, offered his declaration as proof of the urgency of his border security agenda and as a jab at the immigration policies of the Democratic president’s administration, over which then-Attorney General Abbott filed a federal lawsuit on behalf of Texas and more than 20 other mostly Republican-led states in 2014. It alleged the president exceeded his constitutional authority when he used executive action to shield certain young adults and parents from deportation. In April 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court heard the Texas-led challenge to the Obama administration’s policy; a ruling could come this year. We emailed Abbott spokesman John Wittman to ask when ISIS ran through the border, and also which Obama policies had made the border more porous, as Abbott said. Regarding the porous border, Wittman sent a link to the 2014 lawsuit filed by Attorney General Abbott. "A specific policy which has made the border more porous," Wittman wrote. Regarding ISIS, Wittman provided a web link, tweeted by Abbott on April 23, 2016, to a Fox News Latino article published the day before. The news story, citing prosecutorial documents, said a 21-year-old Minnesota man charged with conspiracy to join ISIS "told the ISIS members about the route (‘to the U.S. through Mexico’) so that it could be used to send members to America to carry out terrorist attacks." ISIS at the gates For our part, we looked first for signs of ISIS border crossings, then considered Abbott’s charge about Obama fostering a porous border. Abbott’s backup did not say, as the governor did, that ISIS was operating at the border, but we still made inquiries. At the Department of Homeland Security, the parent agency for border security, including the U.S. Border Patrol, spokeswoman Marsha Catron emailed in reply: "The suggestion that (ISIS) operatives have been apprehended at the Southwest border is not supported by facts on the ground. DHS does not have any credible intelligence that terrorist organizations are planning to attempt to cross the southwest border to carry out attacks in the United States." We also emailed the Texas Department of Public Safety, which patrols the border, to ask for any reports of ISIS activity thereabouts.DPS spokesman Tom Vinger emailed: "The department does not have any information to provide." In the past, groups or individuals bandying similar claims alleged that law enforcement agencies suppress news of ISIS at the border to avoid public panics. That in mind, we also queried experts outside of government. By phone, we asked Victor M. Manjarrez, director of the National Center for Border Security & Immigration at the University of Texas at El Paso, if ISIS was operating at the border. Manjarrez, a former Border Patrol sector chief, said, "no," adding that every report of ISIS at the border has been debunked. We thought perhaps there are reports Manjarrez hadn’t seen, so we looked elsewhere. At the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington D.C.-based think tank which focuses partly on border security and international terrorism, we were referred to Rick Nelson, former director of the center’s Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Program, who said in a phone interview he knew of no reports of ISIS at the border. Nelson said: "There’s no doubt that if ISIS had the opportunity, they would conduct an attack in the U.S., but to state that they’re going to do so by going through Mexico and going through the southern border is a little bit disconnected." He said the group was more focused on radicalizing Americans already in the country. We also emailed the RAND Corporation, a California-based think tank focused partly on national security, to ask about reports of ISIS at the border. By phone, Colin Clarke, a political scientist and national security research at RAND, said: "I haven’t seen any evidence that there are ISIS people coming across the border. My standard response is I haven’t seen the evidence, but that doesn’t mean that at some point they won’t try that." Clarke said ISIS would need a domestic network of safe houses and weapons stashes to wage a significant attack, even if members were to come across the border. So, no confirmed ISIS sightings. We looked next at if the border has become "porous" on Obama’s watch, as Abbott said. Border Patrol spending up, apprehensions down There are no signs of a more porous border that we divined. When we asked Nelson at the CSIS to what extent border security had decreased under Obama, he said, "I would say it hasn’t." He said, "The amount of resources Obama has put forward to secure the border has been significant." On Obama’s watch, federal figures suggest, border security spending and staffing escalated and, in the latest full fiscal year, 2015, apprehensions of individuals crossing the border without legal authority declined in comparison to the three previous years. Some perspective: --The congressionally approved $3.8 billion fiscal 2015 budget for the Border Patrol, the on-the-ground border enforcement unit of Customs and Border Protection,was up an inflation-adjusted 29 percent from fiscal 2009, the year Obama succeeded George W. Bush. --The 17,522 Border Patrol agents in 2015 were up a sliver, less than 1 percent, from 2009, though down 6 percent from the all-time high of 18,611 agents in 2013. --Apprehensions along the southwest border escalated in 2013 and 2014, according to Border Patrol data, but the 331,333 apprehensions near the border in fiscal 2015 were the fewest since 2011--and down 39 percent compared to 2009. Also worth noting: Deportations from the U.S. hit a record high under Obama in 2013, the year before the surge, according to Pew Research. Obama policies? Abbott’s lawsuit, which Wittman cited as backup, identified two Obama policies: Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), announced in 2012, and Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA), unveiled in 2014. DACA blocked deportation for qualified unauthorized immigrants who arrived as children and DAPA did the same for parents of qualified citizens and permanent residents. The lawsuit predicted that both moves would "substantially increase the number of undocumented immigrants in the plaintiff states" because "the removal of the deportation threat, combined with the incentives to stay, will make remaining in the United States far more attractive." We asked Manjarrez if DACA and DAPA made the border more porous. "I wouldn’t say porous, I’d say it’s increased the clutter," he said. "Some people translate that to more porous, I say the border is now at a higher risk to be exploited by some interest." For instance, he said that many children who arrived amid a surge in 2014-2015 cited rumors that they would not be deported as a motivation for their trips to the border. The increased "clutter" at the border, he said, made it harder for Border Patrol agents to pinpoint security threats. We’ve looked before into claims that Obama policies fueled the migrant surge. At the time, experts and news reports gave more credit to rising violence in Central American countries and to a 2008 law passed under Bush shielding non-Mexican children from immediate deportation when apprehended at the border. Abbott again We shared our findings--no confirmation of ISIS on the border and statistics suggesting a greater security presence--with the governor’s office. Wittman said Abbott had nothing to add. Our ruling Abbott said "ISIS is running through the border made porous by Barack Obama’s policies." We found no factual basis — Abbott offered none — to support the claim that ISIS is "running through" the border. Other claims of ISIS forces marshaling on the U.S.-Mexico border have been debunked, and this one deserves the same fate. Border security itself has been stepped up, by the federal government and Texas, with apprehensions lately on the decline. Abbott’s claim isn’t just wrong, it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-00279	"Since NAFTA’s adoption, the United States racked up trade deficits totaling more than $2 trillion."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/01/donald-trump/has-us-racked-2-trillion-trade-deficits-nafta-bega/	During a press event to announce a successor trade pact to the North American Free Trade Agreement, President Donald Trump sought to portray NATFA as a disaster for American trade. "Since NAFTA’s adoption, the United States racked up trade deficits totaling more than $2 trillion," Trump said at the Oct. 1, 2018, event at the White House. (Watch it at about the 20:00 mark.) Is that true? We turned to data for trade in goods with Canada and Mexico published by the U.S. Census Bureau. We totaled up the trade surpluses or deficits with each country between 1994 — the year the agreement was signed — and 2017, the last full year for which data is available. (Reminder: A trade surplus means that exports exceed imports; a trade deficit means that imports exceed exports. It doesn’t literally mean the United States lost $2 trillion.) Here’s the year-by-year summary of the balance of trade of goods with both countries. With one exception, they were all annual deficits. (Mexico is marked in red, while Canada is marked in blue.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com If you add it all up, the accumulated U.S. trade deficit with both countries in goods between 1994 and 2017 was $1.97 trillion. Rounded up, that’s $2 trillion. But it’s not a fully comprehensive description. These figures are for goods only — not for goods and services. When Trump has talked as president about trade statistics, he has often referred to the deficit for goods only. That paints the United States’ trade position in a worse light than If the calculation had included services (such as legal or accounting services). We couldn’t find data on services all the way back to 1994, but we’ll use data for 2015, 2016 and 2017 for a sense of how the numbers differ. In each of those years, the United States erased its modest trade deficit in goods with Canada by running a trade surplus in services. The impact of services on the trade balance with Mexico was smaller, but the trade deficit with Mexico typically shrank when services were included. Second, Trump uses this statistic to emphasize the negative impact of NAFTA while minimizing the positive impact. NAFTA certainly had negative aspects for the United States. We recently rated a Trump statement that "we lost thousands of plants" due to NAFTA Mostly True. Still, the agreement has had positive impacts as well. For instance, NAFTA increased the amount of U.S. exports to both countries, which in turn produced jobs that didn’t exist before. Here’s a chart showing the level of U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico in 1994 and 2017. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com "There are volume benefits to trade under NAFTA," said Ross Burkhart, a political scientist specializing in U.S.-Canada relations at Boise State University. "Exports across NAFTA are one of them. Across the vast majority of U.S. states, Canada remains the No. 1 trading partner both in exports and imports." It’s also worth noting that the concept of "exports" and "imports" between NAFTA-member countries has blurred, since partially assembled goods often cross the Canada-U.S. border several times before the final product is assembled, especially in the automobile sector. "If Ford used to ship engines from a parts plant in Dearborn, Mich., to one in Ypsilanti, Mich., but it now ships those parts to Monterey, Mexico, for assembly into a car or truck that is shipped back to the United States (and if the Ypsilanti assembly plant has closed), then the increase in exports to Mexico has not supported any new jobs," said Robert E. Scott, senior economist and director of trade and manufacturing policy research at the Economic Policy Institute, which is skeptical of trade agreements. Various independent estimates have found that the net job losses from NAFTA were modest, with the gains roughly offsetting losses. In general, experts who are favorable to free trade say that arguing over deficits and surpluses misses the point. Specifically, trade deficits stem from demand among U.S. consumers for products that U.S. producers cannot meet, whether that’s because no American company makes the product in question, because American companies aren’t making the product cheaply enough, or because U.S.-produced wares simply aren’t appealing enough to consumers. "We should be running deficits with some countries and surpluses with others, since comparative advantage will vary, country by country," I.M. (Mac) Destler, who teaches at the University of Maryland School of Public Policy, has told us previously. Our ruling Trump said, "Since NAFTA’s adoption, the United States racked up trade deficits totaling more than $2 trillion." The trade deficit is different from the national debt in that it is not money owed to another country in the future. But if you compile the trade deficit for goods alone, Trump is on target. The amount might be smaller once services are factored in. It’s worth noting that this statistic emphasizes the negative impacts of the trade deal but ignores positive impacts, such as significant increases in U.S. exports to both countries.

pomt-08612	"Our tax rates are lower now than they were under Ronald Reagan. They're much lower than they were under Dwight Eisenhower."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/sep/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-taxes-are-lower-today-under-reag/	CORRECTION: The original version of this story misstated some of the income thresholds that qualified a taxpayer for the top rate. For individuals today, the top rate kicks in at $373,650, rather than $186,825. In 1981, the top rate of 70 percent kicked in at $108,300 rather than $107,100. In 1988, the top rate of 28 percent kicked in at $17,850 for individuals (rather than $113,300) and at $29,750 for married couples (rather than $149,250). Today, those incomes would be equivalent to $33,229 and $55,382 respectively. We had already argued in our assessment that 1988 was the one year where Obama’s comparison was inaccurate, which is why we rated his comment Mostly True rather than True. The corrected numbers do not invalidate that conclusion, so we are keeping our rating. A blog post at Media Matters for America, a liberal group, argued that the premise of our comparison was misleading, since we only compared the the top tax rates. We agree that a comparison of all tax brackets would have an advantage over a look at just the top brackets. But as we indicated in the story, comparing a dozen or more income ranges -- each of which need to be adjusted for inflation -- over a series of nearly 20 separate tax years is a complicated process, and we were not convinced that Obama had actually intended to make the more detailed comparison. So we compared just the top rate. Others are free to make the alternative calculations, but we believe we’ve used a valid methodology. (March 1, 2011) *** During a Sept. 20, 2010, town hall televised on CNBC, President Barack Obama made a pointed comparison involving taxation under his presidency. "Our tax rates are lower now than they were under Ronald Reagan," Obama said. "They're much lower than they were under Dwight Eisenhower." We thought that claim was worth a run through the Truth-O-Meter. The most obvious way to make the comparison is to use income tax rates paid by people in various tax brackets. Due to the complexity of comparing a dozen or more income ranges that each need to be adjusted for inflation, economists most frequently compare just the top rate. First, we'll look at the tax rates, using a convenient historical guide published by the Tax Foundation, an independent tax research group. The tables go as far back as the dawn of the income tax in 1913. Today, the top income tax rate is 35 percent, starting at $373,650 for individuals and couples. By contrast, during the eight years of the Eisenhower presidency, the top rate averaged roughly 90 percent, typically hitting individuals making $200,000 a year or couples making $400,000 a year. In 2010 dollars, that's equivalent to $1.6 million for an individual and $3.2 million for a couple. Someone making the 1954 equivalent of $373,650 in today's money would have paid a tax rate of 72 percent back then. So by this measure, Obama's comparison with Eisenhower earns a True. Now for Ronald Reagan. In 1981, Reagan's first year, the top tax rate was 70 percent, hitting individuals earning $108,300 and couples earning $215,400. The top rate dropped immediately to 50 percent in 1982 and stayed there through 1986. In 1987, the top rate fell again to 38.5 percent, and in 1988, it fell to 28 percent, kicking in at $17,850 for married individuals and $29,750 for married couples. (The 1988 incomes would be equivalent to $33,229 and $55,382 today.) So, for one year of the Reagan presidency, the top rate was lower than it is now under Obama. For the other seven years, it was higher. For the Reagan comparison, we rate Obama's statement Mostly True. But we'll add a few caveats. The first is that looking at the top income tax rate offers an incomplete look at overall tax policy because it only looks at income taxes, not at other levies such as payroll, sales and property taxes. This is not a trivial difference: According to the Tax Foundation, more than two-thirds of all taxes paid by Americans in 2010 will be something other than income taxes. There is another way -- calculating all taxes paid by Americans and dividing the sum by the nation's total income. To make this calculation, we turned to the Tax Foundation's annual "Tax Freedom Day" report, which offers calculations of total tax burden going back to 1900. (There was no federal income tax then, but there were state and other taxes.) The foundation's expected tax burden for 2010 is 26.9 percent, up slightly from the 2009 tax burden of 26.6 percent. (This is not unusual: The tax burden typically falls during recessions, as taxpayers move to lower tax brackets.) Under Eisenhower, that figure ranged from 24.8 percent to 27.7 percent, with the figure lower than 26.9 percent for seven out of eight years. So by this measurement, the tax burden was lower most of the time under Eisenhower. Under Reagan, it ranged from 29.2 percent to 31.1 percent, meaning that in all eight years it was higher than the current tax burden under Obama. Still, Obama did speak of "tax rates," not "taxes" or "tax burdens," so we'll stick to the tax bracket comparison in making our ruling. The second caveat we'll mention is that conservatives say it's inappropriate for Obama to claim credit for lower taxes. They note that today's tax rates were established by his Republican predecessor, George W. Bush. In fact, they say, it is Obama's stated intention to increase taxes on individuals earning $200,000 and couples earning $250,000, which would push the top tax bracket to 39.6 percent. They also note (as we have, in giving him a Promise Broken on the Obameter) that the president has already signed into law several tax increases. He hiked the levy on cigarettes; imposed tax penalties on people without insurance; taxed tanning services, pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and raised Medicare tax rates for upper-income individuals. (Not all of these taxes kick in immediately.) We think it's fair to note that Obama has raised taxes and promises to do so again. But we don't think that undermines the factual accuracy of his statement from the town hall. If you make the comparison using tax brackets -- which we think was Obama's clear intent -- then the president is right when comparing today's rates to Eisenhower's, and he's close to right when he makes the comparison to Reagan. On balance, we rate Obama's statement Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2010-09-22T10:03:29	2010-09-20	['Dwight_D._Eisenhower', 'Ronald_Reagan']

pomt-03843	The transportation package passed by the General Assembly would impose the "largest tax increase in Virginia’s history."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2013/mar/15/jamie-radtke/jamie-radtke-says-transportation-bill-would-impose/	Gov. Bob McDonnell stands accused of sanctioning the biggest tax hike in Virginia history. The charge has been lodged by Jamie Radtke, a Virginia Tea Party organizer, in protest of the General Assembly’s approval last month of a transportation plan that could raise annual taxes by $1.25 billion a year. McDonnell backed the legislation and hailed its passage as "an historic day in Virginia." The bill is sitting on McDonnell’s desk and Radtke is trying to pressure the governor not to sign it. She has started a Facebook page and a petition called "Stop Largest Tax Increase in Virginia History." She also narrated a TV ad claiming that McDonnell, who many believe has national ambition, "pushed the largest tax increase in Virginia history." The commercial was sponsored by the conservative Patriot Super PAC and aired in Iowa, site of the first presidential caucuses every four years. All of this leads to an obvious question: Does the transportation bill call for the largest tax increase in Virginia history? We checked. The package would generate $880 million a year in new state revenues in 2018 when it is fully phased in, according to a report by the House Appropriations Committee. About $680 million of that sum would come from tax increases. The legislation would replace the current 17.5-cent per-gallon gas tax with a 3.5 percent tax on gasoline and 6 percent diesel tax at the wholesale level. It would raise the 5 percent sales tax to 5.3 percent and increase the 3 percent motor vehicle tax sales tax to 4.3 percent. It also counts on Congress passing legislation that would give states authority to compel online retailers to collect sales tax. In addition, Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads would be empowered to impose a 0.7 percent local sales tax and other regional levies that could raise a total of $568 million a year for transportation by 2018. When you combine the new tax revenues for the state with the potential new levies flowing into Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads, the tax package comes to about $1.25 billion a year We asked Radtke to back up her claim that it all adds up to Virginia’s largest tax increase. "I’m slammed and don’t have time to pull all that for you right now," she replied in a March 5 email. Radtke added that former Gov. Mark Warner "had the biggest tax increase in 2004, which was $1.4 billion over two years. This one is $1 billion every year. I will see if I can get you more data later." Radtke never got back to us. It’s true that Warner’s 2004 tax increase, often described as record-breaking when it passed, originally generated about $700 million a year. So in terms of raw dollars, Radtke has a point: This year’s take hike, with a potential of producing $1.25 billion annually for state and local coffers, would set a high-water mark. But Radtke may not have chosen the most meaningful way to compare financial data from different points in time. Several analysts urged us to account for inflation. We followed their advice and found that Warner’s tax hike, in today’s dollars, comes to about $860 million a year. That still falls below the $1.25 billion potential of the bill that awaits McDonnell’s signature. Warner, however, is not the only governor in Virginia history who pushed through a tax increase that can be compared to the current plan. In 1986, Gerald Baliles signed a package of tax hikes that raised $422 million for transportation. Adjusted for inflation, it comes out to $893 million in 2013 dollars. That doesn’t beat this year’s bill, either. But we got a different result when we went back to 1966 and examined landmark legislation signed by Gov. Mills Godwin that created the state’s sales tax. The legislation phased in a 3 percent state sales tax over about three years to aid public education, help create Virginia’s community college system and pay for some transportation and administrative expenses. In addition, the law allowed counties and cities to enact a 1 percent sales tax, and all localities did that, according to a 1970 publication by the University of Virginia. The new levies brought in $282 million during the fiscal year that ended June 30, 1970, according to a report that year by the Department of Taxation. Adjusted for inflation, that comes to $1.68 billion today and easily outpaces the tax increase that McDonnell has endorsed. Our ruling Radtke said that the transportation package approved by the General Assembly this year amounts to the largest tax increase in Virginia history. Using raw dollars, she’s correct. But that’s not the whole story. The value of a dollar changes over time. When inflation is factored, the value of legislation approved in 1966 that created the state’s sales tax would be $1.67 billion annually today. That exceeds the $1.25 billion-a-year potential of this year’s bill. Radtke’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information. That makes it Half True.

pomt-12081	"Our conservative Georgia values are under attack" ... (People) are "calling for the removal of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson statues."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2017/aug/30/brian-kemp/calls-take-down-washington-and-jefferson-statues/	With the debate over Confederate statues roiling the country, Georgia Republican gubernatorial candidate Brian Kemp suggested a similar controversy is brewing over the founding fathers. "You've seen it in the news — the radical left in our country, stinging from their 2016 election losses, has become increasingly desperate and unhinged," he wrote in an Aug. 23 fundraising email. "They want nothing more than to push their snowflake agenda on the entire nation, and our conservative Georgia values are under attack like never before. Now they're even calling for the removal of George Washington and Thomas Jefferson statues in the name of political correctness! Friend, I know you agree we can't allow the radical left to win in Georgia and force their liberal agenda down our throats." For us fact-checkers, the key question is whether there is a cry to get rid of statues of Washington and Jefferson. We found that a few people have said that, but whether there’s much of a drive is less certain. Between emailing the Kemp campaign and our own searches, we came up with some key instances. The clearest example came from Angela Rye, a CNN commentator and former Congressional Black Caucus director. "George Washington was a slave owner," Rye said on CNN on Aug. 17. "We need to call slave owners out for what they are. Whether we think they were protecting American freedom or not. He wasn’t protecting my freedom. I wasn’t someone — my ancestors weren’t deemed human beings to him. To me, I don’t care if it’s a George Washington statue or a Thomas Jefferson statue or a Robert E. Lee statue, they all need to come down." An equally clear call for taking down a statue of Washington came from James Dukes, pastor of Liberation Christian Center in Chicago. After President Donald Trump asked rhetorically if statues of Washington and Jefferson were next on the list for removal after Confederate leaders, Dukes took up the idea. He asked Mayor Rahm Emanuel to take down an equestrian statue of George Washington in the city’s South Side and rename the park where it stands. "It represents on one hand, a hero to some, a forefather, a revolutionary," Dukes said Aug. 16. "But then for us of African-American descent, it represents a person who owned 317 slaves." The prominent civil rights activist Al Sharpton also entered the fray, but the circumstances left it unclear whether this is something he might pursue further. Sharpton appeared on PBS’ Charlie Rose to talk about the violence in Charlottesville, Va. Rose asked Sharpton if the Jefferson Memorial should be taken down. "My great-grandfather was a slave owned by the family that Strom Thurmond was one of them," Sharpton said Aug. 14. "So this is personal. This is not some kind of removed discussion for us. Our families were victims of this. Certainly, it ought to be removed." But Sharpton then continued, saying he didn’t want his tax dollars going to maintain a building that honors a man with "that kind of background." He said there are private museums for that. That left open the option to keep the memorial in place and fund it privately. As far as we can tell, Sharpton has not brought up the issue again. Ambiguous examples There are instances where people expressed dismay at the slave-owning pasts of Washington and Jefferson, but they didn’t call for removing statues. We mention them because some have put them in the same bucket as the previous examples. Wilbert Cooper, a senior editor at the news service Vice, wrote Aug. 17 that if there were ever a serious push to to blow up Mount Rushmore, "I suspect I'd be onboard." "As long as we allow those men to be cults of personality who exist beyond reproach, we're never going to be able to see them for all of their good and all of their evil," Cooper wrote. A number of University of Virginia student organizations issued a list of demands to keep the history of slavery front and center on campus. The list included that "the statue of Jefferson serves as an emblem of white supremacy and should be re-contextualized with a plaque to include that history." At some point over the weekend of Aug. 19, the Jefferson statue on the University of Virginia campus was splashed with red paint. Measuring a movement We have two clear cases of African-Americans saying statues of Washington should come down, and one case involving the Jefferson Memorial. For context, we compared this to the interest in removing Confederate statues. As an approximate measure, we turned to the Nexis database of articles in major newspapers. Between Aug. 11 and Aug. 22 (the day before Kemp’s email), there were 2,113 articles that mentioned removing Confederate statues, but made no mention of George Washington or Thomas Jefferson. In the same period, 183 articles mentioned removing Washington or Jefferson statues. This included Trump’s own reference to people seeking to take down those statues. Roughly speaking, the removal of Confederate statues is at least 11 times more commonly mentioned than taking down statues of Washington or Jefferson. Our ruling Kemp said there are calls for the removal of statues of Washington and Jefferson. We found two instances where two people unambiguously called for those statues to come down, plus another instance where an interviewer’s question elicited a mixed reply that included the words "certainly it ought to be removed." Beyond those examples, there is scant evidence of a broader movement to take down statues of Washington and Jefferson, especially not along the lines of the push against Confederate monuments. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-13133	"Richard Burr voted to protect tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas but voted against a tax break to help working people."	half-true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/nov/02/deborah-ross/did-richard-burr-vote-protect-tax-breaks-companies/	An ad from Deborah Ross, the North Carolina Democrat running against Republican Sen. Richard Burr, paints Burr as a politician beholden to corporate interests. The ad, which first hit the airwaves in mid-October, features a young ex-Marine named Zach. "He came back from Afghanistan and came home to a job as an electrician," the ad says. "But every year, his paycheck doesn’t go as far. He just wants some economic security. Richard Burr voted to protect tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas but voted against a tax break to help working people like Zach. Folks, that’s just wrong. Those aren’t our values." We wanted to find out whether Ross was right that "Richard Burr voted to protect tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas but voted against a tax break to help working people." It’s a frequent refrain of Ross’ campaign, and outside this ad she has repeated the claim in June, in September and at other times on the campaign trail. It’s also a line of attack other Democratic politicians across the country have used before – ranging from Barack Obama, in his 2014 State of the Union address, to a failed Senate candidate in Kentucky. But there’s a major caveat: Variations on this claim have received rulings like Mostly False or Half True on our Truth-O-Meter, depending on the way it was phrased. Given that the Ross-Burr race is one of the closest in the country, and North Carolina has been particularly hard-hit by the outsourcing of factory jobs, we decided to take a look at how much truth there was to Ross’ claim. Ross' ad is talking about a bill called the "Bring Jobs Home Act," which Senate Democrats tried to pass in 2012 and 2014. It failed both years due to opposition from Republicans, and both years Burr did vote against it. Burr also joined his fellow Republicans in voting against a 2010 bill that had similar provisions, called the "Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act." The goal of the bills There is no tax break for companies that move overseas, so the claim is slightly misleading on that account. There are tax breaks, however, for any U.S. company that relocates – whether it’s to the other side of town or the other side of the world. The bills that Burr voted against would have created a new tax incentive for companies that moved jobs back to the United States from overseas. They also would have exempted overseas moves from the types of relocation that can receive tax breaks. So the claim itself has the facts of the bill basically right, although it leaves room for people to get the wrong impression. The money angle Tax experts have repeatedly told PolitiFact that the bills were almost entirely symbolic. That’s because the punishments or rewards companies might have received would’ve been insignificant – not nearly large enough to change their behavior and either bring jobs back or stop jobs from leaving. An analysis by Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation showed the U.S. government would have lost $214 million between 2015 and 2024 if the 2014 version of the bill had passed. But for the sake of not trying to look into the future, let’s just take a look at the 2015 estimates. Companies that outsourced in 2015 would have lost $9 million that year if the bill had passed, the committee found. Meanwhile, companies that insourced would’ve received $19 million in tax breaks. Those numbers are minuscule. Corporations were expected to pay $341.7 billion in income taxes in 2015, according to the Tax Policy Center, a branch of the left-of-center Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. The $9 million in extra payments represents 0.0026 percent of the total corporate income taxes. That’s a quarter of a hundredth of 1 percent. The $19 million in savings isn’t much more significant, representing 0.0056 percent of the total. Wouldn't have changed corporate strategies Tax experts have previously opined, looking at similar numbers, that the bill simply would not have done enough to persuade any major company to change its business plan. "It adds up to a trivial amount of money," James Hines, a professor of law and economics at the University of Michigan, told PolitiFact for a 2014 fact check. "Given how many big multinational firms we have, it’s impossible that it has any effect on their behavior." Howard Gleckman, a researcher at the Tax Policy Center, agreed. "For many multinationals, the credit would be largely meaningless," he wrote. "Those firms already pay close to a zero U.S. tax rate thanks to their ability to shift income to low-tax countries. With their U.S. tax liability already low, the credit would do almost nothing to encourage them to shift operations to the U.S." Our ruling Ross said that Burr "voted to protect tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas but voted against a tax break to help working people." PolitiFact has docked points on several versions of this same claim in the past, in large part because it oversimplifies the bills in question and doesn’t account for the fact that experts don’t think the bills would have done anything to keep jobs in the United States, or bring them back, had the changes become law. Burr did vote against the bills in question – inconsequential though they might have been – so there is a sliver of truth here. But the reality of the situation isn’t nearly so cut-and-dried as Ross describes it.

pomt-02076	In 2007, Ed Gillespie "was paid $300,000 to be the frontman for a coalition that made the individual mandate the centerpiece of its health reform plan."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2014/may/23/democratic-party-virginia/virginia-democrats-say-gillespie-was-paid-300000-l/	When money was offered, Democrats say Republican U.S. Senate candidate Ed Gillespie was pleased to support an individual mandate that all Americans have health insurance. "In 2007, he (Gillespie) was paid $300,000 to be the frontman for a coalition that made the individual mandate the centerpiece of its health reform plan," the Democratic Party of Virginia said earlier this spring in a news release. "However, just last week, Gillespie’s campaign reversed course and claimed that he ‘consistently opposed the mandates.’" Gillespie, a former lobbyist, is the overwhelming favorite to win the Virginia GOP’s nomination for the U.S. Senate at a state convention next month and oppose Democrat incumbent Mark Warner this fall. Despite some unclear statements and writings in the past, Gillespie repeatedly has said this year that he’s always been opposed to an individual mandate -- the central provision of the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. So we decided to examine the Democrats’ claim that Gillespie was paid $300,000 to seek just such a law. Ashley Bauman, spokeswoman for state Democrats, pointed us to news releases, op-eds and media coverage detailing Gillespie’s involvement with the Coalition to Advance Health Care Reform -- a group of large businesses that formed in early 2007 to find ways of curbing health costs and get more people insured. The coalition’s website listed guiding principles to overhaul the nation’s health care laws. It called for a "market-based health care system" that provided financial incentives for people to adopt healthy behaviors and assistance so low-income people would get routine care outside of emergency rooms. But the tenet Democrats’ zero in on is the group’s call for "universal coverage with individual responsibility." "Public policy has long mandated that care be provided when needed. We believe this policy should be balanced with a requirement that individuals carry health insurance regardless of their employment status," the group wrote. "All Americans should have access to affordable quality healthcare services, with no exclusions for pre-existing conditions. The market should drive these policies with the government, businesses and individuals sharing responsibility to ensure affordable health coverage is achieved." Leading the coalition was Steve Burd, then CEO of the Safeway grocery chain. He announced the formation in a May 6, 2007 op-ed in The Washington Times, writing "every American should be required to carry health insurance." The next day, the group announced it had brought in "nationally-recognized professionals," to "manage the organization." The two mentioned by name were Gillespie and his lobbying partner, Jack Quinn, a Democrat who had been chief of staff in the mid 1990s to then Vice President Al Gore. Reports filed in the U.S. Senate show Gillespie registered as a lobbyist for the coalition during the first half of 2007. Bauman pointed us to data on the Center for Responsive Politics’ website showing that the coalition in 2007 paid $300,000 to Quinn Gillespie & Associates, a firm that was founded in 2000. Gillespie’s activities Gillespie’s ties to the coalition trace back several months before the its formation was announced. Federal lobbying records show that Quinn Gillespie & Associates registered to represent the coalition on March 1, 2007. The firm listed 16 employees, including Gillespie, as lobbyists for the health care group. Paul Logan, spokesman for Gillespie’s campaign, said his boss never advocated for the mandate and was listed as lobbyist out of an abundance of caution. "It was the practice at QGA to register even if you were not lobbying lawmakers on behalf of a client," he emailed. "There is a penalty for not registering to lobby and doing lobbying work, but no penalty for registering and not lobbying." Logan gave us a letter Burd wrote to the Gillespie on March 24, 2014 to rebut attacks that the Republican lobbied for the requirement. "Your counsel with CAHR was very clear. To establish a set of core principles at a high level to attract a broad coalition and to stay away from any support for an individual mandate," Burd wrote. "As I recall, you were personally opposed to the idea of an individual mandate and encouraged the coalition to stay with market-based principles to guide its work. At no time did you advocate or lobby for an individual mandate on behalf of CAHR." Burd added, "in fact you never attended any meetings the coalition had with elected leaders and you left Quinn Gillespie and Associates within a month of the coalition being formed, well before CAHR began to actively engage in the policy debate." Gillespie did leave his lobbying firm -- about six weeks after his affiliation with coalition was announced -- to start work as an adviser to President George W. Bush on June 26, 2007. Before leaving, Gillespie promoted the coalition’s broad health care agenda during a May 8 radio interview on WBUR in Boston. He was never specifically asked about an individual mandate. But he did say, "it’s important to emphasize what this coalition is advocating, which is getting people in through individual responsibility and not a mandate -- a government-imposed dictate -- on small businesses." The payments Logan said Gillespie did not receive the $300,000 from the coalition but would not provide other compensation figures. Lobbying records show the coalition paid that amount to Gillespie’s firm -- not Gillespie personally -- in 2007. Burd, in an interview, told us he recalls meeting once with Gillespie while forming the coalition, on March 15, 2007. During that session, Burd said Gillespie gave advice on how to organize and rally support for the group. "There’s not a chance in the world that we would have paid him $300,000 for one meeting," he said. Biannual lobbying records show the coalition paid the Quinn Gillespie $120,000 during the first half of 2007, when Gillespie was still with the firm. Most of the money the coalition paid to the firm in 2007 -- about $180,000 -- was remitted in the second half of the year. A year-end lobbying report covering that span did not list Gillespie as a lobbyist. Logan said Gillespie severed all ties with his firm when he became a presidential adviser. So about 60 percent of the coalition’s $300,000 payment was made during the six months after Gillespie left the firm. With this information, we contacted Bauman again and asked for proof of the Democrat’s claim that Gillespie received all of the money. "We have frequently referred to Gillespie’s firm making more than $300,000, through its work on behalf of CAHR, " she emailed. "In this instance, we should have been clearer, but we stand by the fact that the firm he founded, QGA (Quinn Gillespie & Associates), was paid $300,000 to lobby on behalf of a group that supported the individual mandate." We should note that Democrats have said at least two other times this year that Gillespie -- not his company -- was paid $300,000 by the coalition. Prior to leaving the firm, Gillespie received a $4.8 million payout based on a 2004 sale of his lobbying company, according to a disclosure form he filed upon entering the White House detailing his finances during the previous 18 months. Logan said that amount was "scheduled and paid long before Ed agreed to go to the White House." "Ed severed all ties to QGA when he went to work at the White House and did not receive any compensation or distributive share from them after he left," Logan said. Our ruling The state Democratic Party said Gillespie was paid $300,000 "to be the frontman for a coalition that made the individual mandate the centerpiece of its health reform plan." This, Democrats said, belies Gillespie’s assertion that he’s always opposed mandatory health coverage. There’s no doubt Gillespie was a key adviser to the coalition, as was his business partner. His role was prominently noted in a news release announcing formation of the group, and he spoke on behalf of the group in a radio interview. The group supported an individual mandate, although there’s a bit of hyperbole in the Democrats’ contention it was the ‘centerpiece’ of their agenda. The top item listed on the coalition’s "core principles" was bringing market-based efficiency and price transparency to health care. The founder of the coalition says Gillespie privately voiced opposition to a mandate, urged the pursuit of other reforms and never attended the coalition's meetings with politicians. Records show Gillespie’s lobbying firm -- not Gillespie, himself -- was paid $300,000 by the health care coalition in 2007. Gillespie left the firm that June. During the first half of 2007, Gillespie was among 16 people at his firm registered as lobbyists for the coalition. The bulk of the payments came in the second half of 2007, after Gillespie departed. When we pointed this out to the Democratic Party, a spokeswoman backed away from its improbable claim the Gillespie received all the fees paid to his firm. Gillespie’s campaign denies he was paid $300,000, but would not say how much he did pocket. So bits of truth in the Democrats’ statement are tarnished with exaggeration and create an unsupportable story that Gillespie, when the money was right, led a lobbying effort for an individual mandate. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Democratic Party of Virginia	None	None	None	2014-05-23T06:00:00	2014-03-26	['Ed_Gillespie']

pomt-09097	Bill McCollum "served as a lobbyist whose clients enabled mortgages for illegal immigrants."	false	/florida/statements/2010/jun/23/rick-scott/scott-says-mccollum-lobbied-clients-who-paved-way-/	Republican rivals for governor, Attorney General Bill McCollum and Rick Scott, have accused each other of being too helpful toward illegal immigrants -- a hot topic in the wake of the Arizona immigration law. Their campaigns sent dueling press releases June 15 and 16, 2010, trying to portray their opponent's business practices as being too friendly to illegal immigrants. The Republicans' positions on illegal immigration will be key for primary voters. If elected, Scott has promised to bring an Arizona-style law to Florida -- a law that requires police officers who have made lawful stops to check an individual's immigration status. PolitiFact gave McCollum a full-flop for sending mixed signals on the law -- first opposing the original version, then stating he supported it after Arizona amended it to prohibit racial profiling, but then stating Florida doesn't need such a law. They are now arguing about whose past business practices benefitted illegal immigrants. McCollum sent these fighting words in a press release June 15, 2010: “In just the latest case of hypocrisy, it was revealed today that Rick Scott has heavily invested in a company that is geared to helping illegal aliens transfer money to family and friends out of the country. ... Rick Scott says he wants to crack down on illegal immigration, but now we find out he has been profiting from illegal immigrants." We rated that statement True. The following day, June 16, 2010, Scott's campaign issued a press release about McCollum which stated: "Bill McCollum jumped his sinking ship of a campaign today and fled to Washington, D.C., where he served as a lobbyist whose clients enabled mortgages for illegal immigrants.'' ("Fled to Washington, D.C." refers to a day of meetings McCollum had June 16 with a tax reform group and national conservative leaders, said his spokeswoman Kristy Campbell.) In this Truth-O-Meter item, we explore whether McCollum "served as a lobbyist whose clients enabled mortgages for illegal immigrants." The Scott campaign's press release focuses on three groups that it says McCollum lobbied for: the financial company Citigroup, a non-profit called AmeriDream Charity, and the Mortgage Bankers Association, the organization that represents the industry. Scott's campaign sent us McCollum's lobbyist registrations showing he registered to lobby federal offices for AmeriDream in 2002 and 2003, CitiGroup in 2002 and Mortgage Bankers Association of America in 2001. McCollum lobbied after he left Congress in 2001. Even though no federal laws prohibit making mortgages to illegal immigrants, we doubt any financial firm or organization, in today’s political climate, will acknowledge they offer or have offered loans to illegal immigrants. But many newspaper reports across the country in the past decade have described illegal immigrants who hold home mortgages. Some likely obtained mortgages from institutions that didn’t ask about immigration status, or winked. And certainly, lenders are occasionally duped by mortgage fraud committed by U.S. citizens and immigrants alike. The question here, though, is whether McCollum’s clients enabled those loans while he lobbied for them? We took "enable" to mean that the companies allowed illegal immigrants to obtain mortgages. We started with the sources Scott's campaign cited in its press release but first did some background on Individual Taxpayer Identification Numbers, or ITINs, which have been used by legal and illegal immigrants as a form of ID. The IRS started issuing ITINs in 1996 to provide a method to process tax returns and payments for those not eligible for Social Security numbers, including non-resident aliens. The IRS says ITINs are not intended for other uses. But by 2002, several major banking chains in the U.S. -- including Citibank – were accepting ITINs to allow customers to open bank accounts because they wanted to tap into the growing Hispanic immigrant market. That paved the way for some banks to offer mortgages through ITINs. Mark Rodgers, a Citigroup vice president who wrote an article in the online newsletter of the Comptroller of the Currency in the fall of 2004, touted the firm’s efforts in 2003 to offer bank accounts and money transfers, or remittances to Hispanics. We asked him whether his company provided mortgages to illegal immigrants in 2002. He explained in an e-mail that Citigroup accepted ITINs from mortgage applicants, and approved loans for "applicants with proper identification, who meet our loan requirements and who have filed appropriate tax documents with the U.S. tax authorities, which we have verified.” He emphasized every applicant had to meet the requirements, but did not respond to a follow-up question on when Citigroup began the ITIN program. However, newspaper articles in The Palm Beach Post and Houston Chronicle in 2005 showed illegal immigrants held Citibank mortgages at least by 2004. McCollum lobbied for Citigroup only in 2002. According to a March 18, 2002, article in Business Wire, Citibank also said it would begin accepting Mexican Consular IDs as identification for Mexican immigrants living in the U.S. to open bank accounts. The card, known as a Matricula Consular, identifies the holder as a Mexican national. But that article does not specifically mention mortgages. Next we looked at Scott's claim about AmeriDream. AmeriDream distributed a press release Feb. 7, 2005, announcing it would accept ITINs to help immigrants buy homes, citing “an increasing number of private lenders throughout the country that have begun ITIN loan and mortgage insurance programs.” But by 2005, McCollum was no longer lobbying for AmeriDream. Federal lobbyist registration records show he lobbied for the company in 2002 and 2003. The Scott campaign also cited a Sept. 18, 2007, Boston Globe article about illegal immigrants buying homes, which quoted a representative from the Mortgage Bankers Association. "It's not our bank members' job to determine immigration policy," said Corey Carlisle, senior director of government affairs at the Mortgage Bankers Association, a national organization representing more than 3,000 companies. "But ... they don't want to make a loan to somebody that's not going to be able to repay it." McCollum was registered to lobby this organization in 2001. So we asked an association spokesman what its policy was in 2001 regarding illegal immigrants obtaining mortgages. John Mechem replied in an e-mail that MBA complies with all applicable state and federal laws. He added that McCollum lobbied on efforts related to the Federal Housing Administration’s multifamily (rental housing) programs, not on mortgages for immigrants. Scott spokeswoman Jennifer Baker, however, insists that since the MBA represents lenders who give mortgages to illegal aliens, McCollum in effect "enabled" the mortgages through his MBA lobbying. We asked the McCollum campaign for a response to Scott's claim. Campbell, McCollum’s spokeswoman, said in an e-mail "Bill McCollum never advocated to give mortgages to illegal immigrants." She said he lobbied on tax issues -- not housing issues -- for CitiGroup, and MBA told us that he lobbied on issues related to a rental housing program. But the Scott campaign didn't claim that McCollum lobbied to give mortgages to illegal immigrants -- only that his clients "enabled" those mortgages. So where does that leave us? To recap, McCollum lobbied for the Mortgage Bankers Association in 2001, but that is a trade association that represents lenders and doesn't issue mortgages directly. Representing bankers doesn't "enable" mortgages. McCollum lobbied for Citigroup in 2002. That company started accepting the Mexican consular ID in 2002, but news articles didn't start mentioning Citi providing mortgages to customers with the ITIN identification until 2004. He lobbied for AmeriDream in 2002 and 2003, and AmeriDream didn't announce it would start accepting ITINs until 2005. There are numerous reports in the past decade that illegal immigrants have been able to obtain mortgages through the consular cards or ITINs, but there are no specific examples we could find or Scott could provide that McCollum's three clients did so when he was their lobbyist. We rate this claim False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2010-06-23T11:46:59	2010-06-16	['None']

pomt-12049	"No court has held (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) unconstitutional."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/11/eric-schneiderman/has-daca-been-ruled-unconstitutional/	New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is leading a lawsuit against the Trump administration over its decision to rescind a deferred deportation program, claiming the move is discriminatory and that the program itself has not been ruled unconstitutional. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced Sept. 5 the end for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA), an Obama-era program that protected from deportation immigrants who came to the United States as children and live here illegally. The lawsuit from Schneiderman and 15 other attorneys general contends the administration’s action discriminates against Mexican immigrants, who account for 78 percent of DACA recipients. Trump since his campaigning days "has flagrantly displayed an anti-Latino, particularly anti-Mexican discriminatory animus," Schneiderman said on MSNBC’s The Rachel Maddow Show. "This is a massively successful program. There is no good reason to shut it down. There's no legitimate reason to shut it down. No court has held it unconstitutional," Schneiderman said Sept. 6. We’ve heard lots of competing claims from lawmakers, pundits and others that walk the line between fact and opinion regarding the constitutionality of DACA. Schneiderman’s claim is clearly stated as a fact. We found that he is right: DACA’s constitutionality has not been determined by courts. DACA created by 2012 DHS memo DACA is based on a June 2012 memorandum issued by Janet Napolitano, then-Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security. Napolitano’s memo outlined prosecutorial discretion so that resources would be used to remove immigrants who met the department’s priorities and protect from deportation young immigrants who met specific criteria. Napolitano said immigration laws were "not designed to be blindly enforced" without considering individual cases and circumstances. "Nor are they designed to remove productive young people to countries where they may not have lived or even speak the language. Indeed, many of these young people have already contributed to our country in significant ways. Prosecutorial discretion, which is used in so many other areas, is especially justified here," Napolitano wrote. DACA is a policy, but it is not a law. It also does not grant legal immigration status to the approximately 800,000 people who were approved for the program. Many have argued that creating DACA through the executive brach, rather than through the legislative process is an overreach of executive power. No court ruling on constitutionality of DACA There’s debate among experts on whether DACA is constitutional or not, but there is agreement that a court ruling on the constitutionality of the program has not been issued. "There has been no court decision holding that DACA itself is unconstitutional," Anil Kalhan, an associate professor of law at Drexel University. A lawsuit to challenge the 2012 DACA was dismissed for lack of standing, and that decision was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, Kalhan said. "So there was never any adjudication on the merits," he said. "To my knowledge, no court has ruled DACA 2012 as unconstitutional and the one to even reach the court was dismissed on jurisdictional grounds," concurred Shoba Sivaprasad Wadhia, a law professor and director of the Center for Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at Pennsylvania State University. Wadhia and more than 100 other immigration law professors and scholars wrote a letter to Trump providing legal analysis on the executive branch’s legal authority to implement DACA. Other experts from the University of California also told us courts have not stricken down DACA as unconstitutional. "It's a straightforward fact that no court has declared DACA unconstitutional and that the one appellate court that considered a related program declined to address the issue," said Amy Spitalnick, spokeswoman for Schneiderman. Texas and 25 other states won a lawsuit against the Obama administration by having a federal district judge block the implementation of an expanded version of the 2012 DACA and of another deportation reprieve program, Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). An appeals court upheld the ruling, and in 2016 the Supreme Court ruled 4-4 on the case, leaving in place the lower court's ruling. But when those programs were temporarily enjoined by the district court in Texas, it was not on constitutional grounds, Kalhan said, "but rather based on a conclusion that Obama administration should have instituted the policy using notice and comment rule-making, rather than using the more informal guidance document that it issued." A final, binding precedent even on that basis was not set either, since it was only a preliminary injunction and the Supreme Court deadlocked, Kalhan said. "And even then, some aspects of DAPA and the DACA expansion may be different from DACA in relevant ways that bear on legality—it has never been fully established the two programs stand on identical legal footing," Kalhan said. Our ruling Schneiderman said, "No court has held (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) unconstitutional." While there is debate on the constitutionality of DACA, that has not been determined by courts. We rate Schneiderman’s statement True.

pomt-14407	Says the man who rushed the stage at him in Dayton, Ohio, "had chatter about ISIS, or with ISIS" in his social media posts.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/13/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-links-campaign-event-proteste/	Despite evidence to the contrary, Donald Trump on Sunday morning repeated his charge that a man who rushed at him in Dayton, Ohio, had ISIS affiliations. The March 12 incident at a Trump rally at the Dayton airport involved Thomas DiMassimo, 22. According to police, DiMassimo jumped a barrier and rushed the stage where Trump was speaking. Secret Service agents tackled him and took him into custody. DiMassimo was charged with inducing panic and disorderly conduct and was released from Montgomery County Jail later the same day. HELP US RAISE $15,000 TO HIRE AN EXTRA FACT-CHECKER On NBC’s Meet the Press, host Chuck Todd noted that after the Dayton rally, Trump tweeted a video that purportedly showed DiMassimo posing with a gun against the backdrop of an ISIS flag, with Arabic-language music playing in the background. Trump’s tweet said, "USSS (U.S. Secret Service) did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage. He has ties to ISIS. Should be in jail." The link to the video was appended to the tweet. On Meet the Press, Todd said, "That turned out to be a hoax. Did you go over the top there on that?" Trump responded, "No, no, no, no. He was, if you look on the Internet, if you look at clips…" Todd repeated, "It turned out to be a hoax. Somebody made that up, sir." Trump then said, "Well, I don't know what they made up. All I can do is play what's there. He was walking, dragging the American flag on the ground. Is that a correct statement? Was that a hoax, too? Was he dragging the flag on the ground?" After further back and forth, Trump said, "No, excuse me, you didn't see the clip. He was playing Arabic music, he was dragging the flag along the ground, and he had Internet chatter with ISIS and about ISIS. So I don't know if he was or not. But all we did was put out what he had on his Internet. … (He) had chatter about ISIS, or with ISIS." When Todd repeated that the video appeared to be a hoax, Trump responded, "Okay, look, well, was it a hoax that he's dragging the flag? Was that him? It looked like the same man to me. He was dragging a flag along the ground and he was playing a certain type of music. And supposedly, there was chatter about ISIS. Now, I don't know. What do I know about it? All I know is what's on the Internet." We decided to take a closer look at whether DiMassimo "had chatter about ISIS, or with ISIS" on his social media posts. (Trump’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) The online trail DiMassimo, who could not be reached for comment, has a long history of anti-racist activism, often with a confrontational bent. For instance, he was apparently filmed on Aug. 12, 2015, destroying a Confederate battle flag at a protest at Stone Mountain, Ga. As it turns out, there is a similar video to the one Trump tweeted that apparently involves DiMassimo -- but it doesn’t show anything related to ISIS. The video, uploaded by YouTube user "Tommy DiMassimo," shows a man who appears to be DiMassimo taking part in a protest at Wright State University, where he is reportedly a student, in April 2015. The video shows him dragging a United States flag behind him, and ultimately standing on it. Trump, in the Meet the Press interview, seems to be correct that genuine video exists of DiMassimo dragging the U.S. flag. And we expect that Trump won’t be the only American disturbed by such images. However, that’s not the same thing as DiMassimo being linked to ISIS. Trump’s tweet made the connection based on an edited version of the video DiMassimo originally uploaded. Unlike DiMassimo’s original uploaded video, the one Trump linked to includes an image of DiMassimo armed and in front of the ISIS flag, as well as Arabic-language music. (The post also fails to capitalize the first "M" in DiMassimo’s last name.) The version Trump linked to also includes Arabic text in the description, but according to BuzzFeed, "the Arabic is badly garbled, but appears to say ‘Tommy D’ was trying to look ‘cool’ and as if he has big balls for standing on an American flag." BuzzFeed tracked the video with the ISIS imagery to a May 2015 upload by someone named Thomas Jenners, whose account has since been deleted. It also found a Facebook page called "Tommy dimassimo wasn’t hugged enough as a kid" that was dedicated to trolling DiMassimo, including ISIS-related jabs. Here’s one: Put it all together, and all signs point to the video Trump tweeted being either a hoax or an effort to troll DiMassimo. When we contacted Andrew Kaczynski, BuzzFeed’s specialist in debunking Internet hoaxes, he said his conclusion is that "there's nothing linking him to ISIS." The law-enforcement angle Further supporting the hoax theory of the ISIS video is that the criminal justice system has not treated DiMassimo as an ISIS-linked or ISIS-inspired terrorist -- even though the high-profile incident and the involvement of the Secret Service would have made such a linkage, if it were real, an urgent issue of national security. The fact that DiMassimo was released within hours of the incident is something that would be almost inconceivable if he had truly been a terrorist linked to ISIS, said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a terrorism expert at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. "If the guy had actually made an ISIS video while doing his activism, then the feds would have certainly come across it," Gartenstein-Ross said. "And then there would be a number of things he could be charged with, such as material support for terrorism. There would certainly be an argument that he poses a threat to the community for his pro-ISIS ties, which means they could have detained him pending trial." The police report of the incident, obtained by the Dayton Daily News and shared with PolitiFact, says DiMassimo told police that he intended to take Trump’s microphone and yell, "Donald Trump is a racist." The report makes no mention of ISIS or Islamic terrorism. Our ruling Trump said Thomas DiMassimo, the man who rushed at him in Dayton, Ohio, "had chatter about ISIS, or with ISIS" in his social media posts. There is lots to offend people on DiMassimo’s social media posts. But there doesn’t appear to be any legitimate connection between DiMassimo and ISIS. The link Trump tweeted was a hoax or an effort to troll DiMassimo. It’s also unlikely that someone who really had ISIS ties and who had been arrested for threatening a presidential candidate on live television would be quickly released from custody pending trial. The police report of his arrest makes no mention of ISIS or Islamic terrorism. We rate the claim False. UPDATE, March 14, 2016: In an interview with CNN on March 13, DiMassimo "vehemently denied belonging to ISIS. He told CNN the video was doctored and provided a link to what he said was the original footage from a protest he participated in more than a year ago."

pomt-08450	"Amendment 4 will reduce Florida’s economic output by $34 billion annually."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2010/oct/15/citizens-lower-taxes-and-stronger-economy/study-claims-amendment-4-will-cause-34-billion-imp/	When Florida voters head to the polls on Nov. 2, 2010, aside from casting votes for public office, they’ll also have six state constitutional amendments to mull over. One of the proposals up for a vote, Amendment 4, aims to put land use changes before local voters, and has sparked heated debate. Supporters argue the measure will give more power to local residents by allowing them to make decisions regarding development plans in their communities. Currently, those decisions are handled by an elected or appointed board such as a county commission or a local planning board. Opponents argue Amendment 4 will stall existing projects and drive away prospective developers from investing money in Florida. One of those claims of stalled economic growth comes from the "No on 4!" website. The website, sponsored by opposing group Citizens for Lower Taxes and a Stronger Economy, Inc., quotes a January 2010 study by the Washington Economics Group which states: "Amendment 4 will reduce Florida's economic output by $34 billion annually." In a state hurting for tax dollars, $34 billion is a large figure to toss around, so we decided to take a closer look at that claim. Aside from reaching out to the Washington Economics Group to determine how they arrived at the figure, we also received a counter-study by Hometown Democracy, the group backing Amendment 4. We also contacted economists at the University of Central Florida, Florida State University, University of Miami and the University of Florida. But before getting into all the numbers, data and theories, first a quick primer on Amendment 4. Amendment 4 was placed on the November ballot after Hometown Democracy was able to collect 676,811 petition signatures statewide, more than the state requirement to get a constitutional amendment on the ballot. The proposal is summarized as follows on the election ballot: "Establishes that before a local government may adopt a new comprehensive land use plan, or amend a comprehensive land use plan, the proposed plan or amendment shall be subject to vote of the electors of the local government by referendum, following preparation by the local planning agency, consideration by the governing body and notice." Essentially the proposal would allow voters to decide on changes to local land use plans, rather than having the decision rest in the hands of city councils or an appointed local planning agency. So now that you're an expert on the 1-2-3's of Amendment 4, back to the study in question. Washington Economics Group Study The Washington Economics Group is a private consulting firm whose principal adviser is Tony Villamil. Villamil served as U.S. undersecretary of commerce for economic affairs, under the George H.W. Bush administration, and is dean of St. Thomas University's School of Business in South Florida. "It impacts the ability to generate development, expand operations, the ability to attract new companies coming into the state if they're not part of prior growth plans," Villamil said in a phone interview regarding Amendment 4 and his study. The WEG study used computer software called IMPLAN to simulate two outcomes. A "modest outcome" where only 10 percent of new real estate developments would require a referendum to amend comprehensive growth plans, and what the researchers call the "most likely scenario," where 25 percent of new real estate expansion will require a referendum. It's under the 25 percent scenario that the WEG report contends that Florida will suffer from $34 billion less in economic output. The study argues that 125,616 jobs (or approximately 25 percent of the workforce in the development industry) are "directly endangered." Hometown Democracy Counter-Study Hometown Democracy, the group pushing for Amendment 4, commissioned its own study to refute the claims made in the WEG study. The group hired Braun & Soskin Economic Consulting, run by two University of Central Florida economists. While we took both studies with a grain of salt, we felt it was important to include the questions and concerns raised by the counter-study. Braun & Soskin contend that the WEG model did not reflect any "positive outcomes" in the study. "The WEG report admits that much of the adverse effect of the amendment 'will be on large scale commercial and residential developments….' " the counter-study notes. "These are the projects that contribute the most to sprawl, urban flight and blight in abandoned downtown areas. The benefits from halting sprawl and blight -- unlike the 'costs' from Amendment 4 are measurable: the saving from holding down crime, commuting times, and public service costs (and taxes to pay for them) to fund sprawling public transportation, EMT, policing, trash pickup and fire protection districts...If Amendment 4 saves Florida these costs, those benefits should be counted in any impact study." "WEG makes an untenable assumption that all referenda get rejected by voters," Braun & Soskin wrote. "WEG assumes that all construction jobs are for residential and commercial and none for institutional, industrial, transport infrastructure, extractive and other construction." What do the experts have to say? Since both studies come from groups with vested interests, we turned to economists at the University of Florida, University of Miami and University of Central Florida to help us make sense of all the numbers and theories. Dr. Christopher Cotton is a professor with UM’s School of Business, who specializes in political economics and experimental economics. Prior to becoming a professor, he worked as a consultant conducting economic impact studies. He has not written or advocated on Amendment 4 in this election. Cotton was critical of the WEG study, saying: "I see absolutely no reason to believe the findings of the Washington Economics Group report." He explained in an e-mail: "My biggest criticism is that the report ignores alternative uses of resources and potential benefits. Think about an investor who wants to build a new hotel, but due to Amendment 4 cannot get the rezoning he needs for the project. The report assumes that the investor does nothing with the money that he wanted to use to build the hotel. In reality, he may choose to remodel a run-down hotel instead, or complete another project where zoning is feasible. In reality, he does invest in something else, and this something else will also have economic benefit. This is ignored by the report." Dr. Sean Snaith is an economist with the University of Central Florida, and while Snaith penned an op-ed piece for the Sarasota Herald Tribune speaking against Amendment 4, he also expressed hesitation that specific numbers on the financial impact could be reached at this point. "I think you open up a can of worms," Snaith said in a phone interview. "There are still too many questions up in the air. How is this going to be carried out? In terms of legal battles what will be the time frame? How many more projects will go through? How many less? I don't think we know. You're asking how people are going to behave in terms of voting, and you can't assume that the majority of projects will be rejected. It might be the most environmentally egregious project, but the developers could spend the most money in marketing their project and win the vote. You just never know." Dr. David Denslow is a professor at the University of Florida and an economics researcher for the school's Bureau of Economic and Business Research. He too has voiced his opposition to Amendment 4. He said the WEG study is reasonable but far from a certainty. His point: "We don't know for sure how voters will react, how the legislature will react, how developers will react. Nor do we know for sure what Florida's growth path would be without Amendment 4, as a base. Adding to the uncertainty is the current truly unusual state of the housing market. Would Amendment 4 increase the demand for vacant houses because it'll be harder to build new ones? Or would it reduce the demand because people will think Florida will stop growing and not want to start new businesses?" As an aside, the state Financial Impact Estimating Conference also provides an evaluation of the financial impact of Amendment 4, as it does for all amendments. That evaluation looks not at the cost of lost (or gained) economic output, but at the cost to cities and counties to conduct special elections. Comprehensive plans can be amended just twice a year, and between 2001 and 2005, a statewide average of 7,878 amendments was proposed each year. The statement summarizes: "Assuming every Florida voter is impacted by a single special election, costs would range between $10 million and $20 million." If lower-cost mail-in ballots are used and special elections affected just 25 percent of the voters, the cost would still be more than $2.4 million, in the state's estimation. But in the end, the conference found the same uncertainty as the university economists: "Nevertheless, the amendment's impact on local government expenditures cannot be estimated precisely." Just another unknown cost we weighed in our consideration. Our ruling So back to the question. Will Amendment 4 reduce Florida's economic output by $34 billion annually? There are bound to be some economic impacts, but as all the economists noted, it would be premature to assume that anybody knows what that impact will be. Developers may decide not to push for projects under the new rules, if the amendment passes. Or they may propose other projects more likely to be approved. And voters may or may not approve the projects that do make the ballot. We steer clear of ruling on predictions, and that's the issue we have with the blanket statement made by "No on 4." The opponents use a scary number of $34 billion in lost economic output based on assumptions that other economists -- even two economists who also are opposed to Amendment 4 -- say aren't knowable. Everybody agrees the amendment would have some impact, but how much isn't known. Because "No on 4!" states the claim unequivocally without including the uncertainty, we rate it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04633	After hearing "the frustrations parents and teachers have with the FCAT," next year "we begin improving our testing system."	half-true	/florida/statements/2012/sep/14/rick-scott/rick-scott-touts-phase-out-fcat-tv-ad/	Before Gov. Rick Scott hit the road on his education listening tour, he went to the airwaves to toss in his own two cents about Florida’s high-stakes testing system. Scott appeared in a TV commercial paid for by the Republican Party of Florida as the school year started, touting the GOP Legislature’s roughly $1 billion increase in education funding (a year after cutting more than that amount) and his own willingness to hear criticism. His message: He’s heard the concerns about the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, and change is on the way. "I've listened to the frustrations parents and teachers have with the FCAT," Scott said. "Next year we begin improving our testing system. No more teaching to the test. It's time we get a better measure of our children's progress." So is Scott taking action to improve testing and end teaching to the test? Actually, we found new education standards and assessments were in the works before he took office. Just about every state has agreed to adopt new education standards in language arts and math known as Common Core, a bipartisan product from the National Governors Association and the Council of Chief State School Officers. Florida’s Board of Education adopted Common Core standards in summer 2010, as Scott fought through his Republican gubernatorial primary. These standards are not an effort to nationalize curriculum, though federal leaders like Education Secretary Arne Duncan like them because they are more rigorous and lend themselves to apples-to-apples comparisons for students across the states. Many states, including Florida, have received Race to the Top money for adopting these standards. To measure student comprehension of these standards, a consortium of 23 states and the Virgin Islands developed a new testing system for students from third grade through high school paid for by a $186 million Race to the Top grant. The new system is known as the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers, or PARCC for short. PARCC will gradually replace the FCAT, but that’s not Scott’s doing. Scott’s back-to-school message "was a little like the drum major who jumps in front of a parade that's already marching down Main Street," wrote Orlando Sentinel columnist Scott Maxwell in August. "It’s certainly not a reaction to parents that we’re doing this," said Mark Pudlow, a spokesman for the Florida Education Association. In the ad, Scott is vague about what changes are coming to Florida’s testing system next year. These new PARCC tests don’t fully kick in until spring 2015. What happens between then and now -- such as field-testing and piloting the new exams -- is purely transitional. Fifth and eighth graders will take a tougher version of the FCAT for science. Students will also be taking new end-of-course assessments in various subjects, including civics, U.S. history, algebra I, biology I and geometry. PARCC offers optional assessments to participating states, including a mid-year exam. While it’s possible more tests will be added over time, "it’s not likely that everything that is developed will be implemented in Florida," said Mary Jane Tappen, Florida Department of Education deputy chancellor for curriculum, instruction, and student services. Scott elaborates on the testing switch in a statement, saying he remains a "staunch advocate of student testing" and supports PARCC because the material "emphasizes analytical problem solving over memorization and simple recitation of facts." Indeed, the new tests will require students to show their work on math problems and defend their analyses of literary passages. So what has Scott done relating to the retooled assessments? Upon taking office, he recommitted Florida to these standards and "re-signed the PARCC Memorandum of Understanding," said Republican Party of Florida spokeswoman Kristen McDonald. She pointed to other examples of the state’s progression toward the new testing system under Scott, including the department training 8,000 education professionals over the summer and the state college system being the first in the country to work Common Core into its teacher-training curriculum. The new standards are already being worked in schools, Tappen said. As an aside, we wanted to address Scott’s "no more teaching to the test" rhetoric. It won’t be the last time you hear him say it, even though it’s actually been illegal for a while. Florida lawmakers made it against the law for teachers to stop regular class for FCAT prep in 2008. Still, given the stakes, some do. And starting teachers will have a portion of their pay tied to student performance in a couple of years, so the stakes are higher for them, too. A fear of teachers "teaching to the test" has not dissipated for some school advocates. Our ruling Scott’s commercial leaves viewers with the impression that changes are coming to Florida’s standardized testing system because of him. Really, Florida’s shift from FCAT toward PARCC and end-of-course exams was in the works long before he came on the political scene. Scott is affirming a movement started by Florida’s former Education Commissioner Eric Smith. We rate his claim Half True. PolitiFact Florida is partnering with 10 News for the election.

pomt-09829	"President Obama . . . wants to mandate circumcision."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/27/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-circumcision-obama-cdc/	PARENTAL ADVISORY: We don't imagine there are a lot of kids reading PolitiFact, but this item contains explicit language you don't normally see here. Parental discretion is advised. A new rap song by the hip-hop artist Jay-Z takes a shot at Rush Limbaugh. But the radio talk show host — referring to the rapper as "Mr. Z" — said he was honored to be mentioned. "Does this, Snerdley, mark a new development in my career to be singled out in a rap song by the famous rapper Jay-Z?" he said to his call screener on his Aug. 25, 2009, show. "I guess it is. As far as I know I have never been mentioned in a rap song by anybody. I guess it means I've made it. I'm now in a rap tune by the famous rapper Jay-Z. (The song says) '[T]ell Bill O'Reilly to fall back. Tell Rush Limbaugh to get off my balls.' I would remind the rapper Jay-Z: Mr. Z, it is President Obama who wants to mandate circumcision. We had that story yesterday; and that means if we need to save our penises from anybody, it's Obama. I did not know I was on anybody's balls, either. I'm happy to know that they think I am, though! But I didn't actually know that I was." It's an issue Limbaugh explored on his Aug. 24 show as well, saying, "Not that I'm against circumcision, but it's a family's decision. Leave our penises alone, too, Obama!" He cited a Fox News story about an upcoming report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that may recommend circumcision for newborn boys as a way to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS, because studies show that the procedure can reduce transmission of the disease from women to men. The CDC will be discussing what to include in the recommendations at the National HIV Prevention Conference, which is being held in Atlanta this week. The CDC is still mulling its decision, CDC spokesman Scott Bryan said in an e-mail. "It is important to note that the recommendations are still in development and the CDC has made no determination at this time about the final content," he wrote. "There is a deliberative process for our circumcision recommendations that allows for both external and internal CDC experts to weigh in, followed by a period of public comment after the draft recommendations are published. With respect to infant circumcision, it is important to recognize that many options are still being considered in this process, including simply educating parents about the potential benefits and risks in order to ensure they can make an informed decision." CDC is also considering whether to recommend circumcision for adult men who are at high risk for HIV infection, Bryan wrote. He emphasized that the recommendations "will be completely voluntary." We wondered whether Obama had been involved in the issue and specifically in the CDC's decision to write the guidance, as Limbaugh's claim indicates. We scoured his voting record on Congressional Quarterly , his position papers and speeches on Project Vote Smart , and even typed "circumcision" into the White House Web site , and came up with nothing. From what we found, Obama has not used the word "circumcision" in any public statement as a candidate or as president. We also found no evidence that he has recommended circumcusion to the CDC. The only link — and it's an indirect one — that we could find between Obama and the CDC's efforts was a press release on the White House Web site announcing a series of HIV/AIDS community discussions, the first one being held in conjunction with the National HIV Prevention Conference we mentioned earlier. But the release did not mention circumcision. It turns out that circumcision recommendations have been under discussion since 2007, when George W. Bush was president. Given the fact the CDC was pondering the idea back then, it is no more accurate to say Obama wants to mandate circumcision than to say Bush did. So, back to Limbaugh's claim. He says Obama "wants to mandate circumcision." But the CDC's eventual recommendations — if they even include circumcision — will be voluntary, not mandatory. In addition, we could we find no connection between Obama and the new guidance, and no evidence that Obama had even used the word in a public forum. In fact, the recommendations were under discussion long before Obama took office. This one is ridiculous enough to set the meter ablaze — Pants on Fire!

pomt-04076	Says "in this next biennium, the cost of primary and secondary education is going to increase by more that $1000 per student. Half of that $1000 – $500 per student – is accounted for by the increased cost of PERS alone."	true	/oregon/statements/2013/jan/21/john-kitzhaber/are-increased-pers-costs-responsible-500-student-i/	During his recent State of the State address, Gov. John Kitzhaber defended a proposal to cap the cost of living adjustment for those on the public employee retirement system. "If we are serious about reinvesting in the classroom, we cannot ignore the fact that the crisis in school funding – as well as the crisis in funding things like child protective services and home health care – is not just a revenue problem: it has also become a cost problem," the governor began. "In this next biennium, the cost of primary and secondary education is going to increase by more than $1,000 per student. Half of that $1,000 – $500 per student – is accounted for by the increased cost of PERS alone …" This isn’t the first time the governor has made this exact claim, so we thought it was time we checked it out. We started by asking Kitzhaber’s spokeswoman, Amy Wojcicki, to tell us how the governor arrived at these statistics. In an email, she said the governor started by looking at what it would cost the state to run the K-12 system during the 2013-15 biennium in the exact way its running currently -- this is also called current service level. Essentially, the same services that cost the state $5.715 billion this biennium are projected to cost the state $6.315 next biennium. Then the governor took a look at that extra $600 million; a big chunk of it, $265 million, came from the PERS increase. (As a side note, that steep increase stems from the 2007 stock market crash. Essentially, PERS is like any other investment portfolio; it rides the market up and down. However, when it’s on a downturn, there are still people expecting to get their pensions. In Oregon, that means the government has to go in and make up the losses.) We wanted to verify these numbers independently of the governor's office, so we called Paul Cleary, the executive director at PERS. Cleary told us that based on their estimates, the cost of PERS in education for the next biennium was predicted to rise by $400 million. The state isn’t responsible for that full amount, but rather 70 percent, or $280 million -- roughly the amount the governor had mentioned in his speech. The next step was to take the governor’s $265 million figure and divide it by the total number of students in the public K-12 system, which, by the Oregon Department of Education’s latest count, was about 560,000. Do that and you get about $475 per student -- or just about the $500 the governor mentioned in his speech. Now this isn’t a done deal, of course. If you take a look at the budget the governor recommended to legislators, spending on K-12 increases not by $600 million but by $400 million. The governor has a slighter increase -- and one that is largely the result of other personnel costs as well as a larger investment in education -- because he’s assuming PERS costs will be curbed by his plan to cap cost-of-living increases, among other changes. We note that the governor’s plan has to get through the Legislature, and if approved would likely face the hurdle of litigation. Becca Uherbelau, a spokeswoman for the Oregon Education Association, which represent public employees, says the proposed reforms would wind up in court. However, much of that has little to do with what the governor said -- and the statement we’re vetting. Kitzhaber has said on several occasions, most recently in his State of the State address, that if nothing changes, the state will be spending about $500 more per K-12 student to cover the cost of PERS in the next biennium. We checked his math and verified it with the executive director of PERS and the governor is right. We rate this claim True.	None	John Kitzhaber	None	None	None	2013-01-21T16:29:36	2013-01-14	['None']

pomt-10725	"John wasn't this raging populist four years ago" when he ran for president.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/19/barack-obama/edwards-tagged-populist-early-on/	After John Edwards charged that Barack Obama would be too willing to compromise with special interests, Obama jabbed back during an interview with the Washington Post on Nov. 8, 2007. "John wasn't this raging populist four years ago when he ran" for the previous Democratic nomination, Obama said. "He certainly wasn't when he ran for the U.S. Senate." Edwards has run for major office three times: He ran for the U.S. Senate in North Carolina in 1998, and he's run for president in 2004 and 2008. News reports from his 1998 race show Edwards was described as a populist early on, running as "the people's senator" and saying he would help fight powerful interests like the insurance lobby, just as he did in his career as a successful trial lawyer. Ferrel Guillory, a longtime Edwards watcher and director of the Program on Public Life at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, analyzed Edwards as a "suburban populist" back in 1998. In a 2007 interview with PolitiFact.com, Guillory recalled that first race. "The way Edwards framed himself was very much in tune with the modern suburban Southern middle class, who have anxieties about their medical care, about the quality of their children's education, and about their future," he said. If Obama didn't think of Edwards as a populist in 2004, a lot of other people seemed to. The Los Angeles Times wrote of Edwards, "The North Carolina senator lays his populist cards on the table in New Hampshire," while David Brooks wrote a column about Edwards titled, "The Happy Populist." Brooks, a conservative columnist, criticized Edwards' ideas as "false" and "too facile," but he painted a striking picture of classic populist rhetoric: "The emotional climax of his speech comes when he describes how he used to represent 'people like you' against teams of highly paid, distinguished corporate lawyers. 'And you know what happened? I beat them, and I beat them, and I beat them again!' The crowds go crazy..." Guillory said Edwards has struck populist themes his entire political life, but that's not to say Edwards hasn't sharpened his rhetoric and branched out to other populist issues over the years. During the course of the two presidential campaigns, Edwards has increased his support of unions, a crucial Democratic constituency, and spoken out more about international trade policy. "Edwards is in a different place than he was in 1998," Guillory said. "But it's not like he couldn't go back and give his speeches from 1998. He's just running for a different office in a different context." We give Obama a False ruling on his remark that Edwards came to populism recently. His Senate record may not be the most substantial, but Edwards has consistently raised issues of economic inequality his entire political career.

pomt-03721	Under Obamacare, Virginia taxpayers would have been "forced to pay for abortions" if the General Assembly had not recently intervened.	false	/virginia/statements/2013/apr/15/virginia-society-human-life/va-society-human-life-says-obamacare-allows-tax-fu/	The Virginia Society for Human Life was cheered by the General Assembly’s passage of a measure that will bar insurers who participate in a new federally run exchange in Virginia from covering most abortions. The action -- which was proposed by Gov. Bob McDonnell -- only allows exchange policies to cover abortions in cases when the mother’s life is in danger, or the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest. Shortly after the April 3 vote, the society issued a statement saying it was "extremely pleased that the members of the General Assembly have taken the important step to protect the taxpayers of Virginia from being forced to pay for abortions in insurance plans under the newly created federal health care exchanges." We wondered whether Virginia taxpayers really were on the verge of being "forced to pay for abortion," and were spared from that requirement by McDonnell’s amendment. So we took a look. The claim is centered on the requirements of Obamacare, which calls for statewide health insurance exchanges starting next year that will compete for the business of people who don’t have coverage through their employers. The idea is that it will allow individuals to get favorable rates paid by people in large group plans. Those who cannot afford insurance will get a federal subsidy to help them join an exchange. Virginia lawmakers originally had anticipated creating a state-run exchange, and in 2011 passed a bill banning most abortions from being covered in the program. But late last year, McDonnell announced Virginia would not create an exchange, a move that by default will leave the state with a federally run system. Lawmakers passed the amendment this year to guarantee that most abortions in Virginia would not be covered by the federal exchange. Did excluding abortion coverage spare taxpayers from having to pay for it? We asked Olivia Gans Turner, the president for the Virginia Society for Human Life, to explain her group’s claim. She pointed to a section of the Obamacare law that allows a state to prohibit any plan within its borders from covering abortions except in the cases when a woman’s life is in danger or instances of rape or incest -- limited circumstances that have long been covered under federal law. That provision makes it clear that "the only way for a state to not pay for abortions under insurance plans is to actually enact a law providing such a prohibition," Turner said. So Turner notes, as we have, that Obamacare gives states flexibility on whether to ban abortion coverage in exchanges. But whatever course states chose, there is no threat that public funds would be used for most abortions. That’s because Obamacare mandates a funding mechanism that will segregate premium payments for abortions from the federal subsidies some will receive to help cover the cost of care on the exchange. That system requires anyone who chooses to enroll in a plan covering abortion to make two payments. The first will go into an account for all non-abortion coverage in the plan. The second payment -- of at least $1 a month -- will go into a pool used only for abortion services, according to a July 9, 2012, report by the Congressional Research Service. Our ruling The Virginia Society for Human Life said a recently passed an amendment banning insurers participating in a state exchange from covering most abortions protected "the taxpayers of Virginia from being forced to pay for abortions." The statement ignores the fact that if abortion services had been allowed, insurers would have had to charge separate premium payments for such coverage and segregate the money from all other premiums. That ensures the payments for abortions would come out of policy holders’ pockets -- not public funds. We rate the claim False.

pomt-15301	"By declaring that Pluto was no longer a planet, the (International Astronomical Union) put into place a planetary definition that would have even declassified Earth as a planet if it existed as far from the sun as Pluto does."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/jul/21/other-space/plutos-advocates-say-even-earth-would-not-count-pl/	The world’s best-ever glimpse of Pluto from the New Horizons spacecraft is giving the "Pluto question" new life: Should the icy orb be once again considered the ninth planet of our solar system? Images of the dwarf planet inspired a tide of Internet reaction last week, including memes, a funny interview between Pluto loyalist Stephen Colbert and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, and a petition signed by more than 4,100 people to bring Pluto back to full planet status. The petition on Change.org, which was started by the producers of the Yahoo! web series Other Space, wants world astronomers to reconsider their 2006 decision to classify Pluto as a dwarf planet in its August assembly in Honolulu. "Not long after New Horizons was launched in 2006, the International Astronomical Union stripped Pluto of its planethood because it was different than the other eight planets that we committed to memory," the petition reads. "By declaring that Pluto was no longer a planet, the IAU put into place a planetary definition that would have even declassified Earth as a planet if it existed as far from the Sun as Pluto does." As crazy as it sounds, we wondered if the theoretical argument in the petition could really be accurate: Could Earth really be a dwarf planet in an alternate universe? (Assuming, of course, that Earth could form so far from the sun, which is not realistic.) The International Astronomical Union’s decision Ahead of Pluto’s demotion almost a decade ago, astronomers had been wrestling over what to do with the icy, diminutive planet as other bodies in the Kuiper Belt and elsewhere came to focus, including an even bigger world called Xena (renamed Eris). Should those bodies also be planets, or are they, like Pluto, something else? In 2006, the IAU came up with a resolution on how a planet ought to be defined. The IAU definition says a planet is a celestial body that meets the following criteria: is in orbit around the sun, has a spherical or nearly round shape, has cleared the neighborhood around its orbit. Pluto passed the first two criteria, but it flunked the third about clearing the neighborhood around its orbit. We wondered if Earth would also fail to clear its neighborhood if it switched places with Pluto. And what in the heck does "clearing the neighborhood" mean anyway? Experts told us to think of it like a planet taking a broom to its orbit. " ‘Clearing the neighborhood’ is like sweeping up and tossing out an accumulation of debris once and for all, where no outside source replaces it," said Steven Soter, a resident research associate at the American Museum of Natural History, who also proposed a method of measuring the cleanliness of a planet’s orbit. However, Soter says the IAU definition is misleading because no planet can ever entirely clear its neighborhood, as asteroids and comets often leak back into orbital zones from the outside, he said. "The Earth even in its present location has not entirely ‘cleared’ its orbital zone," Soter said. "Asteroids and comets clobber it every few million years." Soter would rewrite the definition to say that a body must "dynamically dominate" its orbital zone in order to be considered a planet. This loosened definition means a planet could keep its neighborhood relatively clear in spite of constant debris coming in from the outside. Still, Pluto would not pass the planet test even under this term, Soter said. Pluto only dominates its own satellite system, and it has no influence on the rest of the Kuiper Belt that can be seen. If Earth were in Pluto’s position, Soter said it would still be a planet — but only marginally — based on its neighborhood-clearing abilities. Soter pointed to this wonky-looking graph to explain his point. The horizontal axis shows how far a planet is from the sun, while the vertical axis shows a planet’s mass relative to Earth. Every diagonal line on the graph shows how good a planet is at keeping its neighborhood relatively clear despite debris floating back in. Some planets (the larger ones at the top, such as Jupiter and Saturn) clear out more debris, and others (Mercury, Mars, the ones straddling the topmost diagonal line) clear out less. The farther a planet gets from the sun, the harder it is to keep its neighborhood clean. Right now, Earth does pretty well for itself. But move our planet right from 1 AU to 40 AU (Pluto’s location), and Earth is not as good as clearing its neighborhood. Again, hypothetically speaking. "The Earth in Pluto's orbit would have about the same dynamical power as Mercury or Mars, so it would (only) marginally dominate its new orbital zone," Soter said. So, Earth would still be a planet, but it would be close, he said. There is also another way of looking at this definition. Soter proposed a way of defining planets by looking at how significant a planet-like body is compared to other space debris in its zone. (Think of comparing the mass of the broom you’re using to the mass of garbage still left behind.) Would Earth still be a significant object when compared to everything else in Pluto’s neighborhood? Maybe. There is no way to predict and compare masses, he said. Arguments that support the petition The equation behind the graph was proposed by planetary scientists Harold Levison and Alan Stern, who is the lead investigator for the New Horizons mission to Pluto. Stern’s advocacy for Pluto being a planet is well-known, and he stressed in a phone interview that he has a very different take on this question than Soter. As he has said for years, Stern thinks Earth would not be able to clear Pluto’s zone and therefore not be a planet under the IAU parameters. The farther a planet (or planet-like body) is from the sun, the larger an object has to be to clear its orbital zone — which means Pluto, 4.67 billion miles from the sun, has it pretty rough out there. "The Kuiper Belt zone (the zone Pluto has to clear) is bigger than the zones from Mercury to Neptune," Stern told PunditFact. Mark V. Sykes, director of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz., agrees with Stern that Earth would no longer be considered a planet if it were in Pluto’s location. Sykes went even further to suggest that Earth would no longer be a planet if it were placed between Jupiter and Saturn. "The IAU definition is analogous to putting an apple in the middle of the table, then moving it to the edge of the table and declaring it is no longer an apple," he said. Both Stern and Soter faulted a time crunch at the 2006 meeting that resulted in a rushed set of criteria for planethood. When the IAU proposed its new definition, Stern said, it was done "overnight" and no specific calculations were used. One of the concerns among scientists there was that if Pluto were admitted as a planet, then so would other space bodies. Some attendees worried there would be "too many planets to memorize," Stern said. The concerns were "not scientific … (but) somewhere between personal preference and political," Stern wrote in the Space article. There are also other concerns about the IAU’s decision. Only about 16-25 percent of the registered astronomers at the IAU meeting voted on the definition. Other scientists have also pointed out that the IAU’s definition is limited to our solar system and does not consider planets that might exist outside the solar system. We reached out to a representative from IAU to comment but did not hear back. Our ruling Other Space's petition claims, "By declaring that Pluto was no longer a planet, the (International Astronomical Union) put into place a planetary definition that would have even declassified Earth as a planet if it existed as far from the sun as Pluto does." Putting aside the fact that this could not actually happen, we heard very different opinions from scientists on whether the definition would really exclude Earth if it were in Pluto’s shoes. Pluto was demoted as a planet because it could not clear its orbital zone, a requirement established by the astronomers union. However, the IAU definition is ambiguous because no planet can ever completely clear its orbital zone. Absent a clearer definition, scientists disagree about whether Earth would be declassified in this far-fetched scenario, though it certainly would not do as good a job at "clearing the neighborhood" as it does now. The claim on the petition is partially accurate but leaves out important details — the main one being that we’ll never know for sure. We rate it Half True.

pomt-06447	"Nearly half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/oct/21/edith-ajello/ri-rep-edith-ajello-says-half-pregnancies-us-are-u/	In a recent Providence Journal commentary, Rhode Island Rep. Edith H. Ajello and Sen. Rhoda A. Perry argued for the need for better preventive medicine, including "the full range of reproductive health care." Until this year, health insurers could limit or even deny coverage to pregnant women if the insurer determined the pregnancy amounted to a so-called preexisting health condition. But that changed in March with the passage of the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration’s overhaul of the health-care system. And in August, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services adopted guidelines for women’s preventative preventive care that include coverage for contraception. "It’s about time!" the legislators wrote of that measure. "Nearly half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended." Nearly half? That caught our attention, so we decided to check it. First, some background. In their commentary piece, they urged Rhode Island to support the creation of a health-insurance exchange, as all states are required to do under the Affordable Care Act. The exchanges are intended to lower insurance costs by fostering competition among insurance providers. In Rhode Island, legislation to create an exchange passed the Senate but died in a House committee. Perry cast one of six dissenting votes against the Senate bill, which had been amended to include a provision to prevent health insurers from using taxpayer money or subsidies to cover abortions. ( A House bill with no restrictions on abortion coverage was held for further study.) Governor Lincoln Chafee issued an executive order in September to create an exchange. Under the new federal rules, insurers will have to expand coverage for preventive care, including birth control. The expanded coverage is clearly a significant development if, as Ajello and Perry wrote, "nearly half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended." So we asked the two lawmakers for their source in writing the piece. The facts Ajello directed us to The Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit organization based in New York City, which does research and policy analysis about sexual and reproductive health. The Guttmacher Institute has produced two studies about unintended pregnancies in the United States. The most recent, "Unintended pregnancy in the United States: incidence and disparities, 2006’’ published in August 2011, states that "nearly half (49%) of pregnancies were unintended in 2006." The earlier study, "Disparities in Rates of Unintended Pregnancy In the United States, 1994 and 2001,’’ also reported 49 percent of pregnancies in 2001 were unintended, a level unchanged from 1994. The studies define an unintended pregnancy as one in which the pregnancy was either "mistimed," meaning the woman did not want the pregnancy at the time of conception (even if she may have wanted to become pregnant at some future date), or which was "unwanted," meaning that she did not want to become pregnant then or in the future. (Unintended pregnancies are an important public health issue, the study says, because they are associated with "a number of adverse maternal behaviors and child health outcomes, including inadequate or delayed initiation of prenatal care, smoking and drinking during pregnancy, premature birth and lack of breastfeeding, as well as negative physical and mental health effects on children.") Of the 6.7 million pregnancies in the United States in 2006, about 3.2 million were unintended, the 2006 study reported. Of the 3.2 million, the study said, 29 percent were "mistimed," and 19 percent -- or 608,000 -- were "unwanted." The original study, as well as a footnote referencing the more recent one, were posted on the web site of the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A CDC spokeswoman confirmed that the Guttmacher studies are based on data from the CDC’s National Survey of Family Growth, an ongoing survey of about 5,000 women each year whose responses are compiled in periodic reports that reflect the reproductive history of tens of thousands of women. The studies also rely on population data from the U.S. census. Both studies reported that the share of total pregnancies that were "unintended" has remained unchanged at 49 percent. Our ruling Perry and Ajello stated that nearly half of all pregnancies in the United States are unintended. Two studies based on data from the U.S. census and the CDC reported that the share of unintended pregnancies in the United States was 49 percent. We rule this claim True.

pomt-11155	"Yesterday afternoon the Republicans in the General Assembly used the nuclear option to pass North Carolina's over $20 billion budget."	false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/may/25/sydney-batch/nc-democrat-said-nc-budget-had-passed-it-hadnt/	Democrats are mad that Republicans plan to change state government spending without their direct input. Republicans, who hold a supermajority in the North Carolina Legislature, are mostly negotiating budget changes amongst themselves and intend to block any proposed amendments to their bill. But, if voters were to read one Democrat’s newsletter, they’d get an entirely different picture of the situation. A May 23 newsletter distributed by Sydney Batch, a Democratic candidate for NC House, overstates what has happened so far. "Yesterday afternoon the Republicans in the General Assembly used the nuclear option to pass North Carolina's over $20 billion budget," the newsletter said. It adds: "For the first time in (the) history of our great state, they are not allowing any debate or input on our budget." Batch is running for a House seat representing Raleigh’s southern suburbs. That district's incumbent, a Republican, isn't running for re-election so Batch will face Republican candidate John Adcock. The problem with Batch’s statements is that they aren’t accurate. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com As we write this fact-check, legislative Republicans have yet to vote on or even reveal their full budget plans. And her statement about the lack of debate is also misleading. Republican leaders plan to gut an old bill and amend it as a "conference report" to include their budget plans, meaning state lawmakers will have no method for amending the legislation. But it remains to be seen whether Republicans will allow debate on the floor of the House and Senate chambers. As for the historical precedent of blocking amendments, The News & Observer story, which Batch linked to in her newsletter, says amendments won’t be allowed for the first time in "modern history." Gerry Cohen, former head of the bill-drafting division in the Legislature, told the Associated Press that legislators haven’t completely skipped the amendment process since at least the early 1970s. When contacted by PolitiFact, Batch referred to the claim as "an inadvertent typo." An apology "I meant to type, ‘Yesterday afternoon the Republicans in the General Assembly decided that they are going to use the nuclear option to pass North Carolina's over $20 billion budget,’" Batch wrote in an email (Whether or not the process Republicans are using can be referred to as "the nuclear option" is another debate altogether.) "I will retract and edit the statement with the email list shortly. Thanks for bringing it to my attention," Batch wrote. And retract the statement, she did. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com On May 24, Batch distributed a newsletter apologizing for her mistake. "Friends and supporters, yesterday, there was an error in oversight," she wrote. In using a conference report, "the leadership does not have to allow debate or input on the bill. This enables leadership to stop any changes to their bill, that has become NC's budget. This bill is expected to pass immediately in both chambers when properly introduced. It is a secretive and unethical way to govern," she said, concluding: "I apologize for the mistake in the language used in yesterday's title and if you have any questions or concerns please do not hesitate to contact the campaign." Our ruling Batch said, "Yesterday afternoon the Republicans in the General Assembly used the nuclear option to pass North Carolina's over $20 billion budget." In fact, the budget hasn’t been approved yet. It hasn’t even been put up for a vote. Batch apologized for the mistake and retracted her statement in a new email – which PolitiFact applauds. But that doesn’t protect her first statement from our Truth-O-Meter. We rate her claim False. CORRECTION: An earlier version of this story misquoted Gerry Cohen, former had of the bill-drafting division in the legislature, saying that a state budget had previously been approved without going through the amendment process. To clarify, Cohen isn’t sure whether it has happened before. This error doesn’t affect PolitiFact’s rating.

pomt-03292	"Even the employees’ union for the IRS -- the very people in charge of enforcing this law -- are begging to be let out from under this law."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/01/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-union-irs-workers-begging-be-let-/	During a recent interview with Sean Hannity of Fox News, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., picked up a talking point that had been widely repeated in the conservative blogosphere about workers at the Internal Revenue Service wanting to get out of Obamacare. Referring to President Barack Obama’s health care law, Rubio said, "Even the employees’ union for the IRS -- the very people in charge of enforcing this law -- are begging to be let out from under this law." Since federal-employee unions tend to be some of Obama’s staunchest supporters, it would be unusual if the National Treasury Employees Union had turned against the president over his signature legislative accomplishment. Is that really what happened? There’s a kernel of truth here, but the episode is considerably more nuanced than Rubio, or most of the other commentators, let on. The union wasn’t lobbying against Obamacare per se, but rather against a bill sponsored by one of the law’s opponents that would change how Obamacare operates. (You can read the union’s form letter here.) This is a complicated tale, so we’ll start at the beginning. When the health care law was being written in 2009 and 2010, Republicans proposed requiring lawmakers and their staffers to obtain insurance through the exchanges, arguing that if the law was good enough for ordinary Americans, then it was good enough for the people in Congress who wrote the law. Presumably fearing a public backlash if they refused, Democrats accepted the language, and it became part of the law. But as the New York Times recently put it, the provision "has been a headache for many in Congress ever since." That’s because the law does not include an explicit mechanism to allow the federal government to pay its employer share of congressional employees’ health insurance if they use the exchanges. For most Americans with employer-based insurance, including government employees, the employer pays a majority of the cost of insurance, lessening the financial burden for employees. Unless a fix can be found, congressional employees will have to foot the entire cost of their health insurance when buying insurance on the exchange -- a financial hit that could go well into the thousands of dollars. Despite longstanding concerns about the provision’s impact, neither Congress nor the administration has yet come up with a workable solution, although the administration promises action in time for the opening of the exchanges this fall. However, after word leaked to Politico in April that congressional leaders in both parties were "engaged in high-level, confidential talks" to rescind the provision, U.S. Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., decided to offer a bill that would expand the mandate to use the exchanges beyond Congress to the president, vice president and all federal employees. As of this writing, the bill had not advanced to a committee hearing. Still, the fact that the bill was introduced at all set off alarm bells at the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 employees in 31 federal agencies and departments. That includes the IRS, which has a role in enforcing the tax penalties for failing to secure health coverage. This is why the union has urged its members to oppose Camp’s bill. In a statement to PolitiFact, union president Colleen M. Kelley called Rubio’s claim "a misrepresentation." She said the union’s beef is not with Obamacare itself, and the episode does not represent a policy rift between the union and Obama. Rather, the union is concerned that an opponent of Obamacare wants to change the law, effectively uprooting 150,000 of its members from their existing plans and potentially leaving them to pay the entire cost of their health insurance without employer assistance. When we checked with health policy experts, most said they don’t blame Rubio for seizing on a juicy dispute among longtime allies, but they agreed that the actual story is a lot more complicated. Obama and his allies created a system in which most Americans -- at least three quarters -- who had insurance would remain on their existing plans and would see few if any disruptions from the new law. The exchanges were created to provide a marketplace for Americans who lack insurance entirely or have to buy insurance on their own. By contrast, Camp’s bill would force federal employees out of their longstanding coverage and into a new system. An added irony is that the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program is widely considered a key model for the exchanges themselves. Under the program, federal employees under the age of 65 can choose among a variety of health insurance offerings, just as people will be able to do under the exchanges. In 2003, the conservative Heritage Foundation published a paper touting the program as a model for market-based health care reform. "The union is correct that the primary purpose of the ACA is to provide a marketplace for the sale of health insurance for those who do not have such coverage, which would of course exclude IRS and other government employees," said Gail Wilensky, the former head of Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. In fact, she said, "Federal employees, unlike most other employees, have been offered a wide variety of plans through the FEHBP program and are probably the least likely to want to leave their present" coverage. Our ruling Rubio said that "even the employees’ union for the IRS -- the very people in charge of enforcing this law -- are begging to be let out from under this law." He has a point that the National Treasury Employees Union has asked its members to oppose efforts to force its members into the exchanges created by Obama’s health care law. But he ignores a lot of context that would give a listener a different impression. The union’s quarrel is not with Obamacare itself, but rather with efforts by the law’s opponents to uproot federal employees from their longstanding health plans, a change the union views as punitive. By contrast, Obamacare was written to keep as many Americans as possible on their existing insurance plans, with the exchanges envisioned as a way for people without insurance or with inadequate insurance to purchase a plan. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2013-08-01T16:57:57	2013-07-31	['None']

pomt-03242	I have the most Grammys of anyone my age, but I haven't won one against a white person.	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2013/aug/15/kanye-west/west-hits-sour-notes-grammy-claim/	PolitiFact Georgia typically limits its fact-checking to politicos and power brokers who make an impact on the political process. But sometimes the worlds of politics and entertainment intersect. Such is the case for rapper-producer Kanye West, who just happens to have metro Atlanta connections. West is one of the most recognizable and best-selling musicians around. But he has also had his share of run-ins with the top rungs of the political class, including Republican and Democratic presidents. He evoked the ire of President George W. Bush in 2005 by telling the country during a televised benefit concert in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina that "George Bush doesn’t care about black people." Bush later said that the suggestion was an "all-time low" of his presidency. President Barack Obama called West a derogatory term after the rapper infamously interrupted singer Taylor Swift during her acceptance speech at the 2009 Video Music Awards. The president slammed West again in a follow-up interview. Just a couple of weeks ago, Obama criticized the over-the-top lifestyle of West and the entertainer’s unmarried mother of his child, Kim Kardashian. Obama questioned the effect the West-Kardashian lifestyle would have on impressionable young people who view them as role models. So we decided to check West’s statement about his place in popular culture. (Visit our Facebook page and let us know what you think: www.facebook.com/politifact.georgia.) About a week before the release of his album "Yeezus," The New York Times published an extensive interview with the Chicago rapper. During that interview while discussing his Grammy wins, West said, "I don’t know if this is statistically right, but I’m assuming I have the most Grammys of anyone my age, but I haven’t won one against a white person." He continued: "But the thing is, I don’t care about the Grammys; I just would like for the statistics to be more accurate." West’s claims about having the most golden gramophones piqued our interest, so we decided to run them through the AJC Truth-O-Meter. West is a hometown boy. Although he claims Chicago as his home, the rapper was born in Atlanta before moving with his mother to the Windy City at age 3. His parents met and married in Atlanta, according to a book by West’s mother. His father, Ray West, was one of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s earliest black photographers. The AJC recently compiled a slideshow of some of his photographs taken while working at the paper. To check out Kanye West’s claims, we first contacted his publicist, Gabe Tesoriero at Island Def Jam Music Group. Tesoriero asked what our story was about. We detailed the claims we were checking and the PolitiFact process. Tesoriero provided no further response. The official Grammys website says the honors are awarded annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences and recognize achievement in the music industry during the previous year. The first Grammy Awards were held in May 1959. Slate Magazine also checked out West’s claims. The online magazine found that he was partially accurate. At age 36 and with 21 Grammy wins (out of 53 nominations), West has the most awards for anyone his age, Slate said. But he has beaten out several white artists for the awards, including fellow rappers Eminem and the Beastie Boys. We reviewed a list of Grammy statistics compiled by Wikipedia. Doing our own research, we counted each Grammy for artists ahead of West on the list of Grammy wins. We checked the artists’ biographies to determine their 36th birthday to compare their wins by that age. West’s 21 wins ties him with composer and pianist John Williams for the eighth most Grammy wins. Our research found that singer-songwriter Alison Krauss (with 27 Grammys) appears to have tied West’s 21 wins by age 36, according to official past winner information and biographical data we checked. (As a group, rock band U2 earned its 22 awards before 2012, when the band would have been together 36 years.) But other award winners with more Grammys ahead of West on the list -- including Quincy Jones and Stevie Wonder -- had not reached the 21-award mark by their 36th birthdays. The King of Pop, Michael Jackson, by the way, earned 12 Grammys by his 36th birthday. As to whether West has ever beaten out any white artists, he has. For example, in 2005, West beat nominees including Eminem for best rap solo performance with "Gold Digger." But all of West’s Grammy wins have been in the rap and R&B categories, which are dominated by black artists. He has never won overall Grammys in categories such as Album of the Year and Record of the Year. Multiple music critics have criticized the Grammys for overlooking West in these broad categories. Writers for Time and the Los Angeles Times cried foul when West’s "My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy" wasn’t nominated for Album of the Year at the 54th Grammys. The Slate Magazine writer who also examined West’s Grammy claims noted that "West believes that he has been shut out from the ‘bigger’ awards ... in part because he’s black." West’s opinions about his Grammy standings are his own and not for Politifact Georgia to check. But on the facts, West claimed he has won the most Grammys for anyone his age. One other individual artist, Alison Krauss, has tied this feat. On his claim that he’s never beaten out a white artist for a Grammy, West is incorrect. He has beaten white artists in album and song categories. We rate his claims Mostly False.	None	Kanye West	None	None	None	2013-08-15T10:00:15	2013-06-11	['None']

pomt-12735	"I’ve been on the Armed Services (Committee) for 10 years. No call or meeting w/ Russian ambassador. Ever."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/02/claire-mccaskill/claire-mccaskill-says-she-never-met-russian-ambass/	Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., has called for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign over taking meetings with the Russian ambassador without disclosing it to Congress. Sessions, a former Republican senator from Alabama, defended the one-on-one he had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak because it was part of his duties as a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, not as a surrogate for President Donald Trump’s campaign. In a retort, McCaskill, also a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said she never met with Kislyak, who has held his position since 2008. "I’ve been on the Armed Services Com for 10 years. No call or meeting w/Russian ambassador. Ever. Ambassadors call members of Foreign (Relations Committee)," she tweeted March 2. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But McCaskill’s own earlier tweets show that that’s not the case. She has communicated with the Russian ambassador, at least twice, to discuss policy matters. "Off to meeting w/Russian Ambassador. Upset about the arbitrary/cruel decision to end all US adoptions, even those in process," she tweeted on Jan. 30, 2013. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com The Atlantic has a picture of that very meeting, showing McCaskill (and a few other senators) sitting across the table from Kislyak. And in April 2015, she tweeted: "Today calls with British, Russian, and German Ambassadors re: Iran deal. #doingmyhomework." McCaskill spokeswoman Sarah Feldman said McCaskill’s interactions with Kislyak were materially different than Sessions’. Sessions met with Kislyak one-on-one around the same time Russian actors are believed to have been meddling in the election. McCaskill, on the other hand, met him in a group setting to discuss adoption policy and in a brief phone call about the Iran nuclear deal, Feldman said. A few hours after tweeting that she never met with the Russian ambassador, McCaskill published two clarifications, downplaying the significance of the two interactions she had with Kislyak. See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com See Figure 5 on PolitiFact.com She also told CNN that Twitter’s 140-character limit prevented her from initially saying she never received a call from the ambassador, as opposed to the call she made to the ambassador about the Iran deal. Sessions had two interactions with Kislyak in 2016. The first was in an informal group setting at a July 2016 event for diplomats at the Republican National Convention. And the second was a private meeting in Sessions’ former Senate office in September. Who initiated the private meeting and what was discussed is so far unknown. In specifying that she never met with Kislyak on Armed Services Committee business, "McCaskill seems to have inadvertently supported Sessions’ claims," said Benjamin Friedman, a research fellow in security studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. "She made an unequivocal statement and then had to go back and qualify it by saying she was speaking just about one of her roles and not the other." Our ruling McCaskill said, "I’ve been on the Armed Services Com for 10 years. No call or meeting w/ Russian ambassador. Ever." McCaskill’s own tweets show that she has had an in-person group meeting, as well as a phone call, with the Russian ambassador in the past four years. A McCaskill spokesperson contrasted these interactions with the private one-on-one meeting Sessions had in his office with the ambassador.

pomt-00168	"The Postal Service only gives tribal residents PO boxes. The Republican-controlled Supreme Court just said it’s totally okay for North Dakota to demand that ONLY residents with street addresses can vote. Native Americans were the last to get the right to vote, and now they are the first to lose it."	half-true	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/oct/23/occupy-democrats/native-americans-werent-last-get-right-vote-occupy/	A viral image about Native American voting rights in North Dakota called a recent U.S. Supreme Court decision "disgraceful." The liberal advocacy group Occupy Democrats circulated a graphic in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s Oct. 9 decision not to intervene in a challenge to North Dakota’s voter ID law that would require voters to bring a form of identification with them to the polls that displays a current residential street address. The graphic was posted to Occupy Democrats’ Facebook page along with a link to an American Civil Liberties Union article encouraging users to read more. The image shows a picture of Chief Joseph, a leader of the Nez Percé tribe in the Pacific Northwest, along with a paragraph about how the decision will affect Native Americans: "The Postal Service only gives tribal residents PO boxes. The Republican-controlled Supreme Court just said it’s totally okay for North Dakota to demand that ONLY residents with street addresses can vote. Native Americans were the last to get the right to vote, and now they are the first to lose it." This image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It had been shared on Facebook more than 52,000 times. There are a lot of parts to this claim, so we will take them one by one. Recent changes to North Dakota’s voter ID laws Signed into law by Republican Gov. Doug Burgum in April 2017, HB 1369 requires a voter to bring a form of identification with them to the polls that includes their legal name, date of birth and current residential street address in North Dakota. The bill stipulates that a driver’s license, Department of Transportation-issued ID, or tribal government-issued ID are acceptable forms of identification, and allows for other documents, such as a utility bill or paycheck, to supplement missing or outdated information. North Dakota is the only state without voter registration, abolishing it in 1951, according to the Secretary of State’s office. A group of eight Native Americans from the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa had already been in a legal battle with the state over voting rights when Burgum enacted Republican-led HB 1369. So, in December 2017, the plaintiffs, represented by attorneys for the Native American Rights Fund, amended their original January 2016 complaint, Brakebill vs. Jaeger, and asked a federal judge to declare the new law unconstitutional. They argued it violates the national Voting Rights Act. The plaintiffs argued that the law was discriminatory because, "most tribal IDs do not have a residential address printed on them. This is due, in part, to the fact that the U.S. postal service does not provide residential delivery in these rural Indian communities. Thus, most tribal members use a PO Box." Reached by email, Occupy Democrats told PolitiFact that the organization should have specified in their graphic that Native Americans "in remote areas" use PO boxes. "But we stand by the general veracity of the statement, especially with regards to this specific example in North Dakota," Occupy Democrats wrote in the Oct. 18 email. In April, Judge Daniel L. Hovland of the U.S. District Court of North Dakota blocked the bill’s new requirements from being enforced. However, the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals overturned the decision, allowing the street address requirement to be implemented in the upcoming midterm elections. In September, the Native American Rights Fund took the issue to the U.S. Supreme Court, asking it to vacate the Eighth Circuit’s decision. The Supreme Court’s ruling Occupy Democrats’ graphic also said, "The Republican-controlled Supreme Court just said it’s totally okay for North Dakota to demand that ONLY residents with street addresses can vote." The U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling on Brakebill vs. Jaeger was 6-2, with justices Elena Kagan and Ruth Bader Ginsburg dissenting. Newly appointed Justice Brett Kavanaugh did not participate in the decision. It is generally accepted by political scholars, however, that Kavanaugh’s addition to the court means there is a conservative-majority tilt. With the Supreme Court declining to intervene, North Dakota’s voter ID law and its street address requirements will remain in place. However, the U.S. Supreme Court didn’t make a legal determination on the basis of North Dakota’s law. It simply decided not to intervene. Were Native Americans the last to get the right to vote? The graphic also said, "Native Americans were the last to get the right to vote, and now they are the first to lose it." That’s partially accurate, but the timeline of American voting rights is far less cut-and-dried than that statement might suggest. Over the course of history, all but a very small segment of the people who live in the U.S. have had to fight for the right to vote. At the nation’s founding in 1776, only property-owning Protestants over the age of 21 (most of whom were white and male) were given the right to vote. Everyone else had to see laws changed in order to cast a ballot. In 1870, the passage of the 15th Amendment meant that, in theory, African-American men could vote. In 1920, the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote. In 1924, the Indian Citizenship Act gave Native Americans citizenship rights, including the right to vote. And in 1952, the McCarren-Walter Act eliminated laws that prevented Asians from becoming naturalized citizens, which included voting rights. In each case, however, the law on the books didn’t necessarily reflect what was happening when people showed up at their polling places to try to cast a ballot. In reality, Native Americans were turned away from casting ballots in New Mexico and Arizona until 1948, when courts ruled in their favor against state government. In Utah, Native Americans weren’t allowed to vote until 1957, becoming the last of America’s indigenous people to be formally recognized as citizens. But it wasn’t until President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that the United States applied strong legal spackle to the question of voting rights, filling in the many holes and cracks that, for hundreds of years, permitted elections officials to discriminate against citizens who sought to cast a ballot on Election Day. The new law was primarily championed by black Civil Rights leaders, but it ultimately extended protections to people of all backgrounds by prohibiting poll taxes, literacy tests, election fraud and voter intimidation — tactics that had been used to thwart Native Americans from voting. Does a PO Box really mean you can’t vote? Occupy Democrats’ graphic claimed that because of the Supreme Court’s decision, Native Americans in North Dakota who only have PO boxes will be unable to vote. However, news reports show that tribal officials and a voting rights advocacy group called Four Directions are working with the Secretary of State’s office to pave ways for those who have PO boxes to be able to go to their polling places with other documentation that will allow them to cast their ballots. These include efforts to help residents secure other acceptable forms of ID to present at the polls. The Associated Press on Oct. 19 reported that "tribal officials can issue a tribal voting letter with the eligible voter's name, date of birth and residential address at polling locations on reservations," a proposal that Deputy Secretary of State Jim Silrum said would be considered valid ID. In her dissent, Justice Ginsburg noted that the numbers of North Dakota residents who are affected by this change is significant: "1) 70,000 North Dakota residents -- about 20 percent of the turnout in a regular quadrennial election -- lack qualifying ID; and 2) approximately 18,000 residents lack supplemental documentation sufficient to permit them to vote without an ID." That means that voting rights advocates have a huge job ahead of them to ensure those affected by the law are able to go to the polls with acceptable ID. Our ruling Occupy Democrats said that the U.S. Postal Service only gives tribal residents PO Boxes and that because the Supreme Court decided not to intervene in North Dakota’s voter ID law, Native Americans will lose the right to vote. While rural tribal residents in North Dakota are issued PO Boxes for addresses, it is not true that all tribal residents only have PO Boxes. And a conservative-leaning court did rule to let stand a new North Dakota voter ID law that requires a voter to bring a form of identification with them to the polls that includes their legal name, date of birth and current residential street address — but the new ninth member did not participate. North Dakota’s law does pose obstacles for many tribal citizens who don’t have street addresses. However, through the work of voter rights advocates and officials with the Secretary of State’s office, there are ways that Native American voters who have PO boxes instead of residential street addresses will be able to vote. The law does not mean they are losing their right to vote altogether. The group also said that Native Americans were the last U.S. citizens to be granted the right to vote and the first to lose them. Native Americans in Utah were the last ethnic group to be recognized by both state and federal law as citizens with voting rights. But it wasn’t until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that federal law more thoroughly addressed issues of voter discrimination for all people, giving underrepresented voters of many ethnicities the actual right and means to vote.

pomt-00011	"We had a waiting list in Chittenden County when I came into office of about 700. ... We opened a new treatment hub in St. Albans, and it reduced that number to zero."	half-true	/vermont/statements/2018/nov/08/phil-scott/vermonts-governor-inflating-his-record-when-it-com/	The Department of Health estimates about 8,000 people in the state are in treatment for opioid use disorder. The state has had wait times for treatment off and on for more than five years and has struggled to ensure that professionals can meet the demand. During his successful re-election campaign, Republican Gov. Phil Scott touted his administration's overwhelming success in fighting opioid addiction. "We had a waiting list (for drug treatment) in Chittenden County when I came into office of about 700," Scott said at a gubernatorial debate in Rutland last month. "We opened a new treatment hub in St. Albans, and it reduced that number to zero." That gave us pause – did waitlists for treatment in Chittenden plummet from 700 to zero during Scott’s tenure? We asked the campaign for evidence to back up the candidate’s claims, but we never heard back. The Vermont Department of Health, however, closely tracks waitlists at the state’s six "hubs," the regional centers where people addicted to opioids can get high-intensity medication-assisted treatment. State data indicates the governor is off on the original waitlist number – by several hundred. In January 2017, when Scott took office, there were 145 people on hub waitlists statewide, and only 134 on the waitlist for the Chittenden hub. Hubs are the lynchpin of Vermont’s hub-and-spoke drug treatment model. Drug treatment is typically initiated at hubs, where people suffering from opioid abuse disorder can get daily doses of their medication, along with counseling and referrals to social services. Less intensive services are provided at so-called "spokes," a collection of about 90 providers made up of doctor’s offices and community clinics, where patients can get follow-up care. The numbers tracked by the state do show a precipitous decline in waitlists at hubs since 2017. In fact, in 2018, there were no waitlists for treatment at any hubs in March, May, June, July and August, the last month for which data is available. In Chittenden County, the state hasn’t counted a single person on a waitlist at the Howard Center’s Chittenden Clinic, the regional hub for Chittenden and Addison counties, from September 2017 to August 2018, except for one blip in April 2018, when two people were on the waitlist. Dana Poverman, the director of Medication Assisted Treatment at the Howard Center Chittenden Clinic, said the number on the waitlist is still zero. "We’ve really come a long way in terms of access to medicine-assisted treatment," she said. That’s thanks in large part, Poverman said, to the opening of the state’s sixth hub in St. Albans and a dramatic increase in spoke providers. Less is known about what waitlists look like at Vermont’s spokes. The state doesn’t formally track how many people might be waiting for treatment from providers. Beth Tanzman, the executive director of the Blueprint for Health, which oversees the spokes, says the state has "a pretty good sense of what access looks like" through regular check-ins. "Our understanding right now is that we are able to get everyone into care easily within 72 hours," she said. In Chittenden County, people are typically able to access same-day treatment, Tanzman said. In Middlebury and Springfield, where there is a dearth of spoke providers, immediate care is more difficult to obtain. Our ruling In trumpeting Vermont’s success tackling the opioid epidemic, Scott said waitlists for treatment in Chittenden County had fallen from about 700 to zero. He’s right that, according to available data, there is basically no longer a waitlist for treatment at Chittenden’s regional hub at the Howard Center. But he’s completely off the mark when it comes to how long the waitlist was when he first came into office. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-12463	"We have got 20 million folks out there across this land who have told the federal government, ‘Phooey, nonsense, I’m not going to participate in your program, because it doesn’t do what I need done.’ "	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/may/08/tom-price/tom-price-misleads-obamacare-tax-penalty/	Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price argued that people are currently uninsured because they don’t like Obamacare. "When I talk to the doctors that I used to practice with right here in Atlanta, what they tell me is that the current system isn't working for them or for their patients," Price said in a May 7 interview on CNN’s State of the Union. "We have got 20 million folks out there across this land who have told the federal government, ‘Phooey, nonsense, I'm not going to participate in your program because it doesn't do what I need done," he said. "So, they are paying a penalty. They're paying the IRS a fine or a penalty because the federal government is dictating to them what they don't want to do, or they are saying, give me a waiver." Price’s characterization leaves out a lot. Many of the 20 million are likely uninsured not as a personal preference, but because they still can’t find coverage. Penalty under the Affordable Care Act The Affordable Care Act includes an individual mandate to urge people to obtain health care coverage. The mandate that began in 2014 penalizes individuals for each month they lack health insurance that meets the minimum essential coverage. The penalty is assessed on tax returns and increases every year a person remains uninsured. The fee is whichever is higher: 2.5 percent of household income or $695 per adult or $347.50 per child. The mandate has many exemptions depending on income, membership in groups like Indian tribes, and incarceration. If individuals don’t fall into those categories, the health insurance marketplace lays out 14 categories that exempt people from the financial penalty if they cannot afford it, such as being homeless or filing for bankruptcy. The American Health Care Act passed by the House May 4 gets rid of the individual mandate, one of the least popular provisions of the law. In January, the Internal Revenue Service reported that in 2016 about 80 percent of taxpayers -- 117 million -- indicated on tax forms that they had qualifying coverage all year while about 12.7 million taxpayers claimed one or more exemptions. The most common exemption was for people who earned below a certain threshold in a state that didn’t expand Medicaid. Additionally, the IRS reported that 6.5 million taxpayers were paying a fine instead of getting insurance. Add that to the people who claimed exemptions from the penalty, and that totals 19.2 million, close to Price’s 20 million. Still, that means just over 60 percent of the 20 million who aren’t insured are claiming exemptions. Steven Ullmann, director of the University of Miami’s Department of Health Sector Management and Policy, said millions of people struggle to find coverage because they aren’t eligible for Medicaid due to states not expanding Medicaid. There are also those who don’t qualify for the federal subsidy to purchase insurance through the exchanges. "They are uninsured because there is no way that they can afford the insurance," he said. "Then there are others, generally the ‘young invincibles,’ who find that the penalty of $695 is less than the cost of the insurance policies (generally over $2,000 a year)," he said. "They’d rather go bare and take their chances." The penalty hasn’t had its intended effect of driving people to sign up for health care, said Joseph J. Thorndike, director of the Tax History Project at Tax Analysts. "To be effective, the penalty almost certainly needs to be bigger," he said. "And for a lot of obvious political reasons, that sort of tougher penalty is not in the cards now, nor was it plausible when the ACA was drafted. A weak penalty was the original sin of Obamacare." Price's office didn't respond to our queries. His claim is similar to a statement by President Donald Trump at a Feb. 27 meeting with health insurance company executives. "It's gotten so bad that nearly 20 million Americans have chosen to pay the penalty or received an exemption rather than buy insurance," Trump said. (That claim was debunked by fact-checkers including the Washington Post and CNN.) On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order that gave federal agencies broad authority to defer or delay any part of the Affordable Care Act that costs anybody any money, including the penalty. The IRS said in February that it was reviewing Trump’s order "but that legislative provisions of the ACA law are still in force until changed by the Congress, and taxpayers remain required to follow the law and pay what they may owe‎." Our ruling Price said, "We have got 20 million folks out there across this land who have told the federal government, ‘Phooey, nonsense, I’m not going to participate in your program, because it doesn’t do what I need done.’ " Price mentioned the number of people who are either paying a fine because they don't have insurance or who are claiming an exemption, usually because they don't qualify for affordable coverage. About 6.5 million taxpayers reported the penalty in 2016 tax filings, and 12.7 million taxpayers claimed one or more exemptions, bringing the total to about 20 million. But Price makes it sound like all of those people are simply declining coverage. In reality, many can't qualify for affordable coverage, even if they would like to. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-10905	"U.S. Steel just announced that they are building six new steel mills."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/aug/02/donald-trump/us-steel-not-opening-six-new-mills-donald-trump/	President Donald Trump has boasted about big growth in the steel industry at campaign-style rallies this summer. "U.S. Steel just announced that they are building six new steel mills," Trump said July 31 in Tampa. "And that number is soon going to be lifted, but I'm not allowed to say that, so I won't." Trump repeated the company would open six major facilities at a roundtable in Minnesota on June 20 and again at a lunch with members of Congress on June 26. That was one mill down from when he said the company was going to open seven on July 27. That would be huge news, given the company only has four steelmaking facilities in the United States. But there’s no evidence on their website that any new mills are on the horizon. Meghan Cox, a spokeswoman for U.S. Steel, told us that Trump wasn’t privy to any exclusive information. "All of our operational changes have been publicly announced and all information shared with the federal government has been properly disclosed and made available on our website," Cox said. (The White House did not respond to our request for comment.) Cox pointed to several projects U.S. Steel announced this year. That includes plans to invest $275 million to $325 million in capital projects, announced in February; to construct a new steel-coating line to help PRO-TEC, a subsidiary, make cars in Leipsic, Ohio; and to restart two blast furnaces that will create 800 new jobs at an integrated steel-making plant in Granite City. The company idled those furnaces in 2015, laying off about 2,000 workers. Mills are complex operations, so we asked William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, whether a single plant might be easily mistaken for multiple plants. "On its face, it makes no sense," Reinsch said. "A plant is a plant, not a division of something or part of a facility. I don’t see how you get to six from anything I know." None of those are new plants, but they represent investment and job-creating activities. That said, other American steelmakers have announced new mills and re-openings this year. Nucor, a steel manufacturer, announced in November it would open a steel rebar micro-mill in Sedalia, Mo., creating 250 full-time jobs. Nucor will build another mill in Frostproof, Fla., the company announced in March. Liberty Steel bought and is preparing to reopen a steel mill in Georgetown, S.C. The mill was shuttered by its previous owners in 2015. And Big River Steel is investing $1.2 billion to expand its Arkansas steel plant. U.S. Steel CEO David Burritt did not address the mysterious six mills in a second quarter conference call with investors Aug. 2. But Burditt affirmed Trump's support for the steel industry. "We had an incredibly exciting visit form the president, and his daughter was there as well, and I can tell you the commitment that he has to steel is unprecedented, and the notion that this guy would blink, I think, is not going to happen," Burritt said. "He knows this kind of unfairness should been taken care of long ago. He’s got us, he’s with us." Our ruling Trump said, "U.S. Steel just announced that they are building six new steel mills." Between restarts, new mills and expansions, the steel industry has seen significant investment this year. But Trump is wrong. U.S. Steel is restarting two shuttered mills. Other companies are re-opening or building a few other mills. We rate Trump’s statement False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2018-08-02T12:00:29	2018-07-31	['None']

pomt-13581	Says Arizona congressional candidate Ray Strauss is "a ‘Champion of Big Government’ for his votes to raise taxes while on the local city council."	half-true	/arizona/statements/2016/aug/18/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-claims-arizona-congressional-candidate/	Former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin expressed her discontent for Republicans in name only, or RINOs, while talking about Arizona’s District 4 congressional race. The Aug. 30 Republican primary is a two-man contest between three-term incumbent U.S. Rep. Paul Gosar of Prescott and challenger Ray Strauss of Buckeye, whom Palin called a "malleable politician" willing to compromise. "In other words, to sell us out, raise taxes, and spend more of your hard-earned money," Palin said in an Aug. 11 Facebook post supporting Gosar. "Dr. Gosar's opponent is actually classified by Americans for Prosperity for being a ‘Champion of Big Government' for his votes to raise taxes while on the local city council." Palin was referring to Strauss, who served on the Buckeye City Council from June 2010 through May 2016. We wondered whether Palin’s claims against Gosar’s opponent held any weight. Not for taxes We did not hear back from Palin or Strauss, but Gosar campaign spokesman Tom Van Flein pointed us to the Americans for Prosperity's 2016 scorecard. This conservative group, which advocates for limited government, annually grades local and state politicians based on their fiscal voting record. Their scale ranges from Hero of the Taxpayer to Hero of Big Government: According to his most recent scorecard for calendar year 2015, AFP did give Strauss a grade of "Champion of Big Government." But that doesn’t tell the whole story. In June 2015, the Buckeye City Council unanimously approved a $258 million budget for fiscal year 2015-16, $73 million more than the previous fiscal year. "The (sic) rating in calendar year 2015 was for voting for a 39 percent increase in the city’s approved budget, from $185 million in fiscal year 2015 to $258 million in fiscal year 2016," Americans for Prosperity Arizona state director Tom Jenney said. However, Strauss -- and the rest of the council -- did not vote to increase taxes. They actually approved a lower property tax rate of $1,800 per $100,000 of accessed property value. Despite a lower tax rate, some homeowners may still pay more in taxes if their home is worth more, but it varies. "It’s the assessed value on any given property that dictates whether someone’s overall taxes increase or decrease," said Buckeye finance director Larry Price. "She got her years wrong or just flat out missed it." Moreover, while Strauss did get a "Champion of Big Government" rating for calendar year 2015, from calendar year 2007 through calendar year 2015, he averaged a score of -1, or "Needs Much Improvement." And in calendar year 2014, AFP actually gave him a "Friend of the Taxpayer" rating. We also examined the minutes for all the Buckeye City Council meetings in 2015 and found that Strauss voted against resolutions thought to be pro-government. In August 2015, he voted against two resolutions for city employee raises, including one that would give raises to employees based on the city’s financial scope. By comparison, Gosar received a perfect score from AFP, as his congressional votes coincided with the group’s position. Our ruling Palin said, "Dr. Gosar's opponent is actually classified by Americans for Prosperity for being a ‘Champion of Big Government' for his votes to raise taxes while on the local city council." That’s misleading and leaves out important context. The opponent in question, Ray Strauss, did not vote to raise taxes that year while on the Buckeye City Council. And while the group did give him that rating in 2015, it wasn't a lifetime rating. Palin cherry-picks one year. On average, he has a much more moderate score from AFP.

"The president has been very clear," Gidley said Feb. 12. "All forms of abuse, all forms of battery against women are deplorable and disgusting." Fox and Friends co-host Brian Kilmeade interjected, "But he hasn’t said that." "You haven’t talked to him today," Gidley said. "Obviously, he’s said that multiple times in the past. I’ve talked to the president about issues surrounding this type of behavior and he finds it disgusting." Still, whatever Trump's private thoughts might be, he has held his tongue in the present controversy involving his former aide Rob Porter. Trump did sign a statement about domestic violence. On Sept. 30, 2017, he proclaimed October 2017 as National Domestic Violence Awareness Month. "I call on all Americans to promote the safety and liberty of the women, men, and children who are subjected to violent, intimidating, or controlling behavior at the hands of those closest to them," the proclamation read. "Each of us must be a voice for those suffering in silence and must speak up when we see signs of physical or emotional abuse. Together we can bolster victims’ support networks and encourage and empower them to report offenses." That was one of more than 100 proclamations Trump has signed on topics ranging from National Financial Accountability Month to Irish-American Heritage Month. On domestic violence, publicly, Trump has yet to follow through on his own call to action. We searched the Nexis news database. We looked through his tweets. ​We found nothing that came from him in his own words recently and clearly decrying domestic abuse as a disgusting act. The closest we found was in 2015 when Trump attacked Hillary Clinton for her husband’s behavior. "If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong," he tweeted Dec. 28, 2015. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Two years earlier, Trump chastised the military for failing to curtail rape and domestic violence within its ranks. "Army officer who led a sexual abuse prevention unit was just fired after being charged with violently going after his wife. What is going on," Trump tweeted May 17, 2013. He continued with, "General says that the Armed Forces will be severely weakened if the large scale rape and sexual abuse problem is not brought under control." The White House pointed to Trump’s 2012 comment related to singer Rihanna’s personal life. "If @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish," Trump tweeted Oct. 11, 2012. "A beater is always a beater--just watch!" See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com There are press reports that in private Trump has taken a more negative view, though we can't independently verify them because they are based on anonymous sources. Significantly, Trump praised Porter in public after he resigned. "He did a very good job when he was in the White House," Trump told the TV cameras Feb. 9. "And we hope he has a wonderful career, and hopefully he will have a great career ahead of him. But it was very sad when we heard about it. And, certainly, he’s also very sad." Even some Republicans have said they want more from Trump. In an interview with CNN on Feb. 13, Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, said "abuse is never okay" and should not be tolerated among employees. Asked if the president is sending that signal, Ernst said, "I think he needs to send a stronger message, a stronger message." Our ruling Gidley said that on many occasions, Trump has said that abuse of women is disgusting and deplorable. Trump may have said such things privately, but his public stance has been quite different. Trump did sign a proclamation on domestic violence and — years ago, on Twitter — berated the military for allowing rape and abuse to undermine military readiness. But Trump has not conveyed his personal thoughts against domestic abuse when asked about the Porter case directly, and Gidley's comment left viewers with the wrong idea. Instead, Trump came out against a rush to judgment against those broadly accused of taking advantage of women, which might include physical abuse. And he described Porter's situation as "very sad" and wished him well in his career. If there’s a pattern of Trump decrying violence against women, it hasn’t left much of a visible trail.

pomt-14492	"A couple of debates ago, (Donald Trump) said if you don’t support socialized health care, you’re heartless."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/25/ted-cruz/cruz-invents-trump-statement-socialized-medicine/	In a free-for-all Republican debate in Houston, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz attacked frontrunner Donald Trump for his position on health care. "For decades, Donald has been advocating socialized medicine," Cruz said. "What he said is the government should pay for everyone’s health care. And in fact, a couple of debates ago, he said if you don’t support socialized health care, you’re heartless." Did Trump actually say that about socialized medicine? In a Republican debate? No. We looked at the transcripts going back a couple of months to the debate in Las Vegas on Dec. 15, 2015. We found Trump never used those words, nor anything close to them. There was an exchange in the Feb. 6 debate in Manchester, N.H., when socialized medicine came up, but it didn’t happen the way Cruz said. A question from panelist Mary Katherine Ham started the exchange. Ham: "Mr. Trump, you have said you want to repeal Obamacare. You have also said, quote, ‘Everybody’s got to be covered,’ adding, quote, ‘The government’s going to pay for it.’ Are you closer to Bernie Sanders’ vision for health care than Hillary Clinton’s?" Trump: "I don’t think I am. I think I’m closer to common sense. We are going to repeal Obamacare. We’re going to repeal Obamacare. We are going to replace Obamacare with something so much better." Trump talked with ABC moderator Martha Raddatz at the same debate about increasing competition among private insurance companies and he praised health savings accounts. He finished his answer this way: Trump: "What I do say is, there will be a certain number of people that will be on the street dying and as a Republican, I don’t want that to happen. We’re going to take care of people that are dying on the street because there will be a group of people that are not going to be able to even think in terms of private or anything else, and we’re going to take care of those people. "And I think everybody on this stage would have to agree, you’re not going to let people die, sitting in the middle of a street in any city in this country." Raddatz: "Sen. Cruz, to that point, Mr. Trump has said that your position on health care means that maybe you’ve got, quote, ‘no heart.’ There is a question here, though, about uncovered folks. You suggested repealing and replacing Obamacare. As we learned with President Obama’s broken promise that everyone could keep their plan, any major plan — change in health care policy carries with it the risk that some people will lose their insurance coverage or have to change it. How do you reassure that those people that repealing and replacing Obamacare is still in their best interest?" Cruz: "Well, let me take two different parts of that. Let me start with socialized medicine. Socialized medicine is a disaster. It does not work. If you look at the countries that have imposed socialized medicine, that have put the government in charge of providing medicine, what inevitably happens is rationing." For the record, in the Dec. 15, 2015, debate, Trump called the country’s health care a "disaster. In the Jan. 14, 2016, debate, Trump said, "Our health care is a horror show. Obamacare, we’re going to repeal it and replace it." Government’s role Cruz also asserted that Trump had said the government should pay for everyone’s health care. We asked the Cruz campaign for their sources and didn’t hear back. But in an interview on CBS News’ 60 Minutes in September 2015, Trump did say, "Everybody's got to be covered." However, in context he was talking about people who don’t make enough money to pay for insurance. Asked what he would do and who would pay, Trump said, "I would make a deal with existing hospitals to take care of people (and) the government's gonna pay for it." It’s clear from the full interview that Trump did not say that the government should pay for everyone’s health care. He made that point again in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on Jan. 31, 2016, saying that Cruz’s attacks showed "maybe he’s got no heart." Back in 1999, Trump did support a single-payer health care system for America. In his 2000 book The America We Deserve, he said, "We need, as a nation, to reexamine the single-payer plan, as many individual states are doing." Trump does not hold that belief today. Our ruling Cruz said that Trump said in a recent debate that "if you don’t support socialized health care, you’re heartless." Trump did not say those words, or anything like them, in any recent debate. He advanced the idea of more competition among private insurance companies, and he said that government should take care of those who can’t afford insurance. While there was a time in the past when Trump supported a single-payer plan, there’s no substance to Cruz’s statement. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-04508	"Right now, the (Congressional Budget Office) says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/04/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-20-million-will-lose-health-insur/	During the first presidential debate in Denver, Mitt Romney criticized President Barack Obama’s health care law by saying, "Right now, the (Congressional Budget Office) says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year." While PolitiFact does not put predictions to the Truth-O-Meter, we do fact-check whether politicians or pundits accurately portray the predictions made by others. We did so in June, when Romney made a similar claim in a speech -- that "Obamacare … means that for up to 20 million Americans, they will lose the insurance they currently have, the insurance that they like and they want to keep." We rated that claim False. We’ll take another look at the claim here. Cherry-picking the CBO report When we checked with the Romney campaign last June, a spokesman said the source of Romney’s claim was a March 2012 study by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress. The Romney campaign re-confirmed that source after the debate. The CBO study was undertaken to estimate the impact of the health care law on the number of people obtaining health care coverage from their employer. CBO came up with a "baseline" estimate -- its best guess. CBO settled on a range of 3 million to 5 million fewer non-elderly people obtaining coverage through their employer each year from 2019 through 2022 than would have been the case before the law was passed. Including those with individually purchased policies means a decline of an additional 1 million to 3 million Americans. That’s nothing to sneeze at, but it’s quite a bit lower than 20 million. So where did 20 million come from? CBO supplemented its "baseline" estimate with four alternative, and wildly divergent, estimates. One resulted in a net gain of 3 million people with employer-sponsored insurance. The other scenarios resulted in a decline of 10 million, a decline of 12 million, and -- here it is -- a decline of 20 million. A number of other estimates by groups other than CBO have tracked with CBO’s baseline estimate, rather than with Romney’s figure. A study by the Urban Institute projected a decline of about 500,000 people. The Lewin Group predicted a decline of about 3 million people. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services actuary pegged the number at about 1 million fewer people. And the RAND Corp. projected that about 4 million more individuals would be covered by employment-based coverage by 2016. So the 20 million number Romney cited does come from CBO, and he hedged by saying "up to." But it’s the most extreme outcome of the five presented, and it’s not the primary estimate. Some who "lose" coverage will do so because they find better options Even beyond the cherry-picking, Romney is wrong to say that 20 million Americans will "lose" their insurance. According to CBO’s "baseline" estimates, 3 million people will spurn their employer’s offer of insurance and turn instead to another source, such as the health insurance "exchanges" created under the Obama health care law. In many cases, they will do this because they consider the employer’s offering to be unaffordable or lacking too many features they need. Romney also ignores 9 million people who wouldn’t have had an employer plan before the Obama law, but who will get employer coverage after passage of the law, perhaps because of the law’s mix of subsidies and penalties for employers. It’s also important to remember the big picture. CBO projects that, overall, the number of uninsured Americans will drop by 29 million to 31 million due to the law. It’s not as if no one ever loses coverage today As we have previously noted, many Americans lose their current health plan for reasons that have nothing to do with the new law, though figuring out exactly how many is surprisingly tricky. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show that, on average, slightly more than 3 percent of employees leave their jobs in any given month. But you don’t have to change jobs to see your plan change. Your employer may change insurance carriers, or the insurance carrier may unilaterally modify the terms of your plan. How common is this? The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found that in 2007, just over 14 percent of the entire U.S. population "switched" health insurance. All told, this churn -- which, to reiterate, is happening because of forces beyond the Obama health care law -- almost certainly dwarfs the scale of the changes Romney is talking about. Even Romney’s cherry-picked number of 20 million amounts to 7 percent of the 270 million non-elderly people in the U.S. CBO’s preferred figure represents an even smaller share -- 1 percent to 2 percent. Our ruling Romney said, "Right now, the (Congressional Budget Office) says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year." That number is cherry-picked, and many of those 20 million will be leaving employer coverage voluntarily for better options. Romney also ignores that under the status quo, many more people today "lose" coverage than even the highest, cherry-picked CBO estimate. We rate his statement False.

pomt-08093	Mt. Hood Community College is No. 1 on average and top faculty pay and benefits.	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2010/dec/15/mt-hood-community-college/mhcc-says-it-cant-afford-salaries-we-can-no-longer/	Administrators and faculty at Mount Hood Community College are negotiating a new contract in a tight budget year. The 2010-11 budget is expected to fall $5 million short of projected needs. Administrators want to curb salaries and benefits, arguing that faculty at the two-year school in Gresham are the most generously compensated in the Northwest. Mt. Hood enrolls about 33,000 students and is in the top five of Oregon's 17 community colleges. It lacks the profile given its larger sisters -- Portland and Clackamas community colleges -- yet, here are two surprising claims from Mt. Hood’s website and press release: MHCC full-time faculty have the highest average pay among all 54 community colleges in Oregon, Washington and Idaho. (Source: National Education Association (NEA) data, April 2010). Based on 2009-10 data, the base salary for full-time faculty at the top step is 8.2 percent above the average of the five comparator schools ($80,864 v. $74,735). The five Oregon community colleges most like MHCC are Chemeketa, Clackamas, Lane, Linn-Benton and Portland. In a Nov. 22 statement, the college says: "We can no longer pay salaries to our most experienced faculty that are far above the average of community colleges in Oregon, Washington and Idaho." PolitiFact Oregon never realized community college pay could be so rewarding to paychecks, and so crushing to a school’s budget. The numbers, we figured, would be easy to vet. In the faculty negotiations section of Mt. Hood’s website is a link to the National Education Association’s higher education salary study, released this spring. The average salary for faculty at Mt. Hood was $69,200 in 2008-09 -- indeed the highest of 17 community colleges in Oregon, 34 community colleges in Washington, and three schools in Idaho. The average benefit at Mt. Hood for the year was $27,800, again the highest of 54 colleges. Total average pay and benefits came to $97,000. For context, average faculty pay at Portland Community College, the state’s largest two-year, was $62,100 with benefits at $23,800 for a total $85,900 in 2008-09. Faculty at Clackamas Community College averaged $66,000 in salary and $24,600 in benefits, for a total $90,600. (It looks as if Mt. Hood and Clackamas were more in line in 2007-08. Average compensation at Mt. Hood was $94,400, and $93,900 at Clackamas. Salaries are based on nine- or 10-month contracts.) So you can check the first claim as True. The second claim is that base salary for full-time faculty at top scale at Mt. Hood was more than 8 percent higher than average top pay of community colleges closest in size to Mt. Hood, in 2009-10. The numbers pencil out, based on Mt. Hood’s figures. The average of top salaries at Clackamas, Chemeketa, Linn-Benton, Lane and Portland community colleges is $74,735, compared with $80,864 at Mt. Hood, or a difference of 8.2 percent. We checked with contracts for the individual schools and confirmed that Mt. Hood’s figures are pretty much correct, with the exception of Lane Community College, which was off by roughly $1,000 so the difference is actually 7.3 percent. In any case, it’s a similar sized gap. But Shannon Valdivia, a speech instructor at Mt. Hood, raises an excellent question of calendar years. Colleges differ in how many days to expect of faculty. So faculty at Mt. Hood and at Portland worked 180-day calendars in 2009-10; Linn-Benton faculty worked 164 days; Chemeketa, Clackamas and Lane had 175 days. Calculate by day, and top earners at Linn-Benton earned the most at $475 a day. Mt. Hood came in second with $449 earned a day. The average of the five schools was $431.24 a day -- or 4 percent less than Mt. Hood’s $449. Now, we’re skipping comparisons based on health benefits because faculty choose different types of plans. But know that Mt. Hood is on the nicer side with faculty kicking in a maximum of $75 a month for family coverage. On a per-day basis, top base pay at Mt. Hood and Linn-Benton are comparable. So we’ll rate claim No. 2 Half True. So, why is pay at Mt. Hood so high? Well, more than half of the 156 faculty at the college are at top scale. That’s a large percentage. Eighty people are in step 1 of a 14-step pay scale; 76 are in steps 2 to 14. The faculty union says some people were hired at too high a step; college administrators say the increase between steps is too big. (Faculty climb from one "step" to the next once a year; people who are at the top step will get cost-of-living adjustments if bargained for.) But that’s neither here nor there. If you combine the two claims together, we rate the overall claim on pay as Mostly True. It’s accurate -- average pay is high in large part because top tier pay is high, and so many people are in that top tier -- but it needs just a tiny bit of additional information on pay broken down by day.

pomt-08982	"We had 2 percent of the global market (for advanced batteries) when he (Obama) started. We now have 16 percent, headed to 40 percent by 2015."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/15/david-axelrod/david-axelrod-says-us-will-have-40-percent-global-/	President Barack Obama has repeatedly stressed the need for the U.S. to get out front in the production of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles. One of the main obstacles has been that few American manufacturers were producing advanced batteries to power those vehicles. The economic stimulus championed by Obama included $2.4 billion to spur the creation of electric vehicle battery and component manufacturing plants. And this week, the White House repeatedly boasted that those investments are starting to pay off. Nine new battery plants have opened with the help of stimulus money, and the White House says four will be operational by the end of the year. The White House says higher-volume domestic manufacturing of advanced batteries will greatly reduce the cost of batteries -- which is crucial if electric vehicles are to become a viable option for car-buyers. On ABC's This Week on July 11, 2010, White House adviser David Axelrod said the stimulus has made the U.S. a global player in the advanced battery market. "He (Obama) is going on Thursday to Michigan to a plant that produces advanced batteries for electric cars," Axelrod said. "We had 2 percent of the global market when he started. We now have 16 percent, headed to 40 percent by 2015, because we helped spur and leverage private investment, and that's what we want to do." That's quite a leap, and so we decided to check it out. The first part of Axelrod's equation -- that the U.S. had 2 percent of the global market at the start of the Obama presidency -- is defensible. There wasn't much advanced battery production being done then, except for hybrid electric vehicles. And, at that time, according to a 2008 report from the Department of Energy, only one company was assembling batteries in the U.S. for mass-produced vehicles. They were making batteries for the Saturn Vue. The Ford Escape Hybrid was being assembled in the U.S., but the batteries came from Asia. In any case, that one company, Cobasys, commanded a 2 percent share of the batteries supplied in 2008, according to the report. As for where Axelrod got the other figures -- that "we now have 16 percent, headed to 40 percent by 2015" -- the White House press office pointed us toward a Deutsche Bank study of announced capacity to produce lithium ion batteries. The study projected the U.S. would have 20 percent by 2012 and up to 40 percent by 2015. Unlike Axelrod, the White House press office noted that these estimates are about capacity, not actual production. The projection of capacity by Deutsche Bank "pretty well matches with the other projections of announced capacity," said Mike Millikin, editor of the Green Car Congress. "The Administration has certainly put its money toward boosting U.S. capacity," Millikin said. "However, what ultimately matters is production and purchases." In fact, many industry experts say capacity will far exceed demand for, and production of, advanced batteries. In April, 2010, Menahem Anderman, founder and chief executive of Total Battery Consulting, issued a report on plug-in hybrids (PHEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs) based on-site interviews with top technologists and executives at 20 major automakers and 15 current and prospective battery suppliers on three continents. "The government’s stimulus money will create severe overcapacity from 2013 on," Anderman told PolitiFact. "There is no market for the capacity planned." That's because demand for the cars is limited by high up-front cost and still-evolving battery technology. "Unfortunately the mass EV and PHEV market at current gasoline pricing and battery technology status (cost, performance and life) will require unaffordable heavy subsidies to carmakers, battery makers and the consumer," Anderman said. And because the market is so dependent on government subsidies, he said, it is risky. "Our projections are that the combined EV/PHEV world new vehicle market will be on the order of 200,000 vehicles in 2015 and 1 million in 2020," Anderman said. "The government-paid battery plants that are supposed to be operational by 2013 will be heavily underutilized for years; they will have enough capacity to support the 2020 U.S. market." "Indeed the U.S. will have many unutilized plants," Anderman predicted. "The major Japanese players (Sanyo, Panasonic, Hitachi) hesitate to invest in EV batteries since they are skeptical about the EV market." Any suggestion that sales of actual batteries will follow announced planned capacity is naive, he said. Many companies that received stimulus money don't have a proven battery ready for mass production and are at least several years away from being qualified by major car companies. And with no experience running a high-volume automated Lithium Ion battery plant, Anderman said, most of the companies will face a slow and costly learning curve. "Nobody can predict market share for 2015, but I will be surprised if U.S. will get much more than 10 percent," Anderman said. "There are 5 major Japanese suppliers and two Korean that are 10 years ahead in manufacturing experience." The Freedonia Group, a Cleveland-based industry market research firm, estimated that in 2017, the U.S. will command 9 percent of the world market (dollar-wise) for lithium-based rechargeable batteries, including those for electric vehicles. Our biggest issue with Axelrod's claim is that he mixes two different statistics. The 2 percent figure represents actual production; the 16 percent, going to 40 percent by 2015, figures are for capacity. Those are two different things. In a July 15, 2010, speech at a new advanced battery factory in Holland, Mich., which was seeded with stimulus cash, Obama worded the statistic more carefully. "Just a few years ago, American businesses manufactured only 2 percent of the world’s advanced batteries for electric and hybrid vehicles -- 2 percent," Obama said. "But because of what’s happening in places like this, in just five years we’ll have up to 40 percent of the world’s capacity -- 40 percent." It takes a careful ear to discern that he's talking about two different statistics. And presented back-to-back, as they were, we think it's misleading. In fact, here's how a White House press release about advanced battery investments in the stimulus stated the statistic this week: "Pre-Recovery Act, the U.S. produced just 2 percent of the world’s batteries for advanced vehicles, but due to Recovery Act investments, the U.S. will have the capacity to produce 20 percent of these batteries by 2012 and up to 40 percent by 2015 - that’s a jump from 2 percent to 40 percent in a span of just five years." No, it's not a jump from 2 to 40. The 2 percent was a production number. The 40 percent is a capacity number. It remains to be seen how much of that capacity will be utilized. But most market analysts predict that the U.S. share of the advanced battery market -- actual sales of advanced batteries -- will be much lower than 40 percent. We rate Axelrod's comment Half True.

"Maybe I'm missing something but comeback to what? You know the most recent jobs report [shows] that New Jersey lost over 11,000 private-sector jobs in March. Comeback to being one of only eight states in the nation to lose jobs. Being the state with the highest loss of jobs in the nation. I don't know how that plays in a poll but I can tell you it doesn't sit right with New Jerseyans." Though Buono initially cited private-sector job loss, she said her comments referred to overall jobs. Either way, she’s wrong to claim that New Jersey was "one of only eight states in the nation to lose jobs" in March, PolitiFact New Jersey found. While New Jersey’s national ranking differs slightly in March between total jobs and private-sector jobs, the state fared poorly by both measures. But highlighting job loss in one month ignores a larger trend: the state has added jobs in the past year. Buono’s office provided an April 20 blog post from the liberal New Jersey Policy Perspective to back her claims. The post said New Jersey "was one of only eight states in the country to lose jobs in March." That’s not true. New Jersey Policy Perspective corrected the post after we contacted them about it. New Jersey and 19 other states lost jobs in March, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. The unemployment rate increased in eight states, but other factors -- such as the size of the labor force -- impact that measure. New Jersey’s unemployment rate remained at 9 percent in March. So Buono’s wrong on that point. Her other claim isn't as straightforward. In March, New Jersey lost 11,600 private-sector jobs, more than any other state. But Buono said her comments referred to total jobs. Because of gains in government employment, the state’s total job loss was 8,600 in March. Only Ohio lost more jobs overall that month. Since a state’s population can skew rankings of net figures, it’s also important to note percentage growth or loss when talking about jobs. Wyoming and Maine fared worse than New Jersey by that measure for private-sector jobs and total jobs. So New Jersey had the "highest loss of jobs in the nation" in one category, but not the one Buono said she was referring to. Still, the state’s job loss ranks among the worst in the nation in March by any measure. Looking at the larger employment picture in New Jersey, Buono’s statement ignores the fact that the state has added 38,300 total jobs in the last year, from March 2011 to March 2012. The state posted job gains in nine of the last 12 months. Buono said in an e-mail: "Regarding your objection to drawing the inference discrediting the governor's claims of NJ ‘comeback’ let me say this. Job loss is one of the most important indicators of any economic recovery. The figures I used contrast with the governor's constant refrain of a ‘NJ Comeback.’" Our ruling While criticizing Christie, Buono said New Jersey was "one of only eight states in the nation to lose jobs" and "the state with the highest loss of jobs in the nation." Though she preceded those comments by citing private-sector job loss in March, Buono said her statements referred to overall job loss in that month. Either way, 20 states lost jobs in March, not eight. New Jersey ranked, in both net and percentage terms, among the worst states for job loss in March. But in the last year the state added jobs. On the Truth-O-Meter, this statement rates Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Barbara Buono	None	None	None	2012-05-13T07:30:00	2012-05-07	['None']

pomt-06133	"We have one of the highest percentages per capita of nonprofits in this state of any state in the union."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/dec/25/anne-nolan/esident-rhode-islands-largest-homeless-shelter-say/	Times are tough for nonprofits. Financing from state and federal sources is down and people generally have less to give than before the recession. Anne Nolan, president of Crossroads Rhode Island, which operates the state’s largest homeless shelter, knows this first hand. On a recent episode of WJAR's "10 News Conference," she said that while more people are in need, there’s less money out there to help them. That’s undoubtedly true across the country, but, said Nolan, the problem in Rhode Island is exacerbated. "We have one of the highest percentages per capita of nonprofits in this state of any state in the union," she said on the show that aired Nov. 27. "There is a limited amount of funding, a limited number of donors out there, and that waters it all down." The Providence Journal reported Dec. 18 that donations to Crossroads were down in recent months in part because of its support of EngageRI, a business-backed group that pushed for an overhaul of the state retirement system. But we were also interested in Nolan's claim that because the state has such a high concentration of nonprofits, there’s greater competition here for financing than in other states. When we asked Nolan where she got her information, she said she thought it came from a study on Rhode Island’s nonprofit sector done either by the United Way of Rhode Island or the Rhode Island Foundation. The Rhode Island Foundation did publish a study in August on the state’s many nonprofits. According to the report, the number of active nonprofits registered with the secretary of state’s office in 2011 is 7,306. That sounds like a lot. But the list isn’t made up only of charities, foundations or social services groups. It also includes condominium associations, sports teams, religious groups and professional associations. Most are small. Two-thirds operate with budgets and assets of less than $100,000. The report also said that nonprofits employ more than 18 percent of Rhode Island’s labor force, tying us with New York as the states with the highest percentage of people working at nonprofits. That seems logical considering the high number of colleges and universities in Rhode Island and the large hospitals located here. But the report doesn’t make any comparisons among states based on the number of nonprofits per capita. The United Way published the results of a survey of Rhode Island nonprofit health and human service providers in March 2009. The survey focused on fiscal issues and how organizations’ finances were being affected by the recession. Sixty percent of the 230 respondents reported a decrease in total income over the prior year. The survey sheds some light on the struggles of nonprofits, but it doesn’t take up the per capita question either. We didn’t give up. We knew there must be some organization that keeps track of this sort of thing. That organization, it turns out, is the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan Washington, D.C.-based public policy think tank that was established in 1968 by the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson. It keeps track of a range of statistics on nonprofits through its National Center for Charitable Statistics. A search of the institute’s website found a table titled "Number of Registered Nonprofit Organizations by State, 2008" -- the most recent year for data -- which was based on 990 Form filings with the Internal Revenue Service. According to the table, Rhode Island had 7,200 registered nonprofits in 2008, of which 4,959 were 501(c)(3) organizations, which include charities, foundations, hospitals, universities and social services groups such as Crossroads. Using an estimated 2008 population for Rhode Island of 1,050,788, the chart calculated a figure of 68.5 nonprofits per 10,000 people and 47.2 501(c)(3) groups per 10,000 people. That ranked Rhode Island 11th in the nation for nonprofits per capita and 8th for 501(c)(3) groups. Not surprisingly, Washington, D.C., ranked first with 250.3 nonprofits per 10,000 people and 158 501(c)(3) groups. But that number is skewed because many of the groups registered in the nation’s capital have a national or international focus. Most of the other states in the top 10 are geographically large with small populations, such as Montana (second in both categories), North Dakota (fifth in both categories) and South Dakota (sixth in the former category and seventh in the latter). The national average was 49.8 nonprofits per 10,000 people and 35.3 501(c)(3) groups. The Urban Institute also has interesting figures on charitable contributions that relate to Nolan’s larger point about an increasingly tough funding environment. Based on IRS data on tax returns, the average charitable contribution made by a Rhode Island individual dropped from $926 in 2004 to $787 in 2009. That brought Rhode Island’s ranking for the size of an individual’s charitable contribution down from 37th in the nation to 45th. In comparison, the average contribution in Massachusetts was $1,143 in 2009, which ranked 19th, and in Connecticut, it was $1,517, which ranked 4th. Our ruling Nolan’s point that Rhode Island nonprofits are having a more difficult time raising money is valid. People just aren’t giving as much these days. Whether Rhode Island has one of the highest per capita numbers of nonprofits is open to interpretation. The state isn’t among the top five in the country. It’s just outside the top 10. But the state does have the eighth-highest number of 501(c)(3) organizations per capita. These are the groups, like Crossroads, that provide health and social services and are the type that people probably think of when it comes to nonprofits. For that reason, we believe Nolan has a point, but her statement needed further explanation. We rule the claim Mostly True. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-02165	"PolitiFact Texas gave" a David Dewhurst TV ad "a ‘Pants-on-Fire’ rating as an outrageous lie."	half-true	/texas/statements/2014/may/01/dan-patrick/dan-patrick-tv-ad-incorrectly-says-pants-fire-slap/	In TV spots and a voter mailer, state Sen. Dan Patrick declares the Texas Truth-O-Meter found his opponent’s latest TV ad, hammering Patrick’s past financial troubles, to be a lie. That’s curious because we haven’t rated a full ad from anyone lately, including the anti-Patrick ad launched in April 2014 by Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst after Patrick led Dewhurst in the March primary for the Republican lieutenant governor nomination; the two face a May 27 runoff. For this fact check, we’re reviewing a statement in a Patrick campaign mailer brought to our attention by a reader as well as Dewhurst campaign spokeswoman Eliza Vielma. The front side of the mailer shows Dewhurst with his hand half-raised, like a stop sign, and these words in red: "Bankruptcy, unpaid taxes, tax liens, unpaid debts, lawsuits." The other side shows a frowning Dewhurst with the word "lie" stamped on his forehead next to a depiction of the Politifact Truth-O-Meter, its arrow pointed at our most severe rating, Pants on Fire; flames dance around it. "David Dewhurst’s latest personal attack is a lie," the mailer’s text says. "Desperate and lagging in the polls, David Dewhurst has resorted to outright lies in an attempt to malign his opponent. He has spent over $1 million on airing a TV ad he knows is a lie. PolitiFact Texas gave the (Dewhurst) television ad a ‘Pants-on-Fire’ rating as an outrageous lie," the mailer says. This entire statement is attributed to PolitiFact Texas and it’s dated April 17, 2014. Dewhurst’s ad showed a woman sitting in an armchair suggesting Patrick’s personal bankruptcy, which was filed in the 1980s and resolved in 1992, raises doubts about his being able to run the state honestly. Key elements included a reporter asking Patrick in a debate about his walking away from over $800,000 in debts in the bankruptcy. The ad also referenced a Sept. 19, 2013, news story in the Dallas Morning News stating Patrick had numerous tax liens filed against him. On April 17, we rated as Pants on Fire another claim in Dewhurst’s ad--that Patrick changed his name to hide his debts. Patrick, who grew up as Dan Goeb, had gone by the name Dan Patrick as a broadcaster since the late 1970s but legally changed his name in 2003 in anticipation of running for public office--more than a decade after his personal bankruptcy case ended. Based on that time gap and an absence of other factual back-up, we found Dewhurst’s name-change statement incorrect and ridiculous. Dewhurst’s ad also said Patrick was caught not paying taxes and pocketed employees’ payroll taxes. On April 28, we rated this claim Half True. Government agencies had filed liens against Patrick for unpaid taxes in the 1980s. But we saw no proof Patrick pocketed employees’ payroll taxes. Logan Spence, Patrick’s campaign manager, stood by Patrick saying we found the entire Dewhurt ad a Pants on Fire lie. PolitiFact Texas "judged one attack as a pants-on-fire lie and the other attack as only half true," Spence said by email. "On the whole, it is completely accurate to say that the ad is a lie because it intentionally distorts the truth." Our ruling Patrick said "PolitiFact Texas gave" the Dewhurst TV ad "a ‘Pants-on-Fire’ rating as an outrageous lie." We didn’t rate the overall ad emphasizing Patrick’s past financial difficulties. Rather, we rated one of its claims Pants on Fire and another claim Half True. We rate Patrick’s statement, which overstates our findings, as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-05657	Says "the No. 2 cause of death in the U.S. (for) women under 50 is being killed by their spouse or domestic partner."	false	/oregon/statements/2012/mar/19/rod-monroe/intimate-partner-violence-second-leading-cause-dea/	During the 2012 legislative session, lawmakers passed a bill that requires the state's school districts to put policies in place combating teen dating violence. The legislation passed with a pretty wide margin. During the debate, statistics were thrown out left and right in support of the new policy. One in particular caught our attention. While speaking in favor of House Bill 4077, Sen. Rod Monroe, D-Portland, said "teen dating violence is where it all starts, and where it ends is with the fact that the No. 2 cause of death in the U.S. (for) women under 50 is being killed by their spouse or domestic partner. No. 2 cause of death. Only exceeded by automobile accidents." There's no disputing that intimate partner violence, as it's commonly referred to in support circles, is a major problem nationally and worldwide. But could it really be the second leading cause of death for women under the age of 50? Monroe didn't have any support for his claim when we reached him at home. He mentioned that he'd heard the statistic some eight years ago at a conference in San Diego. Since then, he said, he'd read it in several articles. Without a lead, we had to start from scratch. Our first step was to check in with the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC has a specific division that looks into injury and violence prevention. As it happens, injury is the leading cause of death for Americans between ages 1 and 44. Gail Hayes, a spokeswoman for the Injury Center, showed us how to drill down into the data on hand. We looked for the leading causes of death for women between the ages of 1 and 50 from 1999 to 2009. This is what we found, in descending order: Malignant neoplasms (cancer), unintentional injury (largely motor vehicle accidents and poisoning), heart disease, suicide, stroke and then -- at sixth place -- homicide, which would include intimate partner violence. Unfortunately, you can't dig down any deeper into the homicide category to get a good idea of just how many of those are perpetrated by intimate partners. Even if we could have gone further, the rankings didn't seem to support Monroe. Once you remove biological causes of death -- cancer, heart attack and stroke -- homicide comes in at third place, after unintentional injuries and suicide. Hayes was kind enough to check in with some of the Injury Center scientists to see if they'd heard the statistic that Monroe cited. The best she could come up with was the fact that just over 41 percent of female homicides aged 1-50 were "intimate-partner related." But, she said, that data applied to only 16 states and couldn't be reliably nationalized. The CDC had some recent reports on the issues of intimate partner violence, but none of them referenced Monroe's statistic. Our next step was a call to the National Domestic Violence Hotline. We spoke with Angela Hale who also said she hadn't heard of the statistic that we were trying to verify. We did find a similar statistic referenced in the abstract for a paper published in the Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery. Ultimately, that lead never panned out. The closest we could find was a another report from 1991 that stated "violence was the second most common cause of injury overall and the most common cause of injury of women aged 15-44." But violence didn't necessarily mean intimate partner violence. In fact, the only thing the article says about such violence is that 62 percent of the violent incidents involved husbands or boyfriends. Ultimately, we ended where we started: With no source to back up the claim. In the end, the onus is on the speaker to offer a source for what he said. Monroe didn't have one -- and after days of searching, we couldn't find one. There is no doubt that intimate partner violence is a serious issue, but there doesn't seem to be any evidence that it ranks as the No. 2 cause of the death for women under 50. The highest it might rank -- and even this is a stretch -- is sixth place, according to CDC data. We rate this claim False. Return to OregonLive to comment on this rating.

pomt-12754	Political activists are "being paid" to protest members of Congress.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/feb/27/louie-gohmert/protesters-are-paid-disrupt-town-hall-meetings-goh/	Several Republican lawmakers have accused protesters at recent town hall-style meetings of being the tools of deep-pocketed benefactors pushing a liberal agenda. They’re being paid to demonstrate, some GOP officials say, with some activists being shipped in from out of state to Republican-led congressional districts to kick up an artificial fuss. U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert of Texas was one Republican who leveled the charge in a Feb. 21 statement. Gohmert was refusing to hold any constituent meetings because of protests elsewhere. "Unfortunately, at this time there are groups from the more violent strains of the leftist ideology, some even being paid, who are preying on public town halls to wreak havoc and threaten public safety," the statement read. His statement noted former U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords "was shot at a public appearance," prompting Giffords to release a statement excoriating members of Congress who "have abandoned their civic obligations" to "have some courage" and "hold town halls." While Gohmert is not the only official to claim protesters are being paid, nothing has yet turned up to support those claims. The burden of proof still lies with the accusers, however, and Republicans haven’t been offering any evidence (and neither did Democrats when they made similar claims about the tea party a few years ago). Nothing proven First thing about these town hall protests: Crowds have been pretty raucous and confrontational, but not violent. Gohmert spokeswoman Kimberly Willingham did not provide evidence that protesters had been paid. Also silent when we asked for proof was Jim DeMint, a former senator from South Carolina who now is president of the conservative Heritage Foundation. He told Greta Van Susteren on MSNBC on Feb. 22 that’s he’d been reading the Indivisible Guide, a handbook for grassroots protest compiled by several Democratic former congressional staffers. DeMint tried to draw a contrast between Indivisible’s protesters and the tea party, saying Indivisible’s activists were "very well-financed, very well-organized" and were "being bused around to go to these different town halls to disrupt them." That was news to the leaders of Indivisible, who have said they only tried to provide resources — how to found an activist group, how to reach members of Congress, how to hold meetings and form talking points, etc. — to groups unhappy with leaders in their districts. "It’s easier to say all these protests are paid than to admit there are wide swaths of people in your district who disagree with how they are represented in Congress," Sarah Dohl, a spokeswoman for Indivisible told PolitiFact. Dohl said there were only a handful of people behind Indivisible, which offers a website that has registered more than 5,300 different activist groups in order to help them organize. The group was conceived over Thanksgiving 2016, she said, actually drawing from some tea party principles (keeping groups relatively small and committed to local issues, for example). While they have received some donations, none of the board members draw a salary. Most of the people Indivisible helps have not been politically active before, Dohl said, but President Donald Trump’s election had sparked them into action. One such protester is Caitlynn Moses, a 23-year-old from Fayetteville, Ark. She told us she had never gotten involved in politics, but helped organize her group Ozark Indivisible to convince Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., to hold a town hall meeting in Springdale on Feb. 22. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., faced a large crowd at a meeting in Springdale, Ark. Cotton acknowledged the paid protester controversy at the meeting, which Moses said attracted more than 2,000 people. "I don't care if anybody here is paid or not," Cotton said. "You're all Arkansans and I'm glad to hear from you." Moses was glad Cotton was willing to come out, although she laughs at the idea that her group — or anyone other activist — is paid to attend forums. "I would say the majority of us are losing money to do this," she said. "It's so important for us to stand up for what we believe that we are willing to sacrifice for it. The rumor that we're paid protestors is absolutely despicable. It's just something someone came up with so they could write us off." The backlash against protests has roots in the current White House, which has questioned their legitimacy since before Trump took office. Press secretary Sean Spicer said on Feb. 22 that he thought "some people are clearly upset, but there is a bit of professional protester manufactured base in there." This after Spicer earlier this month on Fox News accused protesters opposing Trump’s executive order on immigration of being "a very paid, ‘AstroTurf’ type movement." Nothing new If that term sounds familiar, it’s because liberal pundits and politicians used it to describe the tea party in 2009. New York Times columnist Paul Krugman said in April 2009 that "the tea parties don’t represent a spontaneous outpouring of public sentiment. They’re AstroTurf (fake grassroots) events, manufactured by the usual suspects." Former Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi also used the term, saying of the tea party a few days later: "This initiative is funded by the high end; we call it AstroTurf, it's not really a grassroots movement. It's AstroTurf by some of the wealthiest people in America to keep the focus on tax cuts for the rich instead of for the great middle class." Trump addressed the protests last week, tweeting, "The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com That echoes a common fallback position for politicians who can’t prove that protesters are paid, University of California-Irvine sociology and political science professor David Meyer told us. "It's a little interesting that some of the Republican targets, unable to substantiate the paid professionals charge, retreat to making the claim that the protesters are organized," said Meyer, who wrote the book The Politics of Protest: Social Movements in America. "Of course they are. Someone distributed information about the time and place of each town meeting and encouraged people to show up and ask tough questions. That's how politics works." Meyer has looked into several activist groups, with no evidence yet of protesters being paid. The closest some aides have come is suggesting that Planned Parenthood, with its paid staff, have supported activist meetings, he said. Trump has been suspicious of protesters since the campaign trail, when he accused Hillary Clinton and former President Barack Obama of paying people to incite violence at rallies, without ever providing proof. The Internet also has spread unproven or outright faked claims that protesters raked in thousands of dollars or that George Soros paid Women’s March participants. Soros has denied such reports; his foundation has recently denied paying town hall protesters. Town hall attendees have taken to holding up their drivers licenses and signs with their ZIP codes in order to prove that they live in the districts in which they are protesting. "Not a single member has challenged the authenticity of a town hall questioner to their face," said Nathan Williams, a spokesman for volunteer-based forum organizers the Town Hall Project. "Because they all know these claims of ‘paid protesters’ are ridiculous." Williams said the Town Hall Project has no paid employees, even its full-time staff. Our ruling Gohmert said political activists are "being paid" to protest members of Congress. His office didn’t provide any evidence of this, and neither did several other Republican officials we asked. It’s possible some protesters somewhere may be paid, but there’s zero evidence of a wide-ranging conspiracy to bring in paid activists to disrupt meetings. We rate this statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a6193c51-8464-41e6-be3a-6f31d4804f51	None	Louie Gohmert	None	None	None	2017-02-27T16:33:44	2017-02-21	['United_States_Congress']
pomt-04972	Gov. Bill Haslam is "making our Economic Development department Sharia compliant" by hiring a woman "who specializes in Sharia compliance. That’s what her job is."	pants on fire!	/tennessee/statements/2012/jul/24/woody-degan/candidate-vanderbilt-state-sharia/	Woody Degan, an East Shelby businessman challenging state Senate Majority Leader Mark Norris, R-Collierville, in the Republican primary in District 32, is making several bold claims in his campaign. In an interview with The Commercial Appeal, he claimed there is an effort under way to make the state’s economic development agency "Sharia compliant." He contends that Gov. Bill Haslam has appointed a director at the state Department of Economic and Community Development (ECD) who Degan says specializes in "Sharia compliance" and is working to make the agency "Sharia compliant" in order to "go after Sharia money." Here is but one of the full from Degan: "They’re making our Economic Development department Sharia compliant. They hired Samar Ali, who came directly from the Obama administration, who specializes in Sharia compliance. That’s what her job is." Degan repeated those charges at a candidate forum in Shelby County on Sunday, July 22, specifying again that the official in question is Samar Ali, ECD’s director of international development. Degan is not the only person attacking Ali -- eight county-level Republican committees have passed resolutions denouncing the governor’s appointment and demanding that Ali be fired, which Haslam has refused to do. So we decided to look into the matter. At its simplest, Sharia law is the moral code and religious law of the Islamic faith, addressing a variety of personal and secular topics. Aspects of Sharia law do govern business dealings, and some Muslims conduct business only under Sharia-compliant conditions. For example, Sharia may prohibit interest on loans, considering it usury, but may allow other lending fees in lieu of interest. Some people believe that Muslims are trying to incorporate Sharia law in the United States. In his attack on ECD and Samar Ali, Degan is echoing those groups that have attacked the governor’s appointment, largely because Ali is Muslim. She was a White House Fellow in 2010-11 and her resume includes work as a lawyer in a U.S. law firm’s Abu Dhabi office that involved Sharia-compliant business transactions – which is routine in many Middle Eastern countries. Degan spent eight minutes, in a 42-minute recorded interview, talking about Sharia and Ali. Among his assertions: --"Our governor several weeks ago appointed Samar Ali straight from the Obama administration to the top position in the Tennessee economic development department . . . so we’re preparing our state for Sharia money to come in." --"By Sharia law, 20 percent of all proceeds from their profits have to go to their mosques, many of which support jihad . . . We’re going to let them bring it into Tennessee and let those proceeds go back to kill our boys." --"They’re making our economic development department Sharia compliant. Why would you make it Sharia compliant if you weren’t going after Sharia money?" Degan’s most specific allegation regarding Ali is that she "specializes in Sharia compliance, financial compliance. That’s what her job is . . . and that’s what she was brought into Tennessee for." Clint Brewer, ECD’s assistant commissioner for communications, wrote in an email that Degan’s assertions are false. "Samar Ali was hired to be ECD’s international director. Her job duties are to manage the TNTrade export program and to supervise our four international offices in Germany, Japan, China and Canada." He added: "There is no part of her job -- or any department operations -- that involves Shariah compliant finance or Shariah law." Brewer also said there is no such effort under way, or planned, to make the agency Sharia compliant. "None whatsoever nor will there be any," he said. Ali was born in Nashville and raised in Waverly, Tenn., the daughter of two medical doctors who emigrated from the Middle East when they were young. She is a graduate of Vanderbilt University and its law school. An article on the Vanderbilt Law School website in 2010 summarized her accomplishments when she was selected as one of 13 members of the 2010-11 class of the prestigious White House Fellow program: "During her freshman year, she co-founded the Middle Eastern Students Association and began her three-year involvement with Vanderbilt’s Student Government Association by joining the multicultural committee and the SGA Future Leaders Program. Just two days after the Sept. 11 attacks, Ali rose to an unofficial leadership position by speaking publicly about her Muslim faith and her religion's condemnation of the perpetrators' action. She was the university’s first Arab-Muslim student body president." Mike Newton, a Vanderbilt professor who supervised a project Ali completed on comparative human rights in Islamic societies, was quoted in the article that, "Samar was an amazingly well-rounded and poised student who added a very valuable perspective to our student body and to the International Law Practice Lab." When asked what evidence he had to back up his assertions about Sharia law at ECD, Degan said, "Her specialty is Sharia law and when she was put into that position as a Sharia law expert, it certainly raises questions and concerns about it. The evidence is in what she does…. I’m concerned, yes. Do I have evidence? No." Degan later emailed us a more elaborate response that included several attachments from the far-right blogosphere in opposition to Ali’s appointment. He wrote, "Evidence? Well, I agree, not until it starts happening is there actual concrete evidence." Our ruling A candidate in the Republican primary for state Senate made strong charges aimed at the state’s economic development department, saying that it had hired a woman specializing in Sharia law in order to make the department Sharia compliant. But even Degan admits he has no evidence. The department itself strongly denies the allegations and says Ali will have no involvement in Sharia compliance or Sharia transactions. Whether some like Degan in the Republican party feel it is necessary to attack the governor’s office for hiring a Muslim is up to them, but for making a claim that lacks evidence, we rate Degan’s statement Pants On Fire!

pomt-08457	New Castle County's unemployment rate has not almost doubled in the last two years.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/oct/14/chris-coons/debate-chris-coons-says-christine-odonnell-wrong-c/	In the Sept. 13, 2010, Delaware Senate debate between Democrat Chris Coons and Republican Christine O'Donnell, the candidates split in he-said, she-said fashion over an unemployment statistic. O'Donnell kicked it off by charging that "unemployment here in New Castle County rose, almost doubled in the last two years under (Coons') watch as New Castle County executive." A moment later, Coons countered, "I also frankly can't imagine where she found the numbers that unemployment doubled in just the past year under my watch. I suspect we're going to need to keep a close eye this evening on the numbers that go flying back and forth." One of the moderators, CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, interjected, "Let's ask her. Where did you get those numbers?" O'Donnell responded, "The Department of Labor statistics. And we'll have them on our web site by tomorrow." Sounds like a dispute tailor-made for PolitiFact: How much did unemployment rise in New Castle County, the most populous of Delaware's three counties? Lets first clarify a few matters. In Coons' reply, he misstated the time frame O'Donnell had used, saying it was one year when in fact she had said she was looking at the past two years. We'll analyze the question using O'Donnell's criteria -- two years -- while noting that Coons garbled O'Donnell's time frame. We also won't get into the question of whether a county executive deserves direct blame for rising unemployment, even though one can argue that unemployment is more sensitive to national and international economic factors than local ones. For our answer, we turned to the Local Area Unemployment Statistics database at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, a division of the U.S. Labor Department. In the most recent available month, August 2010, New Castle County, Del., registered an 8.7 percent unemployment rate. Two years before, in August 2008, the rate was 5.5 percent. (The figures are not seasonally adjusted, but since we're comparing August of one year to August of another, making seasonal adjustments should be irrelevant in this comparison.) That's a difference of 3.3 percentage points, or an increase of 58 percent over the August 2008 unemployment rate of 5.5 percent. If the rate had doubled as O'Donnell said, it would have needed to increase by 100 percent, which would have brought the unemployment rate to 11 percent today. And it clearly isn't that high. O'Donnell did give herself some breathing room by saying that the rate "almost" doubled over the past two years. But while it's possible to argue that 58 percent should be rounded up to 100 percent (or "double"), we think that's a stretch. After we'd finished our research, we received a response from the O'Donnell campaign. A spokesman said that O'Donnell was actually referring to the rise in unemployment starting at the beginning of Coons' tenure as county executive. We confirmed with the New Castle County government that Coons, who was elected in November 2004, was inaugurated in January 2005. So we looked at the county unemployment rate for January 2005 and found that it was 4.7 percent. That did rate roughly double by August 2010 -- but that's a period of five and a half years, not two, as O'Donnell had said in the debate. Using that time frame also measures unemployment from a point well before the economy slid into recession to a point of stubbornly high unemployment rates everywhere, so it would hardly be surprising to find the numbers rise. As it happened, New Castle County performed better than the nation as a whole at each of these three points in time. The county's 4.7 percent unemployment rate in January 2005 was lower than the national 5.3 percent rate that month. The 5.5 percent unemployment rate in August 2008 was lower than the national rate of 6.2 percent that month, and the county's 8.7 percent in August 2010 was lower than the national rate of 9.6 percent. In fact, unemployment grew slightly more slowly in New Castle County over that period than it did nationally. So where does this leave us? While O'Donnell is correct that unemployment has risen in New Castle County, as it has everywhere, the increase wasn't almost double over two years -- the period she said during the debate. By saying that she meant to measure it from the beginning of Coons' term as county executive, her campaign team is essentially conceding that she got the fact wrong. In our role as debate referee, we give Coons' stance that O'Donnell erred a rating of True.	None	Chris Coons	None	None	None	2010-10-14T18:04:10	2010-10-13	['None']

pomt-08994	"Gov. Crist has never wavered in his support of the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/14/charlie-crist/crist-stands-firm-gun-rights/	Charlie Crist and "never wavered" are words that don't seem to naturally fit together these days. He vetoed anti-abortion legislation in June 2010 after painting himself as fiercely pro-life. He buddied up to Sarah Palin during a "Drill, Baby, Drill" event in 2008, then called for a special legislative session to ban oil drilling in July 2010. Most famously, he abandoned the Republican party after pegging himself as a both a Jeb Bush and Ronald Reagan Republican throughout his political career. Yet Crist, who has been known to attribute his political flexibility to his desire to serve "the people," claims there is one issue where voters can trust him to never waffle. "Gov. Crist has never wavered in his support of the Second Amendment, the right to bear arms," reads the Crist for U.S. Senate campaign website. Given Crist's serial elasticity, we wondered if this could be true. Does the so-called People's Governor actually have steady convictions about, well, something? Crist, a St. Petersburg lawyer who was first elected to public office in 1992, quickly earned a reputation as a pro-gun candidate. In his steady rise through Florida's political strata, he continued to cultivate that image, consistently siding with gun owners. In one of his first high-profile gun battles, Crist blasted then Gov. Lawton Chiles' last-minute effort to require criminal background checks and a waiting period for purchases made at gun shows in 1998. "Unfortunately we're in a state that's No. 1 in violent crime in America,'' said Crist, then a state Senator. "And for us to make moves that would disarm our law-abiding citizens would be inappropriate." The proposed legislation died in committee. As Attorney General, Crist nominated former NRA President Marion P. Hammer to the state's Women's Hall of Fame. She was inducted in December 2004. In his 2006 primary against Republican rival Tom Gallagher, who supported some gun-control restrictions, Crist put out an ad that called Gallagher "anti-gun." The ad concluded, "Charlie Crist: endorsed by the NRA." After he won, Crist continued to highlight his Second Amendment views to trump Jim Davis, his Democratic opponent in the general election. As governor, he appointed NRA favorites Chief Justice Charles T. Canady and Justice Ricky Polston to the Florida Supreme Court. He signed into law legislation that allowed 500,000 concealed weapons permit-holders to bring their guns to work -- as long as the weapons remained in their vehicles. He vetoed a move by lawmakers to take $6 million out of the trust fund that pays for licensing gun owners and processing concealed weapons permits. The national Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms rewarded his efforts by bestowing him the title of "Gun Rights Defender of the Month" in July 2009. Crist then signed a bill that granted protected status to Florida's concealed weapons permit trust fund, shielding it from future raids by a cash-strapped Legislature, in a ceremony in April 2010, during which he wrapped his arms around Hammer, now the NRA's lobbyist, for a public embrace. Most recently, Crist's campaign celebrated the Second Amendment in a Twitter message. "Pleased w the US Supreme Court's decision today reaffirming our 2nd Amendment rights," he tweeted on June 28, hours after the court ruled the Second Amendment gives all Americans a right to keep and bear arms for self-defense that trumps state and local laws. In fact, PolitiFact had a hard time finding any instance where Crist refused to back gun rights. We scanned roughly 1,000 news articles that mentioned Crist and the words "bear arms," "Second Amendment," and "gun restrictions." The only hints we found that Crist wasn't entirely beholden to unrestricted gun rights could barely be described as so much as a flutter of indecision. In 1993, Crist told the St. Petersburg Times he was considering supporting several proposed bills that would impose tougher penalties on youths who use guns while committing a crime. "I believe very strongly in the right to bear arms, but I don't see a need for kids to bear arms," except for hunting or target shooting with supervision, said Crist, newly elected to the state Senate. The NRA gave some of the proposed bills its blessing. In another instance, Crist bucked the NRA when he appointed Justice James Perry, a self-professed gun advocate who never convinced the NRA of his loyalty, to the Florida Supreme Court in 2009. But gun leaders say the appointment was an unnoteworthy misfire. They did not hold it against Crist. "He has always throughout his career been a strong advocate for the Second Amendment and the rights of law-abiding gun owners and sportsmen, never voted against us, always voted with us as governor," Hammer said. "He signed every piece of legislation gun owners asked him to sign and vetoed every piece of legislation negatively impacting gun owners and sportsman that gun owners asked him to veto. He has an outstanding record of support." Hammer said Crist earned an "A" rating as a political newcomer, the highest grade bestowed to a rookie candidate by the NRA, and subsequently received an "A+" in future years based on his voting record. "You can't get an 'A+' unless you have a strong history on our issues," Hammer said. Joe Waldron, director of the Citizens Committee to Keep and Bear Arms, also said that Crist's support for gun rights has remained steadfast. However, a budding effort to cast doubt on Crist's pro-gun record has begun to emerge. Crist recently indicated he would confirm President Barack Obama's Supreme Court nominee, Elena Kagan, if elected to the U.S. Senate, drawing mixed responses. Hammer said she continues to trust Crist. Neither Hammer or the NRA has endorsed a candidate in the Senate race yet. "I was told he had a made a comment about Kagan before he knew her record and before he knew of our opposition," she said. "We would not be pleased with anyone who would vote to confirm Elena Kagan. We have made that very clear." The Florida Republican Party used the statement in another round of attacks against its former leader. "Floridians believe in the Second Amendment, and we need a United States senator who will defend that right when given the responsibility of confirming justices who could influence the rulings of the Supreme Court for generations," Chairman John Thrasher said in a June 2010 press release. "The reality here is about more than politics. If activist judges like Elena Kagan gain control of the Supreme Court, our individual right to bear arms for personal protection could cease to exist in this country. Does Charlie Crist still think she’d do a great job?" Republican spokesman Katie Betta elaborated in an email interview: "Our main point with this release was to highlight the fact that when the Governor was trying to win the Republican Primary, he opposed the confirmation on Justice Sotomayor because of her record on the Second Amendment, now he said he thinks Kagan will do a great job, despite the fact that she has such a controversial record on the Second Amendment. His position is ever-changing in that it changes based on his political needs, rather than based on principles." To be sure, Crist is no Charlton Heston. He isn't even a Palin, for that matter. He doesn't stalk across the state clutching a rifle or claim to kill his own dinner. But his standing with the NRA is bulletproof, at least for the time being. We rate this True.

pomt-08284	Says "6 percent more Republicans across the state voted than Democrats."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2010/nov/06/bob-tiernan/party-chair-bob-tiernan-says-oregons-republicans-o/	Thursday morning was a rough one for Bob Tiernan. Just before Democrat John Kitzhaber accepted the governorship, the chairman of Oregon’s Republican Party had to bat away suggestions that the state GOP was in need of a major makeover. Tiernan was a guest on Oregon Public Broadcasting’s Think Out Loud Thursday morning, and host Emily Harris asked him what was next for the party. "If Chris Dudley had won, there was a lot of talk that he would be the leader of rebuilding the Oregon Republican Party," she said. She then went on to mention the fact that all statewide offices belong to Democrats and that Republicans had been having a difficult time finding candidates for some races. How, Harris asked, would Dudley’s loss affect all that? "First off, the Republican Party is quite strong in this state. I think you can look at our statistics from this last election," Tiernan said. "We outperformed Democrats. ... Six percent more Republicans across the state voted than Democrats." We wondered whether he had that right. If you take the statement at face value, it sounds as though you had more Republicans than Democrats voting. Thankfully, the Oregon Secretary of State tracks all these numbers. As of 8:30 Thursday morning, the Secretary of State was reporting that roughly 644,000 Democrats and 526,000 Republicans voted out of a total of 1,479,188 for all ballots returned. That means Democrats accounted for about 44 percent of returned ballots and Republicans for about 36 percent. That gives the edge to Democrats. But there’s another way to look at these numbers. While more Democrats than Republicans voted, there are far more Oregon voters registered as Democrats than as Republicans. If you take that into account, the numbers show that 79 percent of all Republicans had turned out to vote while 74.5 of all Democrats had. That is indeed a difference of 6 percent. We spoke with Greg Leo, the spokesman for the Oregon Republican Party, and he told us that Tiernan was referring to the return rates within each party, not overall. So, back to the ruling. Tiernan is right, the Republicans did have a stronger turnout if you’re talking party proportions. But he didn’t make it exactly clear what he meant in his guest spot on "Think Out Loud," and certainly listeners could have come away a bit confused, thinking more Republicans had voted than Democrats. So, we’ll split the difference and call this one Half True. Comment on this item.

pomt-06759	Says Gov. Rick Scott cut state funding for PBS.	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/aug/22/florida-voter/caller-says-gov-rick-scott-cut-funding-pbs/	When the progressive group Pink Slip Rick urged Florida voters to call Gov. Rick Scott, Floridians sounded off about layoffs of government workers, the state of public education and the governor's own wealth. But one caller was tuned in to another issue: public television. On Aug. 17, 2011, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow played some of Floridians' robocalls that are posted on Pink Slip Rick's website, including a call from Chris S: "I really can't believe that you cut PBS of all things. My kids sit around and watch PBS in the early morning. They learn so much from it. And to have the state cut funding for PBS is despicable." Did the jobs governor give Cookie Monster the pink slip? (In a related Truth-O-Meter item we rate a claim made by Debra B., who said Scott spent taxpayer dollars to robocall Floridians.) Scott's veto On May 26, 2011, Scott announced more than $600 million in budget vetoes including $4,799,110 for public radio and television. (That veto included money for WLRN, a public radio station affiliated with the Miami Herald, a PolitiFact Florida partner.) The veto meant that the 13 public radio stations each lost about $62,000 and the 13 public TV stations each lost about $307,000 (the impact on the stations varied depending on their total budget). These public stations are generally funded by state and federal dollars as well as membership donations and corporate support. One piece of public programming was spared Scott's budget ax. WFSU in Tallahassee has a contract for The Florida Channel, which covers the state legislative session and public hearings about redistricting. WFSU lost money along with the rest of the stations but production money for The Florida Channel was not cut, said Janyth Righter, executive director of Florida Public Broadcasting Service Inc. After his vetoes, Scott launched robocalls to highlight the cuts. A progressive group, Pink Slip Rick, invited Floridians to robocall Scott back. The Pink Slip Rick campaign is sponsored by Florida Watch Action, a progressive group. The executive director of Florida Watch Action is Susannah Randolph, wife of state Rep. Scott Randolph, D-Orlando, and former campaign manager to former U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson. Impact of the cut In Florida, public radio stations reach 1.3 million listeners weekly, covering local news and airing NPR programs such as Morning Edition, All Things Considered and Car Talk. The TV stations, which reach 11 million viewers weekly, also include local content such as town hall meetings and national PBS programs about news, history and culture. The TV stations also buy and air PBS programs that teach children about the alphabet, reading, vocabulary, math and science among other shows including Sesame Street, Clifford the Big Red Dog, It's a Big World and Curious George. Florida's PBS stations also provide workshops for teachers with a focus on at-risk and low-income families and provide books to Florida's neediest children. The impact of the veto isn't fully known yet, said Righter, executive director of the Florida Public Broadcasting Service, which represents all of the stations. "People are going to be laid off and have been," she said. "Stations are still trying to come up with how to fund some of these things." But Righter said she doesn't expect that the TV stations will drop children's programs such as Sesame Street. "The way the programs are packaged, we really won't lose our kids programs unless something else happens that creates a big drop in revenue," she said. "We have a big commitment to that childrens block. We plan to continue that." It's the face-to-face outreach with people in the school districts that may not continue, she said. The TV stations have educators who go into schools to provide workshops for teachers to show them how to use PBS programs to help children engage in reading. The cuts will also probably impact local program production, Righter said. John Labonia, general manager at WLRN in Miami, said the veto won't affect children's programming at his station. "Stations pay PBS for the rights to carry those programs. In our case we didn't use any of the state money to purchase programs," he said. Our ruling When Pink Slip Rick put out the call to robocall Gov. Scott, Chris S. was among the callers. He said to Scott: "I really can't believe that you cut PBS of all things. My kids sit around and watch PBS in the early morning. They learn so much from it. And to have the state cut funding for PBS is despicable." The caller is right that Scott vetoed $4.8 million in state funding for public radio and TV, but the particular impact the caller cites -- cuts to children's programs -- are not expected.

pomt-06118	"The latest unemployment numbers have shown that nearly 315,000 Americans have simply given up hope when it comes to finding a job."	false	/georgia/statements/2011/dec/30/paul-broun/broun-315000-americans-gave-looking-work/	Want to make voters pay attention? Use the word "jobs." The national unemployment rate may be down, but the economy’s still in a jobs funk. Congress is under pressure from virtually all sides to pass legislation that encourages job creation, or at least saves jobs. So when U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, R-Athens, used the "J" word in a recent press release over the payroll tax debate, the eyes of your PolitiFact Georgia scribes were glued to our computer screens. "The latest unemployment numbers have shown that nearly 315,000 Americans have simply given up hope when it comes to finding a job," the Athens Republican’s release said. "Our economy is barely hanging on as it is, and we cannot risk losing more of our working class to job-killing tax increases." Nearly 315,000 Americans have given up on finding work? The government tracks all sorts of jobs figures, but who keeps tabs on hopelessness? Broun used this statistic days earlier. When the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Department of Labor’s official keeper of the nation’s jobs data, released its November employment figures Dec. 2, he issued a press release criticizing the Obama administration. "Today’s job report paints a clear picture of how thoroughly this Administration’s policies have failed," Broun’s release said. "While the addition of 120,000 net jobs appears to be good news, what it hides is that 315,000 Americans have now simply given up looking for work, and are no longer counted in these unemployment figures." We called Broun’s office for more information, but received no response during the winter break. So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We discovered that our federal government does track people who despair of finding a job. Each month, the bureau publishes a report with key labor data such as unemployment figures and the size of the workforce. It also includes a monthly count of what the bureau classifies as "discouraged workers." These are people who want to find a job and are available to take one, but have given up because they think there are no jobs, or none for which they would qualify. We looked at data for November 2011, the most recent numbers available when Broun issued his press release. They show that there were fewer discouraged workers than the year before, but their ranks had grown from the previous month. There were some 1.1 million discouraged workers in November, which was down by about 186,000 from a year earlier and up about 133,000 from a month earlier. Whether you consider discouraged workers on a year-to-year or month-to-month basis, Broun’s figure is way off the mark. Since Broun wasn’t available for a response, we searched the Internet for possible sources of his data. We found an Associated Press story that said that "a key reason the unemployment rate fell so much was because roughly 315,000 people had given up looking for work and were no longer counted as unemployed." USA Today, National Public Radio and other news outlets posted the story or excerpts on their web sites. We found that the size of the civilian labor force, or the number of employed and unemployed non-military workers, did shrink by 315,000 people, according to the BLS data. But this does not mean that they dropped out of the job market because they thought they couldn’t find work, explained Gary Steinberg, a spokesman for the bureau. Some might have left the labor force to care for a sick relative. Others might have retired. Or the working-age population might have decreased. Broun was apparently led astray by credible news outlets, but the figure is still wrong. November’s unemployment numbers did not show that "nearly 315,000 Americans have simply given up hope when it comes to finding a job." The ranks of discouraged workers had actually declined by about 186,000 since November 2010, and risen by about 133,000 since October. This means he’s off by hundreds of thousands of workers, no matter how you count it. Broun earns a False.	None	Paul Broun	None	None	None	2011-12-30T06:00:00	2011-12-13	['United_States']
pomt-14305	"It was (Rob Portman’s) job to stop China’s illegal dumping of steel. He failed, looked the other way, did nothing."	false	/ohio/statements/2016/apr/01/ted-strickland/anti-rob-portman-ad-relies-public-ignorance-trade-/	Ted Strickland goes back 11 years in an ad targeting incumbent Ohio Sen. Rob Portman, chastising his role as U.S. trade representative under President George W. Bush. "It was his job to stop China’s illegal dumping of steel," the narrator says. "He failed, looked the other way, did nothing." Titled "Beltway Rob," the ad is part of an ongoing name-calling battle between the Strickland and Portman campaigns. (Portman mocks Strickland as "Retread Ted.") Strickland’s ad left us wondering if Portman dropped the ball on foreign steel during his year as trade representative. ("Dumping" in trade speak typically refers to a country introducing a cheaper-than-normal product into a foreign market and edging out domestic manufacturers.) Was it really his job to stop China’s illegal steel dumping, and did Portman really do nothing to stand up for the United States? Strickland’s campaign pointed us to a 2012 Politico article about potential running mates for Mitt Romney’s presidential bid. Portman’s name was on the short list, the article said, but a chapter in Portman’s trade history could be leveraged as a weakness by Democratic opponents. We turned to the trade wonks for more clarity. Role of trade representative So was it Portman’s job to "stop China's illegal dumping of steel?" In a word, no. "Like a lot of political ads, it’s more complicated than the ad is saying," said Warren Maruyama, who served as general counsel for the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative under Portman’s successor, Susan Schwab. The trade representative’s job is to act as the government’s spokesperson on trade, negotiate trade agreements, file cases with the World Trade Organization on behalf of domestic interests and defend against cases where those interests are challenged, and to oversee coordination with the alphabet soup of other agencies whose interests overlap with trade, Maruyama said. Trade law is arcane, and it’s easier to yell "China bad!" than it is to explain its nuances. But to a trade expert’s ear, it makes no sense to say that Portman failed to stop illegal Chinese dumping. It’s like saying LeBron James failed to score any touchdowns last season — that's the wrong sport. Likewise, the law is very clear that the U.S. trade representative has no role in the determinations on unfair trade practices such as dumping. Determinations regarding dumping are made by the Commerce Department and the U.S. International Trade Court, in procedures which are deliberately shielded from political or outside interference. "It’s walled off from political considerations, and Portman could have gotten into trouble if he’d tried to interfere," Maruyama said. If dumping is proven, it’s an unfair trade practice for which relief is mandatory. The U.S. International Trade Commission decides if there is injury or the threat of injury, and the Commerce Department determines the appropriate relief, through higher tariffs. Alan Wolff, who was deputy special representative for trade negotiations during President Jimmy Carter’s administration, agreed. "Portman had no role on anti-dumping," he said. "That’s flat-out wrong." The attack ad copy is conflating two different issues, Wolff said. The case referenced by Politico, the one that the Strickland ad wants to use as proof of Portman’s inaction on Chinese dumping, didn’t involve market-dumping at all. The case at hand is different In August 2005, American makers of circular welded non-alloy steel pipe, which is often used in home-building, filed for relief from "market disruption" under Section 421 of the Trade Act of 1974. Market disruption is not the same as dumping. Trade experts draw a firm distinction between the two terms. (When the Wall Street Journal mischaracterized a similar 2009 market disruption case as a dumping case, the paper ran a correction.) "There is a clear difference," Maruyama said. "The thing about ‘dumping’ is it sounds bad, so people throw it around, but it’s just not accurate." Section 421 is "a unique and rarely used statute," according to Schwab, who took over for Portman after Bush tapped him to head the U.S. Office of Management and Budget. Cases under this statute for market disruption fall under a category of "safeguard" considerations, where it is not necessary for the petitioner to prove wrongdoing, only that a trade action has caused them "injury, or threat of injury." It’s "a way of bypassing a formal dumping hearing by the trade commission," Schwab said. Section 421 cases are also unique in that they require approval from the White House. The president, the law says, must determine whether trade relief measures are in the country’s economic interest, "or could threaten national security." In October 2005, the International Trade Commission issued its determination on the steel pipe case. Four of six trade commissioners sided with the steel pipe manufacturers and recommended tariffs and safeguard actions be imposed on China’s pipe imports. Two commissioners dissented, finding no market disruption. Here, it was Portman’s job to coordinate the process where representatives from other agencies weigh in. "They all sit down and argue," Maruyama said, "and if they have a consensus, that’s the recommendation that goes up to the president. If there are differences, and often there are, it goes over to the White House in a memo summarizing all the pros and cons. And then Bush gets to decide." Portman had a Cabinet role in this occasion, but Schwab said Bush was very clear that there was only one "decider" in his administration. "It wasn’t a Portman-Bush decision," she said. "It was a Bush decision." Bush did not impose relief in this case, or in three other 421 cases that crossed his desk when Portman wasn’t his trade representative. In the steel pipe case, Bush said that relief wasn’t in the national economic interest. He believed that punishing China on steel pipe wouldn’t ultimately help U.S. steel manufacturers. "There are many other countries currently supplying standard pipe to the U.S. market that could fill the void created by curtailed Chinese imports," wrote Portman in a February 2006 letter to Sen. Blanche Lincoln, D-Ark., one of many lawmakers catching heat from angry steel industry constituents. Schwab called attacks on Portman’s record on China "ironic." "Portman was always my strongest ally when I wanted to take the Chinese to the WTO," she said. "He was a hawk on these issues. If I wanted to file trade enforcement cases on China I could always count on him." Our ruling Strickland’s ad says that it was Portman’s "job to stop China’s illegal dumping of steel. He failed, looked the other way, did nothing." We consulted trade experts on both sides of the partisan aisle. They were unanimous that the ad’s statement is fundamentally wrong. Portman did not have a role to play in anti-dumping measures as U.S. trade representative. The 2005 trade matter that the ad attacks him over had nothing to do with dumping. This case only reached Portman, and ultimately Bush, because it was filed under another part of trade law that triggers presidential involvement that isn't used for true "dumping" cases. And if you switched "Bush" for "Portman" in this ad, it would still be a cynical twisting of words. "Dumping" is not a catch-all for Chinese steel in the market. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/6666f0cb-86ac-46ae-af02-67876e1e7aa2	None	Ted Strickland	None	None	None	2016-04-01T14:08:10	2016-03-17	['None']
pomt-08365	Since Rep. John Boccieri’s election, "Ohio has lost 600,000 jobs" and his district’s "unemployment has doubled."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/26/jim-renacci/gop-challenger-jim-renacci-joins-chorus-job-losses/	Once more, with spirit: Ohio has lost a whole lot of jobs. It’s the chorus line of 2010, and if the Capital Steps were in Ohio they would sing it as an encore. Imagine our surprise, then, when we heard a sonorous new version last week from congressional candidate and businessman Jim Renacci. The Wadsworth Republican, running against Democratic incumbent John Boccieri, said in opening remarks of a debate in Canton: "Ladies and gentlemen, our country is going in the wrong direction. What we’ve learned is that over the last couple of years, Ohio has lost over 600,000 jobs." He added that "Since Mr. Boccieri has become a representative of the 16th District, unemployment has doubled." That figure – 600,000 – is roughly double to triple the number that others have cited as they challenge Ohio Democrats holding office. The sums change depending on the month and year, but Renacci’s figure seemed outlandishly high to our numerically attuned ears. That’s because it is. Using figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found that from January 2009, when Boccieri took office, through August 2010, the most recent month counted when Renacci made his claim, Ohio lost 176,400 jobs. New data that included September came out after the debate, and if counted it would put Ohio’s job losses during the current Congress at 194,300. It would be impossible for Renacci’s number to be correct no matter how you measured "the last two years," unless BLS data – the gold standard for statisticians -- was off by 300-plus percent. Perplexed, we asked Renacci’s spokesman, James Slepian, how his boss got his number. Slepian responded that while Renacci said the state has lost 600,000 jobs over the last couple of years, his number was actually in reference to Ohio’s unemployment rate, not its job losses. Stick with us here, because this is a distinction with a definite difference. The unemployment rate measures the number and percentage of people at any given time who say they are out of work and are actively looking for a job. It doesn’t matter when they lost their jobs. That’s different – and typically much higher -- from the number of jobs lost during a specific period, which is measured in a survey of employers. If you counted every Ohioan looking for work, regardless of when he or she lost a job, the number would come to 601,145 as of August, which again was the most current number during the debate. It’s now come down a tad, to 590,809, BLS databases show.. That’s a lot of unemployed people, to be sure. But most of them were already out of work when Boccieri became a congressman. In fact, the number in Ohio was already 515,292 when Boccieri took his oath of office. So while the trend continued while Boccieri has been in office, the magnitude is not the result of the last couple of years, as Renacci said, and in fact has shown a small reversal in recent months. This brings us to Renacci’s related point – that since Boccieri "became a representative" of the 16th Congressional District, "unemployment has doubled." No, it hasn’t. This, too, can be measured a number of ways, and we tried a bunch. We started by looking at the Canton-Massillon metropolitan statistical area since that’s the heart of the district’s population center. The current rate of unemployment there is 10.6 percent. The number is nothing to cheer. But the rate was 10.2 when Boccieri took office, which is not even close to the doubling that Renacci claimed. We asked Slepian to explain how his boss arrived at this claim, too. Slepian said that Renacci was not using just the Canton metro area but, rather, the four-county area that makes up his district: Stark, Wayne, Ashland and Medina counties. With Slepian on the phone, we joined him in going over the numbers as we turned our respective cursors to the BLS databases. He noted accurately that in Stark County, the unemployment rate just before Boccieri’s election, in October 2008, was 6.8 percent. And in January 2010, it reached 13.6 percent, which is exactly double. Two problems. First, Boccieri was sworn in in January, 2009, and Stark County’s unemployment rate was already 10.0 by then. Second, Renacci seemed to stop flipping through the calendar awfully early to get to his claim. Had he counted every month that Boccieri has been in office, he would have stopped at August 2010, the most recent month for which there is countywide data, rather than stopping in January. Guess what? The unemployment rate for the most recent month available was 10.5 in Stark County, not 13.6. Things improved, it seems, when Renacci stopped counting. We did the same kinds of calculations for the district’s three other counties, and the result were similarly at odds with Renecci’s doubling claim. In fact, were he to measure Ashland County alone, he’d have to say that on Boccieri’s watch, the unemployment rate actually went down, from 12.2 at the start to 10.4 in August. This looked like a classic case of cherry picking the data to support a false claim, and we told Slepian as much. He maintained that statewide, the unemployment rate is higher than it was two years ago, and that no matter how you slice it, "there are 600,000 people out of work in the state." And he said that when looking at certain periods in the last two years – a month before Boccieri’s election (but three before his inauguration) and 12 months into his term -- "we did see it double" in the district’s biggest county. "It’s an accurate statement to say that that’s what it went up to since he was elected to office," Slepian said. Yes, it is, but only if you ignore the fact that it has come way down since Renacci stopped turning the calendar pages at exactly the right date to shore up his argument. To include months when an opponent wasn’t in office, and to stop counting when the unemployment numbers make your case, leaves out a massive amount of information and context. Did we mention that Renacci is a CPA? If we tried these tricks on our taxes, we could be treated to a heap of IRS trouble (although with a creative accountant, you never know). But the Truth-O-Meter does not assess tax penalties; it merely points its arrow to the only rating possible when a claim is inaccurate and its basis is distorted and contorted: Pants on Fire!

pomt-10324	"He made time to go to the gym, but canceled a visit with wounded troops. Seems the Pentagon wouldn't allow him to bring cameras."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/29/john-mccain/damned-if-you-dont/	In an effort to shore up his foreign policy chops, Sen. Barack Obama took the unusual step of making a trip overseas — to the Middle East and Europe. The idea, in part, was to show the presidential candidate's gravitas as an international leader. But the strategy backfired a bit when Obama canceled plans to visit wounded troops at a military hospital in Germany. Obama had been part of a congressional delegation that visited Iraq and Afghanistan, but when that trip ended Obama stayed on the road, spending several days on a campaign-funded tour of Europe. Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Landstuhl, Germany, was supposed to be one of the stops. The decision to cancel was made after the Pentagon raised a number of issues about its policy against campaign activity at a military base — including visits by campaign staff or any media coverage or speeches. As a sitting senator, Obama was welcome to visit troops, but no one on the campaign trip with him, including a retired general who is advising his campaign, could go along. Obama found himself in an awkward spot: visit wounded troops alone and risk being seen as having used them as campaign props, or skip the wounded troops altogether. It was a no-win pickle of Obama's own making. He hoped to minimize the political controversy by backing out of the hospital visit. The McCain campaign quickly pounced. An ad released on July 26, 2008, implied Obama blew off the visit with wounded troops because he wasn't allowed to use it as a photo op. "He made time to go to the gym, but canceled a visit with wounded troops," an annoucer says. "Seems the Pentagon wouldn't allow him to bring cameras." That Obama visited a Berlin gym is not in dispute (though the McCain ad actually shows footage of Obama playing basketball with American troops at an airbase in Kuwait). Nor is it disputed that Obama canceled a scheduled visit with wounded troops. But the ad suggests Obama canceled the visit because he wasn't allowed to bring cameras. That's the part the Obama campaign vehemently denies. The Pentagon did raise questions about whether Obama's visit would amount to political activity, which is restricted at military installations. "Nobody denied Sen. Obama the opportunity to visit our wounded being cared for at Landstuhl. Obviously as a sitting senator he has an interest in that and can certainly visit in an official capacity," said Bryan Whitman, spokesman for the Pentagon. "There are, as you know though, restrictions on what you can do as a candidate for political office, that stems from trying to maintain political neutrality and not have the military involved in politics." "Under no circumstances may a candidate make a campaign-related statement on an instillation," Whitman said. According to Department of Defense policy, "Any activity that may be reasonably viewed as directly or indirectly associating the Department of Defense ... with a partisan political activity ... shall be avoided." Said Whitman: "The senator's staff was informed of the limits on what the military can do with respect to a political campaign and how we could support a senator's visit to Landstuhl, and quite frankly I expected them to have the visit." The Obama campaign apparently thought better of it. "Sen. Obama did not want to have a trip to see our wounded warriors perceived as a campaign event when his visit was to show his appreciation for our troops and decided instead not to go,'' retired Maj. Gen. Scott Gration, a foreign policy adviser to Obama, stated in a release from the campaign. In addition to the ad, McCain took a swipe at Obama's decision during an appearance on the ABC News program This Week . "Well, I know this, that those troops would have loved to have seen him," McCain said. "And I know of no Pentagon regulation that would have prevented him from going there — without the media and the press and all of the associated people." "The important thing is that, if I had been told by the Pentagon that I couldn't visit those troops, and I was there and wanted to be there, I guarantee you, there would have been a seismic event." "I believe he had the opportunity to go without the media. And I'll let the facts speak for themselves." Obama campaign spokeswoman Linda Douglass told ABC News that Obama never intended for the visit to be a public event. "We told military officials explicitly that Sen. Obama had absolutely no intention of bringing any members of the media or photographers in with him to visit the wounded warriors," Douglass said. "In all of our communications with the military, we stressed that this was to be a private visit by Sen. Obama." In the past, Obama has met privately with wounded veterans at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., who accompanied Obama on part of his tour, said Obama met privately with troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., also accompanied Obama as part of a congressional delegation on the official trip to Afghanistan and Iraq, but broke off when Obama parted with the delegation and embarked on a short European tour. "At that point, it was a political trip for Sen. Obama," Hagel said on CBS's Face the Nation. "I think it would have been inappropriate for him and certainly he would have been criticized by the McCain people and the press and probably should have been if on a political trip in Europe paid for by political funds — not the taxpayers — to go, essentially, then and be accused of using our wounded men and women as props for his campaign. ... I think it would be totally inappropriate for him on a campaign trip to go to a military hospital and use those soldiers as props. So I think he probably, based on what I know, he did the right thing." Hagel added that he did not think the McCain ad was appropriate. Here's what Obama said about it all: "The staff was working this so I don't know each and every detail but here is what I understand happened," Obama told ABC News. "We had scheduled to go, we had no problem at all in leaving, we always leave press and staff off — that is why we left it off the schedule. We were treating it in the same way we treat a visit to Walter Reed which I was able to do a few weeks ago without any fanfare whatsoever. I was going to be accompanied by one of my advisors, a former military officer (Gration). "And we got notice that he would be treated as a campaign person, and it would therefore be perceived as political because he had endorsed my candidacy but he wasn't on the Senate staff. That triggered then a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political. And the last thing that I want to do is have injured soldiers and the staff at these wonderful institutions having to sort through whether this is political or not or get caught in the crossfire between campaigns. "So rather than go forward and potentially get caught up in what might have been considered a political controversy of some sort," Obama said, "what we decided was that we not make a visit and instead I would call some of the troops that were there. So that essentially would be the extent of the story." In a briefing with reporters, Robert Gibbs, a senior communications adviser to the Obama campaign, said the trip had been planned weeks in advance, but the campaign believed "it could be done in a way that would not ... be ... seen as a campaign stop." Gibbs said the plan was to leave the media entourage on the plane while Obama made his visit. MSNBC reporter Andrea Mitchell, who was part of the traveling press corps, confirmed that in an on-air interview with Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C. "The point is that Obama had no intention of bringing any cameras with him," Mitchell said. "I was there. I can vouch for that." So where are we? The Obama campaign explanation seems plausible. There is no hard evidence from the McCain campaign that the loss of a photo op played any role in Obama's decision. There's ample evidence, though no documentation, that Obama never intended to bring press to the hospital. On the other hand, this is a problem of Obama's own creation. The fact remains he canceled the visit after the Pentagon voiced concern about political overtones. The fact remains, too, that Obama could have done a private visit even after the Pentagon raised its objections. Obama had done such visits before. We can't give McCain's campaign any points for accuracy here, but neither can we say Obama is a helpless victim of a baseless attack. To do that we would have to give Obama and his version of the campaign's plans every benefit of the doubt. That leads us to Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-14142	Says Danny Tarkanian is "NRA ‘F’ Rated."	half-true	/nevada/statements/2016/may/03/michael-roberson/ads-attacking-tarkanians-nra-grade-need-context/	Politicians on both sides often wear National Rifle Association grades as a badge of pride, but one Nevada Republican is fighting off claims that he received a failing grade from the gun advocacy group. Republican Danny Tarkanian, who’s running for Nevada’s 3rd Congressional District, is the target of a series of Web ads promoted by his primary opponent, state Sen. Michael Roberson, attacking his alleged poor grades from the NRA. The ads implied that Tarkanian has a poor record on Second Amendment issues, with one claiming that he is "playing games with our gun rights." Only a handful of Nevada lawmakers have been the recipient of NRA F marks. We wanted to know if Tarkanian really received a failing grade, and if so, why. Failing grade NRA grades and endorsements are made by lobbyists and analysts who follow state and federal firearm issues, and are generally only supposed to represent a snapshot in time. "Candidate ratings for previous election cycles were compiled in the year of the election and may no longer accurately represent a candidate’s or elected official’s position or rating," the NRA’s website says. (The NRA did not return our requests for comment on this fact-check.) Tarkanian’s F grade came a decade ago, during his Tarkanian’s unsuccessful bid for Nevada secretary of state. But isn’t such a simple snapshot of his position on guns. During that 2006 race, the pro-gun control Brady Campaign for Gun Violence released a recorded robo-call supporting his candidacy. Tarkanian told PolitiFact that he doesn’t dispute the grade, but he never solicited the endorsement. "I didn’t know about it, and I didn’t ask for it," he said. "I have never in my life spoken to the Brady organization." The timeline on the grade is slightly murky. Tarkanian says he wasn’t involved, and the NRA’s former lobbyist covering Nevada, Carrie Herbertson, passed away in 2014. But former Brady Campaign president Paul Helmke said someone from the Tarkanian campaign solicited the endorsement, because the group doesn’t typically involve itself in down-ballot races. "There’s no way we would have been involved in (the) secretary of state race in Nevada unless somebody from the campaign got involved," he said. Dan Burdish, who served as an unpaid adviser to Tarkanian in 2006, said his memory was fuzzy but he believed the failing grade was due to confusion over some of the topics on the questionnaire. "It just got screwed up," he said. Burdish said Tarkanian’s mother, Las Vegas City Councilwoman Lois Tarkanian, contacted the Brady Campaign about endorsing him in the secretary of state race against eventual winner Ross Miller, who got an A from the NRA in 2006. Lois Tarkanian didn’t return multiple calls seeking comment. Second Amendment issues didn’t appear to play a major role in the race, as a cached version of Tarkanian’s 2006 campaign website doesn’t mention firearms and a pre-election preview in the Las Vegas Sun doesn’t mention guns. The F rating resurfaced during Tarkanian’s 2010 run for U.S. Senate, when his then-primary opponent Sue Lowden tried to revive it as a campaign issue. Tarkanian campaign manager James Fisfis told the Las Vegas Review-Journal in 2009 that earlier poor grades were the result of a "misunderstanding" with the surveys. Tarkanian didn’t fill out the questionnaire in 2004 during his run for state Senate, and he received a C+ during his 2012 bid for a U.S. House seat. There’s no record of a grade during his unsuccessful U.S. Senate primary bid in 2010. Nevada Firearms Coalition president Don Turner said his state-based group gave Tarkanian an A rating in 2014, but doesn’t plan to endorse in the current primary. Roberson has a consistent A from the NRA, receiving high marks during his 2010 and 2014 state Senate elections. Tarkanian has generally run on a pro-Second Amendment platform since 2010. He’s written multiple op-eds highly critical of an assault weapon ban and supported reciprocity for concealed weapon permits throughout different states. On his current campaign website, Tarkanian clearly states his firearm policy: "I oppose any and all efforts to register guns and their owners, and I oppose any and all efforts to restrict the sale or ownership of guns by law-abiding citizens." Our ruling A series of Web ads claim Tarkanian has an F rating from the NRA. Tarkanian did receive an F rating from the NRA in 2006, and he also received the blessing of the pro-gun control Brady Campaign. But NRA endorsements are intended to only last for one election cycle, and Tarkanian has planted himself well within conservative orthodoxy on gun issues at least since 2010. In 2012, the most recent grade available, he earned a C+. Roberson’s ad cherry-picked a decade-old rating and left out context about Tarkanian’s more recent comments in opposition to gun control.

pomt-00044	Says Tony Thurmond was "Reprimanded by the Obama Administration for failing to address widespread sexual harassment and assault in district schools."	false	/california/statements/2018/nov/05/students-parents-and-teachers-supporting-marshall-/false-attack-ads-claim-tony-thurmond-was-reprimand/	Was candidate for California schools chief Tony Thurmond "reprimanded" by the Obama administration over assault and sexual harassment problems in his school district? That's one of the eye-opening claims in a recent TV attack ad by a group supporting Marshall Tuck, Thurmond’s opponent in the race. The two Democrats are running for State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Thurmond is a state assemblyman who represents Richmond, Berkeley and other East Bay communities and is supported by teacher unions. Tuck is a former education executive backed by charter school groups. The incumbent, Tom Torlakson, will be termed out in January after serving two four-year terms. The candidates and groups supporting them have produced a flurry of negative ads in recent weeks after raising tens of millions of dollars, turning this typically low-key statewide race into a highly-contested campaign. We wanted to know whether there was evidence to support the claim Thurmond was "reprimanded" by the Obama administration. Our research Before becoming a state lawmaker, Thurmond served on the board of the West Contra Costa Unified School District, based in Richmond, from 2008 to 2012. The TV attack ad refers to a formal censure of the district by the Obama administration, which was addressed to the district’s superintendent. Here’s the full version of the attack ad: "Before he was running for State Superintendent, politician Tony Thurmond was responsible for a school district with widespread budget problems. Ranked last in the state for failing to serve students of color. Sued for leaving at-risk students in rotting trailers with mushrooms growing in the floors. Reprimanded by the Obama Administration for failing to address widespread sexual harassment and assault in district schools. Tony Thurmond failed the students he was supposed to help. California deserves better." Marshall Tuck-supporting PAC ad targeting Tony Thurmond, 2018 from EdSource on Vimeo. The ad was produced by Students, Parents and Teachers supporting Marshall Tuck, an independent expenditure group created by EdVoice, a nonprofit that supports charter schools. During the voiceover, the ad uses misleading text to blur the distinction between action taken against the school district and Thurmond specifically. The text reads: "TONY THURMOND: Reprimanded by the Obama Administration." We looked to the analysis by EdSource, a nonprofit news organization that covers education, on this claim: "The claim that Thurmond was reprimanded by the Obama administration is false. The letter from the Obama-era Education Department’s Office of Civil Rights criticizing West Contra Costa Unified’s handling of sexual harassment never mentions Thurmond or the district’s board. The letter was issued in 2013, after Thurmond left the board, though it does state the department’s investigation began during his term in 2010." The letter was addressed to the superintendent of the school district. "I was never reprimanded by Obama," Thurmond told EdSource, which also reported the ad prompted Thurmond’s campaign to send a cease and desist order to the committee that produced it. A spokeswoman for EdVoice pointed us to a website created by the independent expenditure group backing Tuck. It repeats the same claims in the TV ad and includes a link to the Obama-era letter. But it doesn’t offer any information that directly connects Thurmond to the reprimand. When we asked Thurmond’s campaign about the claim, it pointed to groups and individuals from the NAACP to U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris and San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who have all called out the ad. In a related fact check, we rated False the claim Thurmond was "sued" by the ACLU for leaving students in unsafe conditions. Our ruling A recent TV attack ad by a group supporting Marshall Tuck claimed the Obama administration "reprimanded" Tony Thurmond over assault and sexual harassment problems when he served on a school district board. Obama’s Education Department censured West Contra Costa Unified’s handling of sexual harassment during a period when Thurmond served on the district’s board. But the the report never mentions Thurmond and was addressed to the district’s superintendent. School district administrators, not board members, are responsible for day-to-day management in the district. The text of the TV ad distorts the facts by wrongly singling out Thurmond.

pomt-12622	"There are about as many members of the Armed Forces marching bands as there are American diplomats."	mostly false	/global-news/statements/2017/mar/31/nicholas-burns/are-there-more-military-band-members-diplomats/	President Donald Trump is meeting bipartisan resistance to his plan to trim about 30 percent from the State Department and foreign aid to help pay for a big boost in defense. Lawmakers from both sides of the aisle on the House Foreign Affairs Committee pushed back against such hefty cuts at a March 28 hearing. They asked one witness, former ambassador Nicholas Burns, what he thought of them. Burns served in the administrations of Bill Clinton and both Bushes. He cautioned that "the only place to cut in the State Department is personnel." "You're going to have to make some cruel choices," Burns continued. "The State Department is not big. As Bob Gates said when he was secretary of defense, there are about as many members of the Armed Forces marching bands as there are American diplomats." That certainly gave the trade-off between ammo and diplomacy an unusual twist. We thought we’d dig into the numbers. The result? This comparison is a bit off key. There’s no question that the Pentagon keeps thousands of musicians on hand. A fact sheet on the 2017 Defense appropriations bill said "the Defense Department currently fields more than 130 military bands worldwide, composed of more than 6,000 musicians." In 2016, Politico reported that the total number of trombone, trumpet, keyboard and other instrument players stands at about 6,500. That’s a lot of Souza marches, but the State Department fields a bigger squad of diplomats. There are 8,106 Foreign Service officers, according to a State Department report. (The State Department has about another 5,700 people to support the diplomats, but they don’t do direct diplomatic work.) Still, there are a good 1,600 more diplomats than musicians. Among that slender subset of the population that talks about the State Department budget, this is a popular comparison. Burns, as he said, was citing Gates, who in turn had borrowed the line from former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Although, reading Gates’ words from 2010, it sounds as if he thought Rice was speaking a bit over the top. "Condi Rice used to say, 'We have more people in military bands than they have in the Foreign Service.' She was not far wrong," Gates said. Hillary Clinton used a permutation of this talking point in her 2009 confirmation hearing for secretary of state. She said "there are more members in military bands than there are Foreign Service officers serving overseas." (Our emphasis.) All of them used the quasi-stat to underscore that Congress finds it easier to fund the Defense Department than the State Department. We shared our findings with Burns; he said it was helpful to know it wasn’t accurate. "In any case, the Foreign Service is quite small in comparison to DOD and Homeland Security," he said. "The Trump proposal to cut State/USAID by 31 percent is reckless." Making the comparison department-wide, Burns is on firmer ground. Including support staff, the State Department has about 14,000 people in the Foreign Service. The Defense Department has about 1.3 million active duty soldiers. On that scale, the 1,600 person advantage that diplomats hold over band members is a rounding error. For close readers, we note that Burns added the "marching" part. We don’t know how many military musicians walk and how many sit. From the military bands’ websites, it does seem they do a lot of marching. Our ruling Burns said that there are about as many members of military marching bands as there are diplomats. In plain numbers, there are about 6,500 military musicians and about 8,100 diplomats. So, in fact, the diplomats have about a 1,600 staff advantage.

pomt-13819	Says middle-class New York State residents will have the "lowest tax rate in 70 years."	mostly true	/new-york/statements/2016/jul/15/andrew-cuomo/new-tax-rates-will-be-lowest-70-years/	Gov. Andrew Cuomo thinks you can win money by making a bet with someone on New York State’s tax rates. Ask people about what the state has done with the rates, and "everybody’s going to say, ‘raise taxes,’ because it is inconceivable that a government actually lowers taxes," Cuomo said. At public appearances recently, Cuomo touted what he called the lowest tax rate for the middle class in 70 years. "Wager anyone you know and say, ‘Did New York State raise taxes or lower taxes?’ " Cuomo said. "New York State has lowered taxes for everyone in the state and every income level in the state." Taxes are always a top issue for voters. So does the governor’s claim check out? Are middle-class state residents taxed at the lowest rate in seven decades? Who’s in the middle? No official state definition exists for the "middle class." But in the scope of today’s tax brackets, the middle class are those making between about $40,000 to $300,000 a year. Who’s included in the middle class has changed over time with the rate of inflation. A salary today of $80,000 is equivalent to a $9,000 salary in 1953. The tax brackets used today are not the same as those used in past decades. In 1946, anyone making more than $9,000 was taxed at a 3.5 percent rate. The next year the rate increased to 4.2 percent. In 1948, the rate jumped to 6.3 percent, and that’s the year the Cuomo administration bases its claim. The Department of Tax and Finance says most - if not all - earners in the middle class in 1948 would have paid the top rate. That year the top rate applied to people making about $9,000. That fits what the state has defined as middle class in today’s dollars, and the Department of Tax and Finance says that’s how the middle class would have been defined in that year. How low? Since 1948, the lowest top tax rate fell to between 6.45 and 6.65 percent for people in the same comparable income bracket. That was in 2014, and remains at that level. That’s higher than the now-scheduled rate for 2025 as part of this year’s resolution. Anyone making between $40,000 and $150,000 will see their income tax rate drop to 5.5 percent by that year. The tax rate will drop to 6 percent for those making between $150,000 and $300,000. But there are caveats. The rates do not factor in tax exemptions or deductions, as pointed out by E.J. McMahon from the Empire Center for Public Policy. The center researches and analyzes the state’s economy, including the tax law. To some extent, the tax rates for 2025 and 1948 are like apples to oranges, McMahon said. "It’s much like saying the 2016 Ford Focus has the best headroom since the 1946 Ford Tudor — the two tax codes and the household situations to which they apply are that different," McMahon said. He wrote recently the new rates will be the largest tax cut since the mid-1990s, when lawmakers passed the Taxpayer Relief Act. At the time, the legislation dropped taxes to the lowest rates since 1954. The new tax rates, once fully phased in, will be even lower, according to the Department of Taxation and Finance data. An analysis from the Fiscal Policy Institute confirms Cuomo’s claim holds true - but like McMahon, the institute points out the income range that defines the middle class looks different today than it did 70 years ago. The 1958 exception The Department of Taxation and Finance, in a different report, reveals another interesting historical nugget. Employers were not required by law to withhold tax until 1959. According to the document, because this would have required two years of taxes to be paid in just one year, taxes were ‘canceled’ for 1958 - meaning the tax rate for that year was zero. Our ruling Governor Andrew M. Cuomo claimed new tax rates passed by lawmakers during this year’s state budget process are the lowest in the state in 70 years. Data from the Department of Taxation and Finance backs up his claim. Because of an unusual set of circumstances, there was no income tax rate in 1958 as the state implemented a new system. The first year rates will appear lower than the 1948 rates will be in 2019. We rate this claim as Mostly True.	None	Andrew Cuomo	None	None	None	2016-07-15T12:18:37	2016-06-22	['None']
pomt-05491	A proposed regional transportation tax will last "a minimum" of 10 years, and has been approved to last longer.	false	/georgia/statements/2012/apr/18/anonymous-flier/flier-casts-transportation-referendum-never-ending/	A flier about a vote to raise money for metro Atlanta roads and transit says the plan would create a tax that may never die. The anonymous handout appeared at an April 4 Fayette County Commission workshop, where an Atlanta Regional Commission planner spoke about the transportation special local option sales tax, otherwise known as T-SPLOST. If voters approve it July 31, it will raise an estimated $7.2 billion to build a slate of transportation projects. (The referendum comes with a regional list of projects that total $6.14 billion. In addition, about $1 billion will be sent back to the counties and towns where it was raised.) The flier listed what it said were 10 transportation facts. This one topped the list: "This 1% tax is scheduled for a minimum of 10 years with additional renewals authorized," it said. ARC representatives kept the handout. A spokeswoman sent a copy to PolitiFact Georgia when we requested it. The sentence is a little muddled, but its meaning was clear to PolitiFact Georgia reporters and others who read it: T-SPLOST will last "a minimum" of 10 years, and has been approved to last longer than that. We wondered whether the tax will rise up like a zombie from "The Walking Dead," ready to terrorize metro Atlantans for decades to come. Some fiscal conservatives are fighting the T-SPLOST because they think the government already spends too much money and will use these tax dollars on the wrong projects. Supporters say it will help untangle traffic in a region that’s become notorious for it. Transportation fees that don’t expire are a sore point in metro Atlanta. A toll to finance the building of Ga. 400 was set to expire in 2010, but the State Road and Tollway Authority Board voted to extend it for 10 more years. Gov. Nathan Deal was running for office back then. He promised to revoke the toll by the end of 2011. He didn’t, and earned a Promise Broken on our Deal-O-Meter. Now back to our fact check. We tried to track down the flier’s authors, but came up empty-handed. The handout cited Georgia Statute 48-8-245 (b)2 as the source of information on the tax’s expiration, or lack of one. The statute was written as part of Georgia’s Transportation Investment Act of 2010. The Transportation Investment Act created a process that lets voters decide by region whether to raise taxes to upgrade transportation infrastructure. We read the law and found it does not say what the flier claimed. To the contrary, it lets the proposed tax expire before 10 years are up. Statute 48-8-245 (b) says the tax ends on the earliest of two dates: after 10 years, or if the state revenue commissioner determines the tax has reached its funding goal. For metro Atlanta, that goal is $7.2 billion, or $8.5 billion over 10 years in today's dollars, according to a June 2011 story in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Whether the region reaches its goal ahead of time depends on the economy and how much consumers spend. Voters must approve any extensions. Tea Party Patriots national coordinator Debbie Dooley, whose group was not involved in the creation of the handout, said voters might feel that they must continue the tax. The new infrastructure may need costly maintenance. Some projects may go over budget. Politicians won’t want to give these tax dollars back, Dooley predicted. "They’ll be back with their hands out in 10 years," she said. Still, the flier needs to be revised to say that voters will decide whether to renew the tax, Dooley said. We agree. T-SPLOST may indeed survive its 10-year life span, but a zombie tax would be a creature of voters’ own making. The anonymous flier earns a False.

pomt-14458	Says Donald Trump has written 10 checks to Hillary Clinton "and four of those checks were not to her Senate campaign. … It was to her presidential campaign."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/04/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-donald-trump-wrote-10-checks-hillary/	During the Republican presidential debate in Detroit, Ted Cruz went after Donald Trump by bringing up the real estate developer’s past donations to the Democratic frontrunner, Hillary Clinton. Cruz said, "Donald Trump has written checks to Hillary Clinton not once, not twice, not three times. Ten times. And four of those checks were not to her Senate campaign. It wasn't that she was the New York senator and it was a cost of doing business. It was to her presidential campaign." We found that Cruz has a point that Trump has given multiple donations to Clinton, including to her presidential campaign. However, Cruz’s count is too high, and with the presidential donations, there is less than meets the eye. (We aren’t looking at Trump’s donations to the Clinton Foundation.) We looked up donations by Trump both in the Federal Election Commission donor lookup and a similar tool offered by the Center for Responsive Politics, a group that tracks campaign contributions. Cruz’s number -- 10 donations -- matches the number of donations that come up when searching the FEC site for donations by "Donald Trump." However, searching that way lumps in donations made by Trump’s son, Donald Trump Jr. Weeding out the son’s donations requires clicking into the scanned images of his donation disclosure forms. Here’s a summary of the elder Trump’s donations to Clinton: Date Amount Senate or presidential 05/01/2002 $1,000 Senate 03/23/2005 $1,000 Senate 09/30/2005 $900 Senate 12/02/2005 $1,000 Senate 11/01/2006 $200 Senate 11/12/2007 $600 Presidential 11/09/2009 $1,700 Presidential 11/10/2009 -$2,300 (refund) Presidential This data supports Cruz’s general point that Trump has made multiple donations to Clinton over the years. But Cruz is off on the specifics in several ways. First, the number of total donations isn’t 10, as Cruz said, but seven. The number of donations to her presidential campaign wasn’t four, as Cruz said, but two. Second, the total amount of Trump donations to Clinton’s presidential campaign were refunded in November 2009. Who requested this refund -- Trump or Clinton -- was not recorded in the documentation. Third, the timing of both Trump’s biggest presidential donation and the refund is also curious. The money was not spent and refunded during the heat of the 2008 presidential primary campaign, when Clinton was running. Rather, the transactions came a full year after Barack Obama -- Clinton’s primary rival -- had already been elected president. If we can learn any more about the circumstances of these donations and refunds, we will update this article. Members of Trump’s immediate family also gave money to Clinton over the years. His wife, Melania, gave one donation of $2,000 to Clinton’s Senate campaign in 2006. His daughter, Ivanka, gave three donations totaling $4,400 to Clinton’s Senate campaign in 2006 and 2007. And Donald Trump Jr. gave three donations worth $6,100 in 2006 and 2007, minus a refund of $1,700 in 2008. On net, the younger Trump gave $2,100 in donations to Clinton’s Senate campaign and $2,300 to her presidential campaign. Indeed, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told PolitiFact that "between Trump and his children, it is 10 times. It is all Donald Trump's money." However, we don't consider this money to be Trump's -- his wife and the children who donated are adults -- and Cruz didn't refer to Trump's family at large. Our ruling Cruz said Donald Trump has written 10 checks to Hillary Clinton "and four of those checks were not to her Senate campaign. … It was to her presidential campaign." He has a point that Trump has made multiple campaign donations to Clinton, but he overstated the amounts. Trump ended up making five donations worth $4,100 to Clinton’s Senate campaign, and two donations worth $2,300 to her presidential campaign. The presidential donations were eventually refunded in their entirety. We rate Cruz’s statement Half True.

pomt-06480	Says Texas Senate hopeful Donna Campbell doesn’t live in the district she’s hoping to win in 2012.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/oct/17/burnt-orange-report/democratic-blogger-says-donna-campbell-doesnt-live/	Democratic blogger Katherine Haenschen, writing on the Austin-based Burnt Orange Report, welcomed word that Republican state Sen. Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio is likely drawing a challenger in his party’s March primary. In an Oct. 3, 2011, entry, Haenschen noted that the prospective candidate, Donna Campbell, who is a physician, failed to unseat Democratic U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin in 2010. "This should be interesting," Haenschen wrote. "Dr. Donna is viewed by many as being actually insane." We can’t check looniness, but Haenschen’s blog included a seemingly verifiable claim: "Dr. Donna, by the way, does not currently live in the (senatorial) district ... but is apparently planning to move to Hays County." The Texas Constitution holds that a Senate candidate must have been a resident of the district he or she seeks to represent for at least a year before election. And Wentworth represents the 25th Senatorial District, which runs from a portion of Bexar County north through all of Comal, Guadalupe, Hays and Kendall counties and into a sliver of Travis County, though its boundaries are penciled in to change a bit in time for next year’s election. The 2011 Legislature, acting on results of the 2010 census, reduced the parts of Guadalupe, Hays and Travis counties in the district. By email, Haenschen told us she based her residency claim on information provided by Hays County activists. Separately, we looked up a 2010 Republican Party of Texas candidate list showing Campbell as based in Columbus, in Colorado County, which is east of the 25th Senatorial District. After digging through several bits of conflicting information, though, we’ve concluded that Campbell has since moved to New Braunfels. As we began to check into the residency question, representatives of the Colorado County tax assessor-collector’s office told us Campbell was registered to vote in the county under the name Donna Burrows Campbell. But on Oct. 11, about a week after the Burnt Orange Report’s blog post, Campbell registered to vote in Guadalupe County, we confirmed with the county clerk’s office there. The New Braunfels address that Campbell listed on the voter registration form is within the 25th Senate District, the Guadalupe County elections administrator told us. More conflicting information came when we checked on Campbell’s homestead, which is one’s principal residence for tax purposes. When we visited the website for Colorado County’s Central Appraisal District, it showed a homestead tax exemption for Donna Burrows on property on Texas 71 in the county. In a telephone interview, though, Olga Poncik of the Colorado County appraisal district told us the property is not registered as a homestead, though it was for 2010. In an Oct. 6, 2011, interview, Campbell campaign consultant Luke Macias told us Campbell lives in New Braunfels. Declining our request to interview Campbell, he said that if Campbell were pulled over for speeding, she’d pull out her driver’s license showing that address. Asked for a copy of the license, he sent us a copy of an undated letter from the Texas Department of Public Safety to Campbell at the New Braunfels address, headlined: "Attached is your new driver license/identification card." Our ruling We were frustrated in this check because the blogger did not prove her claim and Campbell didn’t discuss it with us. Our sense, based on available information, is that while Campbell formerly lived in Colorado County and was even still registered to vote there at the time of the Burnt Orange Report blog post, she settled in the 25th District, and obtained a driver’s license there, some time after voting in October 2010 and before the blogger aired her claim. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Burnt Orange Report	None	None	None	2011-10-17T06:00:00	2011-10-03	['None']
pomt-10600	"I won the majority of the Republican vote in both New Hampshire and South Carolina."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/24/john-mccain/when-first-means-second/	Pressed on his credentials with GOP voters, John McCain said he won them over in two early primaries. But he didn't. Exit polls from the Jan. 19, 2008, primary show he narrowly lost to Mike Huckabee among self-identified Republicans in South Carolina, 32 percent to 31 percent. And in New Hampshire, exit polls show Mitt Romney beat McCain 35 percent to 34 percent. However, it should be noted that a few news agencies, including MSNBC, showed McCain narrowly winning among Republicans in their results. The topic is important to McCain because he has often struggled to win over die-hard Republicans. Exit polls show moderate and independent voters powered both of his victories. But when the schedule moves to states like Florida, where primaries are closed to independents, his need for Republican support becomes critical. The exit polls show that McCain didn't lose among Republicans in either state. When you factor in a margin of error, both are statistical ties. But what McCain said was that he "won the majority" of Republicans in those states, and we don't find any evidence that that's true. We rule McCain's statement False.

pomt-05408	Says the stimulus bill sent tax credits overseas, such as "half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/may/03/americans-prosperity/ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-jobs-finland/	Is your tax money paying for jobs in Finland? A TV ad running in eight states blames President Barack Obama for sending stimulus money overseas while Americans are out of work. "Tell President Obama, American tax dollars should help American taxpayers," the narrator says. Instead, $2.3 billion in tax credits funded jobs in Mexico, Finland and China, the ad claims. Americans for Prosperity, a group dedicated to "educating citizens about economic policy" that works closely with tea party activists and has been funded by the conservative Koch family, released the ad April 26, 2012. Here’s the string of claims, starting with an image of the president signing a bill: Washington promised to create American jobs. We passed their stimulus. But that's not what happened. Fact: Billions of taxpayer dollars spent on green energy went to jobs in foreign countries. The Obama administration admitted the truth, that $2.3 billion of tax credits went overseas, while millions of Americans can't find a job. $1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico. Half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland. And tens of millions of dollars to build traffic lights in China. We rated one claim from the ad, about stimulus tax credits supposedly funding a plant in Mexico, a Pants on Fire falsehood. A second claim, on building traffic lights in China, we rated Mostly False. In this fact-check, we’re examining if those tax credits included "half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland." (We've also checked many other exaggerations about the stimulus.) The ad said its source for the Finland claim was an ABC News article, "Car Company Gets U.S. Loan, Builds Cars In Finland." A loan for U.S. work The first clue something’s wrong is in that ABC News headline. A car company got a "U.S. loan." That’s not the same thing as a tax credit. Taxpayers expect to get loan money back, with interest. (Though, they don’t always. See: Solyndra.) Things get even more wrong from there. That U.S. loan program? It's the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program through the Energy Department. And it's not funded by Obama’s stimulus bill — otherwise known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. It is, in fact, a program signed into existence by President George W. Bush in 2007 and first funded by legislation Bush signed in 2008. The program was designed to support development of advanced technology vehicles. The Bush administration was in charge when the automaker filed its application. The Obama administration was in charge when the company’s loan was approved. The stimulus bill had nothing to do with it. Now, the ad could have raised relevant criticism of the Energy Department’s loan programs. Watchdogs inside and outside government have argued since the Bush administration that the programs haven’t included safeguards sufficient to protect taxpayers. Instead, the ad says stimulus tax credits funded overseas jobs. That’s the claim we’re weighing here. And that’s just not the case. Fisker Automotive, a U.S. automaker with global headquarters in Anaheim, Calif., got its $529 million federal loan to develop and produce two lines of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles — the Karma and the Nina. The project was expected to create about 2,000 jobs in Wilmington, Del., where the Nina would be manufactured, according to the Energy Department. Part of the loan — $169 million — paid for design, engineering and other work in the United States on the Fisker Karma. A larger part — $359 million — was slated to help buy and reconfigure a shuttered General Motors plant in Delaware to build the Nina. Here’s where Finland enters the story: Before its Energy Department loans were approved, Fisker had decided it would manufacture the Karma at a plant in Finland. The company argued there simply wasn’t a U.S. plant available for the type of car they were building. But 65 percent of the parts for the Karma, based on cost, would come from U.S. suppliers. "There was no contract manufacturer in the U.S. that could actually produce our vehicle," Henrik Fisker, the company's founder, told ABC News. "They don't exist here." The loan for the design of the car "was only used for the U.S. operations" and could not be spent overseas, according to Fisker and the Energy Department. Meanwhile, most of the loan has yet to be disbursed. Fisker says it stopped taking loan money from the Energy Department in May 2011, after drawing $190 million — most of it for Karma design and development. Its Nina project, now called the Atlantic, has been delayed. The News Journal in Wilmington, Del., reported the payments to Fisker stopped after the company failed to meet Energy Department milestones set as conditions for the loan. "Our loan documents require borrowers to meet certain milestones and other conditions prior to receiving loan proceeds," department spokesman Damien LaVera told PolitiFact. "As has been widely reported, Fisker has experienced some delays in its sales and production schedule -- which is common for start-ups. "As Fisker works through those issues and incorporates lessons learned from the production of the Karma, the department is working with Fisker to review a revised business plan and determine the best path forward so the company can meet its benchmarks, produce cars and employ workers here in America." That makes it an open question when the Delaware plant will produce Fisker autos. As of April, it only employed a small maintenance team. In the meantime, it's not getting loan money. Our ruling An ad from Americans for Prosperity starts with an image of Obama and says the stimulus bill sent tax credits overseas, such as "half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland." The reality: Half a billion in loans from a Bush-era program were approved for Fisker Automotive. But they weren’t tax credits, weren’t part of the stimulus bill, and didn’t go to Finland. And so far, the company has only gotten $190 million in those loans, far less than the half a billion. Instead, the U.S. company spent a third of the money on U.S. engineering of a new electric vehicle. It chose to manufacture the car in Finland, without U.S. help. Another two-thirds of the loan, which it may or may not get, will go toward retooling a shuttered GM plant in Delaware. The ad strings together disparate statements to tell a concocted story. The result is simply False.	None	Americans for Prosperity	None	None	None	2012-05-03T11:11:33	2012-04-26	['Finland']
pomt-00703	"The U.S. representatives that voted to keep militarizing the police received 73 percent more campaign money from the defense industry" than the representatives who voted to stop it.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/30/representus/did-lawmakers-who-voted-keep-defense-surplus-progr/	The recent unrest in Baltimore following the death of an African-American man who’d been taken into police custody has gotten people debating on social media, questioning the role of the federal government in militarizing local police. A reader asked us to check a meme on this topic that recently entered their social media feed. "The U.S. representatives that voted to keep militarizing the police received 73 percent more campaign money from the defense industry," the meme reads. It accompanies an image of a phalanx of helmeted police with guns raised at a suspect whose hands are raised in surrender. The meme was created by represent.us, which was founded in 2012 and describes itself as "building a fiercely nonpartisan movement to pass tough anti-corruption laws in cities and states across America." Its board members range include former Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer, GOP strategist Mark McKinnon, former disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig and D.C.-based think tanker Norm Ornstein. We thought the meme merited a closer look. Checking the number The source of the statistical claim was not hard to find. It originated with a study done using an online tool created by MapLight, a website that tracks and analyzes money in politics. The study looked at how lawmakers voted on an amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2015 (H.R. 4870) that would have prohibited the use of funds to transfer various types of surplus military vehicles and gear to local and state police forces through a Pentagon program established in the late 1990s known as the 1033 program. The amendment in question was offered by Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., on June 19, 2014. It failed by a vote of 62-355, but the MapLight study found some interesting statistics. The study tallied up all of the donations to lawmakers from the defense industry between Jan. 1, 2011, and Dec. 31, 2013, using seven categories of industrial sectors tracked by the Center for Responsive Politics. It determined that lawmakers who voted against the amendment took in $53,153 from defense-related donors, while those who voted in favor of the amendment took in $31,240 from those same industries. That means the "no" voters received 70 percent more in defense donations than did the "yes" voters. That’s slightly off from the 73 percent cited in the meme, but it’s pretty close. (We found an older article on Maplight that said "73 percent"; MapLight staff told us the difference likely arose when a legislator returned a contribution, and the data automatically updated.) So the number is close to the mark. But what about the significance of this finding? This is less certain. What does the connection actually mean? As we noted, the 1033 program gives surplus military goods to local and state law enforcement, so it’s not obvious how the defense industry would benefit from a vote to keep the 1033 program alive. The industry sells its goods only to the Pentagon; the 1033 program doesn’t open up a pipeline for the industry to sell its products to local law enforcement. Nor does the industry get a cut of the transaction with state and local police forces. Some experts told PolitiFact that they don’t see how the defense industry would have a dog in this particular fight. "There is no reason to think that defense contractors benefit from the 1033 program," said Benjamin H. Friedman, a research fellow in defense and homeland security studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. "The transfer of military goods to local or state authorities is quite unlikely to affect what the Pentagon orders in the first place." Friedman called the connection "likely spurious." Brent Skorup, who has studied the issue for the free-market Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said that while the meme "seems to imply that lobbying dollars buys votes … the causation is pretty complicated, and I think the implication is overblown." Todd Harrison, a fellow with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, agreed that the link was likely "tenuous." "It is possible that defense companies could profit by selling spare parts for that equipment to state and local governments," he said. "If the Defense Department simply destroyed the equipment, the companies would have a smaller market for (original equipment-manufacturer) parts, in theory. But a lot of the equipment being transferred doesn’t seem like it would have the potential for high-priced, high-volume spare parts. I don’t see much of a connection here." A spokesman for Represent.us, Mansur Gidfar, disagreed. He said the existence of the 1033 program indirectly benefits the defense industry because it allows the Pentagon to err on the larger side when making orders. "The Pentagon may not be ordering more than they need intentionally, but I have to imagine ‘we're passing these resources on to communities that need them to keep the streets safe’ is a much more palatable talking point than ‘we ordered too much and now they're sitting in a warehouse,’ " Gidfar said. In addition, at least one armored-vehicle contractor -- Lenco Industries, which sells to both the military and domestic law enforcement market -- advertises federal grant-writing classes to police, which suggests that suppliers take an interest in such legislation. Vehicles initially obtained through the 1033 program may hook police forces on their products and spur direct purchases further down the road. Given the uncertainties, Gidfar said that his group was careful when creating the meme to highlight the correlation between defense-industry dollars and voting -- not a causal relationship. Indeed, several experts noted that it may be an independent variable -- the lawmaker’s philosophical or ideological affinity for a strong military and aggressive policing -- that could account for both the larger acceptance of defense-industry money and a "no" vote on the amendment. Ultimately, "it is up to citizens to decide whether or not money played a role in how their legislator voted," said Pamela Behrsin, MapLight’s vice president of communications and a contributor to the original study. Our ruling The group Represent.us created a meme that read, "The U.S. Representatives that voted to keep militarizing the police received 73 percent more campaign money from the defense industry" than did the representatives who voted to stop it. The correct number is actually 70 percent, which is close to what the meme said. But it’s worth noting there's significant doubt about how meaningful this connection is. Several independent experts said it’s not obvious that the defense industry would have a strong self-interest in supporting the continued existence of the program, and if they don’t, that would undercut the meme’s underlying message. Others say defense contractors do have a small but real interest in seeing that police get the equipment. Overall, the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. Correction: This article has been changed to reflect that Maplight's data on campaign contributions automatically updates. We initially reported that a numerical difference was due to mistaken typing.	None	Represent.us	None	None	None	2015-04-30T14:58:24	2015-04-30	['United_States']

pomt-04239	"In 2011, our state-run lottery funded New Jersey classrooms by over $930 million."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/nov/19/big-gamble-nj/group-claims-new-jerseys-classrooms-received-930-m/	Budget woes abound in storm-battered and cash-strapped New Jersey, and now one group claims the state is rolling the dice on its fourth largest revenue source: the lottery. The Communication Workers of America, a union that represents lottery workers, and the Asian American Retailers Association, a group representing convenience and liquor stores and gas stations, has launched a campaign -- called Big Gamble NJ -- to oppose the state’s plan to contract with a private company to manage the lottery’s sales and marketing. Last week Big Gamble NJ started promoting a website that argues such a move would hurt small businesses and taxpayers. On Nov. 13, one slide on the group’s homepage read: "In 2011, our state-run lottery funded New Jersey classrooms by over $930 million." Another slide read: "New Jersey businesses earned nearly $150 million from lottery sales last year alone." Under those slides, the website states, "tell Governor Christie and your state legislators not to gamble with New Jersey's lottery revenues" and provides a link to sign a petition. Here PolitiFact New Jersey checked whether the lottery handed out more than $900 million to schools in 2011. We learned that’s not quite the case. A good chunk of the $930 million helped fund education in New Jersey, but not all of it. The constitutional amendment voters passed in 1969 that authorized the establishment of the state lottery dictated that its "entire net proceeds" must go toward state institutions and education aid. The state lottery doled out $930 million to such causes in fiscal year 2011. Nearly three-quarters of that money went toward education-related initiatives, according to the state lottery’s annual report. More than $105 million funded programs in the state education department, including about $53 million for school construction and renovation. The majority of the money -- more than $580 million -- benefited higher education. More than half of that $580 million was dedicated to operating costs for public colleges. Still, about a quarter of the the $930 million paid for other social services. Roughly $156 million helped fund state psychiatric hospitals and centers for the developmentally disabled received nearly $47 million. More than $36 million in lottery proceeds bulked up operating support for homes for disabled soldiers. So education-related initiatives received a large majority, but not all, of the $930 million in contributions from the lottery in 2011. Seth Hahn, the New Jersey legislative and political director for Communications Workers of America, acknowledged the error on Wednesday afternoon. The website was updated that evening. It now reads: "In 2011, our public lottery funded classrooms & other services by over $930 million." Still, Hahn said that didn’t change the fundamental issue that the proposal is bad for businesses and taxpayers. The history of privatization in New Jersey is a "story of graft, fraud and cronyism leading to taxpayers being on the hook for political indiscretion," he said. "We believe that when it comes to funding education, care for the developmentally disabled, and services for our veterans, New Jerseyans deserve better." Bill Quinn, a spokesman for the state Treasury Department, said the implication that the state is selling the lottery is false. He said a state agency "will still have an oversight function" and "the state is going to continue to get the money from the lottery." Our ruling Big Gamble NJ -- an advocacy group that opposes privatizing management of the state lottery -- said on its website that "in 2011, our state-run lottery funded New Jersey classrooms by over $930 million." The lottery funneled $930 million into education and other social services in fiscal year 2011. Nearly three quarters of that amount funded education-related initiatives. So New Jersey’s classroom didn’t receive the full $930 million from the state lottery, but education aid comprised a significant majority of that money. We rate this statement Mostly True.

pomt-03322	Says "our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/25/barack-obama/obama-says-deficit-falling-fastest-rate-60-years/	President Barack Obama aimed to refocus the national debate and put the economy front and center with a speech at Knox College in Illinois. It was the same place he spoke as a senator in 2005 about the need for the government to help the middle class. He stuck to that theme in this speech, but now as president, he summarized the improvements that have come on his watch. He talked about millions of new jobs, burgeoning energy production, and the nation’s improving balance sheet. "Our deficits are falling at the fastest rate in 60 years," Obama told the crowd. In light of Obama’s ongoing battle with Republicans over taxes and spending, we thought this would be an interesting claim to examine. In this factcheck, we look at whether we are really seeing one of the most rapid declines in the deficit in many decades. As a reminder, the deficit is a snapshot of one year’s fiscal outlook. It’s the shortfall between what the government spends and what the government collects in taxes and other revenues. The White House press office told us that the proof is in the numbers. They tracked the deficit as a percent of the entire economy, measured as the Gross Domestic Product. In 2009, the first year of Obama’s presidency, after tax cuts and new spending, the deficit was 10.1 percent of GDP. In 2012, the deficit declined to 7 percent of GDP. So that’s a decline of 3.1 percentage points. You have to go back 63 years to the period between 1946 and 1949 to find a bigger four-year drop than what the country saw between 2009 and 2012. Right after World War II ended, the U.S. deficit stood at 7.2 percent of GDP. By 1949, America had a surplus of 0.2 percent. So that’s a decline of 7.4 percentage points. We downloaded data from the Office of Management and Budget that shows the deficit as a percent of GDP all the way back to 1930. When we ran the numbers, we found, as Obama said, you need to go back to 1946 to find a larger change. The numbers game As with any statistics, you have to be careful, and to help us be careful, we contacted five economists and policy analysts. The White House simply did a little subtraction to measure the difference between the numbers at the start and the end of the four years. There is another option, which is to look at the relative size of the decline. So if the deficit went from 10.1 percent of GDP to 7 percent of GDP, that means the deficit dropped 30 percent. But when we did this going back to World War II, we saw some very strange results. Big deficit declines could look smaller in relative terms than small declines. Jason Peuquet, research director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization that seeks to reduce deficits faster than the president has done, confirmed that point. Peuquet said the administration has the right approach, because relative numbers can make very different changes look the same. Peuquet gave the example of a deficit of 1 percent of GDP in the first year and 0.5 percent after four years. "That would look like a 50 percent improvement in the level," Peuquet said. "However, a change in deficits that went from 10 percent of GDP to 5 percent of GDP would also register as a 50 percent improvement – despite being a much larger change in relation to the economy." Peuquet and others raised a second statistical issue -- choosing the endpoints for the comparison. It’s a common device to pick the range that best proves your point. But in the case of deficit reduction, no one quibbled with the idea that longer periods are more revealing, and Obama used all the years he has available. His first year in office was 2009 and the numbers for 2013 are not yet in. To the extent that a majority view emerged, economist Alan Auerbach at the University of California Berkeley probably expressed it best. "There is no single ‘correct’ way of doing the analysis," Auerbach said, "but I would say that their approach is a reasonable one." One reason Obama is able to point to an historically high decline is because the deficit as a percent of GDP had never been higher. Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an advocacy group focused on taxes and spending, said the reduction is significant. But at the same time, he said, "Let’s face it, there was a lot to reduce. The deficit was morbidly obese." Similarly, the economy took a major hit which gave it more room for improvement in historic terms. So even a moderate recovery has eased the deficit by both increasing tax receipts and reducing demand for government aid such as unemployment support. Lastly, while the deficit might decline, the country’s accumulated debt is projected to grow. "The future path is not captured in snapshots of what happened over the past few years, Peuquet said. "It ignores the unsustainable debt trajectory the country still faces." Our ruling Barack Obama said the deficit has fallen at the fastest rate in 60 years. While economists vary on how to best measure that decline, the president used an acceptable approach and his numbers are accurate. There are no statistical tricks in play. Our experts warned against reading too much into Obama’s claim. While Obama did not spend much time one way or the other on the significance of the decline in the deficit, he didn’t mention ongoing concerns over the national debt. We rate the statement True.

pomt-03952	"Agriculture has always required a significant workforce from abroad."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/feb/18/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-said-weve-always-needed-foreign-worker/	One reason the U.S. needs immigration reform is to ensure we have enough farm workers, says U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Rubio was part of the bipartisan "Gang of Eight" that unveiled an immigration framework in January. The framework includes a path to residency and citizenship for many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants and would give special consideration to farm workers, among other groups. Rubio has been shopping around these principles to conservative news outlets, including a Jan. 30 column on the conservative RedState.com. Part of his column focused on immigrant farm labor. "Agriculture has always required a significant workforce from abroad, but we do not have a system through which growers and dairies can bring a workforce legally into the U.S.," Rubio wrote. Rubio called for a "modernized agricultural worker program" that "allows our growers to contract the seasonal and year round labor they need legally." The part that drew our attention was his broad claim that "agriculture has always required a significant workforce from abroad." We wondered whether it was accurate to make such a blanket statement without any parameters for time period or type of farm. In a related fact-check, we will explore whether the U.S. has a system for farmers to legally import foreign workers. Rubio's evidence Over the past 15 years, about half of the hired workers employed in U.S. crop agriculture were unauthorized, with the overwhelming majority of these workers coming from Mexico, according to research based on the U.S. Department of Labor’s National Agricultural Workers Survey. Rubio’s office sent us a few reports from government agencies and researchers that looked at the history of immigrant workers in agriculture. Most notably, there was the Bracero program, a program that brought in temporary farm workers mostly from Mexico between 1942 and 1964, peaking at almost a half-million workers, according to a 1965 U.S. Department of Agriculture report. While that sounds like a significant number of foreign workers, they were more common in some places than others. Braceros primarily farmed vegetables, fruits, cotton and sugar beets, and they were concentrated in seven states: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Michigan and Texas. By the 1960s, mechanization reduced the need for these workers for some crops. Historians weigh in about Rubio’s claim We interviewed several historians who specialize in American history, immigration or agriculture. They said it is difficult to generalize about the agricultural workforce, because it differs by time period, location and type of farm. "It's not as simple as you might think," said University of Wisconsin professor Jess Gilbert in an email to PolitiFact. "Certain types of U.S. farming use foreign workers, while others don't." Fruit and vegetable farms used a lot of hired labor. "But these farms are a small proportion of all U.S. farms, the vast majority of which hire no labor and never have. This includes ‘family farms’ in most parts of the country, stereotypically the Midwest," Gilbert said. Paul Conkin, a Vanderbilt history professor emeritus who wrote a book about American agriculture since 1929, said that Rubio’s claim "is either completely wrong or misleading." "Through most of our agricultural history, the workforce largely consisted of farm owners, family members, or one or two hired hands from the neighborhood," he said. "Only since World War II have migratory workers become a major component of farm labor." Many of the professors we interviewed noted that in the South, farms relied on slave labor and later sharecroppers, and many of those people were born in the United States. Columbia University history professor Eric Foner pointed to the Reconstruction period when he said southern plantation owners tried to import foreign workers, including Chinese, to drive down the wages of recently freed blacks. "Very few came -- why go to work as an exploited plantation laborer when jobs were available to immigrants in northern factories?" he said. "This is often the underlying reason for agricultural producers claiming there is a shortage of labor and foreign workers are needed." William and Mary professor Cindy Hahamovitch said Rubio is on the right track, but that some of that immigrant workforce was forced to come here. "In the colonial period most farm laborers would have been European indentured servants and African slaves, especially in the South. After the slave trade ban in 1808 and the Napoleonic Wars, there wasn't much immigration in the early 19th century, but some 30 million Europeans plus Asians and Mexicans arrived in the following century, and many of them would have done farm work." Philip Martin, a University of California professor, co-wrote a paper about migration and farmers that Rubio’s staff cited to us. "Hired workers today are the majority of workers employed in U.S. agriculture, and most were born in Mexico," Martin said. "But especially during the 1930s, most hired workers were U.S.-born, like the Okies and Arkies of Grapes of Wrath days." Our ruling Rubio said that "agriculture has always required a significant workforce from abroad." There have been certain time periods and types of farms that did use many foreign workers. But Rubio overgeneralized when he suggested that throughout American history, all types of farms needed foreign workers. Farms have also been owner-operated, with little need of a foreign work force. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2013-02-18T12:12:07	2013-01-30	['None']
pomt-08062	Says Texas Republican leaders "have proposed laying off thousands of teachers."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2010/dec/24/boyd-richie/democratic-chairman-says-republican-leaders-are-ca/	Boyd Richie, chairman of the Texas Democratic Party, voiced dismay when an East Texas state representative re-elected as a Democrat in November signaled plans to join the Republican Party. Richie said in a Dec. 13 press release that Rep. Allan Ritter of Nederland would be joining the party "whose leaders have proposed laying off thousands of teachers and slashing the budgets of institutions like Lamar University in Beaumont." The budget guidance to state agencies has been widely reported. For this article, we’re zeroing in on whether GOP leaders have proposed laying off thousands of teachers. Democratic spokeswoman Kirsten Gray pointed to news reports on recommendations that lawmakers ease the longstanding class-size mandate for the five earliest elementary-school grades. On Dec. 8, the Dallas Morning News reported that the Senate Education Committee, chaired by Sen. Florence Shapiro, R-Plano, wants the Senate to consider modifying the 22-pupil class-size cap, which is a change championed by state Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston. The cap was put in place by lawmakers in a 1984 special session on education that also raised teacher pay and launched the requirement that students pass classes to participate in extracurricular activities. A day later, the newspaper said a fresh recommendation by State Comptroller Susan Combs would require schools to average 22 students in the early grades, compared to the current average of 19.3 students. The News’ story says that with the change, nearly 12,000 elementary teaching jobs would be cut, saving the state $558 million a year. Teacher groups objected. Richard Kouri, spokesman for the Texas State Teachers Association, told the News: "It’s no surprise that if you put more kids in classrooms and fire a bunch of teachers, you’ll save money. And you don’t save $558 million a year without firing thousands of elementary school teachers." How did Combs propose teacher layoffs? She didn’t, in so many words. But the comptroller’s December report, Connecting the Dots: School Spending and Student Progress, says the state would save $159 million annually if Kindergarten-Grade 4 class sizes were told to average 20 students or nearly $558 million if the permitted average was 22 students. The report bases the projected savings on the average state salary for K-4 teachers of $46,904. By our math, Combs’ recommendation could eliminate the need for 3,390 to 11,886 teaching positions. Combs’ spokesman, Allen Spelce, didn’t quibble with our math, yet said by e-mail that the recommendation "does not necessarily imply layoffs." Other ways to cut teaching costs without teachers losing jobs: "Enrollment growth could help increase" the average number of students per classroom and "simple (employee) attrition could help too," Spelce said. His e-mail closes: "The recommendation was simply to give districts more local control and flexibility" in tight budget times. Kouri reaffirmed to us there’s no way to achieve big savings without thousands of layoffs though Catherine Clark, an administrator for the Texas Association of School Boards, said there could be layoffs, but not in the thousands, adding that normal attrition in the teaching ranks could soften the impact. Next, we read the Senate panel’s recommendation, which says "options to explore" include modifying class-size limits. The report, signed by the committee’s five Republicans and four Democrats, has no additional details or any indication the committee even favors modification. In an interview, Shapiro agreed that changing the 22-1 ratio could lead to teacher job losses, but she cautioned against assuming that means thousands of layoffs. Shapiro said: "What I hope to see, (districts) will start utilizing those teachers in a different way... Maybe they stop hiring new teachers." Shapiro also said the idea didn’t originate with Republican leaders; school superintendents have sought flexibility in the class-size standard. Spokeswomen Jackie Lain of the school boards’ association and Jenny Caputo of the Texas Association of School Administrators told us districts consider the class-size cap a major cost driver and administrators would welcome more sway over class size. However, neither group has declared a position on changing the law. Lain said how each district handles a revised cap would vary and districts would look for ways to avoid layoffs. "School boards don’t want to fire teachers," she said. Lain, Caputo and other school experts said school enrollment growth, which averaged 2 percent statewide in the decade through 2008-09, affects teacher hirings; so does teacher turnover. Statewide, the number of teachers in public schools increased 5,300 from 2008-09 to 2009-10, according to the Texas Education Agency, whose spokeswoman, Debbie Graves Ratcliffe, said it’s reasonable to assume the additions resulted from increased student enrollment. Teacher turnover averages 12 percent, Ratcliffe said, which for 2009-10 would amount to nearly 40,000 of more than 330,000 teachers. Whew. We ran the fact that no one has directly proposed laying off teachers past the Democratic spokeswoman. Gray replied by e-mail: "Obviously no lawmaker is going to stand up and say ‘we should lay off 12,000 teachers,’ but that is the practical effect of the proposal. If someone proposes an idea that has an understood cost, they must take ownership of not only the idea, but the cost that is inherently tied to it." Our sense: One Republican leader -- Combs -- has recommended that lawmakers ease the class-size limit, which she projects would produce significant savings in teacher salaries. But no one has pitched a proposal calling for thousands of teacher layoffs. That’d be political hari-kari. Nevertheless, it stands to reason that larger classes leads to fewer teachers, which gives Richie’s statement an element of truth. We rate it Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-06743	"The studies have shown us that [drug testing for welfare recipients] will be saving us money"	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/aug/26/doreen-costa/rep-costa-says-drug-testing-welfare-recipients-wil/	Rep. Doreen Costa, of North Kingstown, a Republican and member of the Rhode Island Tea Party, thinks the state could save money by requiring welfare recipients to pass a drug test. She is proposing that Rhode Island adopt a law modeled after one enacted in Florida, which took effect July 1. The law bans recipients who fail a drug test (and a confirmatory test) from receiving cash assistance for a year, unless they successfully complete substance abuse treatment at their own expense. If they complete treatment, they can reapply after six months. If they reapply and fail another drug test, they are banned for three years. The child of someone who fails the test will continue to receive money if the parent designates a family member, such as a grandparent, to handle the funds or if the Florida Department of Children and Families (DCF) designates a "protective payee." The selected family member must also pass a drug test and be approved by DCF. Recipients would not be tested for alcohol or tobacco use. Costa said the test would cost $25 to $35 per person and recipients would have to pay for it up front. The state would reimburse them if they passed. "The studies have shown us that it will be saving us money, but we don't have the exact amount," Costa said on WHJJ's Helen Glover Show. "If we could save the state $10,000, I'll take it. If we could save them a million, I'll take it. We have to start somewhere." We're not going to examine whether drug screening is a good idea. But we were intrigued by the question of whether there are studies showing that it would save money. For this item, we will look at the prospect of savings in Rhode Island, because Costa told us that’s what she was talking about at the time. We will also examine what studies in other states have concluded when legislators have considered drug-testing their recipients on welfare, formally known as the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program (TANF). The short answer for Rhode Island is that, under the current system, no state money would be saved because "100 percent of the cash given to TANF recipients is federal money," said Fred Sneesby, spokesman for the Rhode Island Department of Labor and Training. Under current law, the federal government doesn't allow Rhode Island to keep any money it saves by denying benefits to people who test positive for drugs, Sneesby said. Nor will the federal government pay for such testing. How much would testing cost the state? We did a back-of-the-envelope calculation based on data supplied by The Rhode Island Poverty Institute. As of May 2011, there were 5,653 adults receiving TANF benefits, including 1,314 from two-parent families and the rest from single-parent families. The cost to the state would depend, in part, on how many people passed, because only those who failed would end up paying for their test. The state would pay for the rest. When Michigan briefly did drug testing for welfare recipients (more about that state's experience later), about 92 percent passed, in part because they knew the test was coming. If Rhode Island recipients passed at the same rate and testing cost $25 to $35 per person, as Costa suggested, that would result in a bill of $130,000 to $182,000 per year. That doesn't include the continuing cost of testing new applicants, doing confirmatory tests to make sure the first test isn't a false positive and any administrative appeals filed by people who wanted to challenge any move to reduce their welfare checks. So what about the studies that, Costa claimed, showed costs savings in other states? When we asked her to pinpoint them, she couldn't cite any. She said she had done her research by going on Ask.com and Google.com and posing the question, "Will drug-testing welfare recipients save money?" We repeated that exercise. Our spot check showed that the top results consisted mostly of blog items, websites and news stories in which various politicians and commentators had asserted -- without real evidence -- that drug screening would save money. However, we did find some studies, but they didn’t support her contention. A 2009 analysis of a proposed drug testing law by Louisiana's Legislative Fiscal Office concluded that testing would save the state $480,373 in denied benefits while costing the state $184,114 for testing and $763,306 for treatment -- a net loss of $467,047. If you strip out the treatment costs -- because Costa's proposal calls for people to pay for their own substance abuse treatment -- the net savings to the Louisiana taxpayer would be $296,259. But Louisiana fiscal analyst Patrice Thomas told us that those calculations were prepared before the state was informed that the federal government would not pay for any of the testing and would not allow the state to keep all of the savings if people were denied benefits. Analyses of bills submitted in 2010 and 2011 showed the drug testing would be a money-loser for the state. The most recent study we found was done in February 2011 by Idaho's Department of Health and Welfare. It estimated that 10 percent of welfare recipients would test positive for drugs and that 25 percent of that group would lose benefits after failing a confirmatory test, saving $1.13 million per year. Idaho also assumed that the state would get to keep $67,905 of the savings. But those savings would be wiped out by the cost of the testing, estimated at $246,591. Thus, for every dollar the state spends in testing, it would get back only 28 cents. In January 2011, Indiana's Office of Fiscal and Management Analysis released an assessment of a drug testing proposal making the rounds in its legislature. It concluded the state would save between $57,000 and $87,000. But that analysis didn't include any administrative costs. (Idaho estimated that for every dollar spent on drug-test costs, the state would need to spend $3.41 on various staff costs.) Even if you assumed that Indiana's extra administrative costs were the same as its testing costs -- $173,000 per year -- that would easily wipe out the savings to the state. Florida isn't the first state to pass a drug testing law for welfare recipients. Michigan adopted one in 1999 but it was put on hold after five weeks because of a court challenge. (About 8 percent of the 268 applicants tested during those five weeks scored positive for illicit drugs. Most had been using marijuana; fewer than 3 percent were found to be using harder drugs.) The law was struck down in 2003 by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals, which ruled that drug testing without probable cause was ruled to be unconstitutional. A similar challenge has been predicted for the Florida law. Arizona does drug testing, but only for people who admit on a written screening test that they have used drugs in the past, gotten into legal trouble because of drugs, or lost or been denied a job because of drugs. That screening test, derided by advocates of chemical testing because it's easy for people to lie, gives the state probable cause to test for drugs, avoiding the constitutional issue. (Among the people who flunked the screening test, 12.5 percent ultimately tested positive for illegal drugs.) Minnesota and Wisconsin do drug testing, but only of convicted drug felons. The Florida law, and the one Costa would like to see passed in Rhode Island, does not call for written screening. To sum up: Costa, when asked about her proposal to test welfare recipients for drugs, didn't predict specific savings for Rhode Island, only that "The studies have shown us that it will be saving us money." But she was unable to produce any studies to back up that claim. The ones we found showed that the costs to the state exceed any savings. And Rhode Island can't save money by kicking people off the welfare rolls because federal funds finance the payments, and the federal government does not allow states to keep money saved through mandatory drug testing. We rate her statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/22c847d7-83db-4053-b621-e27c676778a7	None	Doreen Costa	None	None	None	2011-08-26T08:00:00	2011-08-10	['None']

pomt-10417	When McCain was questioned about hiring lobbyists to his campaign staff, "his top lobbyist actually had the nerve to say, 'The American people won't care about this.' "	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/may/23/barack-obama/obamas-right-mccains-campaign-said-it-doesnt-matte/	In a speech before 15,000 people in Tampa on May 21, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama said that it was time to get away from "special interest-dominated politics in Washington." He criticized Sen. John McCain for hiring some of the biggest lobbyists in Washington to run his presidential campaign. "And when called on it," Obama said, "his top lobbyist actually had the nerve to say, 'The American people won't care about this.' I think the American people do care about it." Obama didn't say who he was talking about, and his campaign did not respond to clarify. But we think Obama was referring to comments McCain campaign senior adviser Charlie Black made aboard McCain's campaign plane on May 19. Several days prior, the McCain campaign had issued a "conflict policy," which prohibits anyone paid to work for the campaign from being a registered lobbyist. Unpaid volunteers can be lobbyists, but they must list their clients and can't serve on policy committees that deal with issues in which those clients may have an interest. The policy came on the heels of the departure of several high-level campaign officials after embarrassing disclosures about their current or former lobbying activities. Black is himself a former lobbyist (the Washington Post described him as "longtime uber lobbyist"), but he retired from his lobbying firm in March to work full time for the campaign. According to accounts from NBC News and the New York Times, as reporters peppered Black with questions about the debate over former lobbyists working for the campaign, Black responded, "This is complete inside-the-Beltway nonsense." NBC News' Carrie Dann recounted the interview with Black as follows: "Asked today if questions about potential conflicts of interest might be affecting the choices of average American voters, Black responded bluntly: "Hell, no." He was careful to say that Sen. McCain is committed to maintaining the integrity of the campaign — hence his commitment to the re-vetting process. But, Black added, 'I do not believe that average voters out there care.'" Sure sounds like Black was saying he doesn't think the American people care about this issue. We rate Obama's statement True.

pomt-03269	Says some Austin school district classrooms lack electrical outlets.	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2013/aug/08/ramey-ko/prospective-house-candidate-says-austin-school-dis/	A prospective Texas House candidate said some Austin schools shockingly lack a necessity. Ramey Ko, a lawyer who joined candidates for an Austin-area House seat at the July 25, 2013, meeting of the Austin Young Democrats, is not running in the November 2013 special election to serve out the term of Democrat Mark Strama, who resigned. But Ko has said he intends to run in the 2014 Democratic primary. As noted by Austin American-Statesman columnist Ken Herman, Ko said at the meeting: "The very first issue I want to tackle when I'm in the Legislature is public education. Right now in the eastern part of the district in particular we see schools where over half the kids are in portables. We see situations where we may have bought new technology from the bonds that we passed in the past but then we discovered that there are no electrical outlets in the school classrooms because they are over 50 years old. I mean this is literally true. It's amazing when you finally look at the details of this." That does seem amazing. Does the Austin school district have classrooms lacking electrical outlets? Revisiting a board's discussion By telephone, Ko told us he heard about such classrooms at a March 2013 meeting of the board of the Greater Austin Asian Chamber of Commerce in which board members discussed Austin school bond propositions on the May 2013 ballot. Ko said board member Catherine Crago said that some district schools "average" 0.5 outlets per classroom and, Ko said, Crago added that this means some classrooms have no outlets. Ko said he is an advisory board member of the chamber. By phone and email, Crago told us that at the meeting, she mentioned research she helped compile in the early 1990s that inventoried some five million square feet of Central Texas schools, counting among features each school’s windows and outlets. Crago said she did not say that she was referring to classrooms in the Austin district. Precisely, Crago said, she told board members that the research showed some Central Texas schools with 10 outlets per classroom and others averaging 0.5 outlets per classroom. She said she then asked an Austin district representative at the meeting: "Is that still true?" Crago said the representative nodded yes, which could have been in reference to Central Texas schools rather than Austin schools alone. Crago said her broader judgment is that older classrooms lack sufficient infrastructure to handle several computers in addition to a teacher's equipment. Did the Austin district official at that meeting agree that some classrooms lack outlets? That’s not the recollection of Perla Delgado, the district representative at the chamber’s board meeting, Alex Sanchez, a district spokesman, told us by phone. Delgado "did not remember any specific question that she received or answered about electrical outlets," Sanchez said. "It’s not something she said that even came up." Separately, the executive director of the chamber, Marina Bhargava, said by phone that there was extensive discussion of the bond proposals at the meeting. She said she didn’t recall the electrical outlet moment, though such an exchange might well have happened. Austin district says classrooms have multiple outlets Recollections aside, do Austin classrooms lack outlets? Sanchez and other district officials said not. District spokesman Antonio Lujan said by email that there have been no classrooms lacking outlets for years. "Even the district's oldest schools and portables would have several outlets in a room designated as a classroom," Lujan said. "A classroom could not function without electrical outlets, and staff members would request to add them to accommodate the teaching environment." Lujan passed along a response from Jeff Kauffman, the district’s director of construction management, stating that every classroom has an outlet. "For new construction, every type of classroom, (from basic elementary school general-use classrooms to specialized computer classrooms in high school) has a minimum number of outlets (electrical and computer) required to fully operate the space as defined" in the district’s educational specifications, Kauffman said. Kauffman said the specifications for a basic elementary school classroom (the least-wired situation) calls for a minimum of six electrical outlets with separate dedicated outlets (three to five) for computers..." Kauffman said that more "technology-based" classrooms would have more outlets. "Older classrooms," Kauffman said, "have had outlets added, as needed, to accommodate the use of the space." Also, he said, new "classroom portables have a minimum of eight electrical outlets and six data connections per classroom. Older portables have had outlets added, as needed," Kauffman said. Sanchez later said that according to Paul Turner, the district’s executive director of facilities, the typical district classroom has about six outlets, each of them enabling two plugs. Also, according to Turner, each classroom on average would have six "drops," meaning electrical cables enabling multiple connections such as those needed for laptops. Sanchez said voters provided for the "drops" by approving a 1996 bond proposition. We shared the district’s replies with Ko, who said by email that the average number of outlets "doesn't really speak to whether certain schools currently have classrooms that either lack working or usable outlets for whatever reasons." He also said that he apologizes if what he thought he heard was incorrect. Our ruling Ko said some Austin classrooms lack electrical outlets. We see no basis for this statement, which shakes out as horse-and-buggy ridiculous. Pants on Fire!	None	Ramey Ko	None	None	None	2013-08-08T10:00:00	2013-07-25	['None']
pomt-09578	"For the first time in history, my administration posts our White House visitors online."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jan/27/barack-obama/white-house-visitor-logs-voluntarily-released-pote/	During his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama talked about the importance of restoring trust in government. To close the credibility gap, Obama said, "we must take action on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue to end the outsized influence of lobbyists; to do our work openly; and to give our people the government they deserve." "That's why, for the first time in history, my administration posts our White House visitors online," he said. We've been looking into the question of White House visitor logs. It's true that the Obama administration is releasing more information on White House visitors than any previous administration and posting those details to the Web. But the story is more complicated than that. And as we've noted before with this administration, you have to read the fine print because it includes some loopholes. When Obama first took office, the administration did not immediately release information on White House visitors, and it refused records requests from the news Web site msnbc.com and the advocacy organization Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. CREW filed suit for the records in July 2009, and by September, the White House announced its intention to release some of the logs in a settlement with CREW. Starting Sept. 15, 2009, the White House said it would release records of all visitors, but the records would be released 90 to 120 days after the visits occurred. But the administration outlined a series of exceptions for records that would not be released: • personal information such as dates of birth, Social Security numbers or phone numbers • information that would be of concern to law enforcement or a threat to national security interests • personal guests of the president and vice president and their families ("i.e., visits that do not involve any official or political business") • records related to a "small group of particularly sensitive meetings (e.g., visits of potential Supreme Court nominees). The White House will disclose each month the number of records withheld on this basis, and it will release such records once they are no longer sensitive." It's that last point that stuck out to us. They'll release all the records unless the record is "particularly sensitive." That seems like a standard that can encompass an awful lot. CREW first filed suit against the Bush administration in 2006 for the White House visitor logs. Because White House records are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act, the group argued that they belonged to the Secret Service and could be released under FOIA. A federal judge agreed with CREW in 2007, but left the records sealed pending appeal. The settlement with the Obama administration stopped that process. CREW says it still believes that the records are subject to FOIA but that it chose to settle because "the administration agreed to go much farther than we had asked in court: rather than just providing documents about specific visits upon request, the administration is posting the records of nearly all White House visitors," according to an e-mail to PolitiFact from CREW executive director Melanie Sloan. It's worth noting CREW's founder was Norm Eisen, who now is Obama's special counsel for ethics and government reform. He joined the administration in January 2009 and wrote the blog post announcing the new records policy. Judicial Watch, a conservative-leaning organization that has sued both Democratic and Republican administrations, isn't satisfied with the settlement and has filed suit to force the release of all the logs. "The problem with these exemptions is that they're just exemptions that (the White House is) making up," said Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch. "By their own admission, they're not releasing everything." Some open government organizations have nevertheless praised the administration's move. It's a "huge step toward a more transparent government," said Ellen Miller of the Sunlight Foundation, writing on the group's Web site. Mentioning the exemptions, she said, "We are going to trust them to make the right decisions. ... One misstep and the goodwill we are offering them right now goes out the window." So far, the White House has released one month of visitor logs. An Obama administration spokesman said that so far, it has not withheld any records for political sensitivity. A few records are still being processed for national security concerns, according to the White House Web site. Getting back to Obama's statement, he said, "For the first time in history, my administration posts our White House visitors online." He's right that the release was unprecedented -- there is no dispute that the Obama administration has released more information from the logs than any previous administration. But there is still a gap for roughly the first nine months that Obama was in office. And the administration has given itself a significant loophole with the exemption for sensitivity, especially given that there's already a substantial delay built into the release. So while he's opened the records and earned praise from open-government advocates, it's not quite as sweeping as he suggests. We find his claim Mostly True.

pomt-14507	"Drug overdoses are now the second-most common cause of death in New Hampshire."	false	/new-hampshire/statements/2016/feb/22/maggie-hassan/governor-maggie-hassan-says-drug-overdoses-are-sec/	During her recent State of the State address, Gov. Maggie Hassan dropped a startling statistic about New Hampshire’s opioid problem. "Drug overdoses are now the second-most common cause of death in New Hampshire," said the two-term Democrat. "Today, more Granite Staters are killed by overdoses than by diabetes, breast cancer or motor vehicle accidents." Much has been reported about the rapid rise of drug overdose deaths in New Hampshire. More than 400 people died from a drug overdose in 2015, up from 326 overdose deaths in 2014, and 192 in 2013. The issue has taken a role in the 2016 presidential contest. During a recent ABC News Republican debate, moderator David Muir cited Hassan’s claim. But are overdoses now the second leading cause of death in the state, beating out diabetes, breast cancer and motor vehicle accidents? PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to have a look at the numbers. Hassan’s camp cited a chart created by New Futures, a statewide advocacy organization that focuses on substance abuse. The bar chart, titled "In Perspective -- New Hampshire Deaths," stacks up drug deaths against other mortality statistics from 2014. Drug overdose deaths rank second in the chart, behind Alzheimer's disease, which led to 351 deaths in 2014. Those two causes of deaths are followed by diabetes (310), flu and pneumonia (226), kidney disease (175), breast cancer (170), motor vehicle deaths (138) and a host of other cancers. The slide, however, doesn’t include every cause of death, and leaves out several conditions that led to far more deaths than drug overdoses and alzheimer's disease in 2014. Heart disease caused 2,464 New Hampshire deaths in 2014, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. During the same year, Chronic Lower Respiratory Disease and stroke killed 680 and 474 Granite Staters respectively, the CDC reported. The point of the slide, however, is not to rank causes of death, but rather to contrast similar mortality causes and put drug deaths into perspective, according to New Futures spokesman Joe Gallagher. "The slide does not attempt to rank drug overdoses as the second leading common cause of death in New Hampshire, nor does the slide account for all causes of death in the state," he said in an email. So, where exactly do drug overdoses stand among causes of death? It depends on how one classifies mortality rates. While the New Futures slide breaks out different forms of cancer, for example, the CDC lumps all cancer data together and names the disease the leading cause of death in New Hampshire. All forms of the cancer killed nearly 2,700 people in the state 2014. Heart disease followed cancer as the second leading cause of death in New Hampshire, according to the CDC data. "Accidents" -- which includes things like car crashes and drug overdoses -- ranked third, and left 716 people dead in 2014. Even if one breaks out different forms of cancer and heart disease, the leading causes of death in those categories still outnumbered drug overdose deaths in 2014, according to the New Hampshire Division of Vital Records Administration. Lung cancer was the underlying cause of 730 New Hampshire deaths in 2014. Atherosclerotic heart disease led to 687 deaths in the state that same year, according to division statistician Nicholl Marshall. Hassan went on to cite specific conditions that drug overdoses have surpassed, including diabetes, breast cancer or motor vehicle accidents. New Futures pointed us to data from the American Cancer Society, which shows breast cancer killed an estimated 170 Granite Staters in 2014, far fewer than the 326 killed by drug overdoses. Diabetes killed 300 people in New Hampshire during 2014, according to the CDC, again fewer than the state’s drug deaths that year. And, finally, motor vehicle accidents accounted for 102 deaths in 2014, according to the New Hampshire office of the chief medical examiner. Our ruling New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan said, "Drug overdoses are now the second-most common cause of death in New Hampshire." Drug deaths are a growing cause of death in the state, and have certainly outpaced car accidents, diabetes and breast cancer, the three examples Hassan cited. But overdoses are not the second leading cause of death, still falling behind heart disease, stroke, and a host of other ailments. We rate her claim False.

pomt-12242	"Despite decades of marijuana being used for smoking in the United States, there have been no reported medical cases of lung cancer" attributed to marijuana.	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/jul/13/john-morgan/lawsuit-against-florida-john-morgan-says-no-report/	John Morgan, the lawyer who spearheaded Florida’s 2016 constitutional amendment to allow medical marijuana use, says that the Legislature has ignored the will of the voters by banning smoking it. In November, about 71 percent of Florida voters approved the medical marijuana amendment. To implement the new law, the Legislature passed a provision that defines medical use to exclude smoking marijuana. Morgan filed a lawsuit July 6 asking the Leon County Circuit Court to declare the Legislature’s provision unenforceable. He says that while the amendment allows the Legislature to ban smoking in public, it does not allow it to ban smoking in general. In the lawsuit, Morgan made some claims about the benefits of marijuana and then said this: "Despite decades of marijuana being used for smoking in the United States, there have been no reported medical cases of lung cancer or emphysema attributed to marijuana." There have been people who smoked marijuana who had lung cancer, but that in itself doesn’t tell us if marijuana caused the cancer. We found some evidence to support Morgan’s statement, but the research comes with significant caveats and experts say more research is needed to reach more definitive conclusions. (Morgan also mentioned emphysema, but we will focus here on cancer.) A report found no statistical association but called for more research Ben Pollara, who worked with Morgan on the amendment, sent us multiple articles related to research on cancer and marijuana. The most comprehensive information comes from a January 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. The report was written by a committee of experts who reviewed studies since 1999 regarding health effects of using cannabis and cannabis-derived products related to various diseases including lung cancer. In the section on lung cancer, the researchers looked at research and concluded: "There is moderate evidence of no statistical association between cannabis smoking and the incidence of lung cancer." However the committee also noted that the studies it reviewed -- and research in general about marijuana -- had limitations: • A 2015 study published in the journal Cancer pooled data on 2,159 lung cancer cases. This study found no statistically significant association between smoking cannabis and lung cancer incidence including for a subgroup of study participants who were not tobacco smokers. However, the study noted that "the possibility of potential adverse effect for heavy consumption cannot be excluded." The study relied on patients’ self-reporting about their use of cannabis. • In 2015, the American Association for Cancer Research published an epidemiologic review. One study evaluated lung cancer risk among 49,321 Swedish military conscripts over a 40-year period and found they had a statistically significant risk of developing lung cancer compared with those who didn’t use cannabis. However, the report noted several gaps related to the Swedish study, which the author has acknowledged. Overall, the National Academies report called for more research about marijuana and health effects while noting several barriers, including that it is classified as a Schedule 1 substance and that researchers often find it difficult to gain access to the quantity, quality, and type of cannabis product necessary to address specific research questions. American Cancer Society says it is difficult to assess impact Pollara also pointed to information on the American Cancer Society website that listed marijuana in a section on factors with uncertain or unproven effects on lung cancer risk. The ACS states that there are some reasons to think that smoking marijuana might increase lung cancer risk, including that marijuana smoke contains tar. However, it also explains that it’s difficult to research the impact of marijuana since the use has been illegal in many places for a long time, and many lung cancer patients have smoked marijuana and tobacco, making it difficult to attribute causes. "More research is needed to know the cancer risks from smoking marijuana," ACS states. Many experts we reached echoed the sentiment that additional research is needed. Harvard Medical School professor Bertha K. Madras reviewed multiple studies and her conclusion was similar to the National Academies report that there didn’t appear to be an association. However, Madras expressed caution about reaching conclusions. "Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence," she told PolitiFact. "Data are old. Currently we have more persons smoking high potency marijuana daily than years ago, when most studies were collecting data." A 2016 literature review written by University of Tampa health sciences professor Mary Martinasek showed that while some studies indicated an increased risk of lung cancer, others found no such link or a lower risk for lung cancer. "There is little evidence to support statistical associations either for or against cannabis and lung cancer," she said. "We need more research to confirm or deny an association." Dr. Suzanne Sisley, who is an expert witness for Morgan and is doing an FDA approved trial related to marijuana and PTSD, said that the federal government has sought for decades to prove smoking marijuana caused lung cancer and has been unable to do so. Our ruling Morgan said, "Despite decades of marijuana being used for smoking in the United States, there have been no reported medical cases of lung cancer" attributed to marijuana. The most comprehensive analysis about the health effects related to cannabis comes from a 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences. The report found "moderate evidence of no statistical association between cannabis smoking and the incidence of lung cancer." However, the report also noted various limitations of the research. Overall, the academies called for more research -- a sentiment shared by other experts we interviewed. Morgan’s statement is partially accurate, but more evidence is needed before definitely declaring smoking marijuana is risk-free when it comes to lung cancer. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-03690	"The sex-offender registry has been around for a long time, and the research that's out there says that it has no positive impact on the public safety."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/apr/22/ohio-public-defenders-office/ohio-public-defenders-office-says-sex-offender-reg/	Ohio will begin tracking arsonists this summer through a new registry similar to the one used to track sex offenders. A law passed last year by the General Assembly will require people convicted of arson-related offenses to register at their local sheriff's office each year for at least 10 years. Failing to register will be a felony. Supporters tout the measure as a tool for law enforcement. Critics argue, among other points, that the registry will be a burden for sheriffs already charged with keeping the sex-offender registry. "The sex-offender registry has been around for a long time, and the research that's out there says that it has no positive impact on the public safety," Amy Borror, spokeswoman for the Ohio Public Defender's Office, told The Plain Dealer. "And, if anything, it might have a negative impact on public safety because it creates this administrative burden." The registry has been around for almost 20 years and has been public for more than 15. The Jacob Wetterling Crimes Against Children Act, enacted by Congress in 1994, required convicted sex offenders to record their address with local law enforcement. Megan’s Law, added in 1996, allowed the information to be given directly to the public. The Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA), passed in 2006, set registration standards that widened the reach of registration for the entire nation. PolitiFact Ohio knew the subject could be an emotional one. We asked Borror how the claim is supported that the registry does not improve public safety. She referred us first to the website of the Public Defender's Office, which links to a number of reports, and to a special issue of the peer-reviewed journal Criminal Justice and Behavior, from May 2010, which was dedicated to sex offender issues. Criminal Justice and Behavior published 10 academic studies related to sex offenses, focusing on the question of whether public policies concerning sex offenders enhance the safety of children and communities. The journal found that the subject is consistently one of the leading policy issues on legislative agendas. It concluded, however, that "sex offender policies are often inconsistent with empirical evidence about sex offender risks, recidivism, reintegration and supervision.... "Legislators cite the news media and the views of their constituents -- not research evidence -- as their primary sources of information about sex offenses and offenders," the journal said. One of the published studies, by criminologists with the University of Massachusetts, Lynn University and the Colorado Division of Criminal Justice, focused on Ohio and Oklahoma, two of the first states to meet federal guidelines set by SORNA. Those guidelines classify offenders into one of three categories determined by solely by convicted offense. (Previously, judges determined what risk offenders posed and assigned them to one of three registration categories.) Drawing on data from more than 28,000 cases in Ohio and from other research, the study’s conclusions "shed doubt on the public safety utility of the SORNA classification system." It found that a disproportionate number of offenders were classified as high risk, placing greater burdens, perhaps unnecessarily, on law enforcement personnel and budgets. "From a public safety perspective," the study found, the SORNA classification guidelines hurt the ability of the system "to effectively discriminate between those who pose a substantial risk to society and those who pose minimal risk," and also contradict evidence about the risk of repeat offenses for both adult sex offenders and juveniles. Another report, from the Minnesota Department of Corrections, studied sexual offenders who were jailed for failing to register with local law enforcement agencies. It found that the failure to register was not a predictor of repeated crime, other than future failure to register. An analysis of adult arrest data from 1990 to 2005 in South Carolina found that sex offender registration laws did have a deterrent effect on first-time adult offenders, but no effect on juveniles and no effect on recidivism. Borror also pointed us to a 2009 study from the state of New York’s Office of Mental Health that specifically compares a risk-based classification system (which Ohio used to have) to the offense-based registration system, which Ohio has now. It concluded that the current system "falls short of increasing public safety," citing five earlier studies that found registration and notification laws were "ineffective methods of reducing sexual victimizations." It also noted there is evidence that such laws actually lead to more criminal behavior by aggravating the factors linked to it -- an unintended consequence of reducing or denying employment, educational, social and housing opportunities. "Although well intended, such laws have done little (if anything) to increase public safety and may in fact be lowering it," the study said. (A 2007 report by the non-government organization Human Rights Watch detailed the harassment of registered offenders because of online community notification.) We looked further and found a 2008 report funded by the U.S. Justice Department examining the original Megan's Law in New Jersey. "Despite widespread community support for these laws," it said, "there is virtually no evidence to support their effectiveness in reducing either new first-time sex offenses (through protective measures or general deterrence) or sex re-offenses (through protective measures and specific deterrence). "Given the lack of demonstrated effect of Megan’s Law on sexual offenses, the growing costs may not be justifiable," it said. Another study, by J.J. Prescott of the University of Michigan Law School and Jonah Rockoff of Columbia Business School and the National Bureau of Economic Research, examined data from 15 states over more than 10 years. They found that registering sex offenders does reduce sex crime, especially among victims with a personal connection to offenders, most likely because of better police monitoring. They also found, however, that making the registry information available to the public has the opposite effect and increases crime. "There is little evidence of a decrease in crimes against strangers," the study said. "We also find evidence that community notification deters crime, but in a way unanticipated by legislators. Our results suggest that community notification deters first-time sex offenders, but may increase recidivism by registered offenders by increasing the relative attractiveness of criminal behavior. This finding is consistent with work by criminologists showing that notification may contribute to recidivism by imposing social and financial costs on registered sex offenders and, as a result, making non-criminal activity relatively less attractive. "We regard this latter finding as potentially important, given that the purpose of community notification is the reduction of recidivism," the authors concluded. The federal Government Accountability Office evaluated the effects of SORNA in a report issued earlier this year. The GAO noted that law’s purpose is to protect the public from sex offenders, but found "analysis of the act’s effect on public safety has been limited." Positive effects included "improved monitoring of registered sex offenders" and better information sharing between law enforcement agencies. Negative consequences found by the GAO included a lack of consideration of the risk of repeating sexual offenses in classifying offenders; a disproportionate increase in the workload of law enforcement agencies, and increased problems for registered sex offenders to find work or housing. What conclusion can we draw about Borror’s statement for the Ohio Public Defender’s Office, that research shows the sex offender registry has no positive impact? We found that research has been done generally on the effectiveness of sex offender registration and notification laws. We found that studies indicate the laws have no clear effect on recidivism, or repeat offenses, which is their intended target, and are ineffective in assessing and managing risk. Although there is some indication that registration and community notification may deter first-time adult offenders, the studies find that the deterrence doesn’t extend to juveniles -- and that community notification likely increases repeat sex crimes and other crimes. With that information needed for clarification, we rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Ohio Public Defender's Office	None	None	None	2013-04-22T06:00:00	2013-04-12	['None']

pomt-02594	U.S. Rep. John Barrow, D-Ga., does not want to audit the Federal Reserve.	false	/georgia/statements/2014/jan/28/rick-allen/past-votes-contradict-candidates-claim/	A tweet has some feathers flyin’ between a Georgia congressman and a candidate who wants his job. At issue, U.S. Rep. John Barrow’s position on auditing the Federal Reserve. Rick Allen, a Republican running against the Augusta Democrat, posted a message on his Twitter page about Barrow. "You want to #AuditTheFED? @RepJohnBarrow doesn't," the tweet read. True? "This is probably as big a lie as you can get from Rick Allen," Barrow spokesman Richard Carbo said in one email. " ‘Audit the Fed’ is yet another example of John Barrow trying to be on both sides of the issue," said Dan McLagan, a spokesman for Allen. Barrow represents one of the few swing congressional districts in Georgia, and Republicans have been unsuccessful in beating him despite great efforts in recent election cycles. Barrow is the only white Democrat from the Deep South currently serving in the House. So who’s right here? PolitiFact Georgia decided to find out. First, a little background. The Federal Reserve helps set national monetary policy, and its decisions have great influence on Wall Street and the world economy. A movement to audit the Federal Reserve, commonly called the Fed, gained momentum in 2009 after the financial crisis a year earlier. Lawmakers wanted to examine the Fed’s emergency lending to financial institutions in the months leading up to and after the crisis. At its peak, the Fed's lending totaled $1.16 trillion, according to news accounts. One of the leaders of the Audit the Fed movement was U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, a now-retired House member from Texas who ran unsuccessfully for president in 2008 and 2012. Paul introduced a bill in February 2009 to conduct an audit. Called the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2009, House Resolution 1207 would politicize their work, Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke countered. "(W)hat is so outrageous is that the Federal Reserve can literally deal in trillions of dollars," Paul said on the House floor in May 2010. "They don't get the money authorized. They don't get the money appropriated. They just create it, and they get involved in bailing out their friends." Paul’s legislation had been inserted into a House version of a bill involving the regulating of Wall Street that he boasted at the time had more than 300 sponsors. One of those co-sponsors was Barrow, McLagan noted. McLagan pointed to a vote by Barrow on the bill on June 30, 2010, to support his candidate’s claim. Barrow voted against what is described in federal records as "a motion to recommit a conference report with instructions." "(Barrow) co-sponsored the bill, then voted against it. That is John Barrow in a nutshell -- everything is half true because he supports both sides of every issue," McLagan said. "He is tailor-made for PolitiFact." Congress defines a motion to recommit with instructions as one final chance to amend a bill before it is passed by the full House of Representatives. The motion included language to audit the Fed that was similar to what Paul had proposed a year earlier, according to a pro-Ron Paul website. Eight minutes later, the House passed, with Barrow’s support, a financial industry bill that had been agreed upon a day earlier by House and Senate lawmakers. Paul supporters said the 2,000-page bill had a "watered-down audit provision" limited to loans made by the Fed during the height of the economic crisis. Carbo, Barrow’s spokesman, explained the vote against the motion to recommit. "[T]he main purpose of an MTR is to send the bill back to the Committee of jurisdiction, effectively killing the bill. Mr. Barrow, was already in support of the bill (which included audit language), so it would have been counterproductive to send it back to Committee when negotiators had already come to an agreement," Carbo said via email. "The MTR, in addition to ‘killing’ the underlying bill, made some other changes that weren't clear at the moment of the vote." Two years later, Paul tried again. In July 2012, the House voted 327-98 in favor of a bill he titled the Federal Reserve Transparency Act of 2012. Barrow had signed on to the bill as a co-sponsor in July 2011, and he voted in favor of the legislation. The bill was forwarded to the Senate, but no vote was taken there, records show. In January 2013, another Georgia House member philosophically tied to Paul introduce another bill to audit the Fed. This was one filed by U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, a Republican from Athens. Barrow is one of 181 House members who co-sponsored the bill. The legislation, though, has not come up for a vote in the House. McLagan insisted his candidate’s Twitter post was correct, citing the 2010 vote. McLagan said Barrow was slow in co-sponsoring the subsequent legislation to audit the Federal Reserve. In short, McLagan said, Barrow is not truly committed to auditing the Fed. "He’s on both sides of every issue," McLagan said repeatedly of Barrow. To sum up, Allen’s Twitter page posted a claim that Barrow does not want to audit the Federal Reserve. Barrow, though, has co-sponsored and voted for legislation in favor of an audit. We rate Allen’s claim False.	None	Rick Allen	None	None	None	2014-01-28T00:00:00	2014-01-10	['United_States', 'Federal_Reserve_System']

pomt-06537	Says Gov. Chris Christie "cut spending (by) $1 billion" and provided "$850 million in new education funding."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/06/committee-our-childrens-future/television-ad-promotes-chris-christies-spending-cu/	If you believe what you see on television, Gov. Chris Christie is a ray of sunshine in a dark and dreary world. A television ad broadcast in recent weeks by a group of Christie supporters paints that image of the governor, while touting his achievements of cutting spending and increasing education funding. From a group called the Committee for Our Children’s Future, the ad begins with a hazy image of the Capitol building in Washington, D.C. as the narrator intones: "Runaway spending, record debt, gridlock government. Washington is backwards." Then suddenly, the video turns to an image of a sunrise with the narrator telling us who’s responsible: "But Chris Christie, with bipartisan support, is taking New Jersey (in) another direction." The ad goes on to claim Christie "cut spending (by) $1 billion" and provided "$850 million in new education funding." PolitiFact New Jersey found that the group’s numbers are technically correct, but the picture is less sunny when you examine the education funding changes over the course of Christie’s tenure. Let’s start with that $1 billion in spending cuts. The $1 billion in spending cuts mentioned in the ad refers to the line-item vetoes made by Christie in response to a $30.6 billion budget approved in June by the Democratic-controlled Legislature. With his line-item vetoes, Christie reduced the fiscal year 2012 budget to nearly $29.7 billion. So the group is right that he cut spending by about $1 billion from what the Legislature had approved. Despite that decrease, the fiscal year 2012 budget is still larger than the fiscal year 2011 budget that Christie signed in June 2010. The fiscal year 2012 budget is about $1.3 billion greater than the fiscal year 2011 budget approved last year. David Rosen, the budget and finance officer for the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, said that $1.3 billion -- most of which represents a pension payment and increased school aid -- was made possible by higher-than-anticipated revenue growth in fiscal year 2011 and projected revenue growth for fiscal year 2012. Now, let’s turn to the "$850 million in new education funding" mentioned in the ad. In a previous ruling, we noted how the fiscal year 2012 budget increases education funding by about $863 million over the prior fiscal year. That figure supports the group’s claim, but there’s two problems with that argument. First, about half of that increased aid -- more than $446 million -- was required as part of a court order to go to the so-called Abbott districts. So Christie didn’t have a choice about that money. Secondly, the fiscal year 2011 budget cut education aid by about $829 million. That means the new budget only represents a net increase of about $30 million. In a Sept. 8 interview on an online radio show hosted by the New Jersey School Boards Association, Christie backs up that analysis: "Yes, in my first year, we had to cut $820 million in funding from the public schools because we were in an enormous fiscal crisis. But the next year, this budget that I just signed...and advocated for, put an additional $850 million into the budget for public schools. So it paid back the entire cut from the year before of $820 million and added an additional $30 million on top of that." Brian Jones, a spokesman for Committee for Our Children’s Future, defended both statements in an email. "Christie did wind up cutting $1 billion in spending, as you note below, so I don’t see how the statement can be seen as being false," Jones said. "Again, Christie did wind up increasing education funding by $850 million this year. It’s a true statement." Our ruling A television ad from a pro-Christie group claims the governor "cut spending (by) $1 billion" and provided "$850 million in new education funding." Those numbers are accurate, but when it comes to the education funding, Committee for Our Children’s Future must think New Jerseyans only have short-term memory. Given the cuts made last year, education funding has gone up by a total of about $30 million since Christie’s first budget in office. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-09273	The more than $800,000 raised by the Alan Grayson campaign last quarter was "#1 among all 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives."	false	/florida/statements/2010/apr/29/alan-grayson/grayson-said-he-was-no-1-was-no-3/	Alan Grayson, a Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives representing central Florida, is a prolific fundraiser. He recently trumpeted his success in an e-mail to supporters on April 26, 2010. Grayson wrote: "Our Grayson for Congress campaign raised over $800,000 last quarter, from almost 25,000 contributors. That was #1 among all 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives." We're always curious when we hear someone claim to be No. 1 in anything, so we looked into it. The Grayson campaign was slow in getting back to us with data to back up the claim, so we examined at Grayson's report on the Federal Election Commission website for the most recent quarter that ended March 31, 2010. We found he raised $809,111.83 in net contributions. We went to the Center for Responsive Politics site OpenSecrets.org and looked at a chart of the top 10 fundraisers for this current election cycle for candidates for the House of Representatives. On that list, Grayson is No. 6. We ran those 10 names -- which include eight incumbents and two other candidates -- through the FEC database to examine reports for the most recent fundraising quarter. The result: Grayson was third behind two Republican members of the House -- Eric Cantor of Virginia at $831,851.79 and Michele Bachmann of Minnesota at $810,991.74. The Federal Election Commission sent us a list of the top 10 fundraisers among candidates in the House for the most recent quarter. For incumbents, Grayson came in third behind Cantor and Bachmann. We showed the figures we found for Cantor and Bachmann to Grayson's office and asked how the campaign concluded that he was No. 1. Julie Tagen, senior advisor to the campaign, then acknowledged to us an in an e-mail that he was "not number one last quarter.'' But she added that, "Although we were not number one last quarter, we are number one in the past two quarters combined," wrote Julie Tagen, senior advisor to the campaign. "We were among the top fundraisers, and no campaign claims to have more donors than us. That makes us number one in the context of what we were discussing." We don't believe there is sufficient public data for a campaign to prove her latest claim. Comparing the number of donors is a difficult task -- in part because donors who give less than $200 don't have to be reported. That would require calling all of the members of the House and asking for their donor lists -- something they would be hesitant to provide. We doubt the Grayson campaign had time to do that. But back to the claim we're checking: Grayson said in an e-mail to his supporters that he was "#1 among all 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives." We proved he was wrong because at least two others raised more, and his campaign has acknowledged the claim is not accurate. We find it False.

pomt-00424	"Black business ownership jumped 400% in one year."	false	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/27/blog-posting/black-business-ownership-didnt-increase-400-percen/	Conservative bloggers are championing a survey that they say indicates a 400 percent jump in the number of black-owned businesses in the United States in the past year — and they’re attributing that supposed increase to President Donald Trump. Trump has pointed to low African-American unemployment rates throughout his presidency, calling them "the lowest ever recorded in our country." While that’s true, we found African-American unemployment has been decreasing gradually since it peaked at 16.6 percent in 2010. This new claim of a skyrocketing number of black business owners originates from a 2017 client email survey conducted by two private companies and focused on small businesses. The aggregated findings, posted on the companies’ websites in January, do not reference Trump. However, bloggers then took the survey and linked the results to Trump. For example, the conservative website Think Americana published an article titled, "MAGA: Black business ownership jumps 400% in one year under Trump." "On Monday President Trump’s approval rating with African Americans hit 31%," the article said. "That’s not all. Black business ownership jumped 400% in one year." This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The 31 percent approval rating comes from a recent Rasmussen Reports poll, which was updated a few days later as 36 percent. Rasmussen Reports consistently cites higher approval ratings for Trump than most pollsters. Gallup’s numbers hover in the 10 to 15 percent approval range for African-Americans, and Reuters monthly polling for July had black approval at 12.8 percent. In November 2017, small business financing company Guidant Financial and online credit marketplace LendingClub Corporation sent out an email survey to their clientele nationwide; they received responses from about 2,600 "current and aspiring entrepreneurs." The companies both posted general articles about the results of that survey on their websites in January without making any distinctions about race or ethnicity except that 47 percent of "aspiring entrepreneurs" surveyed were minorities. The 400 percent increase in black-owned businesses claim, however, was not made until a subsequent graphic was published on Guidant’s website on Aug. 8. It was not clear from the released results how the companies came up with the 400 percent jump. The percentage of African-American respondents who owned businesses was not published, nor was that figure from last year. The survey sample was not random, the response was voluntary, and the margin of error was not made public. This graphic said it relied on the same survey data, and it highlighted the African-American business owners in the pool. The methodology the companies provided did not break down respondents by race, only saying that minorities accounted for 47 percent of aspiring entrepreneurs who responded. PolitiFact contacted Guidant about the claim in the graphic on Aug. 21. Two days later, a new version of the graphic was posted, this time without any mention of a 400 percent increase. "We have found that the 400% statistic is being misrepresented in its context and therefore we have decided to pull that statistic from our info graph," public relations consultant for Guidant Stacia Kirby said in an email. "Our mission is to help people get started and funded in owning their own business." When it comes to black-owned business numbers, we couldn’t find another source that supports this increase from 2017 to 2018. The Annual Business Survey data about Business Owner Characteristics for 2017 is not yet available, and most recent census data related to minority-owned businesses is from 2016. Robert Fairlie, an economics professor at the University of California-Santa Cruz, studies entrepreneurship and authored a book about its relationship with race in the United States. Fairlie said there was no indication that African-American businesses had seen significant growth in the past year. "That would be great if there was a 400 percent increase given that African-American rates are so low, but everything that I have seen from Census and BLS data does not show that kind of growth," Fairlie said. Because of the small sample size and lack of corroborating data, we rate this claim False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2018-08-27T10:09:58	2018-08-20	['None']
pomt-14652	"Blue Cross Blue Shield cancelled all their individual (health care) policies in the state of Texas, effective Dec. 31."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2016/jan/22/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-ridiculously-says-blue-cross-blue-shield-/	Republican presidential hopeful Ted Cruz revealed at a campaign stop that he lately lacks health coverage because, he proclaimed, an insurance provider governed by the Obamacare law announced it was ditching the Texas market. According to a video snippet of Cruz’s Jan. 21, 2016, Manchester, N.H., remarks, emailed to reporters by the Democratic National Committee, Cruz followed up general criticisms of the 2010 law requiring most Americans to have health coverage by saying: "I’ll tell you, you know who one of those millions of Americans is who has lost their health care because of Obamacare? That would be me. "I don’t have health care right now," Cruz said. "I had purchased an individual policy and Blue Cross Blue Shield cancelled all their individual policies in the state of Texas, effective Dec. 31. So our health care got cancelled. We got a notice in the mail, Blue Cross Blue Shield was leaving the market. And so we’re in the process of finding another" policy. The day we published this fact check, Cruz’s campaign separately said Cruz hadn’t realized when he spoke in New Hampshire that after Dec. 31, 2015, Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas shifted Cruz’s family from the policy it was losing to an HMO plan. Bloomberg News quoted Catherine Frazier, a Cruz campaign spokeswoman, saying: "On December 31, Blue Cross cancelled the PPO health insurance policy covering the Cruz family. That plan was purchased on the individual market, using a private insurance broker, with no government funds. At the time, the broker informed Sen. Cruz that the plan was being cancelled. The broker did not inform him that Blue Cross had automatically enrolled the family in another policy, an HMO with far more limited coverage. Based on this information, Sen. Cruz believed the family was uninsured and asked the broker to pull quotes immediately for a new policy. Frazier further said Cruz's family is currently covered by a Blue Cross HMO but planned to be covered by a Humana PPO effective March 1. A Politico news story on Cruz’s Manchester remarks said that in 2015, Cruz and his wife, Heidi, on temporary leave from her job with Goldman Sachs, had purchased an individual plan after previously receiving coverage through the Wall Street firm. For this article, we looked into Cruz’s claim that Blue Cross Blue Shield stopped selling health coverage in Texas at the end of 2015, leaving the market, as Cruz put it. Not so, we found, and the "notice" Cruz mentioned in New Hampshire may have been sent his way a couple months before the year ended, leaving time to consider options. July 2015 announcement We didn’t hear back from Cruz about the basis of his statement. Meantime, the insurer in summer 2015 did announce changes to its Texas offerings. According to a July 2015 Austin American-Statesman news story, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Texas said it would offer fewer health insurance plans when open enrollment began in the fall on the online marketplace mandated under the Obamacare law, which Cruz has vowed to repeal and replace. At the time, the insurer’s chief medical officer, Dan McCoy, said preferred provider organization, or PPO, plans would not be affordable in 2016, and the company wouldn’t continue to make them available. McCoy also said the company would continue to offer health maintenance organization, or HMO, plans. An HMO requires enrolled patients to pick a primary care physician through which the patient and family members obtain all but emergency services, sometimes by referral. Visits to health care professionals outside of the HMO network typically aren’t covered. PPO plans give more flexibility; you don’t need a primary physician and can go to any health care professional without a referral inside or outside its network, though it costs less to stay in the network. Costs cited Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas’ July 23, 2015, announcement said it had been "the only insurer to offer an individual PPO insurance plan across the state to individuals in 2014 and 2015. Since the Affordable Care Act began," it said, "the market has changed." The company further said it couldn’t simply offer the PPO option at higher rates, saying: "The law requires that we set our individual plan rates based on all of our individual members' claims history. This means that if the costs of one plan are high, it will raise the rates of all other plans, not just the high-cost plan. If we kept the Blue Choice PPO, this would have raised the rates so much for all our other plans that most people wouldn't be able to afford them. By dropping the PPO, we can still offer our other plans at reasonable rates." McCoy said then: "We felt it was important to make sure that we offer a sustainable product. Clearly, the individual marketplace is evolving." To our own inquiry, Edna Pérez-Vega, a spokeswoman for Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas, said by email the company’s "retail market PPO plan, offered directly to individual consumers on and off the Affordable Care Act (ACA) Exchange," had become "economically unsustainable, paying out more than $400 million in claims" more "than it earned in premiums." The 2015 Statesman story further said the announced change wouldn’t affect customers with employer group plans or grandfathered PPO individual plans, meaning plans that existed on March 23, 2010, when the Obamacare law came to be. However, the story said, customers who bought PPO plans in or outside of the marketplace--including 367,000 Texans--would have to find new options. The company’s announcement suggested its announcement was timed to give customers time to prepare before open enrollment began anew Nov. 1, 2015: "If you enrolled in the individual Blue Choice PPO plan last year, you won't be able to keep your PPO plan in 2016. We're sharing this information well in advance of the required notification date so that you have plenty of time to research the plan options that best suit your needs," the company said. Company: Health coverage available all over Texas We asked Pérez-Vega if Cruz was right that the company bowed out of the Texas health insurance market. Without mentioning Cruz or his statement, Pérez-Vega replied that the company offers health plans in every Texas county and it’s the only company offering coverage to individuals in 58 of the 254 counties. She also reaffirmed that the company told members in 2015 "we would no longer offer PPO's to individual policyholders," though, she said, the company said it "would work to transition them to other available insurance plans for individuals so they would not experience a gap in coverage. Those who have been transitioned also have the option of choosing different plans for 2016. " Asked generally when plan holders like Cruz would have been notified of changes, Pérez-Vega said: "Members were notified in the days leading up to Oct 1," 2015. Our ruling Cruz said: "Blue Cross Blue Shield cancelled all their individual (health care) policies in the state of Texas, effective Dec. 31." Actually, the company continues to sell coverage all over Texas, according to Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas. The company also says individual customers like Cruz were notified months before 2016 changes—including an end to individual PPO plans--kicked in. So, Cruz was both incorrect about Blue Cross’ offerings in Texas and evidently mischaracterized how his own coverage came to lapse. That adds up to Pants on Fire!

The Senior Citizens League, an Alexandria, Va.-based, nonprofit advocacy group for seniors on issues including Social Security, Medicare and veteran and military retiree benefits, seized on the Social Security debate in a September mailer to members. A reader sent PolitiFact the mailer and asked us to examine the claims made by the organization. TSCL’s latest mailer warned about international Social Security agreements, called totalization agreements, that coordinate the U.S. Social Security program with comparable programs of other countries. The totalization agreements prevent workers in one country from paying dual national retirement system taxes when working in another country, and the pacts also help fill gaps in benefit protection for workers who have divided their careers between the United States and another country. The U.S. has these types of agreements with about two dozen countries. A pending agreement with Mexico was signed in 2004 but has not yet been adopted[this is repeated later]. TSCL says it retained a law firm to study the U.S./Mexico agreement and, "They believe if the Agreement goes into effect, the millions of Mexican citizens who will become eligible for Social Security benefits may have a far stronger claim to benefits and protection against cuts than U.S. citizens!" as reported in the mailer. TSCL has 1.3 million members/supporters, according to its website. The organization has been criticized in the past for its "scare tactics" aimed at seniors and about issues involving Social Security and health care, and for seeking donations from its members in misleading solicitations. We asked Shannon Benton, TSCL’s executive director, about the Social Security letter and the research done on the totalization issue. Benton says the group has worked on the issue for years, including sending out various mailers about the Mexican agreement in the past. TSCL hired Virginia law firm William J. Olson, P.C. to do the work over the years. The firm handles constitutional law and has done work on behalf of other organizations including Gun Owners of America and the Conservative Legal Defense and Education Fund. It has filed eight Freedom of Information Act requests between the Social Security Administration and the State Department and filed a lawsuit to obtain a copy of the agreement in December 2006, attorney Bill Olson told us in an email. One of TSCL’s main concerns with the Mexican agreement has been whether millions of immigrants who have worked in this country illegally would become eligible for U.S. Social Security benefits, along with their dependents, and hurt the program’s trust funds, Olson wrote. Previous PolitiFact checks found that there were no plans in Congress to allow illegal immigrants to collect Social Security benefits, even though many pay in the system. They could receive benefits only when and if they became legal. But would Mexican citizens working in the country legally have greater protection from future cuts than U.S. citizens? To break down the issue, we started at the beginning. The totalization agreement with Mexico has not yet been adopted by both countries, and there are no ongoing negotiations, according to a spokeswoman for the Social Security Administration. We asked the administration for the number of workers who would be covered by the agreement with Mexico, but received no response. Barbara Neuby, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University who has been researching world pension changes, estimated the possible number of Mexicans covered under this agreement at around 1 million. Those are "people who have paid into this [Social Security] system, those who are here [in the United States] legally," Neuby said. Social Security benefits are not a contractual right and can be changed by Congress, a 1960 U.S. Supreme Court ruling, Fleming v. Nestor, established. But the TSCL claim that the totalization agreement would give Mexican citizens stronger claims to benefits and protections against cuts doesn’t hold up, according to experts on the issue. The agreement is based on U.S. law, and that covers every beneficiary, Neuby said. For citizens of Mexico to be treated differently than U.S. citizens, Congress would have to create an exclusion for them, she said, a move that would be "political suicide." "If Congress cut the U.S. benefits and not the Mexican citizens’ benefits, the people in Congress would be chased and would probably be shot," Neuby said, adding that such a move would be "political suicide" for Congress members. Added Gary Burtless, a senior fellow of economic studies at the Brookings Institution: It’s hard to see how the description of totalization agreements "can be squared with the idea that foreign citizens who receive Social Security would be exempt from a legislated cut in Social Security benefits that applies to U.S. citizens." While it is true that Congress can cut Social Security benefits, the claim that the pending totalization agreement would better protect Mexican citizens from benefits cuts is not accurate. The pending agreement has not been approved by the United States or Mexico, but to exclude some citizens from any cuts would require an exemption by Congress that is highly unlikely. We rate the claim False.	None	Senior Citizens League	None	None	None	2012-10-15T06:00:00	2012-09-03	['United_States', 'Mexico']
mpws-00022	The battle for control of the U.S. House is playing out in Minnesota’s 7th Congressional District, where groups backing Republicans and Democrats have dueling ads up this week. After the National Republican Congressional Committee dropped six figures on an ad targeting incumbent DFL Rep. Collin Peterson earlier this month, its foe the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee fired back with an ad blasting Peterson’s Republican opponent, state Sen. Torrey Westrom of Elbow Lake. “Westrom led the charge to shutdown Minnesota’s government. Why? Because he wouldn’t let go of tax breaks for millionaires. Westrom’s shutdown cost Minnesota almost $60 million. Almost 20,000 Minnesotans were out of the work. And the whole time, Torrey Westrom kept his taxpayer funded paycheck.” 	misleading	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2014/09/poligraph-dccc-ad-exaggerates-shutdown-facts/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: DCCC ad exaggerates shutdown facts	September 19, 2014, 2:00 PM	None	['Republican_Party_(United_States)', 'Minnesota', 'Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Collin_Peterson', 'Minnesota_Democratic–Farmer–Labor_Party', 'Congressional_district', 'United_States_House_of_Representatives', 'Republican_National_Committee']
pomt-13923	"Attempts to find things like, ‘crime,’ ‘criminal activity,’ ‘indictment,’ have been filtered out by Google" in favor of Hillary Clinton.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2016/jun/23/andrew-napolitano/did-google-adjust-its-autocomplete-algorithm-hide-/	Is America’s most popular search engine trying to make us forget about Hillary Clinton’s email woes? The hosts of Fox & Friends explored this angle in a June 16, 2016, segment that started with a video clip contrasting autocomplete predictions for searching "Hillary Clinton cri" on Google, Yahoo and Bing. After watching the video, which was from a website called SourceFed, Fox News’ chief judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano accused Google of hiding Clinton’s problems. "The clip that we just ran is the result of a very extensive test, an examination, about whether or not attempts to find things like, ‘crime,’ ‘criminal activity,’ ‘indictment,’ have been filtered out by Google, and we know that it has," Napolitano said. We wanted to find out for ourselves if Google manipulates search suggestions in favor of Clinton. Napolitano did not return emails seeking comment. The SourceFed video, posted on YouTube June 9, shows how certain terms, when searched with Clinton’s name, don’t autocomplete as suggestions underneath the search bar. For example, when users search "Hillary Clinton cri," the suggested searches are "Hillary Clinton crime reform," "Hillary Clinton crisis," "Hillary Clinton criticizes obama 2008" and so on. No suggestions for "Hillary Clinton crime" itself. However, Bing and Yahoo bring up "crimes" and related returns when you search "Hillary Clinton cri." What’s going on? Searching for the truth SourceFed clarified its original video with another one June 10, which included comment from Google denying the accusation. CNN Money also put its two-cents in the mix, saying Google’s algorithm was set up to filter-out offensive information. In a statement, a Google spokesperson says the filter "operates according to the same rules, no matter who the person is." "The autocomplete algorithm is designed to avoid completing a search for a person’s name with terms that are offensive or disparaging," the statement says. "We made this change a while ago following feedback that Autocomplete too often predicted offensive, hurtful or inappropriate queries about people." The statement linked to a Vox article that refutes the idea Google is manipulating autocomplete in favor of Hillary Clinton. The article says that most people who are accused of crimes but were not convicted will not show up in suggestions. We wanted to test Vox’s theory, so we searched "Casey Anthony cri" and "George Zimmerman cri." Both were suspects in criminal murder investigations and were acquitted. The autocomplete yielded no suggestions. We wanted to try other presidential candidates and common allegations against them. When we searched "Donald Trump fraud," no suggestions came up. When we searched "Bernie Sanders communist," two suggestions appeared, but only when we spelled out "communist." "Bernie Sanders arrest" didn’t yield any results either. A search of ‘Donald Trump rac’ does yield arguably offensive suggestions. Experts told PolitiFact that Google’s autocomplete algorithm is not out-of-the ordinary for popular search engines. "Google is the market leader among search engines by far, so its actions have a much larger impact than those of other search engines," said Susan Worst, a lecturer in computer science at Boston University said. "That it would be leading the way in modifying its autocomplete algorithm is not unusual at all." Worst cited an instance last year when Google made corrections to its algorithms after its photo recognition project delivered racist results to users. For many years, autocomplete algorithms were based on what others have typed in the past, but the possibility of Google changing its algorithm to detect offensive term suggestions isn’t that surprising, said Marti Hearst, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. She said major search engines update algorithms frequently to assimilate to the "changing online environment." "Algorithms have to be clever to show the best few choices, according to very complex measures of ‘best,' " Hearst said. "No doubt there are filters for curse words, and as time has gone by and the tenor of our times are getting more divisive, I would not be surprised if an algorithm has been developed to detect terms that feel offensive to a large segment of the population." Our ruling Napolitano accused America's most popular search engine, Google, of scrubbing search suggestions in favor of Clinton. Although it is clear Google’s algorithm is different from Bing or Yahoo, it still isn’t correct to describe the difference as evidence of Google’s support of Clinton. Google’s suggested searches, for the most part, avoid offensive suggestions for everyone, not just Clinton. Napolitano’s claim has a thread of truth, but it leaves out key details that would give the reader a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4b442b95-e20a-4768-babf-61ed5ba7062f	None	Andrew Napolitano	None	None	None	2016-06-23T16:00:00	2016-06-16	['Google', 'Hillary_Rodham_Clinton']
pomt-10323	Barack Obama "is more to the left of the announced Socialist in the United States Senate."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/29/john-mccain/if-you-look-at-one-narrow-source/	It's an old standby of GOP presidential politics to paint Democratic opponents as liberals who are out of step with the American mainstream. Sen. John McCain took up that line of attack against Sen. Barack Obama this month in an interview with the Kansas City Star. Obama is "more to the left of the announced Socialist in the United States Senate, Bernie Sanders of Vermont," McCain said when asked if he really thought Obama was "an extremist." In truth, this is a recycled charge, one that PolitiFact examined before. But since the charge lives, we'll take it on again. McCain's source is a vote rankings study put out each year by National Journal, a respected, nonpartisan, inside-the-beltway weekly magazine. In January 2008, after analyzing 99 of the 442 votes taken by the Senate in 2007, National Journal reported that Obama was the most liberal of the bunch. Sanders finished fourth. The two differed on just three of the 99 votes the magazine studied. According to National Journal, the three votes occurred in January, March and June of 2007. In January, Sanders joined a conservative majority in voting against establishing a Senate Office of Public Integrity to handle ethics complaints against senators. Obama voted for it. Likewise, Sanders was with a conservative majority in June when he voted against moving forward with a comprehensive immigration reform bill. Again, Obama voted for it. But in March, it was Obama siding with a conservative majority in voting for a resolution stating that funds for U.S. troops in the field should not be cut off. Sanders voted with liberals against the resolution. So, as far as that one study goes, Obama was more liberal than Sanders in 2007 by a net difference of one vote. But the magazine's tally is inherently subjective, since it relies on the judgment of its editors and reporters to determine which votes show an ideological distinction. And the sample size of votes comparing Obama to Sanders is quite small. Sanders only joined the Senate in 2007, Obama in 2005. And Obama wasn't the most liberal senator in either of his first two years, finishing 16th-most liberal in 2005, according to National Journal, and 10th-most liberal in 2006. And as PolitiFact found earlier this year, other tallies disagree with National Journal's findings. Voteview.com, which conducts a similar study based on the judgments of political scientists, found that eight current senators, including Vermont's Sanders, were more liberal than Obama. The Voteview.com study looked at the breadth of the senators' careers, not just the most recent year. Likewise, Americans for Democratic Action, a self-described liberal group, found that Obama needs to get a lot more liberal to match up with Sanders. In tallying votes it believed showed a liberal position, the group reported in February that Obama scored only a 75 percent liberal quotient in 2007, while Sanders clocked in at 95 percent. Obama might have scored as well as Sanders if he hadn't missed five of the 20 votes the ADA scored. Missed votes are counted against senators in the study. Sanders, by contrast, voted with the ADA on 19 of the 20 votes the group tallied. Another method of evaluating senators' politics is used by Congressional Quarterly, which gauges how often they vote with members of their own party on bills that divide most Republicans from most Democrats. In that tally, both Obama and Sanders sided with the Democrats on 97 percent of partisan votes in 2007. Even Charles Green, National Journal's editor, says he'd be wary of putting too much stock in any one rating methodology. "There's pluses and minuses to each rating system. If you look at a number of them, I think you have a pretty good picture," he told PolitiFact in June. So while McCain can make a case that Obama was more liberal than Sanders in 2007, that conclusion is more a matter of opinion than fact. As a result, we find his statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04756	There has been "$5 trillion in debt added over the last four years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/28/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-there-has-been-5-trillion-debt/	During his keynote speech at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie picked up on one of the convention’s biggest themes -- that the United States is on a fiscally unstable path, with the accumulation of too much debt. "With $5 trillion in debt added over the last four years, we have no other option but to make the hard choices, cut federal spending and fundamentally reduce the size of this government," Christie said. We thought we’d check to see whether Christie’s math is correct. We will start by noting that there are two main types of federal debt, and Christie didn’t specify which one he was referencing. One, known as gross federal debt, includes all debt obligations of the federal government. The other -- public debt -- is a subset of gross federal debt that excludes debt owed by one part of the government to another part of the government, such as money lent by the Social Security trust fund for use elsewhere. In the past, experts have told us that both measures have legitimate purposes, so we will look at both of these numbers without favoring one over the other. We used a Treasury Department online calculator that tracks both measures of debt on a daily basis. Even though Christie said "four years," we assumed that -- as a good Republican -- he meant to start the clock on the day Barack Obama was inaugurated, and that he did not intend to count the final four and a half months of George W. Bush’s administration. Given this framework, how do the numbers stack up? On Jan. 20, 2009, when Obama took office, the public debt stood at $6.3 trillion. By Aug. 27, 2012, the public debt had risen to $11.2 trillion. The increase: $4.9 trillion. That’s close enough for us to $5 trillion. As for gross federal debt, it rose between those two dates from $10.6 trillion to $16 trillion, an increase of $5.4 trillion. By this measure, Christie’s lowballing it. We should note that in its ratings, PolitiFact considers not just the factual accuracy of a statement, but also whether credit and blame is fairly assigned. In this case, Christie has a point that the Democrats bear some responsibility for this debt increase, since Obama was president for the entire period and the Democrats had majorities in both chambers of Congress for two years. But the Republicans have controlled the House since January 2011, and much of the debt stems from entitlement spending policies that were set under various past presidents and Congresses of both parties. So the overall blame is fairly bipartisan. Our ruling Christie’s claim -- that there has been "$5 trillion in debt added over the last four years" -- is just about on target. His number is either slightly high or a little low, depending on the type of measurement used, and that’s actually for a period short of a full four years. His implication that Obama and the Democrats are to blame has some merit, but it ignores the role Republicans have had. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1946db8e-eefc-46db-95e4-0c5031d907e1	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2012-08-28T22:47:53	2012-08-28	['None']

pomt-14044	"In 2006, Donald Trump was hoping for a real estate crash."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/may/26/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-faults-donald-trump-hoping-real-es/	The commercial seems like an example of the old adage, "Be careful what you wish for." Democrat Hillary Clinton posted the ad, which we caught on Instagram, on May 24 slamming Republican Donald Trump for saying he would welcome a burst in the housing bubble affecting real estate prices a decade ago. "In 2006, Donald Trump was hoping for a real estate crash," it says, showing a picture of Trump giving two thumbs up. The ad goes on to list consequences from the Great Recession, which peaked in 2008. It lists 9 million jobs lost and 5 million families who lost their homes. "And the man who could be our next president was rooting for it to happen," the ad contends. That's followed by audio, identified as being from 2006, of Trump saying, "I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy ... If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you could make a lot of money." "If Donald wins," the ad concludes, "you lose." The Instagram description accompanying the video says, "Millions of Americans lost jobs and homes in the '08 crash. A man who hoped for it has no business being president." We wondered if there was more to the story. The Trump campaign didn't respond to our emails. When we emailed the Clinton campaign, they sent us two links. A May 19 CNN story offers details of Trump's comment, along with context. A May 23 story from NBC News shows that Trump's remark wasn't a one-time affair. His statement reported in the Clinton ad comes from the audiobook How to Build a Fortune, created as part of Trump University, which has been the subject of three lawsuits from former "students" who allege they were ripped off by the billionaire. In 2006, real estate values had peaked and there was concern that they were overpriced, creating a "bubble" that could burst, producing a rapid fall in values. The man interviewing Trump for the audiobook says, "There's a lot of talk, which you've no doubt heard too, about a so-called real estate bubble. What's your take on that pessimism?" "Well first of all, I sort of hope that happens because then people like me would go in and buy. You know, if you're in a good cash position — which I'm in a good cash position today — then people like me would go in and buy like crazy," he says in a portion of the audiobook posted by CNN. "If there is a bubble burst, as they call it, you know, you can make a lot of money." Whether the "bubble burst" that Trump was hoping for deserves to be called a "crash," especially a crash on the scale of what occurred during the Great Recession, is open to debate. But it's important to stress that Trump was doing nothing than articulating an investment principle — look for a bargain. Good investors, he was arguing, should buy low and sell high. More importantly, in the audio book, Trump immediately adds: "At the same time, I don't think that (real estate bubble burst) will happen because if interest rates stay fairly low, if the dollar stays pretty much where it is or even goes a little bit higher, but basically if you have a weak dollar, this is tremendous amounts of money pouring in, so I don't think that's going to happen. I'm not a believer that the interest market, that the real estate market, is going to take a big hit." Obviously, he would turn out to be wrong. A year later, in 2007, Trump was telling the Toronto Globe and Mail that he was ready to invest in real estate because the market was starting to head down. "People have been talking about the end of the cycle for 12 years, and I'm excited if it is," he told the paper. "I've always made more money in bad markets than in good markets." But, once again, it's clear that Trump didn't see what was coming. The story begins: "Donald Trump almost lost his shirt 15 years ago when the North American real estate bubble burst. The 2007 version of that disaster will be much more benign, the real estate magnate predicts. . . 'We're talking very minor (problems) compared with the depression of the early 1990s,' Mr. Trump said." The story said he was advising investors that there are now great deals in buying subprime mortgages at a discount and repossessed houses at low prices. In short, even as the events that sparked the Great Recession were unfolding, Trump was not predicting the size and the scope of the economic disaster. Our ruling Clinton said, "In 2006, Donald Trump was hoping for a real estate crash." He said on more than one occasion that he welcomed a downturn in the real estate market because it would give him a chance to buy properties at a bargain and sell them at a higher price later. That's the essence of profitable investing. What's far less clear is whether Trump was rooting for something on the scale of the Great Recession, a suggestion made in the Clinton ad. In fact, his comments in his audiobook and to the Globe and Mail show that he didn't envision the financial meltdown that followed. Because Clinton's statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/476b3221-a0ce-40cc-ba96-56605fcd50b1	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-05-26T14:57:48	2016-05-24	['None']
pomt-06855	"The average Republican voter thinks there should be some revenue as part of this deal."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/aug/03/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-said-average-republican-favors-includ/	As the debate over the nation's budget intensified over the weekend, liberal commentator Paul Krugman lamented that increases in tax revenue were being left out of the overall deal. "On the politics of this, if you look at the polling, it turns out that the average Republican voter thinks there should be some revenue as part of this deal, right? So the president has agreed to -- not just to an agreement that's way to the right of the average American voter. It's actually to the right of what the average Republican voter wants." Krugman is saying that even Republican voters support some limited form of tax increases. We looked at a similar statement a few weeks ago from President Barack Obama. Obama said back on July 15, 2011, that "the clear majority of Republican voters think that any deficit reduction package should have a balanced approach and should include some revenues." We rated it Barely True (since re-named Mostly False). At the time Obama made his statement, we found one recent poll that supported his claim but two other polls that showed a much more evenly divided picture. We wondered if polling data showed growing support from Republicans for increasing tax revenues, in the form of tax increases or closing loopholes and removing exemptions. Interestingly, the polls we've looked at have shown markedly different results, sometimes showing Republican support for limited tax increases but sometimes showing opposition or an even divide. As pollsters have long noted, sometimes the way the question is phrased can affect the results. We should note that we didn't consider polls that only asked people if they favored spending cuts or tax increases, since the relevant question is whether people support both spending cuts and tax increases. Here are the three polls we looked at when we fact-checked the issue a few weeks ago. • A Gallup poll poll conducted July 7-10, 2011, asked: "As you may know, Congress can reduce the federal budget deficit by cutting spending, raising taxes, or a combination of the two. Ideally, how would you prefer to see Congress attempt to reduce the federal budget deficit: only with spending cuts, mostly with spending cuts, equally with spending cuts and tax increases, mostly with tax increases, or only with tax increases?" The answer "only spending cuts" got 26 percent from self-identified Republicans. The other answers from Republicans were "mostly spending cuts," 41 percent; "equal spending cuts and tax increases," 24 percent. Another 3 percent favored "mostly" or "only" tax increases. So about 68 percent of Republicans were open to some tax increases. • A Quinnipiac University poll conducted July 5-11, 2011, asked, "Do you think any agreement to raise the national debt ceiling should include only spending cuts, or should it also include an increase in taxes for the wealthy and corporations?" In this case, 48 percent of Republicans favored spending cuts only, while 43 percent favored including tax increases. Another 9 percent were unsure. • A Reuters/Ipsos poll from June asked, "As you probably know, the US budget deficit is currently about $1.4 trillion. There are a number of different solutions being discussed for reducing this deficit. These are cutting existing programs, raising taxes, or some combination of the two. Which approach do you think is best?" In that poll, 43 percent of Republicans said cut existing programs, while 44 percent favored including tax increases. That result was within the margin of error. In addition to those three polls, we found three more recent polls. • A CNN/ORC poll conducted July 18 to 20 asked about the recent discussions on the debt ceiling. It asked, "If you had to choose, would you rather see Congress and President Obama agree to a budget plan that only includes cuts in government spending, or a budget plan that includes a combination of spending cuts and tax increases on higher-income Americans and some businesses?" That poll found that, among Republicans, 61 percent favored spending cuts only, while 37 percent said spending cuts and tax increases. So this would not support Krugman's statement. • A Pew Research Poll conducted July 20 to 24 asked, "In your view, what is the best way to reduce the federal budget deficit? Should we mostly focus on cutting major programs, increasing taxes, or should we do a combination of both?" Among Republicans, 46 percent favored a combination of both, while 39 percent favored cutting programs. These results would support Krugman's statement. • Reuters/Ipsos polled again on the debt ceilling on July 25, 2011. It asked its same question from June, whether people favored cutting programs, raising taxes or some combination of the two. This time, it found that 41 percent of Republicans favored only cutting programs, while 52 percent favored some form of tax increase. This too would support Krugman's statement. To summarize these three newer polls, we still find mixed evidence. One poll showed Republicans favor spending cuts only; the other two showed Republicans favor including tax revenue increases. We e-mailed Krugman about our fact-check, and he referred us to an analysis from the New York Times blog Five Thirty Eight, which specializes in political statistical analysis. Five Thirty Eight analyzed the Gallup poll from early July in some depth, extrapolating what level of tax increases Republicans might support. But it didn't consider the other polls that we've described here. In conclusion, when we rated a similar statement from Obama a few weeks ago, the evidence seemed more mixed on whether Republicans favor some form of tax increases as part of a budget deal, the way that Democrats and independents do. Now, the polling seems to be moving a bit in Krugman's direction. Nevertheless, the polling results are still conflicted. While we can point to several polls that support Krugman's statement, we can also point to some that refute it. Of the six polls we looked at, three polls showed Republicans favored a package that included some tax revenues, two polls showed opposition, and one poll was a statistical tie. We're not convinced polls show that the average Republican favors some form of tax increases to reduce the deficit. Overall, we rate Krugman's statement Half True.

pomt-11488	"You take Pulse nightclub. If you had one person in that room that could carry a gun and knew how to use it, it wouldn’t have happened, or certainly to the extent that it did."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/01/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-about-pulse-nightclub-shooting/	During a televised meeting with lawmakers, President Donald Trump emphasized the importance of firearms as protection against mass shootings in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting that killed 17. He compared an unarmed group to "sitting ducks," and referred to the June 2016 shooting at an Orlando nightclub. "You take Pulse nightclub," he said Feb. 28. "If you had one person in that room that could carry a gun and knew how to use it, it wouldn’t have happened, or certainly to the extent that it did." That didn’t sound right to us, so we did some digging. Turns out, Trump is wrong on how that attack unfolded. An armed police officer working at Pulse exchanged fire with gunman On June 12, 2016, 29-year-old Omar Mateen killed 49 people and wounded dozens more in a shooting rampage at Pulse, a gay nightclub in Orlando. Trump ignored the crucial fact that an armed, off-duty police officer in uniform was working security at the club that evening. Soon after the first shots rang out, officer Adam Gruler, a 15-year veteran of the Orlando Police Department, exchanged gunfire with Mateen. This isn’t the first time Trump has made this erroneous claim. Our friends at Factcheck.org flagged a similar statement after candidate Trump at a June 15, 2016 campaign rally — days after the Orlando shooting — bemoaned that there were "no guns on the other side." Several days later Trump took to Twitter to clarify his statement after backlash from gun safety advocates and even the National Rifle Association, who said alcohol and guns don't mix. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com "When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees," Trump tweeted June 20, 2016. Trump’s latest statement on the Pulse shooting gives the impression clubgoers were defenseless, which was not the case. (The White House did not respond to our request for comment.) The Justice Department in 2017 released a nearly 200-page report detailing the Orlando police response to the shooting. Here’s the report’s account of Gruler’s initial confrontation with Mateen: "Outside, in the Pulse parking lot, (Gruler), who was working extra duty at the club — to provide outside security and to provide assistance to security personnel inside the club if needed — heard the shots that were being fired; at 2:02:17 a.m., he broadcast over the radio, 'Shots fired, shots fired, shots fired,' and requested additional officers to respond. "The detective told the assessment team that he immediately recognized that his Sig Sauer P226 9mm handgun was no match for the .223 caliber rifle being fired inside the club and moved to a position that afforded him more cover in the parking lot. Two patrons attempted to flee through an emergency exit on the south side of the club. When the detective saw the suspect shoot them, he fired at the suspect." According to an Orlando Police Department report, additional officers arrived on the scene about a minute after Gruler’s call for backup was broadcast. A second backup officer arrived about a minute after that. At 2:05 a.m., Gruler advised that the suspect had an assault rifle (the gunman also carried a Glock 17 9mm handgun). Gruler again shot at Mateen, this time "firing three shots at the suspect as the sound of rapid fire gunshots were heard inside the club." Mateen was ultimately shot and killed in a shootout after law enforcement, including SWAT team members, breached the building's wall. Some 300 local law enforcement officers responded to the scene during the three-hour standoff, according to the Orlando police report. Gruler would later attend Trump’s State of the Union address on Jan. 30 as a guest of Rep. Val Demings, D-Fla. Our ruling Talking about the Pulse nightclub shooting, Trump said, "If you had one person in that room that could carry a gun and knew how to use it, it wouldn’t have happened, or certainly to the extent that it did." An armed, off-duty police officer in uniform was at the club during the shooting, and exchanged gunfire with the shooter, who managed to kill 49 people. We rate this False. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com What do you think? PolitiFact Republican guest columnist former U.S. Rep. David Jolly says how politicians use and interpret true facts to influence their policy decisions is rightly a matter of their own personal judgment, for which they are ultimately held accountable by voters. But whether those politicians are actually offering facts or mere falsehoods in justifying their proposals is increasingly a matter for which fact-checking organizations are necessary to provide accountability in our political debates.

pomt-02359	The Republican-controlled Wisconsin Senate approved a bill "denying veterans the right to recover their medical costs for cancers they developed while serving their country."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/mar/20/chris-larson/wisconsin-democratic-leader-chris-larson-says-gop-/	On March 12, 2014, the Republican-controlled Wisconsin state Senate approved several pieces of legislation that dismayed Democrats. The same day, Senate Minority Leader Chris Larson of Milwaukee pounced on three of the bills, citing them in a fund-raising email he sent on behalf of a committee that works to elect Democrats to the Senate. One of the bills, Larson wrote, is "denying veterans the right to recover their medical costs for cancers they developed while serving their country." Fund-raising letters often make startling claims, like "denying" rights. Let’s see how this one does on the Truth-O-Meter. The bill The bill Larson cites is due for a vote in the state Assembly on March 20, 2014. Gov. Scott Walker has not said whether he would sign it. The bill would change requirements for anyone who files a lawsuit claiming they contracted an illness, often cancer, as a result of exposure to asbestos. So, despite Larson’s claim, the bill does not target veterans. That being said, veterans, particularly those who served in the Navy, make up a large percentage of people with mesothelioma, one type of cancer caused by asbestos exposure. Some studies show that as many as 30 percent of all Americans with mesothelioma cancer are veterans who were exposed while on active duty, according to Mesothelioma.com. There are two ways that a person with asbestos-related cancer can seek to recover money for their medical costs and other damages: 1. File a lawsuit against a company that manufactured or used asbestos. 2. File a claim with one or more trusts that were set up by now-bankrupt companies to pay victims of asbestos-related illnesses. Under the bill, cancer victims suing an existing company would have to disclose whether they have also filed a claim with any of the asbestos trusts. And if they haven’t already done so, the judge handling the lawsuit could order them to file a claim with one or more of the trusts. Under that scenario, if the lawsuit is resolved in a settlement or at trial and it is determined that the cancer victim be paid damages, the parties or the jury could determine how much should be paid by the existing business being sued and how much, if any, should be paid by trusts. Opponents of the bill worry that a veteran could end up collecting less money, because the funds in some trusts have been depleted, while supporters see the possible apportionment of blame as a matter of fairness. Before we close, a little more from each side: -- Opponents of the bill include the American Legion, Wisconsin Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Military Order of the Purple Heart. They say the the bill could delay a trial for six months or more -- and given that Mesothelioma victims typically die within about a year or less of being diagnosed, a veteran could become incapacitated or die before the trial, hurting the chances of the veteran or the veteran’s family to collect damages. Moreover, if a jury decides an existing business is responsible for damages, the veteran stands a strong chance of collecting a full amount. But if the jury decides that a trust is responsible for some of the damages, it’s possible the veteran wouldn’t collect that entire amount because some trusts are depleted. -- Supporters of the bill include the National Federation of Independent Business, Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce and the AMVETS veterans group. They say there wouldn’t be any significant delays in asbestos trials because attorneys representing cancer victims would know before filing any lawsuit that they also have to file a claim with an asbestos trust. And even now, it can take up to a year before an asbestos lawsuit goes to trial, so many veterans videotape their testimony in case they die before the trial begins. The supporters also say the bill would stop so-called double dipping: a cancer victim collecting damages from the company they sue and then filing claims for more money with one or more of the trusts. Double dipping arguably depletes funds available for other cancer victims who have legitimate claims. Our rating Larson said the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Senate approved a bill "denying veterans the right to recover their medical costs for cancers they developed while serving their country." The bill does not target veterans and does not deny their right to seek compensation, both from existing and now-bankrupt asbestos-related companies, for cancer they contracted as a result of serving in the military. But Larson’s claim contains an element of truth, in that the bill could result in some veterans collecting less money from legal actions than they could under the current system for seeking compensation. We rate Larson’s statement Mostly False.	None	Chris Larson	None	None	None	2014-03-20T05:00:00	2014-03-12	['Wisconsin_State_Senate']
pomt-08964	Opponent Holly Benson said that "Just because you're poor doesn't mean you're unhealthy, it just means you have a lot more time to go running."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/20/pam-bondi/holly-benson-once-said-poor-people-have-time-run-o/	Pam Bondi, a former Hillsborough County Assistant State Attorney now running for attorney general, is playing up her courtroom experience and life outside of politics in a new mailer hitting doorsteps of potential Republican voters. The mailer is heavy on self-praise, calling Bondi a "proven conservative," a "hands-on prosecutor" and a "legal expert." Those aren't claims PolitiFact Florida can objectively analyze, but we found something else that caught our eye. In a section of the mailer called "Who's cut out for the job?", Bondi creates a chart that reports to measure the three GOP candidates -- herself, Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp and former Agency for Health Care Administration Secretary Holly Benson. One of the categories is: "In their own words." Bondi's answer, since she got to choose it, says that she won't be outworked or outlawyered. Kottkamp's answer comes from a newspaper interview related to the Republican Party of Florida credit card mess that besieged the state GOP in 2009 and early 2010. Then there's Benson's line. According to Bondi, Benson once said that "just because you're poor doesn't mean you're unhealthy, it just means you have a lot more time to go running." The line includes a footnote referencing a Tallahassee radio interview from July 9, 2008, when Benson would have been serving as Gov. Charlie Crist's health care secretary. But would she have said something like that? We found a digital recording of the interview with WFSU's Margie Menzel. Benson and Menzel were having an extended discussion about health and poverty, a serious topic. During the interview, Benson talked about trying to get people to eat more fruits and vegetables, the push for more nutrition in school lunches and the encouragement to take the stairs instead of the elevators. Then, Menzel suggested the economic downtown would continue to create a "downward spiral" in people's health. "It may not create a downward spiral in their health, maybe in their ability to find affordable health insurance," Benson responded. "But just because you're poor doesn't mean you have to be unhealthy. It means you have a lot more time to go running." The answer prompted a devilish laugh from Menzel, and from the sound of it, immediate regret from Benson. (You can listen to the interview yourself here, the exchange starts around the 12 minute mark). Benson almost instantaneously tried to correct her statement. "OK, that's not... that's not really," Benson says over the laughing. Then, she tried to clarify her point. "I don't think just because you don't make a lot of money doesn't mean you can't go exercise." Later in the same program, a caller who identified himself as "Michael from Alabama" criticized Benson's remark, calling it inappropriate and low class. "Thank you sir, I apologize for that. As soon as I said it, I regretted it," Benson says according to the audio recording. "I mistook something that Ms. Menzel said and meant that there's no reason that anybody couldn't be healthy at any time." Bondi quotes Benson accurately in the campaign mailer, but Benson tried to walk back her comment right away and apologized for it later in the same radio interview. We rate Bondi's statement Mostly True.	None	Pam Bondi	None	None	None	2010-07-20T18:03:42	2010-07-15	['None']
pomt-06237	Newt Gingrich’s immigration plan offers "a new doorway to amnesty."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/dec/02/mitt-romney/does-newt-gingrich-support-amnesty-mitt-romney-say/	There’s an "A" word in the Republican primary for president -- "amnesty." When Newt Gingrich outlined a more flexible immigration policy at a CNN debate on Nov. 22, 2011, his opponents seized the chance to brand him an amnesty supporter. Mitt Romney said the next day that Gingrich "offered a new doorway to amnesty last night, which as I said last night in my view is the wrong course for a Republican debate." About a week later, Romney repeated his criticism of Gingrich in an interview with Brett Baier of Fox News. "If he's going to do what I believe he said he was going to do for those people who would be allowed to stay permanently and become citizens, that would be providing for them a form of amnesty," Romney said. We decided to investigate the amnesty charge, to see if it was an accurate way to describe Gingrich’s policies. Before we go any further, we need to take a stab at defining amnesty. Merriam Webster defines amnesty as "the act of an authority (as a government) by which pardon is granted to a large group of individuals." In recent American politics, though, the usual standard for amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. That law, supported by President Ronald Reagan, said that illegal immigrants could become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in this country by Jan. 1, 1982, and met a few other minimal requirements. The law was widely described as an "amnesty" program, both then and now. Gingrich’s vision for immigration policy is that it takes place in steps, with the first step of securing the border between the U.S. and Mexico. He also supports a program for guest workers, to allow foreign nationals into the United States to work. Finally, some illegal immigrants would be allowed to stay. "Once you've put every piece in place, which includes the guest worker program, you need something like a World War II Selective Service Board that, frankly, reviews the people who are here," Gingrich said at the debate. "If you've come here recently, you have no ties to this country, you ought to go home, period. If you've been here 25 years and you got three kids and two grandkids, you've been paying taxes and obeying the law, (and) you belong to a local church, I don't think we're going to separate you from your family, uproot you forcefully and kick you out. "The Krieble Foundation has a very good red card program that says you get to be legal, but you don't get a pass to citizenship. And so there's a way to ultimately end up with a country where there's no more illegality, but you haven't automatically given amnesty to anyone." Gringrich’s sets a higher bar for allowing people to stay than the law under Reagan. Based on his comments at the debate and a detailed 10-point plan on his website, Gingrich says his proposal isn’t amnesty for several reasons: It is not citizenship but legal residency; immigrants would have to prove "deep ties to America, including family, church and community ties;" and they would pay a fine of at least $5,000. In the course of our research, we noticed that advocates for more legal immigration often used this distinction. In their view, amnesty means widespread legalization with few requirements. A path to legality or earned legalization, on the other hand, includes fines, waiting periods, proof of English language proficiency, criminal background checks and other criteria. Romney, on the other hand, has defined amnesty as giving any kind of special preference to people who are now in the country illegally. "My view is that those people who have waited in line patiently to come to this country legally should be ahead in line, and those who’ve come here illegally should not be given a special deal or a special accelerated right to become a permanent resident or citizen," Romney said the day after the debate. Those who oppose more immigration tend to agree with Romney. "Anything that turns an illegal resident into a legal resident one way or another is an amnesty," said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports low levels of immigration, when we asked him about this. After the debate, Krikorian scolded Gingrich in a blog post on the National Review Online for claiming his plan wasn’t amnesty: "If you want to make a case for amnestying long-established illegal aliens, that can be an honorable position, but call it for what it is. Don’t lie to voters, imagining they’re too stupid to see through your deceit." On the other side of the issue is Tamar Jacoby of ImmigrationWorks USA, which represents businesses who favor more immigration. She said Gingrich’s avoidance of the loaded term amnesty was understandable, since his plan is limited and requires illegal immigrants to meet various requirements. She praised Gingrich for his honesty. "He’s getting pilloried for saying we can’t deport 11 million people," she said. "At least Newt is saying, ‘There’s a problem here, let’s come to grips with it.’ " During Romney’s recent interview with Fox News, Baier pressed Romney about what he would do with the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants who are already in the country, noting that Romney has stopped short of urging mass deportation in past interviews. "You know, there's great interest on the part of some to talk about what we do with the 11 million. My interest is saying, let's make sure that we secure the border, and we don't do anything that talks about bringing in a new wave of those or attracting a new wave of people into the country illegally," Romney said. Our ruling "Amnesty" has become a radioactive term in American politics, and Republicans in particular do not want their immigration policies described that way. Gingrich supports allowing illegal immigrants who have been in the United States for many years to apply for legal status. He’s said that process should look at each individual and whether they have "family, church and community ties." They would also have to pay a fine. What he describes sounds like a more restrictive process than the 1986 law supported by Reagan that allowed for widespread amnesty. Still, the word amnesty means simply forgiving groups of people who have broken the law. Most legal amnesties include some sort of process. Words matter, and under a more straightforward definition, Gingrich’s plan is clearly amnesty, though it may be limited in scope. Romney said that Gingrich's plan offers "a new doorway to amnesty," which suggests that Gingrich's plan allows for legalization without being the same as the older amnesty law.

pomt-05819	Says he was "exonerated in every single case" in 1990s ethics violations charges.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2012/feb/20/newt-gingrich/gingrich-says-he-was-exonerated-ethics-probe/	Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich faced some of his harshest attacks on ethics violations during the Florida GOP primary last month. On Feb. 10, Gingrich appeared on Neal Boortz’s radio talk show on AM 750 and 95.5FM News/Talk WSB to make his case. With the Georgia primary just weeks away, Boortz told Gingrich that he should have fought harder in Florida against the attacks. "Well, look," Gingrich replied. "The Wall Street Journal said the ads were false and that in fact I was exonerated in every single case. National Review said the ads were false, I was exonerated in every single case." "Exonerated in every single case?" This was a surprise to us. A U.S. House of Representatives committee looked into whether Gingrich broke ethics rules in the 1990s. All but one of the charges were dropped, and he was reprimanded by the House in 1997. In what amounted to a plea deal, Gingrich agreed to pay $300,000 and admit he had "engaged in conduct that did not reflect creditably on the House of Representatives." So how could Gingrich have been exonerated? He even admitted to poor conduct. We contacted the Gingrich campaign but received no response. We therefore switched gears and took a closer look at the National Review and The Wall Street Journal, the two publications he cited. But first, here’s a review of the ethics controversy, as provided by PolitiFact National: The case primarily involved a course at Kennesaw State College (now Kennesaw State University) that Gingrich taught while in Congress. Its organizers solicited financial support from "individuals, corporations and foundations," promising that the project qualified for tax-exempt status. But the ethics committee concluded that the course aimed to "help in achieving a partisan, political goal" -- something that would run afoul of its tax-exempt status. A further problem for Gingrich was that during the investigation, he submitted letters from his lawyers for which "the subcommittee was unable to find any factual basis." Gingrich "should have known" that the information in the letters "was inaccurate, incomplete and unreliable." The Abraham Lincoln Opportunity Foundation and the Progress and Freedom Foundation, Gingrich-related groups backed with tax-deductible donations, helped fund the course. Obviously, Gingrich wasn’t exonerated by the House of Representatives. The ethics committee, which has an even number of Republicans and Democrats, voted 7 to 1 to pass a report that recommended a reprimand and $300,000 penalty. The full House passed the ethics report 395 to 28, with 196 Republicans supporting it. Now on to the articles Gingrich cited. Neither publication said he was cleared on all ethics counts. However, an opinion article in The Wall Street Journal said that a formal IRS investigation in 1999 "exonerated Mr. Gingrich." We found a similar claim in the National Review. News accounts tell a different story. The House ethics committee left it to the IRS to determine whether there were violations of tax laws. It cleared the Progress and Freedom Foundation of accusations that it violated its tax-exempt status in 1999. The IRS described its decision as a "close case," according to news accounts. It accused the ethics committee of failing to turn over crucial transcripts. "It is possible that if the ethics committee had rendered full cooperation with our examination, the transcripts might have affected our conclusion," the decision said. News accounts from the Los Angeles Times and The New York Times said that the IRS did not directly exonerate Gingrich. The IRS did find the Lincoln foundation was involved in partisan efforts to train Republican political activists. It lost its tax-exempt status in December 1998, and the decision was upheld in federal court, according to an article in Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call. But the IRS restored its tax-exempt status in 2003 through a little-known review process, according to Roll Call. Critics said the move opened the IRS to accusations that it was swayed by political influence, and the process was soon abolished, according to Roll Call. The IRS did not say at the time whether the Lincoln foundation controversy was a factor. An IRS letter restoring the Lincoln foundation’s tax-exempt status does not say whether the group was cleared of engaging in partisan activity. No, Gingrich was not "exonerated in every single case," as he said during the Boortz show. There is no doubt that the full House of Representatives voted to formally reprimand him for his conduct, and he was required to pay a $300,000 penalty. Furthermore, the IRS’ treatment of the Progress and Freedom Foundation and the Abraham Lincoln Opportunity Foundation don’t clear him, either. One was cleared -- with a caveat the IRS was unable to obtain important evidence. Even if both groups were cleared, that would not blot out or negate the House of Representatives’ historic decision to reprimand him. Trying to claim that it does is ridiculous.

pomt-01047	The merger of Georgia State University and Georgia Perimeter College will make GSU one of the largest universities in the nation, with more than 54,000 students.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/jan/23/gsu-alumni-association/merger-will-produce-one-nations-largest-universiti/	Since 2011, the University System of Georgia has been consolidating some of its 35 colleges and universities. The biggest of these mergers -- combining four-year Georgia State University in downtown Atlanta and largely two-year Georgia Perimeter College anchored in the suburbs -- is slated to be final in 2016. When this merger was approved earlier this month by the university system’s Board of Regents, officials said the university that emerges would retain the Georgia State name. They said it also would become the largest university in Georgia. But in a mass email to former students, the school’s alumni association suggested the merger will put GSU in an even more exclusive class. With a student enrollment of more than 54,000, the consolidated university also will be one of the largest in the nation, the email said. PolitiFact Georgia decided to check the facts and the numbers. We looked first at the claim that a merged Georgia State and Georgia Perimeter College would be No. 1 among the state’s colleges and universities, based on enrollment. The University of Georgia currently holds that rank, with 35,197 students enrolled last fall, followed closely by GSU with 32,556 students. But a consolidated school would have 53,927 students, if the 21,371 students who attended Georgia Perimeter last fall were put on GSU’s rolls. That would put GSU’s enrollment well above UGA’s and No. 1 in the state by more than 20,000 students, based on current data. Enrollment is forecast to exceed 54,000 by 2016, assuming normal growth.. Now, what about that national claim? We found a couple of organizations that rank colleges and universities by enrollment. But for our purposes we had to discount the most widely known of those, U.S. News & World Report. The magazine, which grades colleges and universities on several standards, bases the ranking we saw on undergraduate enrollment. Georgia State’s claim is based on total enrollment. The website Matchcollege.com identified the largest 300 colleges and universities in the U.S, -- and only 17 of them had 50,000-plus students. Several of the highest-ranking schools were largely on-line, although Ohio State University and the University of Central Florida were high on the list with 56,387 students and 59,601 students, respectively. We discounted the schools that are largely online, including Phoenix University, with its 300,000-plus students. We did not see how to make apples-to-apples comparisons between the largely online and traditional brick and mortar colleges and universities, and a data expert we consulted agreed. Bragging rights are also hard to determine since a lot depends on how the numbers are counted, and who is counted? We found where Central Florida calls itself the second-largest university in the U.S. In Indiana, we found that Ivy Tech College, which is the state's system of community colleges at multiple locations, is considered one college. It calls itself the nation’s largest single accredited statewide community college. We looked at federal government data and went to websites to get more recent enrollment numbers. From that we found: Arizona State University with a first-day 2014 fall enrollment topping 82,000; Lone Star College hitting an all-time high enrollment last fall of 82,818; University of Minnesota reported system-wide enrollment this fall of 67,477; The University of Texas at Austin in fall 2013 had 52,076 students enrolled; and Tarrant County College (another community college in Texas) with a fall 2014 enrollment of 50,628. Richard Vedder, director of the not-for-profit Center for College Affordability and Productivity in Washington D.C., said he was confident that Georgia State will qualify as one of the nation’s largest universities, once the merger is complete. He said it was "a little unusual to have a two-year merge into a four-year" university. "Schools like Georgia State take on thousands of marginally qualified students who don’t go on to graduate and tend to hurt their rankings. Now, they’re going to add Georgia Perimeter students," he said. "It might be good to save an institution. It might be a way to improve access. But I can’t see any reputation gains from it," he said. Vedder also cautioned that "getting big doesn’t necessarily mean getting better." Hank Huckaby, chancellor of the University System, has never said the goal was to boost Georgia State’s size. He has said the merger will play to GSU’s strength as "a recognized national leader in improving student retention and graduation rates." "Combining these attributes with Georgia Perimeter College’s leadership in providing access to students across the metro area presents a major opportunity to improve student success," Huckaby said after the merger was approved. GSU officials also have stressed that the university’s rankings as a top-tier public research university will not be impuned and that Georgia Perimeter’s academic enterprise will be evaluated and measured separately from Georgia State’s bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degree programs by organizations that rank institutions. Students and faculty at GSU and Georgia Perimeter have been voicing concern about how the schools’ two missions will be blended and about staff layoffs forecast for Georgia Perimeter A student earning a 4-year degree from Georgia State can expect to earn $44,200 starting out and $72,900 at mid-career, according to payscale.com. By comparison, a student with two-year degree from Georgia Perimeter can expect to make $37,200 starting out and $48,200 at mid-career. Georgia Perimeter has been without a permanent president since 2012 when President Anthony Tricoli resigned after an audit revealed a budget shortfall at the college of about $25 million. Tricoli has since filed suit, alleging he was made the fall guy and misled about the finances. Revelations about the shortfall initially hurt the college’s credit rating. But it has since bounced back and recently been upgraded. Our conclusion: The merger of Georgia State University and Georgia Perimeter College will make the state’s largest university, as plans exist now. It also would make the combined university one of the largest in the nation. We rate the alumni association’s statement True.

pomt-01524	Says Scott Walker's jobs agency gives financial incentives that lead "Wisconsin companies to look at shipping jobs elsewhere. ... A company got $4.6 million in taxpayer money and actually reduced its jobs by 300 people."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/19/mary-burke/scott-walkers-jobs-agency-gives-incentives-lead-lo/	The Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., a jobs agency created by Republican Gov. Scott Walker and a GOP-controlled Legislature, has been beset by enough operational problems that it has become something of a political punching bag. But Democrat Mary Burke took the criticism to a new level when she raised questions about whether the agency is actually costing the state jobs. The former state Department of Commerce secretary and Trek Bicycle executive was asked in a Sept. 10, 2014 interview on La Crosse television what she would do to keep Wisconsin from losing jobs to other countries. "It’s absolutely critical," Burke said. "And, unfortunately, we have a situation not only in the state here but across the country where American manufacturers are finding it hard to compete against lower-wage countries. So, as governor, I want to fight for the interests of Wisconsin manufacturers, to level that playing field. She continued: "But also, we shouldn't have incentives that cause Wisconsin companies to look at actually shipping jobs elsewhere. And there was a company that, just yesterday it was just announced that under WEDC -- the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., Gov. Walker's chief jobs agency -- that a company got $4.6 million in taxpayer money and actually reduced its jobs by 300 people. So, we have to make sure we’re not having incentives that actually cause employers to ship jobs elsewhere." So, does the WEDC offer incentives that lead companies to move jobs out of Wisconsin? WEDC’s history WEDC was created in February 2011 to replace the Department of Commerce. Walker argued that the partially privatized agency would be able to respond more quickly to the needs of businesses looking to create jobs in the state. Its short history has included controversy. In November 2012, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that WEDC discovered it had failed to track in one centralized database more than $12 million in past-due loans. In May 2013, a state audit found the agency repeatedly failed to follow basic standards in state law for ensuring the clear and proper use of millions of dollars in taxpayer money. And in September 2014, it was revealed that a top WEDC official quit the previous month over the way the agency is run, saying another leader — and former top aide to Walker — was causing the agency "lasting harm." He revoked his resignation three days later. Burke’s claim As for Burke’s claim, her campaign spokesman insisted that Burke did not mean to say WEDC offers incentives that lead Wisconsin businesses to move jobs out of state. But twice in her remarks Burke referred to incentives that could cause businesses to ship jobs elsewhere. So, we're basing our factcheck on what a TV viewer would have heard Burke say. The day before Burke’s interview, WKOW-TV in Madison did a blog post following up on previous news stories it had aired about WEDC assistance to Plexus Corp., a company based in Neenah in Wisconsin’s Fox Valley that also has operations in Europe and Asia. The piece noted that Plexus had received $4.6 million in tax credits from WEDC despite having cut more than 300 jobs. Those were the two figures Burke cited in the La Crosse interview and her campaign confirmed that she was referring to Plexus. Let’s explain. Plexus builds electronics for other companies., such as ultrasound machines for GE Medical Systems and the "Freestyle" soda-dispensing machine for Coca-Cola. In May 2012, it announced plans to build a $50 million, 410,000-square-foot manufacturing facility in Neenah to replace two leased plants. At the time, Plexus and WEDC said the agency was eligible for up to $15 million in tax credits for the plant. Walker said as many as 350 jobs could eventually be created. WEDC provides certain portions of the tax credits based primarily on the amount of money Plexus invests in the now-completed plant, which was dedicated in August 2014, and on the number of jobs added over time. Plexus was to retain 1,792 jobs and create 350 more. According to the latest data on WEDC’s database, as of December 2013 only 1,485 jobs were retained -- 307 fewer than planned -- and no new jobs were created. About $4.6 million of the $15 million in credits that were approved had been issued. The tax credit deal runs through 2019. In July 2014, WKOW reported that Plexus said in July 2012, a month after the $15 million in credits were announced, it was laying off 116 workers from its main facility in Neenah. Plexus later issued a statement saying it did the Wisconsin layoffs after unexpectedly losing its largest global customer. The jobs were simply lost as a result of the lost business and were not moved elsewhere, the company said. The affected Plexus employees received federal benefits for workers harmed by overseas trade because the competitor that picked up the contract ended up performing the work in Mexico. A July 2014 memo from WEDC says Plexus will need to rehire for the positions that were cut before receiving any of the tax credits for adding jobs. Most of the new jobs are expected to be added in 2015 and 2016, according to the memo. Our rating Burke said the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp., Walker's chief jobs agency, gives financial incentives that lead "Wisconsin companies to look at shipping jobs elsewhere. ... A company got $4.6 million in taxpayer money and actually reduced its jobs by 300 people." There is an element of truth in the statement, in that Plexus Corp.'s Wisconsin employment dropped by 300 after it received about $4.6 million in state tax credits. Burke could criticize WEDC for giving money to a company that soon after laid off Wisconsin employees, but there is no evidence the aid led the company to move jobs elsewhere. Indeed, the aid went toward building a new plant in Wisconsin. Our rating is Mostly False.	None	Mary Burke	None	None	None	2014-09-19T10:00:00	2014-09-10	['Wisconsin']
pomt-03525	Says "With nearly 75 percent of Americans supportive of the construction of the pipeline, Schrader needs to explain to Oregon families why he voted against this needed project."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2013/jun/01/national-republican-congressional-committee/did-kurt-schrader-vote-against-widely-supported-ke/	The communications office of the National Republican Congressional Committee isn’t letting up on Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore. It’s recently peppered him with criticism over the sequester and President Barack Obama’s health care overhaul. This time, the issue is construction of a controversial pipeline that would carry crude oil from Canada to the U.S. Gulf Coast for refinement. A May 23, 2013, press release targeted Schrader for voting against H.R. 3, a bill that would allow TransCanada to start building the Keystone XL Pipeline without approval from President Barack Obama. Specifically, the legislation skips further environmental review and removes barriers to construction. "With nearly 75 percent of Americans supportive of the construction of the pipeline, Schrader needs to explain to Oregon families why he voted against this needed project," the release states. Three-quarters of Americans want this project to happen? We know surveys can sometimes use scurrilous, squirrelly language, so we thought we’d take a look-see. Plus, while Schrader is a veterinarian who loves animals, the man is no tree-hugging environmentalist. Does he oppose construction? Let’s tackle the 75 percent statistic first. The NRCC relies on a survey conducted by Nanos Research that was the subject of an April 2013 news report in the Wall Street Journal. Here’s the survey question: Based on what you have heard about the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline between Canada and the U.S., do you support, somewhat support, somewhat oppose or oppose the US/Canadian government approving the project? Of Americans, 52 percent said they support the project and 22 percent said they somewhat support it. Nanos, a respected independent polling firm, isn’t the only one to find that a majority of respondents in the United States support construction. An April 2013 Pew Research poll found 66 percent in favor with 23 percent opposed. The poll found broader support among Republicans and independents; Democrats are more divided. We checked with Daniel Kessler, a media campaigner with 350.org, which opposes Keystone. The Nanos polling question looked sound to him, although he wanted to remind readers that other surveys show high support for clean energy alternatives and efforts to combat global warming. Now, let’s address the second part of the statement. As we stated earlier, H.R. 3 eliminates the need for White House approval to start the project. It’s undisputed that Schrader voted against the bill. Nineteen House Democrats joined majority Republicans to send the bill to the Senate, where it sits. No House Democrat from Oregon voted for the legislation. In fact, the NRCC targeted a number of Democrats with the same press release, including Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore. A spokesman for Schrader said the congressman supports construction in principle, just not the way Republicans are going about it. "To say that he does not support the construction on the pipeline is false," wrote spokesman Cody Tucker in an email to PolitiFact Oregon. Annie Clark with the NRCC disagrees. She cited four other times where Schrader voted against construction. "Schrader voted against constructing or expediting construction of the Keystone XL Pipeline every chance he had," she wrote to PolitiFact Oregon. We checked his other votes. The legislation sought to force Obama to act or bypassed him altogether in approving Keystone. Loads of House Democrats voted against the bills. Schrader did vote against H.R. 3, which eliminates further regulatory hurdles, eliminates presidential input and essentially gives congressional go-ahead for construction. This statement by itself we would rate Half True. It is partially accurate in that Schrader did vote against the legislation, which authorizes the project. But it is missing significant details in that Schrader supports construction in principle, just not this particular way to get there. Had the NRCC said that Schrader voted against the bill -- as opposed to the project -- the statement would be True. The NRCC is accurate in citing that nearly 75 percent of Americans support construction of the Keystone XL pipeline. The Nanos survey is solid, as is a Pew Research poll that showed two-thirds support. With the polling part True and the project part Half True, that brings our ruling to Mostly True for this two-part statement.

pomt-06484	Says Democrats raised taxes over 115 times in the past 10 years, "making New Jersey increasingly unaffordable and chasing jobs to neighboring states."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/16/tom-kean-jr/tom-kean-jr-says-democratic-tax-hikes-chased-jobs-/	Property taxes are one of the usual go-to sources to gripe about the high cost of living in New Jersey. But there's dozens of other taxes and fees ripe for the picking. Buying new tires? Working on your tan? Looking to blow something up -- legally? All that will cost a little something extra. And a decade of Democratic control in state government is to blame, according to Republican state Sen. Tom Kean Jr. "Over the past 10 years, Democrats have been in control of the Legislature and have done a disservice to New Jersey workers and their families by raising taxes over 115 times, making New Jersey increasingly unaffordable and chasing jobs to neighboring states," Kean said in an Oct. 7 news release. PolitiFact New Jersey has heard the claim that Democrats increased taxes 115 times before -- and we’ll probably hear it again. But is it true? A list of the 115 tax increases that John Gorman, a Senate Republican spokesman, sent us included a mix of tax increases, fee hikes and tax policy changes between fiscal years 2003 and 2010. And though the vast majority of the bills were sponsored by only Democrats, a few had Republican support. Also, some of the increases -- whether they were taxes or fees -- were temporary and have expired. But since they went up, if only for a short period, we think it’s still fair to call that an increase. The state increased the sales tax from 6 percent to 7 percent in 2006. The legislation that hiked that tax also extended its reach, applying the tax to investigation and security services, tanning and limousine services, among other items and services. The gross income tax was increased in 2004 for taxpayers with income exceeding $500,000 and in 2009 for taxpayers with income exceeding $400,000. And smokers couldn’t have missed the multiple increases on cigarette taxes between 2002 and 2009. But among the 115 "tax increases" were a number of fee hikes -- measures that cost some residents more money but are arguably not a tax increase. Of those were a bill passed in 2008 that increased the maximum fees for permits to manufacture, store, sell or use explosives and a 2004 law that imposed a $1.50 fee on the sale of a new motor vehicle tires. Overall, Gorman provided a list that showed under Democratic majorities, there were dozens of increases in taxes or fees or other tax policy changes that could result in individuals or businesses paying higher taxes. Kean would be more accurate if he said taxes and fees were increased 115 times, but his number isn’t wildly off. Now let’s assess Kean’s larger point that tax increases drove jobs from New Jersey to neighboring states. Gorman sent a handful of surveys and studies that show New Jersey’s poor standing in the nation for its business and tax climate. A 2009 report by the Pew Center on the States said, "While its proximity to New York City and its educated workforce are appealing to many employers, New Jersey has been ranked the least friendly state for business four years running, largely because of its heavy tax burden." That’s a valid point, but there are a number of factors involved in the creation and destruction of jobs. Nancy Mantell, director of the Rutgers Economic Advisory Service, said "so many different things" are involved that you can’t just point to one factor as the reason for New Jersey’s job losses. Also, we previously researched a similar claim by another Republican state senator that blamed Democratic tax hikes for private-sector jobs losses in the last decade. Considering the impact of the recession on employment, we determined that tax hikes aren’t the only factors involved. Our ruling Kean said Democrats raised taxes over 115 times in the past 10 years, "making New Jersey increasingly unaffordable and chasing jobs to neighboring states." Under Democratic control of the state Legislature and governor’s office, the state saw nearly 115 increases in taxes and fees or other tax policy changes. But Kean can’t attribute a loss of jobs in New Jersey solely to those changes. We rate his statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-13494	Says Hillary Clinton said the Veterans Affairs scandal is "over-exaggerated." "She said she was satisfied with what was going on."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/sep/07/donald-trump/Trump-says-Clinton-satisfied-with-VA/	An Iraq War veteran asked Donald Trump at NBC’s Commander-in-Chief Forum how the Republican nominee would support veterans, beyond words. Trump referred the speaker to his website, saying one of the big problems veterans face is wait times to see doctors. He said his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, has been dismissive of the crisis. "And by the way, Hillary Clinton six months ago said the vets are being treated essentially just fine, there's no real problem, it's over-exaggerated," Trump said. "She did say that." Host Matt Lauer cut in, saying, "No, no, she went on after that and laid out a litany of problems within the VA." Trump doubled down: "Look, I mean, she made up half of the things she said about me. I'm telling you, this is -- she said she was satisfied with what was going on in the Veterans Administration. We wondered if in fact Clinton had used those words to downplay reports about veterans waiting for months to get medical care. Trump’s campaign issued a news release quoting Clinton at a November 2015 event, where she said, "I think Secretary (Robert A.) McDonald is doing a great job, but there is a lot more that needs to be done." The 16-second clip about McDonald, who took over the job in July 2014 after Eric Shinseki’s resignation, doesn’t provide much context of what she said before that quote. The Washington Post reported that Shinseki, former secretary, resigned May 2014 after reports that the VA hospital system "conspired to hide months-long wait times that veterans faced when seeking care." The event followed multiple media reports on extended wait times veterans face to get medical treatment, including reports of veterans dying waiting for care. Trump’s campaign after the forum also pointed to a Wall Street Journal article on criticism Clinton received after saying "It’s not been as widespread as it has been made out to be," on MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow Show, regarding problems at the Veterans Affairs Department. In that interview, Maddow asked Clinton about talks of privatizing the VA and if she had ideas on how to fix the program. "You know, I don’t understand why we have such a problem, because there have been a number of surveys of veterans, and overall, veterans who do get treated are satisfied with their treatment," Clinton said in the Oct. 23, 2015, interview. "Now, nobody would believe that from the coverage that you see, and the constant berating of the VA that comes from the Republicans, in part in pursuit of this ideological agenda that they have." Maddow interjects: "But in part because there has been real scandal." "There has been. But it’s not been as widespread as it has been made out to be," Clinton responded. "Now, I do think that some of the reforms that were adopted last year should be given a chance to work. If there is a waiting period that is just unacceptable, you should be able to, in a sense, get the opportunity to go out, have a private physician take care of you, but at the cost of the VA." Clinton went on to say the problem went "deeper" than access to health care and also included a backlog of disability determinations. "There’s something not working within the bureaucracy," she said. Clinton spoke before Trump at the NBC forum and said she was "outraged" by the stories about the V.A. and that she has been "very clear" about the necessity to move the department into the 21st century. Clinton has called for addressing the VA’s problems at multiple town halls and campaign events. At a June 2015 roundtable in Nevada, she said transforming the VA across the country should be a priority and "what happened in Phoenix and elsewhere is absolutely unacceptable, period," transcripts show. Later in November 2015, Clinton said at a town hall that the VA "does a lot of good work" but also "has systemic problems." "And those have been revealed, and it's been shameful that people have been mistreated. They've been put on waiting lists and never gotten the treatment that they were looking for. They've been given the wrong treatment. There are serious deficiencies within the VA," Clinton said. Our ruling Trump said Clinton said the Veterans Affairs scandal is "over-exaggerated," and, "She said she was satisfied with what was going on." This reading of Clinton’s comments about the problems facing veterans’ health care is misleading and leaves out the full story. While Clinton has said problems at the VA have "not been as widespread as it has been made out to be," she has also acknowledged systemic problems within the system and repeatedly urged reform so veterans can get care quickly. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-11647	"Almost half of all vehicles stolen in Texas each year had keys left inside."	false	/texas/statements/2018/jan/12/robert-chody/nearly-half-texas-vehicle-thefts-keys-left-inside-/	A Central Texas sheriff posted a warning that led us to check--and find faulty--key facts. Republican Robert Chody, elected the sheriff of Williamson County in 2016, said in a Dec. 27, 2017, tweet: "65,000 vehicles stolen in Texas each year. Almost half of all vehicles stolen in Texas each year had keys left inside. That’s a lot of preventable thefts #TakeKeysWithYou #LockDoors," his tweet said. Chody made us wonder about the share of vehicles stolen in Texas that have had keys left inside. Our inquiries didn’t prove out the claim and the responsible state agency removed the "almost half" statement from its website. Sheriff cites state agency For starters, Chody told us in a Twitter message that he drew his claim from a web page overseen by the Texas Department of Motor Vehicles. That page, "Auto Burglary and Theft Prevention Authority," said toward the top: "It doesn't matter what kind of car you drive, all vehicles are a potential target of theft. Nearly 65,000 cars and trucks are stolen in the state of Texas each year, and thousands more are burglarized. Almost half of all vehicles stolen had the keys left inside." When we asked TxDMV about the basis of its "almost half" finding, spokesman Adam Shaivitz provided statements by email from the anti-theft authority’s director, Bryan Wilson, who noted first that according to information collected and posted by the Texas Department of Public Safety, more than 65,000 motor vehicle thefts were reported each year from 2013 through 2016, when the agency noted 68,461 such thefts. Wilson also shared a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration publication, "Vehicle Theft Prevention: What Consumers Should Know," attributing 40 percent to 50 percent of vehicle thefts nationally "to driver error, which includes leaving vehicle doors unlocked and leaving keys in the ignition or on the seats," the publication says. Also, Wilson pointed out, the National Insurance Crime Bureau, an Illinois-based nonprofit that says it’s dedicated to fighting insurance fraud and crime, published an October 2016 report stating that over several years, Texas ranked second only to California by having 11,003 vehicle thefts with keys inside--a figure drawn from the bureau’s review of theft reports compiled by the federal National Crime Information Center. The bureau’s report says: "Vehicle thefts with keys were identified by using the NCIC text fields available to NICB. Terms indicating the vehicle was stolen with the keys were used as search criteria." Wilson, asked about relevant statewide data, said there hasn’t been a systemwide "science-based empirical study to measure the sometimes surreptitious activity of leaving keys in the car or doors unlocked." A rough calculation We made our own run at gauging the prevalence of Texans leaving keys in stolen vehicles by dividing the 11,003 Texas vehicle thefts with keys inside as noted by the crime bureau into the 200,503 vehicle thefts in Texas tallied by the DPS through the study period. That comparison suggests that 5.5 percent of vehicle thefts in the state from 2013 through 2015 involved keys left inside. Next, we sought to fine-tune our results by asking the bureau to sort its count of Texas vehicles stolen with keys left inside by each of the years. A spokesman, Frank Scafidi, emailed us a chart indicating 3,079 Texas vehicle thefts with keys left inside in 2013; 3,547 in 2014; and 4,377 in 2015. We compared those counts with total vehicle thefts tallied by the DPS for each of the years--an indication the share of stolen vehicles with keys left inside ranged from 4.7 percent in 2013 to 6.5 percent in 2015. Scafidi also offered a caution by telling us to consider the bureau’s counts of thefts with keys left inside to be on the low end of what likely occurred because "we have to rely on reporting officers indicating keys were a factor in the text field of each NCIC record. They don’t always provide that extra bit of information," he wrote. By phone, meantime, Scafidi expressed skepticism at the idea of nearly half of Texas thefts involving keys left in vehicles. Scafidi further noted by email that the bureau does not make that kind of claim in its handout about auto theft that’s made available to police departments. We also asked NHTSA and the FBI about available national data showing how often victims of vehicle theft leave a key in place. In emails, Jose Ucles of NHTSA and Stephen Fischer of the FBI each told us his agency didn’t have such data. Local police agencies Shaivitz separately told us the authority’s tracking of vehicle thefts with keys left inside came from reports submitted by 24 regional task forces or local police agencies awarded grants by the authority to combat vehicle thefts and burglaries. Shaivitz also provided a December 2017 press release from the Amarillo Police Department stating that 762 of the 922 cars and trucks reported stolen locally from December 2016 through Dec. 21, 2017, had the keys left in them--a figure confirmed by the department’s Cpl. Jeb Hilton, who told us by phone that he couldn’t guess why so many motorists had left keys in their vehicles. Shaivitz also forwarded an email from Austin Police Department Sgt. Chris Vetrano stating that 51 percent of locally reported vehicle thefts in December 2017 involved keys left in vehicles. We asked the Austin department to elaborate. By email, Anna Sabana advised that through 2017, approximately 32 percent of vehicle thefts reported to the department "had keys available" when the thefts occurred--compared with about 41 percent the year before. Broadly, Shaivitz said, more than half the authority’s grantees said a major factor in vehicle burglary and theft cases is "people leaving their vehicles unsecured and leaving keys in the interior, although they don’t all report percentages." He specified that authorities in Paris reported that 80 percent to 90 percent of stolen vehicles were due to keys being left inside or available and Potter County officials said 90 percent of stolen vehicles had the keys left in them and the Victoria Police Department reported that in the last quarter of 2017, 69 percent of local vehicle thefts involved keys left inside. Claim removed While we were researching this fact-check, Shaivitz told us the TxDMV had amended the authority’s anti-theft web page by removing the declaration that almost half of vehicles stolen in Texas had keys left inside. Revised text on the web page says: "Many jurisdictions report that keys left inside and doors unlocked are major factors in stolen and burglarized vehicles." Our ruling Chody said that almost half of all vehicles stolen in Texas each year have the keys left inside. Surely some instances of keys left in stolen vehicles go unreported. Yet we identified no statewide data supporting this "almost half" assessment while our calculations rooted in a national group’s research indicate that less than 1 in 10 reported Texas vehicle thefts from 2013 through 2015 involved keys left in vehicles.

pomt-07981	"Between the year 2000 and 2006, (insurance) premiums in this country doubled."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/19/chris-van-hollen/rep-chris-van-hollen-says-insurance-premiums-doubl/	As the debate over a Republican effort to repeal the health care reform law kicked into high gear on Jan. 18, 2011, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., argued against repeal and began by citing a couple of statistics to set the stakes. "I'm interested to hear my colleagues say that they can identify with all the problems in the health care system," Van Hollen said from the floor of the House. "Between the year 2000 and 2006, premiums in this country doubled, health insurance company profits quadrupled, and this Congress did nothing." This statistic is nothing new in the health care debate. In fact, we first visited a very similar claim when Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., wrote a Sept. 21, 2009, opinion piece for the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call in which he said, "Insurance companies have seen their profits soar by more than 400 percent since 2001, while premiums for consumers have doubled." As we did then, we'll break this into two fact-checks. We'll deal with the claim about insurance company profits in a separate item. Here we'll address Van Hollen's first claim that between 2000 and 2006 premiums in this country doubled. The time frame cited by Rockefeller is a little different, but the source for fact-checking it isn't. The Employer Health Benefits Survey, published by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust, is considered the definitive source for health benefits cost information, and its most recent data stretch from 1999 to 2010. In 2000, average annual premiums for single people were $2,471, a number that rose to $4,242 by 2006 — a 72 percent increase. The amounts for family coverage rose over the same period from $6,438 to $11,480 — a 78 percent increase. We also looked at just the portion of premiums paid by employees, because that's the number most consumers really care about. For individuals, the average premium paid by the employee went from $334 to $627; and for families, the employee contribution went from $1,619 to $2,973. That's an increase of 87 percent and 83 percent, respectively. Those numbers get pretty close to Van Hollen's claim about doubling, but not quite. And so we rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-08945	Marco Rubio's "economic proposals will add $3.5 trillion to the federal deficit."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/23/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-and-marco-rubio-come-out-swinging-cl/	Liberal MSNBC television host Rachel Maddow and conservative Republican U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio are engaging in a multimedia tit-for-tat over tax cuts and the federal deficit. All set to a background of peppy elevator music, winks and clever one-liners. We're not kidding. The back and forth started on July 14, 2010, when Maddow decided to poke fun at Rubio's "12 Simple Ways To Grow Our Economy." She noted, correctly, that most of the ideas are ripped straight from the Republican playbook. Extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. Repeal the estate tax. Repeal the federal health care legislation. Fight cap and trade. Maddow criticized the ideas as failing to consider the GOP's (and Rubio's) other golden rule -- thou shall not increase the deficit. "Republicans want to be the anti-deficit and anti-debt party right now, but they also want to run on George Bush's tax policies," Maddow said. "And that is the giant awkwardness at the heart of Republicanism right now. Because George W. Bush's tax policies did to the deficit what the 'I only eat fried cheese' diet does to your cholesterol." The Maddow rant got a reaction from the Rubio campaign two days later, in a web ad set to that peppy elevator music we talked about. "On Tuesday, Marco Rubio announced 12 simple ways to grow the economy and create jobs," the ad, called "Maddow" begins. "How can you know the plan is right? Rachel Maddow thinks it's wrong." (You really should watch these ads, by the way. Rubio at one point facetiously plugs Maddow's 9 p.m. show; Maddow, in return, facetiously thanks him, and so on). On July 19, Maddow issued her reply to Rubio's ad -- in her own "ad" that mimics Rubio's. "Marco Rubio has proposals for cutting the deficit and growing the economy. He wants to: Make Bush's '01 and '03 tax cuts permanent, end the estate tax, prevent cap-and-trade energy legislation, repeal health reform," Maddow's ad says. "How does Marco Rubio say you can know his plan is right? 'Rachel Maddow thinks it's wrong.' Seriously. That's his argument. That's it. "Even if everything about me is inherently wrong just by virtue of who I am, this is still true about Marco Rubio: His economic proposals will add $3.5 trillion to the federal deficit." The Rubio camp issued their latest response on July 21, highlighting the state's unemployment rate and the number of Floridians facing foreclosure while taking a shot a President Barack Obama and Senate rival independent Gov. Charlie Crist. "Think Obama and Crist's policies are working just fine for Florida?" the ad, called "Again, Rachel" asks. For Rubio, the ads are a chance to take on a liberal media-type like Maddow. And we're pretty sure we haven't seen the last of it. That said, we found it an appropriate time to jump in with a fact check. The question we're after: Will Rubio's economic ideas add $3.5 trillion to the federal deficit? Maddow's case We know government spending is a big issue for Rubio. On July 16, 2010, we checked and found True a Rubio claim that $0.40 of every $1 being spent by the federal government is now borrowed. We also know Rubio vigorously opposed the federal stimulus bill because it added substantially to the federal deficit. A spokeswoman for Maddow said the talk show host got her deficit figures from the Congressional Budget Office, Congress' nonpartisan number-crunching arm. The CBO produced a series of revenues estimates in February should Congress enact three Republican-held tax cutting ideas -- extend the set to expire 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, repeal the federal estate tax and continue indexing the Alternative Minimum Tax for inflation (The AMT was enacted in 1969 to make sure wealthy people couldn't avoid taxes altogether, but it wasn't indexed for inflation. Congress manually adjusts the AMT for inflation each year). All three proposals are part of Rubio's 12 ideas -- specifically Ideas 1, 3 and 5. Together, the CBO found that they would increase the federal deficit by $3.4 trillion from 2011-2020, "mostly from lower revenues but also from increased outlays for refundable tax credits." Preventing cap and trade legislation, Rubio's Idea 9, also would have a negative effect on the federal deficit, according to the CBO. The theory behind cap-and-trade is that the government sets a limit on how much carbon different companies, such as electric utilities or manufacturers, can emit (the cap). The government then issues permits to companies and allows them to buy and sell the permits as needed so they can conduct business (the trade). If the policy works as planned, overall emissions decline, companies determine for themselves the best way to lower emissions, and the free market rewards those who lower emissions most effectively. In a letter dated July 7, 2010, CBO Director Douglas W. Elmendorf said that opposing cap and trade legislation would have the effect of raising the federal deficit by about $19 billion from 2011-2020. Those are the four major ideas Maddow uses in making her claim. But we wanted to at least consider Rubio's other ideas. Many of them, it turns out, come with deficit impacts that are difficult to measure, or at least appear to have no impact on the deficit. Rubio proposes reducing the corporate tax rate, for instance, but he doesn't say how much -- making it impossible to judge the revenue impact. Another Rubio idea is to repeal the federal health care bill (you can see all 12 here). The federal health care bill enacted is estimated to reduce the deficit slightly -- about $143 billion from 2010-2019 -- according to the CBO. But a substitute health care bill -- something Rubio favors -- could reduce the deficit as much. So we've decided to discount the deficit reduction for the sake of this fact check. Excluding the health care repeal, that's about $3.4 trillion that we can verify that will be added to the federal deficit between now and 2020 if Rubio's economic ideas are put in place. Economic debate We turned to economists and Rubio's campaign to see what we're missing. Karen Campbell, a policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the CBO deficit projections do not account for a fundamental Republican philosophy -- that lower taxes can bolster economic activity across a broader spectrum. Put simply, the lower tax rates are, or the less taxes people are required to pay, the more opportunities that exist for people to make money. It's a sentiment echoed by the Rubio campaign. "A growing economy means more people are employed and generating revenue, more businesses are being started and expanded, and fewer people are claiming unemployment benefits," Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos said. That's not an argument for everyone, however. "If you cut taxes, you borrow money, that's it," said Chuck Marr, the Director of Federal Tax Policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "For a lot of Republicans it's gotten to the point, that deficits only concern spending. A deficit is when you spend more than you tax. But for them, it's become just what the spending is. They seem to think that taxes don't matter. Mathematically it's ridiculous." Added Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution: "I cannot see any way that extending the Bush tax cuts or repealing the estate tax could have any effect other than to produce an increase in the expected size of the future deficit. Period. There is no plausible set of private economic responses that would generate an increase in future total tax revenue if those two policies were adopted. The federal government would simply collect less income tax revenue and less estate tax revenue than it is now expected to do." Greg Mankiw, who was the chairman of George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisors from 2003 to 2005, estimated in 2005 that a broad-based income tax cut would recoup "only about a quarter of the lost revenue through supply-side growth effects." Mankiw, who teaches macroeconomics at Harvard, referred to people who believe that broad-based income tax cuts could actually raise tax revenue "charlatans and cranks" in the first edition of his textbook, Principles of Economics. Our ruling We realize we're not going to be able to change people's basic economic philosophies. We're not here today trying to disprove supply-side economics, or boost another economic thought. Based on our analysis, we do think it's a stretch for someone like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to suggest the Bush 2001 and 2003 tax cuts were revenue neutral. And yet we also see the logic in the argument that lower taxes could stimulate investment in the economy, creating an army of new taxpayers. Rubio, himself, realizes spending cuts also will be necessary to offset at least some of the tax cuts he's proposed -- and to shrink the federal deficit. Rubio's campaign announced he would roll out ideas to cut government spending on July 26 in Jacksonville. And we'll be ready to examine them. But in this case, we're sticking to Maddow's claim that Rubio's "economic proposals will add $3.5 trillion to the federal deficit." The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that extending the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts, repealing the estate tax and continuing to adjust the Alternative Minimum Tax for inflation will increase the federal deficit $3.4 trillion between now and 2020. That's right about on the mark, and only measures the impact of three of Rubio's tax cutting ideas. But unlike Maddow, we do want to leave some leeway for the economic growth those broad-based tax reforms could generate, as well as Rubio's spending cuts, still to be revealed. We rate her statement Mostly True.	None	Rachel Maddow	None	None	None	2010-07-23T11:35:03	2010-07-19	['Marco_Rubio']
pomt-06816	High-speed rail would have cost Florida taxpayers $1 billion to build.	false	/florida/statements/2011/aug/11/rick-scott/gov-scott-says-rail-would-have-cost-state-taxpayer/	On his second month on the job in February 2011, Florida Gov. Rick Scott wrote a letter to the U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood announcing he had decided to reject about $2.4 billion in federal money for a high-speed train line between Tampa and Orlando. Scott said at the time that he was worried Florida would ultimately be on the hook for costs. Democrats and some Republicans criticized Scott's move, which killed a project that had been in the works for decades. Florida's high-speed rail debate kept the Truth-O-Meter running at full speed ahead for some time as members of Florida's congressional delegation, several state lawmakers and local officials scurried to try to circumvent Scott. Supporters pitched a new plan to the governor in which cities would take over the project and a private company would assume the risk of cost overruns -- but Scott remained steadfast in his argument that the state could get stuck with huge costs. Several months after Scott squashed the project, he still faces questions about why he put the brakes on it -- as he did during an interview on Tampa Bay's local CBS affiliate Aug. 5. "Here is the deal. I offered it to everybody and nobody wants to do this and that's why I'm not doing it. They offered, the federal government, here's the deal. ... I'm going to give you $2.4 billion -- that sounds nice right? You've got to put up a billion dollars to finish the project. And you are going to lose money every year. And if you decide, gosh I'm tired of losing that money, you've got to give the $2.4 billion back. It's a bad deal." Scott made a similar claim about the $1 billion cost for Florida in an Aug. 5 meeting with Tampa Bay Buccaneers coach Raheem Morris after the coach made a comment about liking rail. Readers picked up on the line and asked us if Scott got Florida's share of the high-speed construction correct. To start, it's worth looking at the chronology of what led up to Scott's rejection of high-speed rail. In 2009, the Florida Legislature under Gov. Charlie Crist laid the groundwork for Florida to provide $280 million for a line between Orlando and Tampa. But after Scott took office it was clear that the project was in jeopardy. A December 2010 fact sheet from the Florida Department of Transportation about high-speed rail stated that the federal government would pay for the bulk of the project -- about $2.392 billion. The state's portion, according to the state DOT, would be $280 million. The fact sheet stated that an industry forum in Orlando in November 2010 drew considerable interest from the private sector. "There will be intense competition to win the first true HSR (high-speed rail) in the U.S. Individual meetings with various teams in November 2010 revealed strong private sector interest and willingness to assume ridership risk and invest in the system. Teams are very interested in right-of-first-refusal for Orlando-Miami leg." (The Orlando-to-Miami leg was to be built after Tampa-to-Orlando. That project was more costly but also considered more lucrative in the long run.) Where Scott got his number So why did the state say the rail line would cost the state $280 million to construct but Scott said $1 billion? The answer is because Scott's source of information isn't state transportation officials. It's the libertarian Reason Foundation. On Jan. 6, 2011, the Reason Foundation released an analysis about Florida's rail project, which concluded that capital costs to build the project would be higher than anticipated and ridership would fall short, leaving the state with operational shortfalls. Scott relied on the Reason analysis in killing the high-speed rail project. While the federal government had committed $2.4 billion and the state $280 million, "This report assumes that any cost above $2.7 billion will be borne by Florida taxpayers." The Reason analysis goes on to cite research by European academics who looked at 258 projects in various countries over 70 years and found that cost overruns occurred in 90 percent of the projects and that the average capital cost overrun for passenger rail was 45 percent. "If the Tampa to Orlando high-speed rail line experiences cost escalation typical of international high-speed rail projects, it will cost between $.54 billion and $2.7 billion more than projected," the Reason analysis states. "Based on averages, most likely the overrun would be about $1.2 billion, all of which would be the responsibility of Florida taxpayers." The analysis is right to point out that many other rail projects experienced cost overruns. But there are reasons to question its methodology and objectiveness are suspect. Consider: • The author of the study, Wendell Cox, is a known rail skeptic, and Robert Poole, a Reason Foundation director whose name was on the report, served on Scott's transition team for transportation issues. • Much of the expectation of cost overruns is based on a list of 258 projects studied by European academics. But those projects are not just rail projects. The study includes bridges, tunnels and highways. In fact, of the 258 projects, only 58 (or 22 percent) are actually rail projects. The projects also are predominantly based in Europe. It's also unclear what projects are included and what projects are not. • The $1.2 billion overrun estimate is created simply by assuming the Florida rail project will cost 45 percent more than anticipated. How is that assumption made? By calculating the average overrun in 258 transportation projects considered. There is no analysis to suggest Florida will experience an "average" cost overrun compared with the other projects. • The study also fails to account for the current low price of construction and materials given the problems in Florida's economy. As Scott's own DOT secretary Ananth Prasad said on Aug. 8, 2011, in advocating for more road-building projects: "This is kind of like a buyer's market." • And, most importantly, the study assumed Florida taxpayers would assume the cost of all construction overruns, when that likely wasn't true. In an interview, Cox said that he has supported rail programs when they make sense. We asked for an example and Cox said he supported an expansion of a rail project in Hong Kong in 2000. But generally, Cox said that rail projects have not been profitable. "Every single dollar put into high-speed rail has been lost. The record couldn't be more clear." He said his report takes into account some more recent projects within the past decade including one in London. The rail project in London was taken over by the government in 2009 after the consortium faced financial difficulties. The report also considered a current project in California. A report by California's legislative analyst in May cited problems with the rail plans in that state. The Associated Press reported in May 2011 that while the cost for the first phase was estimated at $43 billion in 2009, estimates have grown by as much as 57 percent. Cox sent us this Aug. 9, 2011, news report about California's skyrocketing rail costs. Cox said his study didn't guarantee cost overruns for Florida. But, he said, history shows that overruns were likely. "We didn't say this will be the case -- what we did say was taxpayers in Florida need to be aware of the risks," Cox said. State officials said private companies would pay for construction overruns To satisfy state legislators, who were unwilling to spend any additional state taxpayer dollars on the high-speed project, Florida transportation officials promised in early 2011 that any contract to build the rail line would include a guarantee that Florida wouldn't pay for any construction overruns. Kevin Thibault, the Florida Rail Enterprise's executive director, said in a Jan. 11, 2011, Senate committee meeting that a private consortium -- not state taxpayers -- would be responsible for cost overruns or revenue shortfalls. We listened to a recording of Thibault from the meeting where he stated that a private company would design and build the project and maintain and operate it for 30 years. "The public sector would help fund the major investments of it -- the infrastructure -- and then the private sector role is to assume the ridership risk. Where we've been very clear upfront is the operation and maintenence cost is going to be borne by the private sector. There is no state funds associated with that phase of it. The only funds that's going to be available would be toward the capital end." And the private sector would take on the costs of any construction cost overruns, longterm operations and maintenance, Thibault said. U.S. Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood also said that private companies, not the state, would be required to pay for cost overruns in a Feb. 16 statement: "We worked with the governor to make sure we eliminated all financial risk for the state, instead requiring private businesses competing for the project to assume cost overruns and operating expenses." Brie Sachse, a spokeswoman for the Federal Railroad Administration, provided the same information in an Aug. 9 e-mail interview. "Federal officials repeatedly assured Gov. Scott that Florida would not be on the hook for either cost overruns during construction or any operating cost deficits. These risks were to be 100 percent assumed by bidders of the project for design, construction, operations and maintenance responsibility, in order to insulate Florida taxpayers. Eight private teams comprised of domestic and international companies were ready to bid on this project and several of these groups said they would be willing to assume any risk associated." Ultimately bids were never sent out to private companies, so we can't for certain say DOT officials would have included the overrun guarantee. And we don't know if private companies would have agreed to the deal. But we do know legislators made it clear they would need a guarantee to move forward with the project. Legislators, we should note, also wanted private companies to pony up the $280 million or so the state had committed to the project, to lighten the state's burden even more. The prospects of that, however, were never completely vetted because Scott pre-emptively killed the project. Our ruling If high-speed rail had moved ahead in Florida, Scott said the state would have had to pay $1 billion to build it. Scott bases his claims on hypothetical cost overruns from a suspect study written by a libertarian think tank. While the study correctly points out that other transportation projects have experienced cost overruns, there are several flaws with the study. Most importantly, the study assumes that the state would pay for cost overruns. But that ignores that both the state official in charge of the rail project and the U.S. Department of Transportation secretary said that the state wouldn't be liable for overruns. And legislators were keen on having it happen that way before fully embracing the high-speed rail line. In the end, the state's share to build the line would have been capped at around $280 million (and legislators hoped the final number would be even less). You can't rewrite history to fit your narrative. We rate Scott's claim False.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2011-08-11T11:40:47	2011-08-05	['None']
pomt-09225	"The city of Houston now has more debt per capita than California."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/may/14/rick-perry/perry-says-houston-has-more-debt-capita-california/	Bill White, the Democratic nominee for governor and Houston's former mayor, casts himself in a recent TV ad as a "man on the move" who intends to "move Texas forward." GOP Gov. Rick Perry, running for re-election, depicts White as a man running from his record. "The city of Houston now has more debt per capita than California," the narrator says in a May 3 Web advertisement posted by Perry's campaign. White has touted his financial prowess; we recently noted his claim to cutting city property tax rates five times. In contrast, California in 2009 issued 450,000 IOUs for personal income tax refunds. Does Houston have more debt per resident than the Golden State? Believe it. Perry's campaign pointed to fiscal 2009 financial reports for Houston and California. Houston's outstanding debt that year was $5,720 per person. California's debt per person was $2,808 — less than half of Houston's. Katy Bacon, a spokeswoman for White's campaign, balked. Comparing state and city debt is "ridiculous," she said, arguing that Texas lets local governments, like counties and cities, borrow money to build most of their infrastructure. Next, we asked Perry's campaign why he compared Houston's debt to California's debt as opposed to, say, Los Angeles. Spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said California was singled out because its economy isn't flourishing "and that sets a pretty powerful comparison looking at the debt between Houston and the debt of the state." Powerful, yes. But reasonable? We asked financial experts all along the political spectrum about that. Like White's campaign, Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, said comparing cities' and states' long-term debt can be misleading. "The state will typically have responsibility for public infrastructure, such as highways," Craymer said. "Cities — they're in charge of infrastructure for not just roads, but water, wastewater, solid waste, landfills. They're really very different operations." Talmadge Helfin, director of the Center for Fiscal Policy at the conservative-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation, said California's debt load is beyond his expertise. Yet Heflin, former Republican chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said that generally, "when you look at cities and states, the cities within a state tend to have a higher debt load than the state does." Heflin echoed the infrastructure Craymer pointed to, that he said cities tend to use bonds to fund. Robert Kline, executive director of the Texas Bond Review Board, said he's never heard of comparing city debt to state debt. In the end, none of the experts we spoke with had either. They included Steve Murray, regional director of Austin-based Fitch Ratings, one of three major national credit rating agencies. "Typically we do not compare city debt and state debt levels primarily because (city and state governments) issue (debt) for very different purposes," Murray said. "The repayment streams can vary greatly, so really, a more appropriate comparison, and what we do, is city to city and state to state." We took his suggestion and compared Texas' debt to California's debt and Houston's debt to that of other big cities. In fiscal 2009, Texas had $1,368 in debt per capita, according to the state's financial reports. That was less than half of California's per-capita debt that year, whose population of 36.9 million people (according to the U.S. Census Bureau) is about 1.5 times the population of Texas. According to Los Angeles' financial reports, the city (the nation's second largest, with 3.8 million residents in 2008, the Census Bureau's most recent data) in 2009 had $3,995 in per-capita debt, or about two-thirds of the per-capita debt of Houston, which with 2.2 million residents in 2008 ranked as the nation's fourth-largest city. Other cities' debt per capita in 2009: the nation's largest city New York ($7,760), third-largest Chicago ($5,274), fifth-largest Phoenix ($3,757), sixth-largest Philadelphia ($4,684) and seventh-largest San Antonio ($1,808). Punch line: Houston's per-capita debt of $5,720 doesn't stand out in this sampling, except that only New York among the three bigger cities had more debt per resident. Meanwhile, Craymer cautioned against comparing per-capita debt loads of cities without taking into account what those debts are paying for. In Texas, for instance, Austin operates its electric utility, while the electric utilities in Houston are privately held. "So you couldn't reasonably compare Houston debt to Austin because they include different things," Craymer said. More on point to how Murray compares cities, we looked at Fitch's most recent credit ratings, which are often used to assess the economic health of everything from corporations to governments. AAA is Fitch's best rating, while D, the worst, means the entity has defaulted. Of late, Houston, New York and San Francisco have received AA ratings from Fitch. Los Angeles was most recently rated AA-. How have state governments fared by the Fitch ratings? Texas most recently got the AAA rating, California landed with an A-. And where does all this debt noodling leave us? Perry accurately says Houston's debt per capita is more than California's debt per capita, a charge that seemingly packs a punch. However, Perry's claim leaves a misleading impression because Houston's and California's budgets are different beasts. Experts concur, moreover, that it's unheard of to compare a city's debts to the debts of a state. We rate Perry's statement as Half True.

pomt-04122	Says in fiscal year 2011, the state had "a projected $11 billion deficit."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jan/09/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-new-jersey-faced-11-billion-de/	Hurricane Sandy held much of the focus of Gov. Chris Christie’s State of the State address Tuesday, but New Jersey’s economic woes weren’t totally forgotten. Christie talked repeatedly of Garden State resilience and making the tough choices, from tenure reform to hardline collective bargaining to dealing with huge amounts of debt. "In fiscal year 2011, the picture was even worse: a projected $11 billion deficit – on a budget of $29 billion – in percentage terms, the worst in America," Christie told a packed statehouse in Trenton as he reviewed the state’s economic landscape. He also noted that as in previous years, the state budget was balanced without raising taxes. Tuesday’s address marks the fourth time since 2011 that PolitiFact New Jersey has heard that $11 billion figure from Christie. The third time was during Christie’s keynote address in August at the Republican National Convention in Florida. As we did in August, we’re looking only at the claim of an $11 billion budget deficit for fiscal year 2011 and the budget being balanced. First, Christie has balanced the budget every budget year, as required by the state Constitution. So, that claim is accurate. But there’s a problem with his claim about a projected $11 billion deficit for fiscal year 2011. Let’s explain. The $11 billion refers to a $10.7 billion structural deficit the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Service projected for the fiscal year 2011 budget, when Christie proposed his first spending plan. A structural deficit measures how much money the state would need if current services and revenues remained the same and all spending obligations required by statute were fully funded. But the state does not have to meet all of its obligations because the budget supersedes statute. So although a state statute may require certain levels of spending on different programs, the governor can sign a budget that does otherwise. That’s basically what Christie did in his first budget. He skipped a $3 billion pension payment, didn’t fully fund the school aid formula, and didn’t fully fund the state’s property tax rebate program. When the fiscal 2012 budget year came around, New Jersey still had a projected structural deficit, of about $10.5 billion. But Christie dismissed that calculation, calling it the "old way of budgeting." In a 2011 budget speech, Christie said the projected deficit "assumes no one is actually managing the budget or setting priorities. That is yesterday’s New Jersey." The next year Christie said, "the baseline is zero" for budgeting. That’s one way of making an $11 billion deficit ‘disappear.’ Our ruling Christie said in his State of the State address that New Jersey in fiscal budget year 2011 faced a projected $11 billion budget. The governor also said that he, with the Legislature’s help, was able to balance the budget. The state Constitution requires a balanced budget every year and Christie met that obligation. But the deficit figure Christie cites refers to a $10.7 billion projected structural deficit, a calculation Christie used to his advantage in his first budget year but has since dismissed as the old way of budgeting. Now, "the baseline is zero" for budgeting, the governor has said. That’s important context Christie’s statement lacks. As it did in previous fact-checks, this statement rates Half True.

pomt-05153	"The Koch brothers alone gave twice as much money to Scott Walker as the total amount of money raised by Tom Barrett."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jun/20/debbie-wasserman-schultz/billionaire-koch-brothers-gave-8-million-wisconsin/	As Wisconsin’s historic recall election approached, Democrats lamented the record-setting amount of money raised by Republican Gov. Scott Walker. The complaints continued at the state party’s annual convention on June 8, 2012, three days after Walker defeated Democrat Tom Barrett in the recall. The keynote speaker, Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, attacked billionaire brothers and conservative activists David and Charles Koch. "Democrats were up against nothing short of an avalanche of secret, out-of-state and corporate special interest money amounting to a massive $31 million war chest for Governor Walker compared to just $4 million on our side," the south Florida congresswoman charged. "In fact, the Koch brothers alone gave twice as much money to Scott Walker as the total amount of money raised by Tom Barrett." Roughly speaking, the total figures Wasserman Schultz cited have been widely reported: Walker raised $30.5 million and Barrett, the Milwaukee mayor, $3.94 million. That’s as of reports filed by May 21, 2012, more than two weeks before the election; final reports won't be filed until July 5, 2012. If the congresswoman is correct, David and Charles Koch gave Walker’s campaign $8 million -- more than one-quarter of the governor's total haul. It’s possible, given that Wisconsin law allowed unlimited contributions to Walker during part of the recall campaign. But is Wasserman Schultz on the money? The Koch brothers Before they became front-page news in Wisconsin in early 2011, many residents had never heard of the Koch brothers. Charles Koch, of Wichita, Kan., is chief executive officer of Wichita-based Koch Industries, which owns companies involved in oil and other industries. David Koch, of New York City, is the company’s executive vice president. The brothers, both in their 70s, are each worth $25 billion, making them tied for 12th on Forbes’ March 2012 list of billionaires. In February 2011, a Buffalo, N.Y., blogger posing as David Koch made a prank call to Walker. Walker discussed ways Koch could help Republican legislators, presumably with TV and radio ads. He also said he considered -- but rejected -- planting troublemakers amid demonstrators who had been protesting his policies at the Wisconsin Capitol for a week. We asked Koch companies spokeswoman Melissa Cohlmia to respond to Wasserman Schultz's claim. She said neither brother personally contributed any money to Walker. Indeed, neither brother shows up as a donor to Walker’s campaign in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel searchable database of recall contributors. Case closed? Let’s dig a little deeper. Wasserman Schultz's evidence To back up Wasserman Schultz’s statement, Democratic National Committee spokeswoman Ellen Canale cited parts of a June 2012 CBS News article on contributions benefiting Walker that were linked to the brothers. She cited two figures in the article that add up to a total of $10 million, well above Wasserman Schultz’s claim of $8 million. CBS indicated it got at least some of its data from the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which tracks money in politics, but it didn’t attribute specific figures to the Madison-based nonprofit or to any other source. The article said $3 million was spent on Walker’s behalf by the conservative group Americans for Prosperity, which was founded by the Koch brothers. How or when the money was spent isn’t stated. The article also said Americans for Prosperity spent $7 million in 2011 to promote Walker's agenda, "launching an ad campaign just two days after the governor introduced legislation ending collective bargaining for public unions." So, Wasserman Schultz is backing down from her original claim -- that the Koch brothers gave Walker $8 million -- and is now saying the money came from the group the brothers founded. Canale also provided a second article, from Florida’s Palm Beach Post in February 2012, in which David Koch said of Walker: "We're helping him, as we should. We've gotten pretty good at this over the years. We've spent a lot of money in Wisconsin. We're going to spend more." In saying "we," Koch was referring to Americans for Prosperity, the article said. So, clearly there’s a close connection between the Koch brothers and the group they created. Examining the evidence Two questions arise: 1. Are the $3 million and $7 million figures Wasserman Schultz cites in the CBS article accurate? In examining campaign money in the gubernatorial recall campaign, we reported in late May 2012 that the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign estimated that Americans for Prosperity had spent $2.7 million on Walker’s behalf. The group said it based its estimate primarily on AFP television advertising. We followed up with executive director Mike McCabe about a week after the recall election. He said it's safe to say that Americans for Prosperity in late 2011 and early 2012 spent at least $3 million on Walker's behalf, but that it would be difficult to say how much more. McCabe said he sees no evidence the total would be $10 million, as the CBS article indicated. 2. Is it fair to say those amounts were spent by the brothers when the money, as Wasserman Schultz now admits, came from Americans for Prosperity? David Koch himself refers to Americans for Prosperity as "we." But as a tax-exempt "social welfare" organization, AFP does not have to disclose its donors, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit in Washington, D.C. that tracks money in politics on the national level. So, the sources of Americans for Prosperity’s money, including how much has been contributed by the Koch brothers, aren't readily available -- although the center noted in a March 2012 report that AFP's donations included $1.6 million from the John William Pope Foundation in North Carolina and $520,000 from the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation in Milwaukee. That makes it clear the group gets money from more than just the Kochs. For its part, Americans for Prosperity says on its website that more than 90,000 Americans in all 50 states have given money to AFP or its sister organization, AFP Foundation. AFP Wisconsin director Luke Hilgemann reiterated to us that AFP doesn't disclose its donors and he noted that the group's ads supported the 2011 state budget reforms, as opposed to a particular candidate or party. The reforms are among Walker's signature accomplishments, although they needed approval from the Republican-controlled Legislature. Our rating Wasserman Schultz said "the Koch brothers alone gave twice as much money to Scott Walker as the total amount of money raised by Tom Barrett," which would amount to about $8 million. She later said she meant it was through the conservative organization they founded, Americans for Prosperity, although that qualifier certainly was not part of her original statement. The Koch brothers didn’t personally give any money to Walker’s campaign. There is no proof of how much Americans for Prosperity, which gets money from the Kochs but also other sources, spent on Walker's behalf. And the leading campaign money tracker in Wisconsin estimates the AFP total as being in the $3 million range. We rate Wasserman Schultz's claim False. Update: After this item was published, Brendan Fischer of the Center for Media and Democracy pointed out that a June 2012 CNN article said Americans for Prosperity had spent $10 million. We contacted AFP president Tim Phillips, who told us AFP had spent $10 million in 2011 and 2012 on TV ads, direct mail, staff and other expenses to support reforms made by Walker and the Legislature. We also contacted the Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, which reiterated that it saw evidence of only about $3 million in AFP spending, but that it could not be sure because AFP is not required to report its spending. The original claim cited money directly from the Koch Brothers, not AFP which has numerous other donors. As such, we don't feel a change in rating is warranted.

pomt-00518	After a federal inquiry corroborated Hillary Clinton on Whitewater, "the next day, there was nothing in the media about it."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/23/bill-clinton/no-media-coverage-hillary-clintons-exoneration-whi/	Former President Bill Clinton said in a recent interview that questions over his wife’s trustworthiness have been put to rest in the past and will be again. Speaking on CNN’s State of the Union, Clinton compared the media frenzy over leaked emails, speaking fees, and Clinton Foundation donations with a 1995 Whitewater report that he said "completely exonerated" Hillary Clinton. Back then, the alleged exoneration didn’t get much traction in the news, he said. "The next day, there was nothing in the media about it. There was stunning nondisclosure," he said on June 14. "So, now we have got social media, and we can have disclosure. And we can all live under the same rules. And it's going to be fine." His claim about missing coverage of Whitewater was as surprising to us as it was to the incredulous Clinton, so we decided to delve into the archives and see if we could confirm his claim. In a separate fact-check, we looked at the claim that the report "completely exonerated" her. That earned a rating of MostlyTrue. Investigating Whitewater The long, long Whitewater saga first came to public attention during Bill Clinton’s 1992 presidential campaign, when the New York Times published an article detailing the Clintons’ involvement in the late 1970s with Whitewater Development, a real estate corporation. Together with a longtime friend, James B. McDougal, the Clintons formed the company in order to buy and sell vacation property in the Ozark Mountains. McDougal, however, was also the president of Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan association. Over the following decade, the company became engaged in a number of risky real estate ventures and lending deals, including a number of political donations to Bill Clinton’s Arkansas gubernatorial campaign. When Madison Guaranty finally collapsed in 1989, McDougal was indicted on federal fraud charges; though he was later acquitted, a separate investigation ensued, one that eventually implicated the Clintons as potential beneficiaries of illegal activity. To further complicate matters, Hillary Clinton’s law firm had also represented Madison Guaranty as it fought unsuccessfully to prevent insolvency. After Clinton won the presidency, a confused mass of probes, committees, hearings, and special investigations ensued, proceedings that dogged Clinton through most of his tenure in the Oval Office. Questions were raised, as Republicans in Congress searched for a smoking gun: The only problem, to stretch a metaphor, was that nobody knew the make, the model, or even the existential status of the alleged firearm. The investigation was rife with leaks of undisclosed documents that dripped out slowly, and as we’ll see, that contributed a good bit to why the media covered the scandal the way they did. The 1995 Pillsbury Report The Pillsbury Report sat squarely in the midst of this bureaucratic tangle. Commissioned in order to investigate the Clintons’ involvement in the Whitewater venture, it concluded that no civil action should be taken against anyone involved in the real estate deals. This is not the first time Clinton has expressed his disapproval over the media’s coverage of the 1995 report in question, which was authored by independent law firm Pillsbury, Madison, & Sutro and commissioned by the Resolution Trust Corporation, a now-defunct federal agency involved in the Whitewater investigation. In his autobiography, My Life, Clinton writes that he "eagerly awaited" the coverage of the New York Times and Washington Post on the report’s findings, but was disappointed by the results: "Immediately after the RTC report was released, the Post mentioned it in passing, in the 11th paragraph of a front-page story...and the New York Times didn’t run a word. The Los Angeles Times, Chicago Tribune, and Washington Times ran an Associated Press story of about four hundred words on the inside pages of their papers." In acknowledging that there was any press coverage at all, Clinton contradicts his recent statement that there was "nothing in the media" the day after the report was released. Nevertheless, his larger point seems to be that the press coverage of the event was severely lacking. So, is Clinton’s claim of "stunning nondisclosure" factual? The answer is slightly murky, since it’s unclear when the report’s findings came to light, and therefore how quickly news organizations responded to it. There exists a preliminary report dated to April 24, 1995, but it does not appear to have been released to the media at the time (more on this below). It seems more likely that Clinton is referring to the Dec. 13, 1995, report to the RTC, which concluded, "It is recommended that no further resources be expended on the Whitewater part of the investigation." The earliest media mention we could find of the December report is from the Dec. 16, 1995, Washington Post story that Clinton mentions in his book. The story focused on the White House easing conditions for the release of certain documents, noting that the report was sent to congressional committees two days earlier. Over the next week, articles about the Pillsbury report trickled out. On Dec. 18, both the Wall Street Journal and the San Jose Mercury News ran short stories, less than 150 words, giving succinct summaries of the report. The next day, ABC’s evening news program Nightline briefly discussed the findings, while the New York Times, like the Washington Post, mentioned the report within a larger story on missing Whitewater files. Later that week, the New York Times’ Sunday edition contained a story focused solely on the Pillsbury report. On Dec. 20, the New York Daily News ran two editorials on the Pillsbury report, one giving a nod and the other exploring the findings at length. So there was some press coverage, even if it wasn’t sufficiently exculpatory for Clinton’s taste. In fact, Howard Kurtz, in an editorial for the Washington Post on Dec. 22 (one praised by Clinton in his autobiography) discussed why there was scant media attention. Kurtz quoted several reporters from major newspapers as saying that the report was old news — a draft had been leaked that June — and beside the point: Attention to the Clintons’ participation in the land venture itself had dissipated, replaced instead by questions surrounding Hillary Clinton’s role as legal adviser to Madison Guaranty, the firm embroiled in the real estate deals surrounding the scandal. That particular issue would not be resolved until the Dec. 28 report on Clinton’s Rose Law Firm was released, which concluded on a similar note to the other report: "It is recommended that no further resources be expended on this investigation." We looked back to see if it was true that the December report’s findings had already been covered in the summer, and discovered that it was: Seven different newspapers wrote about the April 24 Pillsbury report on June 26 or 27, with the Washington Post devoting two separate stories to the issue. Kurtz’s article also supplies another reason why media outlets might have been reluctant to devote too much coverage to the Pillsbury report, even after its findings were made public in December: It wasn’t available to them in its entirety. "As soon as we can get ahold of the report, it's our intention to write an article about it," a New York Times editor told Kurtz, "There's a lot of spin that goes along with these reports. That's why you have to look at them." The New York Daily News, in its article from Dec. 20, gives the reason for this, writing that the report "was shown to the Daily News by congressional Democrats," but "the not-guilty verdict cannot be made public. It contains advice on how to prosecute other Arkansas figures, including their business partner James McDougal, and the government does not want that information to fall into the hands of defense attorneys." Our ruling Bill Clinton said that after a federal inquiry substantially cleared Hillary Clinton on the Whitewater scandal, "The next day, there was nothing in the media about it. There was stunning nondisclosure." While the former president might technically be correct — after the Dec. 13 report was sent to Congress, nothing appeared in the papers the following day — there was some amount of press coverage over the following week and a half, including a discussion of why that press coverage was not more amplified, a discussion that Clinton himself acknowledges in his autobiography. Additionally, there had been substantial press coverage of the findings of a preliminary report once the media managed to obtain information from it. We rate Clinton’s statement Half True.

pomt-02185	"95 percent of the income gains in the last few years have gone to the top 1 percent."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/apr/27/neera-tanden/tanden-95-percent-income-gains-last-few-years-have/	With most political handicappers giving Republicans the edge in the 2014 midterm elections, the pundits get to debate whether Democrats can rally their base and beat the odds. A primary question is whether the country’s struggle with income inequality offers the Democratic party the toe hold with voters that it needs. Democratic Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren’s new book A Fighting Chance gave the panelists on NBC’s Meet the Press an opening to bat this about. Neera Tanden, head of the Center for American Progress, a liberal-leaning group, argued that the issue not only would work well among the party faithful but beyond. "95 percent of the income gains in the last few years have gone to the top 1 percent, That's a fact in the country," Tanden said. "I think this is going to be an issue on both the right and the left." The claim that the top earners have done extremely well coming out of the Great Recession has come up before. While there is some debate over the details, in large measure, Tanden is on solid ground. The statement goes back to a study from University of California-Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez. In the years from 2009 to 2012, Saez found that the income flowing to families in the top 1 percent of families went up by over 30 percent, while for the rest, income grew by less than half a percent. "Hence, the top 1 percent captured 95 percent of the income gains in the first three years of the recovery," Saez wrote. The main caveat with Saez’s work is that he used preliminary data for 2012 and didn’t include two significant kinds of income -- money from the government (Social Security, welfare, food stamps, etc.) or the value of health insurance benefits. Saez focused on employment wages, capital gains, dividends and interest. So Tanden has her numbers right by Saez’s figuring, but what you count as income makes a difference. We’ll now walk you through some other ways of looking at this question. Other interpretations, analysis We came across a study that measured income differently than Saez -- by measuring capital gains regardless of whether the owner cashed out and including government assistance programs. That study, published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, found a wide income disparity as well, but noted that the gap actually narrowed between 1989 and 2007. There’s another argument that it makes more sense to calculate consumption rather than income. Economist Aparna Marthur with the American Enterprise Institute, a free-market oriented think-tank in Washington, believes what people spend shows you how well people are actually living, and it doesn’t matter if they pay for it using credit cards, their weekly paycheck or their savings. Viewed this way, the situation is not as bad. "We find that consumption inequality is much narrower than income inequality," Marthur said. "And has shown no trend towards widening over the last few decades." Marthur’s perspective is fuel for a policy debate that goes far beyond what we are writing about here, but there is one other criticism of Saez’s analysis. Eugene Steurele, a fellow at the Urban Institute, a D.C-based academic center, warned about using 2009, the very bottom of the recession, as the starting point. "The economic cycle messes up this comparison," Steurele told PunditFact in January. "In recovering from a recession, if an unemployed person stays with the same unemployment benefits, and a wage earner doesn’t increase her wages, but the stock market recovers enough so there are more capital gains, then one might get these types of results." Steurele said Saez’s findings are useful but his approach simplifies a complex situation. Work by the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan policy analysis arm of Congress, goes at least part way toward addressing Steurele’s concern. A 2011 report chose two points at the same place in the economic cycle, 1996 and 2006. It also factored in taxes and if its results are not exactly comparable to the Saez article, they point in the same direction. "The poorest tax filers (the bottom fifth) saw average after-tax income fall by 6 percent between 1996 and 2006," the report said. While "the richest 1 percent of tax filers experienced a 74 percent increase in after-tax income." The main reason for the widening gap was the rapid growth in capital gains and dividends income among the wealthy, the Congressional Research Service concluded. The latest annual review of data by the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality found that "after the Great Recession ended in mid-2009, income and consumption inequality increased." The report noted that households in the bottom fifth of the income ladder received 3.4 percent of all income in 2012. However, going back to the pundits' debate over how this will play out in the voting booth, one statistic might give the Democrats some concern. The Pew Research Center, an independent study group, found that Americans are not too worried about income inequality. In the center’s 2013 survey of global attitudes, barely half of Americans said the rich-poor gap is a very big problem. Our ruling Tanden said that 95 percent of the income gains have gone to the top 1 percent of earners. Tanden accurately reflected the findings of a much publicized report. Other studies confirm the overall trend in that report, although the disparities in gains between the wealthiest Americans and everyone else are not always as large as Tanden said and depend on how you define income. Tanden’s statement is accurate but in need of clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Neera Tanden	None	None	None	2014-04-27T15:55:37	2014-04-27	['None']

pomt-08923	Says Bill White's program to bring dropouts back to school was "so successful that almost every city in our state has replicated" it.	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/jul/27/leticia-van-de-putte/leticia-van-de-putte-says-bill-whites-efforts-cut-/	State Sen. Leticia Van de Putte praised gubernatorial candidate Bill White, a fellow Democrat, for his efforts to get dropouts back into classrooms during a speech last month to her party's convention in Corpus Christi. He "went door to door in Houston luring and asking those dropouts to come back to school," she said June 25. "Those programs were so successful that almost every city in our state has replicated what Bill White started." We wondered whether the former mayor of Houston's education initiative had really become so widespread. In response to our inquiry, Van de Putte's office pointed us to the website for Expectation Graduation, a program that White and his wife, Andrea, helped create in 2004 -- his first year as Houston mayor -- to reduce dropout rates. Part of the program's strategy is an annual Reach Out to Dropouts walk during which volunteers visit the homes of students who have not come back to school and encourage them to return. Linda Clarke, who served as White's director of education and special projects when he was mayor, said one goal of the walk is to help kids deal with the issues that keep them out of school, such as finding child care for teen mothers. The first walk was held in the Houston school district in 2004, and Clarke said Bill White has participated in each one. Mark Cueva, assistant to the deputy chief of staff in the office of Houston Mayor Annise Parker, said the walks first went statewide in 2008, when other major cities in Texas -- excluding Austin -- and their respective school districts held their own versions: Corpus Christi, Dallas, El Paso, Fort Worth and San Antonio. Five small cities in the Houston area also participated: Baytown, Galena Park, Richmond, Rosenberg, and Stafford. Last year, Midland joined the group, as did eight additional small cities near Houston. That brings the total number of Texas cities to 20. According to the Texas Almanac online, which is maintained by the Texas State Historical Association, the state has about 1,200 incorporated cities. So, less than 2 percent of the state's cities are replicators of the White-founded outreach program. On Tuesday, the White campaign released a Web video highlighting White's involvement with the Reach Out to Dropouts walk and its spread to big cities across the state. The campaign video also says that the Reach Out to Dropouts walk has brought more than 8,000 students back to school in Houston. Clarke said that number is a cumulative total based on reports by participating Houston-area school districts. When we asked Clarke, who is on the board of the nonprofit group that runs Expectation Graduation, about Van de Putte's statement that "almost every city in our state" has replicated the Reach Out program, she questioned the broad sweep of that assertion, and said her organization has always been clear about the number of cities participating. Van de Putte's press secretary, Kathryn Freeman, told us that the senator had gone off her prepared remarks during that part of the speech, which "simply stated that the program was so successful it was replicated across Texas." However, based on the expansion of the walk in the past two years, Freeman argued that the senator's "larger point is true, that Bill White began a program to try and address the dropout crisis in Houston that was successful and therefore replicated." We agree. Although Van de Putte clearly overstated the expansion of the Reach Out to Dropouts walk, it has been duplicated in most of the biggest cities in the state. We rate her claim Half True.

pomt-00747	The Hyde Amendment "language was in the (human trafficking) bill. The Democratic sponsor admits it was in the bill, and she voted for it."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2015/apr/19/karl-rove/karl-rove-and-juan-williams-argue-over-loretta-lyn/	This past week, President Barack Obama pressured Senate Republicans to schedule a vote to confirm his nominee for attorney general, Loretta Lynch. But the confirmation is stuck behind a stalled anti-human trafficking bill. The bipartisan bill hit an unexpected road bump in March when Senate Democrats accused Republicans of sneaking in a provision that restricts federal spending on abortions, while Republicans accused them of not reading the bill thoroughly. The issue resurfaced on the Sunday talk shows April 19, since Republicans have said they would not confirm Lynch until the human trafficking bill passes. By and large, the Republicans want the abortion spending restrictions, and Democrats don't. "The Republicans hid this language," said Fox News Sunday pundit Juan Williams of the abortion provision. "The language was in the bill," responded Republican strategist Karl Rove, after some crosstalk. "The Democratic sponsor admits it was in the bill, and she voted for it." Because the question about the origins of the anti-abortion provision have re-emerged, we wanted to take a look into Rove’s statement that the language was in there, and that a Democratic sponsor knew about it. The Hyde Amendment So what is an anti-abortion rule doing in a bill designed to increase compensation for human trafficking victims and to raise consequences for the traffickers? The provision is called the Hyde Amendment, which first passed about 40 years ago and is named after the original sponsor, Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill. The amendment bars federal funding for most abortions. Lawmakers have worked it into many pieces of legislation, including every appropriations bill since 1976, to explicitly prevent those funds from going toward abortions. So the trafficking bill’s Republican authors worked in a reference to the Hyde Amendment into the bill. The bill doesn’t plainly say anything about abortion or the Hyde Amendment. Rather it says, "Amounts in the Fund, or otherwise transferred from the Fund, shall be subject to the limitations on the use or expending of amounts described in sections 506 and 507 of division H of the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2014." (Those sections of the appropriations act are Hyde limitations.) But Senate Democrats didn’t notice that this was in the bill until after the Senate Judiciary Committee passed it unanimously in late February. The Democrats accused the Republicans of hoodwinking them. The Senate debated a version of the bill last year, and that version did not include Hyde Amendment language, and they said Republicans didn’t let them know about the change. In January, a Republican Judiciary Committee staffer emailed the Democratic counterpart a summary of changes, but the list did not mention the addition of the abortion language, according to the Washington Post. So who was Rove referring to when he said, "The Democratic sponsor admits it was in the bill, and she voted for it"? A spokesperson for Rove told us he was referring to Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., a member of the Judiciary Committee and one of the original cosponsors of the bill. Klobuchar’s office released a statement on March 18 saying that a staffer in Klobuchar’s office had known about the insertion of the Hyde Amendment before the Senate Judiciary Committee vote but "did not inform the senator." "The senator was not aware that the provision was included" when she voted for the bill in committee, the statement said. So, yes, Klobuchar’s office says a staffer knew the measure was in the bill. And Klobuchar did vote for it. But Rove is pushing things by linking the two events so closely together. There is no evidence Klobuchar knew the measure was in the bill and voted for it anyway -- which is what you might interpret Rove’s statement to mean. And Klobuchar has voted to block a final vote on the bill since the provision became widely known. We asked a couple legislative experts if the Democrats’ claim that they were hoodwinked passed muster, and they said both parties are to blame. The Democrats didn’t do their due diligence in thoroughly reading the bill, but the Republicans weren’t as upfront as they could have been in regards to adding in the Hyde language, said Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University and a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "Really, this is bad staff work all around," said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute. Our ruling Rove said the Hyde Amendment "language was in the bill. The Democratic sponsor admits it was in the bill, and she voted for it." The abortion language was indeed in the human trafficking bill considered this year, though it was not in a similar bill considered last year. A Democratic staffer was aware it was in the bill, but that message wasn’t conveyed up the food chain. The only flaw in Rove’s statement is the suggestion that the Democratic sponsor, Klobuchar knew about the language and voted for it anyway. There is no evidence of that. Rove’s statement needs that clarifying detail. We rate his claim Mostly True.	None	Karl Rove	None	None	None	2015-04-19T18:53:42	2015-04-19	['Democratic_Party_(United_States)', 'Hyde_Amendment']

pomt-12334	"Obamacare premiums have doubled" in Wisconsin.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jun/15/donald-trump/donald-trumps-claim-about-obamacare-premiums-doubl/	On his second visit to Wisconsin since entering the Oval Office, President Donald Trump stepped off Air Force One on June 13, 2017, and tore into Obamacare. Joined by two Wisconsin families whom he described as victims of the Affordable Care Act, Trump said in Milwaukee: "These are sad but familiar stories in Wisconsin, where Obamacare premiums have doubled. Obamacare is one of the greatest catastrophes that our country has signed into law." By not stating a time frame with his claim, the president left it to his audience to determine how alarmed to be; premiums doubling in one year, of course, is much different than over a span of years. And premium increases can’t be considered in isolation. So, let’s sort this out. Obamacare vs. GOP plan Three days before Trump’s trip, Vice President Mike Pence visited Milwaukee, saying that under the Republican replacement for Obamacare everyone with preexisting medical conditions will "have access to the coverage and the care that they need -- no exceptions." We found the pledge misleading. Based on the GOP plan passed by the House of Representatives, people with preexisting conditions could potentially face huge increases in premiums, though changes in the bill could still be made by the Senate. Around the country, there have been huge premium increases for people who buy health insurance on their own through Obamacare. We rated Mostly True a January 2017 claim by House Speaker Paul Ryan that Obamacare premiums had gone up as much as 116 percent (in Arizona) from 2016 to 2017 -- though it’s important to note that before Obamacare, millions had no coverage at all. But there are multiple problems with the president’s claim. Trump’s evidence The vast majority of Americans get health insurance through their employer or through a government program such as Medicaid or Medicare. So, Trump’s claim refers to the relatively few people who buy health insurance coverage on their own. The White House pointed us to a May 2017 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that compared premiums in the individual market in 2013 to 2017. The report says 2013 was chosen because that’s when key regulations that are part of Obamacare took effect. The average premium in Wisconsin nearly doubled, based on the analysis: Obamacare individual market 2013 average monthly premium 2017 average monthly premium Increase Wisconsin $266 $514 93% United States $232 $476 105% But Cynthia Cox, a health reform and private insurance expert at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading authority on health care, told us the analysis is skewed in a way that inflates the average premium for 2017 because it includes only policies that are sold in the Obamacare marketplace. The average 2017 premium would have been lower had the analysis also included individual policies that are not sold on the marketplace. That's because people who buy individual policies off the marketplace tend to buy less expensive plans because they aren't receiving Obamacare subsidies, she said. Other factors There are two other key factors to consider. 1. Obamacare subsidies offset much of the impact of premium hikes. In a news article on premium increases for 2017, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported that tens of thousands of Wisconsinites who buy individual health plans, but earn too much income to qualify for Obamacare subsidies, would have to absorb double-digit increases. But the story also said that because of the subsidies, most people buying those policies would see little, if any, change in their monthly costs. Economist Gail Wilensky, who ran the Medicare and Medicaid programs under Republican President George H.W. Bush, told us the same is true nationally: People buying individual policies on the exchange are mostly protected from premium increases, though the subsidies that rise along with premium increases are a hit to other taxpayers. 2. Coverage: Premiums are up, but benefits are better. Before Obamacare, millions of Americans had no health insurance and policies on the individual market offered "very limited benefits," University of North Carolina social medicine professor Jonathan Oberlander told us. For example, most of those policies didn’t cover maternity, mental health and substance abuse services. But now insurers are required to cover those services. The federal government estimates that 83 percent of Wisconsin marketplace participants receive premium tax credit subsidies and 51 percent receive cost-sharing subsidies. "For these residents, nongroup insurance today provides more protection for less money than in 2013," said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at Kaiser. Our rating Trump says "Obamacare premiums have doubled" in Wisconsin. The average premium for individuals who buy their own health insurance in the Obamacare marketplace nearly doubled from 2013 to 2017. But the vast majority of Wisconsin residents buying those plans get Obamacare subsidies that protect them from the premium increases. Moreover, insurance coverage on individual plans is generally more comprehensive than before Obamacare. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.

pomt-05120	The DREAM Act "was written by members of both parties. When it came up for a vote a year and a half ago, Republicans in Congress blocked it. The bill hadn’t changed. ... The only thing that had changed was politics."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jun/26/barack-obama/obama-says-dream-act-hasnt-changed-republicans-sup/	The debate over immigration was revived by President Barack Obama’s announcement of a reprieve for the children of illegal immigrants. So, too, was talk of the DREAM Act. In a speech to Hispanic elected officials in Orlando on June 22, 2012, Obama criticized Congress’ inaction on the bill. "We should have passed the DREAM Act a long time ago," he said. "It was written by members of both parties. When it came up for a vote a year and a half ago, Republicans in Congress blocked it. The bill hadn’t changed. The need hadn’t changed. The only thing that had changed was politics." We decided to check Obama’s history on the DREAM Act. The federal Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors Act pertains to children brought to the U.S. illegally by parents or relatives. If the young people have stayed out of trouble and were in school or the military, the legislation would allow them to move to legal status and not be deported. It has been proposed every year for more than a decade but never passed Congress. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, introduced the original bill in 2001, along with Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Ill. It drew 18 co-sponsors, Democrats and Republicans. Obama was correct that the legislation was written by both parties. The more recent vote he referred to took place in December 2010. The House passed the DREAM Act by 216-198. Only eight Republicans voted for it; 160 voted against. In the Senate, it could not garner the 60 votes needed to overcome a Republican filibuster and died 55-41 on Dec. 18, 2010, largely along party lines. The Republicans who voted for it were Richard Lugar, R-Indiana; Bob Bennett of Utah, who had already lost his Senate seat; and Alaska’s Lisa Murkowski, who kept hers by running as a write-in candidate after losing in the primary. But we should also note that five Democrats voted against it. Those five votes could have gotten the DREAM Act to a floor vote. So how much has it changed in all this time? Durbin’s office provided us with a list of revisions, which were made at the request of Republicans. They included: • Lowering the age cap from 35 to 30 on who could be eligible. • Specifically excluding anyone who has committed one felony or three misdemeanors; has engaged in voter fraud or marriage fraud; or has abused a student visa. • Requiring a medical exam and background check. • Requiring applicants to speak, read and write English. In other words, the changes tightened eligibility standards and made the law stricter overall, which would support Obama’s point. Roy Beck, president and founder of Numbers USA, which advocates for the interests of American workers in immigration legislation, acknowledged that changes to the law over time addressed "loopholes." "I think it’s correct there were some improvements in that area," he said. But Beck also noted that the original version of the bill set the age cap at 21. It was raised to 35 in subsequent years, then lowered back to 30. "The age limit has varied quite a bit, and that’s not small," Beck said. "How many people are you going to be adding to the workforce to compete with Americans?" Frank Sharry of America’s Voice, a group that favors comprehensive immigration reform and passage of the DREAM Act, agreed that there were "small changes" to the bill. Sharry pointed out that the age limit has been raised to accommodate immigrants who were 21 when the bill was first introduced, so they would still be eligible. He said Durbin then lowered the cap to try to attract more votes in Congress. As for the politics surrounding the bill, that has certainly changed. Some Republicans who supported the DREAM Act are no longer in the Senate or have lost primaries, including Indiana’s Richard Lugar and Bob Bennett of Utah, swept out by the tea party movement, which generally shows little tolerance for any form of amnesty and advocates deporting illegal immigrants and building a border fence. Others who supported the bill early on have now backed away, including Hatch, the original sponsor. When the Senate bill was introduced in 2011, not a single Republican signed on. Depending on your point of view, that could be good or bad. Said Beck: "They have changed their mind on some of these things, but good for them." He argues that the economic downturn was the driving force for many Republicans’ change of heart. In 2001, "we we didn’t have 20 million Americans who were unemployed or forced into part-time work," Beck said. "I think through the years as the numbers got larger, they became aware of how out of sync an amnesty like this is with high unemployment." Our ruling Obama said the DREAM Act was written by members of both parties and since then has been blocked by Republicans, even though "the bill hadn’t changed, the need hadn’t changed. The only thing that had changed was politics." The president is correct that Democrats and Republicans worked on the original bill and it had bipartisan support in Congress for several years, though never enough to pass. In 2010, most of the opposition was on the Republican side, but five Democrats helped sustain the filibuster in the Senate. And there have been minor changes to the legislation, most importantly an increase in the age cap from 21 to 30. Other revisions made the bill more restrictive, and thus in theory more appealing to conservatives. Finally, there’s no question that the political debate about immigration has evolved, with the tea party surge crowding out more moderate viewpoints and even pushing some Republicans out of office. Obama’s comment glosses over some of the details, but his statement is largely correct. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-10828	"Each year, 18,000 people die in America because they don't have health care."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/18/hillary-clinton/indeed-uninsured-people-have-higher-mortality-rate/	The full quote from Sen. Hillary Clinton's speech on her health care plan: "Each year, 18,000 people die in America because they don't have health care. Let me repeat that. Here in America, people are dying because they couldn't get the care they needed when they were sick." Clinton used the number to dramatize the need for universal coverage. The number comes from a report called "Care Without Coverage: Too Little, Too Late," produced in 2002 by the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine. The National Academy of Science is a private, nonprofit society of scholars. It was granted a charter by Congress in 1863 and has a mandate to advise the federal government on scientific and technical matters. The report found that people without health care coverage: • received less frequent or no use of cancer screening tests; • received inconsistent care for the management of chronic disease; • received fewer diagnostic and treatment services for trauma or heart attacks, and had an increased risk of death when in the hospital. The report concluded that "excess deaths among uninsured adults ages 25–64, based on a 25 percent higher mortality risk, can be estimated to be in the range of 18,000 each year." The report was independently reviewed. Its findings controlled for an individual's health insurance status as an independent variable, ruling out issues of income, for instance.

pomt-08308	"Congressman Perriello voted in lock step with Nancy Pelosi 90 percent of the time."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2010/oct/30/robert-hurt/robert-hurt-says-tom-perriello-voted-lock-step-nan/	In congressional races across the country, Republicans are trying to link Democratswith House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who has been demonized by GOP leaders. One example can be found in Virginia’s 5th Congressional District, where the Republican challenger, state Sen. Robert Hurt, has repeatedly lashed out at Democratic incumbent Rep. Tom Perriello for his alleged loyalty to the House speaker, particularly on high-profile issues. In a recent posting on Hurt’s website, his campaign lays out a "Breakdown of Congressman Perriello’s actions while in Congress." Second on the list: "Congressman Perriello voted in lockstep with Nancy Pelosi 90 percent of the time, 100 percent of the time on the signature issues that kill jobs, increase Washington’s reckless spending spree, and vastly expand the size and scope of the federal government." Having found that similar claims in other states were exaggerated, PolitiFact Virginia decided to check the assertion that Perriello voted with Pelosi 90 percent of the time. Asked for the source of the claim, Hurt’s campaign pointed to the same Washington Post congressional voting database that has been cited as the foundation for similar claims in other races. But that’s where the claim begins to stray from the truth. While that database measures the the percentage of votes on which a lawmaker agrees with the position taken by a majority of his or her party members, it does not measure how often they agree with a particular party leader. A look at the database reveals that Perriello voted with his party 90.4 percent of the time, so we set about the task of finding out how often he voted in with Pelosi specifically. Because House Speakers rarely vote, Pelosi has only cast 94 votes since the start of 2009, while Perriello has cast 1,502. So we measured the number of times Perriello has agreed with Pelosi on matters where both recorded votes. Of the 88 times, excluding procedural roll calls, where both have voted, Perriello went against Pelosi 19 times, making his true record of following the House Speaker’s lead 78.4 percent. That’s significantly lower than 90 percent. Hurt’s campaign is correct that the two voted together on some major Democratic initiatives -- the stimulus package, health care and cap and trade. But Perriello did notably dissent from Pelosi and his party on the Wall Street bailout. In fact, of Virginia’s 11 members of Congress, Perriello breaks rank more than anyone else other than Rep. Glenn Nye, a Democrat from Hampton Roads. The average party loyalty of all 444 House members on votes over the past two years is 90.6 percent, so by that measure, Perriello is typical. But he’s less faithful than the average Democrat, who votes with the party 92.2 percent of the time. Amanda Henneberg, Hurt’s spokeswoman, said voting with the Democratic Party is the equivalent of voting with Pelosi since she is the party’s House leader and has voted with her party 100 percent of the time. Furthermore, Henneberg notes that Pelosi has not missed any votes, but has chosen not to participate in the traditional sense when it didn’t matter. University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said that if the House Speaker did vote on every issue, the claim would have more truth. "A good case can be made that the recorded number is only part of the real, larger story," he said. "Our Congress today is so partisan that almost all Democrats vote together on anything important, and almost all Republicans vote the other way. The Speaker would side with her party every time ... So you don't get the full picture with the 94 recorded votes." So let’s recap. First, the Hurt campaign says Perriello voted with Pelosi 90 percent of the time, which is incorrect. He voted with his party 90 percent, but voted with Pelosi only 78.4 percent, which is significantly lower. Still, there is support for Hurt’s underlying point that Perriello votes with his party much of the time. So we find the claim Half True.

pomt-10745	"I've got the most international experience here."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/04/bill-richardson/yes-hes-got-experience-but-the-most-/	At a Democratic debate in Philadelphia on Oct. 30, Gov. Bill Richardson tried some global one-upsmanship. "I've got the most international experience here," he said. That message is a central plank in his campaign. He not only has executive experience running the state of New Mexico and 15 years in Congress, he's got foreign policy experience. (Our in-depth look at the candidates' experience can be found in our story here.) Indeed, in 1997, President Clinton appointed Richardson ambassador to the United Nations, where he stayed for 1 1/2 years. He has also, on several occasions, gone overseas to negotiate the release of American political prisoners and servicemen in North Korea, Iraq and Cuba. In 1995, he negotiated with Saddam Hussein for the release of two American hostages. And he negotiated a cease-fire, later breached, among several factions in the Darfur region of Sudan. This year, Richardson led a delegation to North Korea that included President Bush's main policy adviser on North Korea. Afterward, North Korea said it would shut its main nuclear reactor once it received $25-million frozen in a bank by sanctions. A few deadlines lapsed, but the United States is working with North Korea to remove it from Washington's list of states sponsoring terrorism as American experts prepare to disable the nation's nuclear reactor. Whether this stage of negotiations is a result of Richardson's skills as a diplomat, or if officials like U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Christopher Hill are more responsible, goes beyond the scope of our question. But this experience definitely gives him some foreign policy cred. Compare his resume against the records of most of the other Democratic candidates and he definitely has more international experience. But what about Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware? He's spent 35 years in the Senate. He's chairman of the powerful Foreign Relations Committee, a post he held following the 9/11 attacks. His proposal to divide Iraq has considerable support from people in both parties. So it's a stretch for Richardson to claim he's No. 1. We recognize he has lots of foreign policy experience, but given his brief time as U.N. ambassador and Biden's significant experience, we find Richardson's statement to be Half True.

pomt-15052	"Six of the 10 richest counties in the United States surround Washington, D.C."	true	/virginia/statements/2015/sep/29/mike-huckabee/huckabee-says-six-10-wealthiest-us-counties-surrou/	Mike Huckabee says he’s found the road to riches, and it’s called the Capital Beltway. "Six of the 10 richest counties in the United States surround Washington, D.C.," the GOP presidential candidate said during a Sept. 24 interview on "The John Fredericks Show," a Hampton Roads-based radio program. Huckabee, a former Arkansas governor, cited the statistic while contending that federal power brokers have set up a system that shields them from economic hard times. We emailed Huckabee’s campaign asking for the source of his numbers and didn’t hear back. But PolitiFact has examined variations of his statement that have been uttered by three other Republicans: Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan, former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and, most recently, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. The six-of-10 figure is a reference to the counties with the highest median household income, a widely used measure of county-wide wealth. The U.S. Census Bureau compiles the income data each year. Here are the 10 counties with the highest median income in 2013, the latest year for which figures are available: Loudoun County, Va. -- $117,680 Falls Church, Va. -- $117,452 Los Alamos County, N.M. -- $110,930 Fairfax County, Va. -- $110,658 Howard County, Md. -- $108,503 Hunterdon County, N.J -- $107,203 Douglas County, Colo. -- $105,192 Arlington County, Va. -- $101,533 Morris County, N.J. -- $99,950 Montgomery County, Md. -- $97,873 That list includes six counties -- four in Virginia and two in Maryland -- that are located outside Washington. Although Falls Church is a city, it’s treated as a county by the Census Bureau. We looked at the annual Census Bureau figures going back to 2009. In each of those years, there also were a half-dozen D.C. suburban counties that made the top 10 list of the highest median household income. It’s no secret that the federal government is the major seed of affluence in the D.C. area, sprouting high-paying government and contracting jobs. The suburbs have some of the highest education levels in the nation, according to Terry Rephann, a regional economist at the University of Virginia’s Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service. We should make a statistical note here. Median household income is the midrange point where half of the county’s households make more than the median and the other half makes less. For example, if only five families lived in a county, the median income would be that of the third highest-earning household. Not all measures rank the D.C. suburbs among the 10 richest counties. Money magazine, for example, looked at average income -- the total income in a county divided by its residents. Based on that data from 2012, none of the counties near Washington made a Money list of the 10 richest counties published last year. If you’re wondering, No. 1 in was Teton County in Wyoming. Rephann, however, told us that average income can easily be thrown off by a few extremely wealthy people living in a less populous rural county. Median income is a better way to measure the richest counties, he said. We’ll also note that while median incomes are high around Washington, that doesn’t mean everything is rosy there. Economists told us for a recent fact-check that the Virginia economy has taken a hit in recent years amid federal budget-cutting in D.C. Our ruling Huckabee said six of the 10 richest counties in the United States surround Washington, D.C. Judged by median household income -- a standard way for tracking a county’s wealth -- his statement is correct. We rate his statement True.

pomt-06372	Proposition 2 on November’s Texas ballot "does not cost state taxpayers any money."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/nov/03/H204TEXAS-PAC/Group-says-proposed-constitutional-amendment-costs/	An email blast advocating for a proposed constitutional amendment on the Nov. 8, 2011, Texas ballot says Proposition 2 will help "build critical local water supply projects that create jobs and protect us from drought and wildfire." The email from Texans 4 Prop 2, funded by the H2O4TEXAS political action committee, goes on: "This does not cost state taxpayers any money. Yes, that’s right, Prop 2 advances critical, job-creating local water projects at no cost to state taxpayers." Residents of communities benefiting from the requested $6 billion boost in bonding authority would pay such debt costs. We wondered if state taxpayers would be scot-free. The proposition, among 10 changes to the constitution placed before voters by state lawmakers, would authorize the Texas Water Development Board to issue additional general obligation bonds on a continuing basis for one or more accounts of the Texas Water Development Fund II, according to an explanatory statement from the state. According to a July 2011 House Research Organization background paper on the proposition, the bonds are "self-supporting.They require no draw on (state) general revenue," meaning revenue ponied up from state taxpayers, "but use the state’s superior credit rating to finance water and wastewater projects for public entities — including cities, districts, and nonprofit water supply corporations — at a lower interest rate than the entities could receive with other financing." To date, non-self-supporting bonds approved by lawmakers have required state revenue to cover a portion of the interest on the bonds. After asking the pro-proposition group for backup information, we interviewed Melanie Callahan, the board’s interim executive administrator, who said the reason there’s no state cost for such self-supporting bonds is that debt on the bonds is repaid by the benefiting entities. To date, she said, no jurisdictions have defaulted on such payments. Case closed? Not quite, we realized. Two analyses of the proposal -- a fiscal note written by the Legislative Budget Board when lawmakers were acting last spring and a description of the ballot proposal by the Texas Legislative Council, which helps legislators draft proposals -- state that Proposition 2 allows legislators to appropriate money to pay debt service on the bonds. If so, we surmised, any such appropriation would pose a cost to state taxpayers. Generally, the fiscal note says, the proposed amendment has no "significant fiscal implication to the state... other than the cost of publication" on the ballot, $105,495. However, the note says, the proposal "includes bond authority that would comprise a mixture of self-supporting debt and non-self-supporting debt," meaning debt not covered by the benefiting jurisdictions repaying the state. "Any non-self-supporting debt that receives a General Revenue appropriation for debt service," the note says, "would impact the state's constitutional debt limit," meaning it would be a cost to the state and its taxpayers. The note continues by saying the water-development board can only issue such non-self-supporting debt with legislative authorization. The council’s analysis includes similar language. In interviews, a board staff spokesman, John Barton, and the council’s chief legislative counsel, Jeff Archer, each said the reference to legislators subsidizing debt payments reflects the established constitutional authority of Texas legislatures to appropriate money. Archer said the ballot proposition might pose "little to no risk to the state revenue. That doesn’t mean there’s no risk," meaning a future Legislature could supplement related debt payments by tapping state revenue. We checked back with the water development board. General Counsel Ken Petersen said that under the constitution, lawmakers have full power to manage the board’s financing activities by changing state law and appropriating state revenue for any purpose, including debt payments. Proposition 2 alone "does not cost state taxpayer money at all," Petersen said. "What could cost (taxpayer) money is what the people who get elected to the Legislature (in the future) choose to do... That is a choice the Legislature makes." Callahan told us lawmakers have done so before in situations when debt payments by benefiting communities would not flow quickly enough to the state to satisfy terms. More than $1.7 billion in board-overseen general-obligation bonds outstanding as of Aug. 31, 2011 consisted of $1.2 billion in self-supporting bonds, with debt not paid by state taxpayers, and nearly $528 million in non-self-supporting bonds for which legislators voted to pick up a portion of debt service, at a cost to state taxpayers, she said by email. Most recently, Callahan said, the water board got legislative permission this spring to convert $24.5 million in self-supporting bonds for the San Antonio Water System to build a brackish water desalination project into non-self-supporting bonds, with a portion of interest on the bonds consequently being paid from state revenue. "The Legislature's direction to issue non-self-supporting debt has been more prevalent in the last few years in order to help fund state water plan projects, in the absence of a dedicated funding source" for such projects, Callahan said. Of about $512 million in debt service paid by the water development board from 2008 through August 2011, about $101 million, or 20 percent, came from legislative appropriations, Callahan said, with benefiting jurisdictions covering the rest. The treasurer of the H2O4TEXAS PAC, Heather Harward, agreed that future Legislatures could spend general revenue to cover the debt service on the non-self-supporting bonds envisioned in the ballot proposal. "But as of today, based on the will of the (2011) Legislature and the direction provided to lawmakers by Texans, the bonds are completely self-supporting," Harward said by email. She added that the proposal "does not encumber any state funds." We’re ready to cash out: The group's claim sidesteps the fact that taxpayers of jurisdictions benefiting from the bonds will face bond-related costs. And while the additional bond authority sought in the proposition would not cost state taxpayers--up front--state lawmakers could still exploit their standing authority, as before, to spend state revenue on related debt. This possibility is unacknowledged in the group’s claim, which we rate Half True.	None	H204TEXAS PAC	None	None	None	2011-11-03T06:00:00	2011-10-24	['Texas']
pomt-04041	"When George Bush became president of the United States, 17 million people were in poverty. When he left, 30 million people were in poverty."	false	/ohio/statements/2013/jan/30/marcia-fudge/rep-marcia-fudge-says-30-million-people-were-pover/	As a member of Congress who represents an urban area with many low-income residents, Warrensville Heights Democratic Rep. Marcia Fudge has made fighting poverty one of her legislative priorities in Congress, as well as a priority of the Congressional Black Caucus she recently began to chair. On Jan. 17. Fudge joined a George Washington University panel discussion on poverty that was hosted by PBS’ Tavis Smiley. Other panelists included outspoken Union Theological Seminary professor Cornel West and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, a recent Republican candidate for president. During the discussion, Fudge decried efforts to balance the federal budget by cutting aid to the poor. She argued that many of the nation’s fiscal problems were caused by two wars in the Middle East, the creation of the Medicare Part D program, and tax cuts implemented by President George W. Bush. In an effort to point out that increased needs for social service programs did not begin under President Barack Obama, Fudge said that "When George Bush became president of the United States, 17 million people were in poverty. When he left, 30 million people were in poverty." When Smiley pointed out that poverty continued to worsen during Obama’s presidency, Fudge agreed. She said neither party has done enough to fight poverty, but health care reform legislation Obama passed "significantly" helped poor people, as did money in the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act for programs like Head Start, Pell Grants, food stamps, and unemployment insurance. She argued problems would be worse if Obama hadn’t taken those steps. PolitiFact has periodically examined claims about poverty in the United States. The poverty numbers that Fudge cited for the Bush presidency actually sounded low to us, so we asked her office where she got them. Fudge spokeswoman Belinda Prinz replied that Fudge - the top Democrat on the House Agriculture Subcommittee that oversees the Supplemental Nutritional Assistance Program (also known as food stamps) used statistics on the number of people using SNAP benefits during Bush’s presidency instead of numbers that described those living in poverty. She said poverty and SNAP numbers both rose during Bush’s presidency, though they didn’t increase at identical rates. SNAP benefits, with some exceptions, are available to people with incomes up to 130% of the poverty line and thus can be used to aid the near poor, including the working poor, as well as anyone classified below the poverty line, said Prinz. "It was unintentional to describe SNAP data as poverty data," Prinz’s email said. Prinz forwarded material from the U.S. Department of Agriculture that indicated 17.3 million people used food stamps when Bush took office in 2001 and that 28.2 million used them during 2008, his last year in office. By 2012, USDA figures show the number of people using the SNAP program rose to 46.6 million people. Prinz also sent a report from the Food Research and Action Center that said food stamp participation topped 31.7 million people during Bush’s last month in office, December 2008. A Congressional Budget Office report on the food stamp program attributes the dramatic rise in the program’s use to "the deep recession from December 2007 to June 2009 and the subsequent slow recovery." As Fudge’s office said, poverty rates and food stamp usage both rose during the terms of Presidents Bush and Obama. Census data shows that in 2001, the year President Bush took office, 32.9 million people - or 11.7 percent of the U.S. population - lived below the poverty level. During Bush’s last year in office, 2008, 39.8 million people or 13.2 percent of the population lived below the poverty line. By 2011 - well into Obama’s term - there were 46.2 million impoverished people, a 15 percent rate of poverty. The point that Fudge was trying to make - that poverty rose under the presidency of George Bush - is correct. But singling out Bush is misleading because poverty also has gone up under Obama. And her numbers were incorrect. Her substitution of SNAP numbers for poverty data led her to significantly understate the number of people living in poverty. We rule her statement False.

pomt-08439	Says Texas has so few gas-pump inspectors in the field, "the HEBs of this state, the Brookshires of this state, they're calibrating their own gas pumps. The (Texas Department of Agriculture) just sends them the stickers and they calibrate them."	false	/texas/statements/2010/oct/18/hank-gilbert/hank-gilbert-pitching-reorganization-state-agency-/	Hank Gilbert, the Democratic nominee for state agriculture commissioner, has hammered incumbent Todd Staples, a Republican, on many fronts, including his agency's performance inspecting gas pumps to make sure they work right. PolitiFact Texas just checked his September claim that pumps in each of the state's five Texas Department of Agriculture regions lack required state stickers or have stickers that are out of date. We rated that statement Half True. But today's venture into the state's vast span o' pumps was touched off by an Aug. 20 press release from Staples' campaign bringing to light a video of Gilbert at the Central Texas Democratic Forum on Jan. 11--yes, January. That's when he told the Dems that he'd fire about half the agriculture department's employees at headquarters in order to hire "people to put in the field because that's where we need it. Because right now we have so little people in the field, the HEBs of this state, the Brookshires of this state, they're calibrating their own gas pumps. The TDA just sends them the stickers and they calibrate them. So we literally do have the fox guarding the hen house. That's got to stop." We wondered how such a dramatic statement had slipped past us. Has anyone else noticed that the state sends stickers to stores that calibrate their own pumps? Are things that cozy? Responding to our query, Gilbert's campaign manager, Vince Leibowitz, said in an e-mail that both HEB and Brookshire independently have their gas pumps certified between state inspections. Per Gilbert's statement that the agriculture department "sends them the stickers," Leibowitz said Gilbert wasn't referring to the state inspection seals, which he said can only be affixed by agency employees. Leibowitz said Gilbert meant "independent inspector" stickers--again, not the same as state stickers--which he said Gilbert has seen on Brookshire pumps in East Texas. However, Leibowitz said, "to our knowledge, TDA does not send out those stickers. Hank misspoke." Asked if Gilbert subsequently issued a correction or retraction, Leibowitz replied by e-mail that "someone approached him after this to talk to him about it, and he clarified what he intended to say. He has since not similarly misspoken and has talked about gas pumps dozens and dozens of times on the stump." Hot on this sticker trail, we checked with the Texas Department of Agriculture whose spokesman, Bryan Black, said its inspectors are the only personnel authorized to inspect a fuel pump and apply its "weights and measure seal. That is the law and that is our policy." Stores of all sizes must calibrate their pumps by using registered service technicians, licensed by the TDA, Black said. State law requires each pump to be inspected every four years, he said, though since 2007, the average time between inspections has been 2.6 years. A TDA Web page says the department has 72 weights and measures inspectors throughout the state checking more than 65,000 fuel pumps a year. Leibowitz said Gilbert foresees eliminating various agency positions and using the savings to hire more field inspectors, but that it's "inappropriate and premature" to detail those plans. Next, we queried HEB and Brookshire about their gas pumps. Both told us they contract the calibration of their pumps to outside vendors. Explained Sam Anderson, spokesman for the Tyler-based Brookshire Grocery Company: "If they pass (state) inspection, the Department of Agriculture provides their stickers. If we are not compliant, we have to have our service provider come back out to fix them. Then the department comes back out." In a follow-up e-mail, Anderson said the grocery store does not have its own certification stickers on its approximately 400 dispensers. So, how does the meter swing on Gilbert's statement? Stores do indeed calibrate their gas pumps--by using state-certified technicians. But Gilbert leaves the impression this practice is new and nefarious -- and a substitute for state inspections. It's not. Also, as Gilbert's campaign acknowledged to us, his statement that the state sends stickers to stores simply isn't so. Gilbert may have only said this to a single audience. Regardless, his claim--which was never corrected publicly--incorrectly suggests wrongdoing, and state complicity in that wrongdoing. On the Truth-O-Meter, that's fuel enough to rate False.

pomt-14082	Says Patrick Murphy "switched his vote on All Aboard Florida ... because his father tried to get in a bid to build it and was unsuccessful."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2016/may/18/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-lacks-evidence-accusation-about-patri/	U.S. Senate candidate Alan Grayson dismissed a New York Times story about his hedge fund as "full of s---" in a sit-down with CBS4’s Jim Defede, a reaction so wrong his own campaign corrected him on the facts. But that wasn’t the only attack in the interview that ran off the rails. Grayson called rival Patrick Murphy a "walking, talking crook" and zeroed in on Murphy’s wealthy businessman father, another focal point in the race between the two Democratic congressmen running for Sen. Marco Rubio’s seat. Grayson accused Murphy of flip-flopping on the passenger rail project when it snubbed a bid from builder Thomas P. Murphy Jr., owner of Coastal Construction Group. Murphy "switched his vote on All Aboard Florida and tried to destroy the program -- the only Democrat in the entire country who voted to destroy the All Aboard Florida program -- because his father tried to get in a bid to build it and was unsuccessful," Grayson said May 15. "So he went from being in favor of the program to being against the program. That’s certainly using your congressional influence. He tried to kill the entire program -- the only Democrat to do so -- because his father didn't get a contract out of it." Did Murphy really flip-flop on votes for All Aboard Florida after his father’s company lost its bid? There is no dispute that Murphy initially supported the rail project and later opposed it. There is dispute, however, over why he did it. Murphy’s campaign argues that he came out against the project as he learned more about it and heard community opposition. Grayson, who supports All Aboard Florida, points to more nefarious reasons, but he doesn’t prove his charge that it was connected to Murphy’s dad’s business. There’s also an issue with Grayson’s wording about flip-flopped "votes." There were two votes in Congress related to the financing, but Murphy consistently voted no on those votes. The Grayson campaign acknowledged to PolitiFact Florida that Murphy changed his "support" for the project, but not his votes. Coastal Construction’s role All Aboard Florida is a $3 billion passenger rail line that will connect Miami, Fort Lauderdale and West Palm Beach in 2017, with plans to extend it to Orlando. The owners applied for a $1.6 billion federal loan to supplement private financing but later put that request on hold. All Aboard Florida’s federal application for $1.75 billion in tax-exempt bonding authority was approved. (The state is also kicking in some money connected to the project.) An All Aboard Florida spokeswoman declined to comment about Coastal Construction’s interest. Coastal Construction along with a joint venture partner, Tishman Construction, had preliminary conversations with All Aboard Florida from October 2012 until the fall of 2013 but never submitted a bid, said Dan Whiteman, Coastal Construction vice chairman. "In early December of 2013, it was decided to no longer pursue the project," Whiteman wrote. "All Aboard Florida was advised in mid-December 2013 that we were not going to proceed any further in discussions, and we never submitted a response to their request for proposals to build the project." Asked why Coastal declined to bid on the project, Whiteman said: "Other projects came available and were starting more quickly." Whiteman said that Coastal Construction had no conversations with Rep. Murphy about the project. A spokesman for Murphy's campaign, Joshua Karp, agreed with that point. Murphy changed his stance Murphy supported All Aboard Florida in the fall of 2013 when it benefited from a $13.75 million federal grant. The state applied for the grant to improve connectivity between multiple rail operators including All Aboard Florida. "I'm a proud supporter of infrastructure projects that generate jobs and stimulate long-term economic growth just as this rail project will," Murphy said in a Sept. 13, 2013, news release. In October 2013, Murphy was one of 16 Florida members to sign a letter to U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx praising the project. They wrote it had "potential to modernize and upgrade a busy transportation corridor" and provide an economic boost. But by the spring of 2014, local opposition had grown due to fears about noise and other impacts. Resolutions from local governments and groups, such as Indian River County, the city of Port St. Lucie and the village of Tequesta, started to pile up. Ultimately, 60,000 people signed a petition against it. Murphy, who faced re-election, hopped on board the opposition train. He won his race. In March 2014, Murphy sought a meeting with Foxx to discuss constituent concerns. By April, he was an adamant opponent. In a letter to Foxx, Murphy wrote that the rail line would likely "delay emergency vehicles, create traffic jams, raise noise pollution and block waterways." Over the next several months, Murphy contacted federal and state officials, sought public hearings as well as a federal study in an effort to quash the rail line. Murphy’s changed stance drew media attention. Murphy’s chief of staff, Eric Johnson, told the TC Palm that initially the project drew local support because of the economic benefits. "But since then," Johnson is quoted as saying, "with everything (Murphy) learns, the more information he gets, the less he likes it. The more he learns, he sours on this project more." (Murphy campaign spokeswoman Galia Slayen provided a similar explanation for this fact-check.) K.C. Ingram Traylor, leader of the opposition group Florida Not All Aboard, told PolitiFact Florida, "As the facts about All Aboard Florida came to light, Rep. Murphy intelligently took another look at the project and strongly opposed it." Murphy’s votes A spokesman for Grayson, David Damron, initially argued that Grayson had specified Murphy switched his "support" and not his vote. But after PolitiFact Florida sent Damron the transcript and CBS4 video, Damron acknowledged that Grayson errantly mentioned votes. Congress didn’t get an up-or-down vote on the project. However, there were two votes on amendments offered by U.S. Rep. Bill Posey, R-Rockledge, to an appropriations bill about financing. Murphy was the lone Democrat to vote in favor of the two amendments to ban funds for the project. One amendment banned funds in general, and the other banned tax-exempt bonds. Both amendments failed by wide margins on June 9, 2015. Our ruling Grayson says Murphy "switched his vote on All Aboard Florida ... because his father tried to get in a bid to build it and was unsuccessful." There is one kernel of truth here: Murphy did switch his position on the rail project. But he did not switch his votes, which were consistently against funding for it. Murphy said he switched his vote because of community blowback to the rail project, and not as a result of his father’s business dealings. The onus is on Grayson to prove that Murphy flip-flopped because his father didn’t get a contract out of it, and he did not prove his case. The entities involved are private, which makes primary documents hard to obtain. Coastal Construction’s vice chairman said the company had preliminary talks with the private rail project but did not file a bid.

pomt-07408	"90 percent of babies with Down syndrome are aborted."	true	/florida/statements/2011/apr/28/richard-corcoran/rep-richard-corcoran-says-90-percent-prenatal-down/	Editor's note: On Feb. 27, 2012, we rated a similar claim -- phrased slightly differently -- by presidential candidate Rick Santorum and ruled it Half True. To see that ruling, click here. The use of statistics dominated a daylong debate over six abortion bills in the Florida House of Representatives on April 27, 2011. The bills, which passed the House and are being heard in the Senate, include a broader ban on third-term abortions, tighter requirements for notifying parents when a minor seeks an abortion, and a mandate that women be offered an opportunity to view and hear a description of ultrasound images before receiving an abortion. Another bill seeks to amend the state Constitution to prevent possible state funding of most abortion procedures. Among all the stats used in nearly six hours of floor speeches, one stood out. It came from Republican Rep. Richard Corcoran of New Port Richey and caught the attention of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates on Twitter. The group posted a message that said Corcoran claimed that "90 percent of babies with Down syndrome are aborted." "PolitiFact anyone?" the group asked. We heard it, too, and spoke with Corcoran after the House adjourned. He said he found it in a couple of different places, including in a New York Times story. Corcoran's point was that we, as Americans, have to do more to try to prevent abortion. But is he right about the high percentage of abortion in these cases? Sure enough, we found the Times article Corcoran was referencing. The article from 2007 discussed how effective prenatal testing to detect Down syndrome could reduce the number of children born with the genetic condition, and how parents of children with Down syndrome were trying to convince others not to abort fetuses that tested positive for the condition. The story included almost the same line that Corcoran used -- that "about 90 percent of pregnant women who are given a Down syndrome diagnosis have chosen to have an abortion." The line was not sourced, meaning the story did not say specifically where it came from. However, the online version did include a link to an abstract of a medical study discussing abortion rates after a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. The study is from 1999 by the Psychology and Genetics Research Group at King's College in London. It compiled 20 other studies measuring abortion rates and concluded that, following a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome, 92 percent of women chose to have an abortion. We searched and found other studies that show similar percentages. A study from researchers at Wayne State University in Michigan examined the cases of 145 pregnancies with a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome from 1988-97. The study found that 19 (13.1 percent) women chose continuation of the pregnancy, while 126 (86.9 percent) chose termination. Another study examined 131 prenatally diagnosed cases of Down syndrome in Hawaii from 1987-96. The study found that women in 110 of those cases (84 percent) chose to have their pregnancies terminated. That's three different medical studies, all reaching similar conclusions. Similar statistics were referenced in two books we found about prenatal testing (here and here). We asked the Guttmacher Institute, an independent research organization that analyzes data on population growth and reproductive health, if we should be aware of any other data. Spokeswoman Rebecca Wind said she didn't know of anything else. That leaves us to rely on these studies, which have been cited by subsequent researchers. Corcoran said that "90 percent of babies with Down syndrome are aborted." Though the exact numbers vary slightly, the studies back him up. We rate this statement True.

pomt-13925	"The LGBT community is more often the victims of hate crimes than any other recognized group."	true	/florida/statements/2016/jun/23/loretta-lynch/loretta-lynch-says-gays-and-lesbians-are-most-freq/	The Orlando shooting massacre at the Pulse gay nightclub that led to the deaths of 49 victims has led to more national attention about hate crimes targeting the gay community. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch spoke about the attack hours later on Fox News Sunday. "I think we have to keep our eye on a larger picture here, which is the victims of this crime were from a community that is often marginalized and that, frankly, the LGBT community is more often the victims of hate crimes than any other recognized group," she said. Lynch is correct if we examine per capita rates for hate crimes, although there are some caveats about the data -- mainly that there are gaps in how law enforcement reports hate crimes. The FBI defines hate crimes as "criminal offenses motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias against" a particular group such as a religion, race or sexual orientation. Data on hate crimes A spokesman for Lynch said she was referring to an analysis by the New York Times published days after the Orlando shooting. Using data from the FBI and the U.S. Census, the newspaper compared hate crimes per capita in two years: 2005 and 2014. The newspaper found "L.G.B.T. people are twice as likely to be targeted as African-Americans, and the rate of hate crimes against them has surpassed that of crimes against Jews." Mark Potok, an expert on extremism at the Southern Poverty Law Center, did a similar analysis of 14 years of hate crime data in 2011. He found that LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) people are far more likely than other minority groups to be victimized by violent hate crimes. Potok examined the percentage of the population represented by these groups: LGBT, Jews, blacks, Muslims, Latinos and whites. Then he compiled the total number of hate crimes against persons (excluding crimes against property) between 1995 and 2008. Then he compared the level of hate crime aimed at each group to the group’s percentage in the population to determine the rate of victimization. He found that LGBT people were victimized at 8.3 times the expected rate. Jews were victimized at 3.5 times the expected rate, blacks at 3.2 times, Muslims at 1.9 times, Latinos at 0.6 times, and whites at 0.2 times. An important caveat: There are several holes in the reporting of hate crimes to the FBI. Local law enforcement agencies voluntarily report their data to a state agency that compiles the information for the FBI. Some local agencies report no hate crimes or don’t submit a report. A study by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics found that 60 percent of violent hate crime victimizations were not reported to police in 2012. A 2016 Associated Press investigation found that more than 2,700 city police and county sheriff's departments have not submitted a single hate crime report to the FBI during the past six years — about 17 percent of all city and county law enforcement agencies nationwide. Among the agencies that reported zero hate crimes in 2014 were several major cities, including Jacksonville, Miami and Tampa. Another way to look at the data about hate crimes rather than per capita is the sheer number of crimes. By that measure, there were more hate crimes against African-Americans than LGBT residents. But that’s not surprising since African-Americans represent about 13.2 percent of the population according to the U.S. Census, while the LGBT community represents about 2.3 percent of the population, according to a survey done by the Centers for Disease Control (other surveys found a slightly higher rate.) Why would LGBT be victimized at a higher rate Answering the question as to why the LGBT community would be victimized at a higher rate is more complex. Some of the crime, paradoxically, may be motivated by more widespread acceptance of gay rights. "We are seeing lots more gay people getting married," said Jack Levin, a sociologist at Northeastern University and expert on hate crimes. "I think what hate crimes represent is a reaction to that." Some are motivated by fear. "There is a visceral hatred against LGBT people in large part connected to fears about sexuality," Potok said. "Sexuality is an incredibly fraught topic for some people and especially those people who fear they might have same-sex attraction themselves." Law enforcement is still investigating the Orlando shooting, but based on information so far, experts said that the shooter appeared to be motivated in part by bigotry and self-loathing. Omar Mateen, who was married to a woman, regularly visited the gay nightclub and used gay dating apps, according to reports by patrons at the club. Our ruling Lynch said, "The LGBT community is more often the victims of hate crimes than any other recognized group." It’s worth noting that there may be widespread underreporting of hate crime incidents in general. However, the best available research shows that the LGBT community is victimized at a higher rate than other minority groups, according to FBI data.

pomt-01802	"We are 49th in the nation for our graduation rate"	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2014/jul/23/dennis-richardson/does-oregon-rank-49th-nation-its-high-school-gradu/	Oregon Rep. Dennis Richardson, R-Central Point, hopes to unseat Democratic incumbent Gov. John Kitzhaber in November’s general election. The two met in their first debate July 18, during which Kitzhaber portrayed himself as a problem-solver who works effectively across the aisle. Richardson pointed to problems with the doomed Columbia River Crossing bridge project and the disastrous rollout of Cover Oregon, the state’s health insurance exchange. The claim: Richardson, in assessing Kitzhaber’s record in office, singled out failures of the state’s educational system. "We are 49th in the nation for our graduation rate," he said. Is Oregon nearly at the bottom of the barrel when it comes to U.S. high school graduation rates? PolitiFact Oregon checked. The analysis: We emailed the Richardson campaign, which sent us a link to a Feb. 7, 2014, article by Betsy Hammond, the state education reporter for The Oregonian. The article’s headline: "Oregon’s high school graduation rate second-worst in nation." The results, from the high school class of 2012, taken from the 2011-12 school year, showed Oregon’s rate above only Nevada’s when it came to our "regulatory adjusted cohort graduation rate"; that is, the percentage of students who entered the ninth grade in 2008-09 and graduated on time four years later in June 2012. The numbers came from the U.S. Department of Education’s second-ever compilation of comparable state-by-state graduation rates. For 2012, the numbers show, Nevada ranked dead last, at 63 percent, with Oregon next-worst, at 68 percent. Iowa topped the list, with an 89 percent four-year graduation rate.But three states, Idaho, Kentucky and Oklahoma, did not submit their rates, saying they lacked the ability to track all students. So Oregon was actually No. 46 out of 47 states, not No. 49. If the three other states had submitted their rates, it’s conceivable that Oregon could have climbed anywhere from one to three spots higher. For the class of 2011, Oregon’s graduation was fourth-worst among the same 47 states, according to data from the U.S. Department of Education’s National Center for Education Statistics. By in 2011-12, New Mexico and Georgia surged ahead, leaving the Beaver State a step from the basement. We called Crystal Greene, communications director for the Oregon Department of Education, who said that while the four-year rate is the gold standard, other measures exist. Those include five-year programs that allow students to remain enrolled in high school while attending community colleges, "modified" diplomas for special education students, diplomas awarded to adults, and GEDs. Including students who received modified diplomas and GEDs, she said, takes Oregon’s "completer rate" to 80 percent. But, she said, official state reports on graduation rates don’t include those numbers. The Oregonian has also found that outcomes for students who earn GEDs, in particular, are far worse than those for high school graduates, meaning the credentials are far from equivalent. Still, she acknowledged that the four-year rate -- considered by both state and federal education officials as the correct way to measure graduation rates nationally -- places Oregon near the bottom. The ruling: State Rep. Dennis Richardson, in taking on Gov. John Kitzhaber, stated during a recent debate that Oregon ranks 49th in high school graduation rates. He based the number on a news story that looked at state-by-state numbers for the 2011-12 school year from the U.S. Department of Education. The story’s headline said Oregon had the nation’s "second-worst" rate. That’s correct. But because only 47 states submitted data, it’s incorrect to say Oregon came in 49th. Richardson’s claim is close but needs clarification. We rate the claim Mostly True. Thoughts on this PolitiFact Oregon piece? Go to OregonLive.com/politics to leave your comments.

pomt-14635	"I am the only candidate on either side who has laid out a specific plan about what I would do to defeat ISIS."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jan/27/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-wrong-say-shes-only-candidate-lay-/	National security has been something of a double-edged sword for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton during the 2016 campaign. Clinton amassed extensive international experience during four years as President Barack Obama’s secretary of state, but because of this, opponents can charge that she shoulders some of the blame for ongoing difficulties overseas. During a speech in Burlington, Iowa, on Jan. 20, 2016, Clinton argued that on foreign policy, she was the only candidate to offer a thorough, detailed vision for the future. "We know one threat we have to face right now, and that's from ISIS," Clinton said, referring to the group also known as the Islamic State. "And I am the only candidate on either side who has laid out a specific plan about what I would do to defeat ISIS." Hillary Clinton addressing a crowd in Burlington, Iowa, on Jan. 20, 2016. Clinton’s claim didn’t sound right to us because we’ve heard many candidates describe how they would take on the terrorist group. In fact-checking her statement, we aren’t taking a stance on the quality of her plan, or the other candidates’ plans, only the degree to which a candidate has laid one out. Our research found that Clinton’s plan is a bit lengthier and more detailed than the other ones we were able to locate. But she is hardly the only one to lay out a specific plan. The following table provides a rundown of the Democratic and Republican campaigns for which we found either a candidate’s speech addressing how to combat ISIS or an "issues" section of their campaign website that summarizes their views. If we found that the candidate offered both a speech and an issues Web page, we have analyzed the longer of the two. We were unable to find a written proposal for every candidate, so the list does not cover the entire field. But putting Clinton’s statement to the Truth-O-Meter only requires us to determine whether any candidate has laid out a "specific plan." The table shows the number of words in each candidate’s ISIS proposal and our count of how many individual agenda items were included in each proposal. Candidate Party Source Words in ISIS proposal Individual agenda items Hillary Clinton Democrat Speech 3,816 24 Jeb Bush Republican Speech 3,195 9 Bernie Sanders Democrat Speech 1,204 7 Marco Rubio Republican Web page 718 18 John Kasich Republican Speech 705 11 Martin O’Malley Democrat Speech 522 6 Ben Carson Republican Web page 429 7 Carly Fiorina Republican Speech 373 5 The table indicates that at least seven other candidates, Republicans and Democrats alike, have offered plans, ranging from five to 18 agenda items in length. (You can scroll through them all here.) Notably, many of the points in Clinton’s plan appear in at least one other candidate’s plan, and often in several other candidates’ plans. They include stronger intelligence, more intensive airstrikes, the use of ground forces, improved cooperation with allies, more effective restrictions on terrorist financing, and better efforts to counter ISIS recruiting on the Internet. For instance, increased intelligence-sharing appears in plans not only from Clinton but also from Sanders, Rubio, Kasich and Fiorina. A greater role for Middle East allies was mentioned not just by Clinton but in one form or another by Bush, Sanders, Rubio, Kasich, O'Malley, Carson and Fiorina. Indeed, of the 24 agenda points we isolated from Clinton’s plan, we found just five that appeared to be only in her plan. They were passage of an updated authorization to use military force; curbing corruption among Middle East governments; securing loose nuclear material and chemical and biological weapons; improvements in airline-security techniques; and greater effort to ease the humanitarian crisis of refugees from the region. Meanwhile, elements of Rubio’s plans were at least somewhat unique: "engage in global ideological pushback by exposing ISIS’s war crimes and sex trafficking and recruiting disaffected former members to tell their stories," and "counter ISIS recruitment and propaganda by broadcasting U.S. victories, showing the world that ISIS is not invincible." Bush, for his part, was the only candidate to specifically cite Canada’s practice of embedding in Iraqi units as a model, since it is being done "to a very good effect," Bush said. When we contacted Clinton’s campaign for evidence, they pointed to several plaudits in the media for the comprehensiveness of her anti-ISIS plan. For instance, CNN reported that "Michael Desch, an expert in international security at Notre Dame University, said that Clinton's speech was polished and showed her to be ‘head and shoulders’ above Republican candidates on framing an anti-ISIS strategy." And the New York Times’ David Brooks wrote, "While other candidates are content to issue vague calls to get tough on terror, Clinton offered a multilayered but coherent framework, not only dealing with ISIS but also putting that threat within the crosscutting conflicts that are inflaming the Middle East." However, Clinton’s statement in Iowa wasn’t about whether her plan was an effective one; it was that it was the only "specific plan" in the entire field of candidates. And that’s clearly not the case. Our ruling Clinton said, "I am the only candidate on either side who has laid out a specific plan about what I would do to defeat ISIS." While Clinton’s plan is more detailed, by some measurements, than those of other candidates, at least seven other candidates in both parties have released multi-point plans for taking on ISIS. Some plans -- such as those from Bush and Rubio -- approach Clinton’s in either length or degree of detail. In fact, there’s a significant degree of overlap between the agenda items in Clinton’s plan and in plans released by other candidates. We don’t see strong evidence for Clinton’s claim that she’s the only member of the 2016 field with a "specific plan." We rate the claim False.

pomt-01575	Says Democratic Senate candidate "Bruce Braley voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare to support Obamacare."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/09/national-republican-senatorial-committee/gop-ad-says-bruce-braley-voted-cut-700-billion-med/	Some political talking points just never die. Like this one, used in a recent ad aired by the National Republican Senatorial Committee in the hotly contested Iowa Senate race between Democratic Rep. Bruce Braley and Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst. "Bruce Braley voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare to support Obamacare," the ad says. "That’s just not fair. We paid in. We paid for it. That should be there for us." Here, we’re going to look at the claim that Braley "voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare to support Obamacare." (In a separate item, we’ll look at the second half of the claim.) It’s correct that Braley, as a House member, voted for the Affordable Care Act in 2010. However, PolitiFact has been skeptical of numerous previous claims that Obamacare cuts Medicare, rating them either Half True or Mostly False, depending on how they are worded. Other fact-checkers have concluded similarly. The claim is too sweeping and doesn’t convey fully what the law is doing. Here’s the gist. As Congress was debating President Barack Obama’s health care law in 2010, its backers acted to fend off one line of criticism -- that the bill was a budget-buster -- by making sure the bill didn’t add to the deficit. To do this, they wrote into the law both new taxes and new savings. Among the spending cuts were measures aimed at reducing the increase in future Medicare costs. When the law was passed, the reductions amounted to $500 billion over the following 10 years; eventually, as the 10-year budget window shifted a year or two into the future, the cost of these reductions rose to more than $700 billion. Over 10 years, the combined reductions are estimated to be $415 billion for traditional Medicare, $156 billion for the managed-care option known as Medicare Advantage, $56 billion in payments to teaching hospitals that serve large low-income populations, and $114 billion in other categories, according to a Congressional Budget Office estimate. But it’s important to note a few caveats. First, while the ad implies that the law is slicing Medicare benefits, these are not cuts to current services. Rather, as Medicare spending continues to rise over the next 10 years, it will do so at a slower pace would have occurred without the law. So claims that Obama would "cut" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. Second, the savings are focused on lowering payments to hospitals and insurance companies. They are not aimed at beneficiaries. For instance, the law makes significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers that serves roughly 30 percent of Medicare beneficiaries. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But in recent years the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to participating health plans. Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care. Does this mean that no senior citizen today would be harmed by the law’s passage? No. It’s possible that some beneficiaries, including Medicare Advantage participants, could see additional costs passed along to them, experience reductions in services, or find fewer doctors willing to treat them under Medicare. For instance, Brook Hougesen, the NRSC’s press secretary, pointed to news coverage in Iowa about how 9,200 state residents, "many of them in rural areas of the state," had to choose a new Medicare Advantage plan to avoid losing coverage on Jan. 1, 2014. The shifts were prompted by some Medicare Advantage plans’ determination that they could not provide the minimum number of health care providers in thinly populated areas to satisfy Medicare Advantage rules. Still, there’s a lot of uncertainty about the extent and scope of these cutbacks -- more than the ad lets on. Also, the ad ignores some of the benefits seniors will get from the law -- for instance, $48 billion over 10 years for Medicare Part D prescription coverage from the ACA’s provisions that targeted the so-called "donut hole." It also funds illness prevention benefits and expands preventive care benefits. We asked Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid for President George H.W. Bush, whether subsequent changes in the law’s implementation would undercut our previous skepticism about claims like those made against Braley, and she said they did not. The prior critiques of the claim "remain relevant," she said. Our ruling The ad says, "Bruce Braley voted to cut $700 billion from Medicare to support Obamacare." The law does include cost savings that could impact some beneficiaries, such as Medicare Advantage participants. But the ad overlooks some key nuances. The statement that suggests that the law is reducing benefits now, across the board, but it’s actually reducing the future growth of Medicare spending. The law also targets these reductions at health-care providers, not beneficiaries. And the ad ignores new spending from the law that would benefit Medicare beneficiaries, such as expanded coverage for prescriptions. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate the NRSC’s statement Half True.

pomt-03159	Says Gov. Scott Walker "hasn't done a public event this entire year."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2013/sep/08/chris-larson/scott-walker-hasnt-done-any-public-events-2013-dem/	Gov. Scott Walker has so cocooned himself from regular folks, state Senate Minority Leader Chris Larson contends, that he "hasn't done a public event in this entire year." Wait, what? Larson made the statement Aug. 27, 2013, on Madison-area radio station WEKZ-FM (93.7), then quickly told liberal talk show host John Sylvester what he meant. "Just to be clear, Sly. His events, they're open to press, donors and for invited guests. I wouldn't consider that a public event," Larson said. "A public event, I would consider something where folks, the working class, can actually make it, where it's not working hours and it's something where it's not invite-only." So, the Milwaukee Democrat has his own idea of what constitutes a public event, although we’re not bound by that definition in rating his claim. Narrow definition When we asked Larson to back his statement, he elaborated by saying that, besides being open without invitation and held outside of regular working hours, a public event should allow ordinary citizens to express opinions to or ask questions of the governor, he said. But that’s not evidence of what Larson said in the interview and it’s an even more narrow definition of public event. By that definition, most meetings of legislative committees -- typically scheduled during business hours -- are not "public events." And it suggests that when the governor visits a factory or business and talks to workers, it shouldn’t count simply because someone off the street couldn’t walk in and participate. So, Larson doesn’t exactly back off his claim. He just aims to shift it to more favorable terms for himself. Larson also pointed to a series of public hearings he held on evenings and weekends on the 2013-’15 state budget, saying Walker has appeared at no such events this year. There's no question that access to the governor -- really, any governor -- is limited. Walker typically gives a day’s notice to news media of what some of his appearances will be the following day. Indeed, he doesn't release detailed daily itineraries until weeks after the fact, a practice followed by Walker’s predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle, for most of his time as governor. Yet, just a few weeks before Larson made his claim, there was Walker addressing folks along with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat, to open the Wisconsin State Fair, and attending the Governor’s Red, White and Blue Ribbon Livestock Auction. The fair, obviously, is about an accessible public an event as there is. So, let's take a closer look at where Walker has been. Events in 2013 Walker spokesman Tom Evenson sent us a list of more than 100 Walker events in 2013 that Evenson described as public. Some were easily accessible to the general public; others, because of cost, membership requirements or other reasons, weren't. Here's a sampling: The World Championship Snowmobile Derby in Eagle River, an event that attracted thousands. Television news coverage showed Walker delivering opening remarks and shaking hands with folks wearing snowmobile suits. A Martin Luther King Jr. ceremony in the Capitol rotunda in Madison. Hundreds of people attended the 33rd annual event, including a few who booed during Walker’s remarks, according to the Wisconsin State Journal. The annual State Education Convention at a Milwaukee hotel. Hundreds of school district officials and school board members heard Walker speak, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The three-day Governor’s Conference on Economic Development in Madison. Registration cost a minimum of $250 for Wisconsin Economic Development Association members and up to $340 for non-members. The National Rifle Association state convention in Wausau, where Walker gave a speech. A South Suburban Chamber of Commerce awards dinner in Oak Creek. More than 220 people attended, according to the chamber. The dinner cost $50. Military-related ceremonies in Pewaukee, at Camp Douglas and elsewhere. TV coverage of one event, at the Experimental Aircraft Association in Oshkosh, showed Walker speaking to a large gathering of Army National Guard members and their families. Independence Day parades in Menomonee Falls and Wauwatosa. A number of government meetings in Madison, including Walker presenting his state budget proposal and giving his "state of the state" address. In criticizing Walker’s availability to the general public, a progressive blogger pointed out that an upcoming meeting of the state Building Commission, which the governor is a member of, would be open to the public. An open house held by Pierce Manufacturing near Appleton to mark the firetruck maker’s 100th anniversary. Hundreds heard Walker speak, according to one account. Walker spoke to an audience of predominantly students in a speech at St. Norbert College in De Pere, the student newspaper reported. He also mingled with students and posed for pictures with them, according to images from a local TV station. The governor’s annual prayer breakfast. Tickets were priced at $30 and up. The annual Greater Milwaukee Law Enforcement Memorial Ceremony. Walker was among the speakers at the outdoor event, near the Milwaukee County Courthouse. News conferences, including one at the University of Wisconsin-Superior. TV news coverage showed an opponent of Walker’s state budget plan talking with the governor at the event. So, attendance is limited at some public events Walker attended, but not at others. In any case, Larson’s claim was absolute. Our rating Larson said Walker "hasn't done a public event this entire year." Larson may believe Walker needs to be more open, but it’s ridiculous to say Walker hasn’t done even one public event in 2013. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-15227	"As governor of Florida I defunded Planned Parenthood."	true	/florida/statements/2015/aug/07/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-he-cut-funding-planned-parenthood-go/	Former Gov. Jeb Bush is using the recent release of activist videos criticizing Planned Parenthood as a chance to advertise his own record on restricting abortion. During the first Republican primary presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015, Bush sidestepped a question from Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly about his time on the board of the Bloomberg Family Foundation, which has donated millions to Planned Parenthood. Instead, Bush reiterated he had a long history of opposing abortion. "Here’s my record: As governor of Florida I defunded Planned Parenthood. I created a culture of life in our state," he said. (Watch the exchange in the video here.) Bush earlier this week said the federal government should do the same. We’ve documented Bush’s opposition to abortion before, as well as his preference for abstinence-only education. But we wanted to check if he cut off state assistance for Planned Parenthood while governor, well before the current controversy. It turns out he did, long prior to recent calls to end federal funding for the group. Targeted cuts Planned Parenthood is a network of affiliated nonprofit organizations that cooperate with each other, led by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Funding comes from a wide range of sources, including private donations, grants, health center revenue and Medicaid. In Florida, there are currently two affiliates accredited with the national organization after several mergers, so the group is not organized quite the same as it was in 2001. There are now 23 health centers in the state, 16 of which provide abortion services. (Three of these were recently cited by the state Agency for Health Care Administration for allegedly providing second-trimester abortions without a license, violations Planned Parenthood has denied. A fourth was cited for improper recordkeeping.) Both Bush’s campaign and the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates pointed to the same thing: Two line-item vetoes Bush made to the state budget in 2001. According to a 2001 state fiscal analysis, Bush vetoed $115,759 in funding for Northeast Florida Planned Parenthood in Duval County and $187,084 for Department of Health contracts with Planned Parenthood in Collier and Sarasota counties. As governor, Bush was well-known for his frequent use of his veto power. That money was not for abortions, but was being used to provide family planning services to poor women, and had been available for more than a decade. To give you an idea of the scale of the state assistance, one of the affiliates confirmed in 2001 the payments made up about a quarter of their budget. It used the money to help pay for pap smears and sexually transmitted disease screening and treatment, among other services. The other affiliate noted the money went to treat patients who had no health insurance or access to Medicaid. Laura Goodhue, executive director of the Florida alliance, confirmed the group did not get any state funding after Bush’s 2001 veto. It still does not receive assistance from the state now. Our ruling Bush said, "As governor of Florida I defunded Planned Parenthood." In 2001, he used his line-item veto power to end funding for Planned Parenthood affiliates, and that funding never returned. We must note that the money was for family planning and health care services, not abortions, but he did cut off state money for the group. We rate the statement True.

pomt-02904	"The Legislature passed Gov. Walker’s so-called property tax relief bill," but the Republicans "are still raising your property taxes."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/nov/06/janet-bewley/despite-100-million-property-tax-relief-wisconsin-/	Soon it will be December and time for presents -- including your annual property tax bill. Oh, the suspense in opening the envelope: Will this year’s bill be lower or higher? But wait. On Oct. 24, 2013, Republican Gov. Scott Walker used his weekly radio address to herald a $100 million property tax relief bill he signed into law four days earlier. Relief means lower taxes, right? After we heard the opening lines of the Democratic response, put out the same day, we weren’t sure what to think. "Last week, the Legislature passed Gov. Walker’s so-called property tax relief bill," Ashland state Rep. Janet Bewley said in her address. "Lost in all the hype is the fact that the governor and Republican-controlled Legislature are still raising your property taxes." So, is the property tax relief real? Is it somehow superseded by property tax increases? And don’t school districts and other local governments help determine how big your property tax bill is? Property tax primer We’ll start by reviewing how a property tax bill comes to be. Every fall, each local unit of government -- cities, villages, towns, counties, school districts, and technical college districts -- adopts a budget for the following year. They subtract what they expect to receive in revenue, such as state aid, license fees, tuition, etc. The remainder has to come from property taxes, which happens to be the largest source of tax revenue in Wisconsin. In total, local governments levy more than 99% of all property taxes; the state claims the last sliver, for forestry programs. Nevertheless, state government plays an important role in how much your property tax bill turns out to be. First of all, the local governments’ levies get reduced by three state tax credits, including the state lottery credit. Second, the state has imposed a variety of caps on how much money local governments can raise or spend. So, even though the locals are the ones levying property taxes, the state puts strict limits on how much they can levy. For example, school districts are limited in the amount of money they can raise in total from property taxes and state aid. On the other hand, school districts can exceed their limits if voters approve a referendum. For municipalities and counties, their levy growth, if any, is limited to the amount of property taxes generated by new construction in their communities. The new law Reining in property taxes has been one of Walker’s priorities as governor. On Oct. 10, 2013, citing growth in state tax revenue, he called a special session of the Legislature to take up property tax relief -- specifically by increasing state aid to school districts. So, the approach was not a simple across-the-board tax reduction. The property tax relief measure was approved overwhelmingly on bipartisan votes -- 82-12 in the Assembly, with Bewley among the Democrats voting for it, and 28-5 in the Senate. The law raises state aid payments to school districts by $40 million (0.92%) in 2013-’14 and $60 million (1.36%) in 2014-’15. But, as we discussed earlier, school districts are under revenue limits. So, while individual levies for school districts will vary, statewide the additional $100 million in state aid to school districts triggers a corresponding $100 million decrease in property taxes. State schools Superintendent Tony Evers pointed out that while the new law "provides property tax relief for some school districts, it does not increase spending for public schools." Now, to Bewley’s claim that Walker and the GOP-run Legislature are "still raising your property taxes." The state budget In her radio remarks, Bewley argued that despite the property tax relief, the average person’s property taxes will rise. When we asked for evidence, her office cited an October 2013 memo from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It takes into account not only the property tax relief, but also the 2013-’15 state budget that Walker signed into law several months earlier. In contrast to the property tax relief bill, the state budget was adopted without a single Democratic vote. It passed 55-42 in the Assembly, with three Republicans voting no; then it passed 17-16 in the Senate, with one Republican voting no. According to the fiscal bureau, the property tax for a median-valued home -- $151,148 -- was $2,943. Under the biennial state budget, the tax was to drop by $5 in the first year, then increase by $36 in the second. That put the tax bill on the typical home at $2,974 -- a net increase of $31 over the two years. But with the property tax relief law, the tax on the typical home is now estimated to go down by $18 in the first year and increase $29 in the second. That would put the tax bill at $2,954 -- a net increase of $11. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson agreed with the figures, but noted that property tax increases have been held down under during Walker's first two years in office. He cited an August 2013 Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance report that said total property taxes, not just the portion levied by school districts, rose by 0.2% in 2011-’12 and 0.8% in 2012-’13. That was the first time since at least 1946 that the total levy rose by less than 1% in two consecutive years, the report said. Our rating Bewley said "the Legislature passed Gov. Walker’s so-called property tax relief bill," but the Republicans "are still raising your property taxes." Bewley’s right that under the Republicans’ 2013-’15 state budget, it’s estimated that property tax bills will rise, by an estimated $11 over two years for a typical home. But the increase would have been larger without the property tax relief, and property tax bills are affected by actions taken by local governments, not just the GOP-controlled state government. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, we give Bewley a Half True. If you would like to comment on this item, you can do so on the Journal Sentinel’s web page.

pomt-05409	Since 2009, the Ohio Republican Party has made more contacts with voters — nearly 6.6 million — than any other GOP state organization in the nation.	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/may/03/kevin-dewine/ex-gop-chair-kevin-dewine-says-his-watch-ohio-part/	Kevin DeWine in April lost a bitter, high-profile power struggle for control of the Ohio Republican Party to Gov. John Kasich even though DeWine was the party’s chairman. The feud between these GOP titans grew so personal that even time may not be enough to heal these battle scars, especially for DeWine. We won’t rehash all the nastiness but in a nutshell Kasich wanted DeWine booted for his perceived lack of support when Kasich successfully ran for office in 2010 against Democratic incumbent Ted Strickland. But DeWine did not go quietly, penning a resignation letter in which he declared himself the better man making the sake of the party his foremost concern and noting that Republicans may have just lost the best chairman they had ever had. DeWine, who took office in January 2009, noted that he had promised to re-engage the state party’s conservative base and establish improved voter contact programs. In his letter he deemed himself a success by using the 2010 elections as a barometer when Republicans swept the statewide elected offices and more. He then took his boasting a step further, claiming at least by one measure to be the best run state-level Republican party in the country during his tenure. "Since 2009, the Ohio Republican Party has collected more data points — nearly 6.6 million — than any other state in the nation," DeWine wrote. Data points? PolitiFact Ohio decided to learn more. Party spokesman Chris Maloney later explained that ‘data points’ represent actual contacts with voters, whether it be by phone, door-to-door knocking, email, snail mail or through social media outlets. Maloney would not share the party’s data for proprietary reasons, he said, but insisted the "nearly 6.6 million" figure that DeWine touts is accurate. As for how that ranks against other states, Maloney referred us to the state-level’s parent organization, the Republican National Committee. RNC spokesman Ryan Mahoney sent us a statement: The Ohio GOP’s "strong performance in 2010 combined with their efforts in 2011 give them the most voter contacts/data points since 2009. We monitor and coordinate with all of the states across the country so we can compare how all of the state parties perform." The RNC, however, declined to show us actual state-by-state figures, leaving us to essentially take them at their word. Reviewing the political activity of 2010 and 2011 would lend itself to support DeWine’s assertion. In 2010, all five of Ohio’s statewide elected offices were up for grabs: governor, attorney general, auditor, treasurer and secretary of state. And leading into the election, four of those five offices were held by Democrats. But with the state, much like the rest of the country, reeling from the effects of a recession, Republicans figured to have a strong shot at winning several of those seats and they did — winning all of them. The GOP also held onto a U.S. Senate seat that year. Then came 2011, an off-year for elections that turned out to be anything but. There were two major referendums on the ballot last year that helped mobilize both Republicans and Democrats and drove an unusually high number of voters to the voting booths for a year when no major state or federal political races are anchoring the ballot. Democrats worked their base to come out in overwhelming support of a referendum to overturn Senate Bill 5, a controversial collective bargaining bill. And Republicans reached into their deeply conservative roots to block provisions of the federal healthcare law they dubbed Obamacare from being implemented in Ohio. That turned out to be more a symbolic vote than anything since the U.S. Supreme Court had already decided that it would hear a case to determine if the healthcare law was constitutional. The bottomline is that it figures to reason that Republicans — and Democrats, too, for that matter should they make a similar claim — likely had strong success in reaching out and making contact with their base of voters. So where does that leave us with DeWine’s statement? DeWine’s claim was that since 2009, the Ohio party has collected more contact points than any other state in the nation. He presented that point as part of a greater discussion of his successes as party leader. While the organization is quick to boast about a claim of being the best among 50 state GOP operations, it would not offer up definitive proof to support their point. A spokesman for the Republican National Committee didn’t offer statistics, either, but did support DeWine’s claim that Ohio’s performance for building contacts was tops since 2009. We see no reason for the national organization to label Ohio’s operation as tops compared to the other states unless that is true. Based on that, we find DeWine’s claim is accurate. That the party declined to provide supporting data to back the specific numbers DeWine’s letter cites is additional information that helps provide clarity. On the Truth-O-Meter, DeWine’s claim rates Mostly True.	None	Kevin DeWine	None	None	None	2012-05-03T10:15:00	2012-04-04	['Republican_Party_(United_States)']
pomt-12070	In addition to his compensation as a judge, "Roy Moore and his wife (paid themselves) over $1 million from a charity they ran."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/sep/05/senate-leadership-fund/did-roy-moore-take-1-million-charity-he-ran/	Correction: When we originally reported this fact-check on Sept. 1, we were unable to determine how the Senate Leadership Fund arrived at its figure of "over $1 million," and the group didn’t respond to our query. The evidence seemed to show a total of under $1 million for salary and other benefits. After publication, a spokesman for the group provided additional evidence showing Moore received compensation as a consultant and through an amended filing, bringing the total to more than $1 million. We have corrected our report, and we have changed the rating from Mostly False to Mostly True. An attack ad targeting Roy Moore, a Republican candidate in the Alabama Senate special election, claims that he and his wife Kayla Moore paid themselves $1 million from a nonprofit organization they ran. The ad, funded by the Senate Leadership Fund, also creates the impression Moore drew compensation from the organization, The Foundation for Moral Law, while sitting on the Alabama Supreme Court. "Despite being one of the highest paid judges in the nation (...) Roy Moore wanted more," the advertisement said. "So Roy Moore and his wife (paid themselves) over $1 million from a charity they ran." Moore will face Sen. Luther Strange in a Sept. 26 runoff vote for the Republican nomination to fill the senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions, now the attorney general. Strange, who’s backed by the Senate Leadership Fund, was tapped to fill Sessions’ seat ahead of the Dec. 12 general election. The Senate Leadership Fund is aligned with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. We decided to investigate the Senate Leadership Fund’s claim that the Moore family drew over $1 million from The Foundation for Moral Law. Did the Moore family draw a $1 million from a non-profit they ran? The stated mission of The Foundation for Moral Law, founded in 2002, is to "educate the public and promote current litigation aimed at moral and religious issues," according to its website. In practice, the group writes friend-of-the-court briefs that advocate a Christian point of view in legal cases involving abortion, gay marriage, public prayer and other litigation with potential to "restore the knowledge of God in law." The group’s ethos aligns with Moore’s controversial judicial career, which includes being forced out as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court in 2003 for defying a federal court order to remove the Ten Commandments from the courthouse grounds. Moore was elected again to the Alabama Supreme Court in 2013 and was suspended in 2016 after he directed Alabama’s probate judges to defy federal court orders on same-sex marriage. He resigned the following year. The IRS granted The Foundation for Moral Law tax-exempt status in 2005, and that same year Moore was listed in IRS filings as the foundation’s chairman. Moore served as either chairman or president from 2005 through 2012, and his wife Kayla Moore took over as president in 2013. The attack ad claims it was during this 9-year period — from 2005 through 2013 — that the Moore family drew $1,030,875 in compensation (but as the screengrab shows, this time frame appears inconspicuously and in very fine print, perhaps to create the impression the Moores were paid in a single lump sum, when in fact their compensation was spread over nearly a decade). As the breakdown below shows, the Moore family did in fact receive $1,030,875 from The Foundation for Moral Law over this period, according to IRS filings: Form 990 ‘05 ‘06 ‘07 ‘08 ‘09 ‘10 ‘11 ‘12 ‘13 Roy Moore 9,983 0 105,500 (Legal consulting) 55,392 72,000 (Amended filing) 90,000 60,000 (Salary) 393,000 (Retirement and other deferred compensation) 138,000 42,000 N/A Kayla Moore N/A N/A N/A 0 0 0 0 0 65,000 Was Moore paid by the foundation while serving on the Alabama Supreme Court? The ad also creates the impression Moore drew compensation from The Foundation for Moral Law while serving as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court, a position he began in 2001. Moore was kicked off the bench in 2003 for refusing to comply with a federal court order to remove a monument of the Ten Commandments from the rotunda of the state Supreme Court building. He began to draw a salary from the foundation in 2005, two years after his dismissal from the bench, according to the foundation’s IRS filings. So the suggestion he drew the two salaries concurrently is wrong. Our ruling Senate Leadership Fund attack ad said, "Roy Moore and his wife (paid themselves) over $1 million from a charity they ran." From 2005 through 2013, the Moore family drew $1,030,875 from The Foundation for Moral Law. But the ad gave the wrong impression that Moore took a salary from the nonprofit while serving as Chief Justice of the Alabama Supreme Court. We rate this Mostly True.

pomt-07696	The health care bill has "six years of costs against 10 years of tax revenue."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2011/mar/07/ken-cuccinelli/ken-cuccinelli-says-health-care-law-has-six-years-/	No one has fought President Barack Obama’s health care reform law more effectively than Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli. The Republican is spearheading the legal challenges against the bill, especially the "individual mandate" provision that would require most Americans to buy health insurance. Cuccinelli won a major victory in December 2010 when a federal judge found that provision of the law to be unconstitutional, and the case is expected to wind up before the U.S. Supreme Court. During a March 1 appearance on Fox News, Cuccinelli was asked about Obama’s recent statement that he would support legislation that would allow states opt out of the mandate if they can find another way to expand coverage without driving up health care costs. Cuccinelli said he doesn’t expect much to come from the president’s comments. "They put four enormous conditions on what they call the opting out or providing some flexibility, and one of them that I would point to first is that it has to be deficit-neutral, which for a president who's counting six years of costs against 10 years of tax revenue to call his [proposal] balanced, you think he's going to let the states do that?" Cuccinelli asked. "I doubt it." The claim that the health care bill charges 10 years of taxes and for only six years of services is widely used by Republicans. We have checked it before, as has PolitiFact’s national staff. Brian Gottstein, director of communications for Cuccinelli, said the attorney general "was referring to how the taxes begin four years before the services do." Two of the highest-profile elements of the bill start in 2014, roughly four years after the law took effect. The virtual marketplaces known as health care exchanges would start that year, enabling those who are uninsured or who do not have access to coverage through an employer to buy insurance. Also starting that year would be subsidies to help people buy coverage on the exchange. In addition, that's the year for a major expansion in eligibility for Medicaid. And a 10-year phase out of the "doughnut hole" -- the gap in Medicare drug coverage -- began last year. The Republican argument that benefits don’t kick in until 2014 is true if you’re looking at those big provisions. But many smaller provisions have already taken effect. As PolitiFact has previously reported, there are plenty of examples: • Small business tax credits. From 2010 through 2013, qualifying small companies could get a tax credit of up to 35 percent of the company's contribution to employee health coverage. Beginning in 2014, when the exchanges start up, small businesses could qualify for up to 50 percent of the cost. • Coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. Soon after enactment, people with pre-existing conditions who haven't had coverage for at least six months could obtain coverage through a "high-risk pool" with subsidized premiums. This would be a temporary solution until the exchanges begin in 2014. • Assistance for early retirees. Starting last year, a temporary reinsurance program will help cut the cost of health coverage for retirees not old enough to be eligible for Medicare. • Dependent coverage to age 26. Shortly after enactment, all insurers were forced to offer dependent coverage for children up to age 26. • No more recisions. Existing plans can no longer terminate beneficiaries when they get sick. • Enhanced preventive care. Soon after enactment, qualified health plans were forced to provide certain preventive services without cost-sharing. Starting this year, patient cost-sharing for preventive services under Medicare and Medicaid are eliminated. The other half of this claim is that taxes kicked in immediately. Some of the tax provisions that help pay for the plan are already in effect. A 10 percent levy on indoor tanning began last year, and an escalating annual fee on drugmakers begins this year. Individuals with flexible spending plans and health savings accounts -- tax-advantaged accounts linked to health care expenses -- have already been hit with certain exclusions and limits. But many of the major tax changes will be delayed by a few years. • Medical device taxes. A new levy on medical device makers worth about $20 billion over 10 years kicks in 2013. • Taxes to benefit Medicare Part A. The bill's hike of payroll taxes for individuals earning $200,000 or couples earning $250,000 and a new tax on unearned income for higher earners will start in 2013. • Insurance sector fees. Fees on health insurers totaling $67 billion over 10 years become effective in 2014. • Mandated coverage. Two of the bill's provisions most controversial to Republicans -- the requirement that individuals buy health insurance and that employers of a certain size offer affordable health insurance, under penalty of a fine -- would not begin until 2014. The individual mandate would start low that year and then phase in through 2016. • "Cadillac tax." The most recent version of the bill pushes back the tax on higher-cost health plans until 2018. Now, let’s look at numbers to get a sense of proportion. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation -- Congress' bipartisan judge of revenue impacts from proposed laws -- the tax provisions collect minimal revenue for 2010, $2.9 billion for 2011 and $5.5 billion for 2012. They start getting enormous 2013, when revenues increase to $31.9 billion, eventually peaking at $86.9 billion in 2019. Indeed, of the total $409.2 billion in increased taxes over the 10-year window, only 10 percent of that amount is raised in the first four years -- the period when, according to Cuccinelli and other Republicans, the government is collecting taxes without providing care. Meanwhile, on the benefits side, it's true that the cost increases significantly four years after enactment. According to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service's Office of the Actuary, the first four years account for about 1 percent of the 10-year cost of increased coverage. The "statement that you have 10 years of taxes and six years of benefits is obviously an oversimplification," said Paul N. Van de Water, Senior Fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. "But overall, it is generally true that more taxes kick in a little bit earlier than the benefits do." Van de Water said the larger question is whether this is a gimmick and a long-term problem. The answer to that, he said, is no. "Despite the fact that it’s true that some of the taxes kick in on average a bit earlier, by the end of the 10-year period the health reform bill still produces a modest reduction of the deficit, according to the CBO estimate," he said, "and in the subsequent 10-year period the reduction of the deficit gets even larger." Let’s review. Cuccinelli says the health care reform law charges 10 years of taxes for six years of benefits. It suggests we're paying all of the taxes now and getting none of the benefits. Cuccinelli and other Republicans are correct that the bill's biggest expansions in coverage do not happen until 2014, including the exchanges, the subsidies and the Medicaid expansion. He's also right that some taxation has already begun, albeit it minor. The bill is is a bit front-loaded. About 10 percent of the taxes for health care reform will be levied in the first four years to pay for an estimated 1 percent of cost. But Cuccinelli is flat wrong to say health care reform offers no benefits before 2014. Some of the bill’s most popular provisions -- including no cancelation of health insurance for pre-existing conditions, guaranteed coverage of dependents to age 26, and tax credits for small businesses -- have taken effect and other components will be implemented before 2014. We rate this claim Half True.	None	Ken Cuccinelli	None	None	None	2011-03-07T15:37:01	2011-03-01	['None']

pomt-01979	More than 1.5 million people moved into Georgia between the past two Census counts, and a majority consider themselves, African-American, Latino or Asian-American.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/jun/17/stacey-abrams/most-georgias-population-growth-minorities/	Georgia’s changing demographics has become fodder in political circles about what those numbers could mean come November. The talk focuses broadly on the population growth in the state and just who has been moving in. The Democrats’ idea: follow the Obama administration’s successful playbook and win over those folks with voter registration and turnout efforts to capture their party’s bid for U.S. Senate and governor. We decided to check claims by House Minority Leader Stacey Abrams, an Atlanta Democrat who also heads a nonprofit focusing on voter registration, on the numbers involved. "In Georgia, during the previous decade between Census counts, more than 1.5 million new neighbors set up homes in the state," Abrams wrote in the Huffington Post. The majority of those arrivals were minorities, she said. In Georgia, race is often a good predictor of political affiliation. Racial minorities in the state tend to vote Democratic, according to experts. With polls showing both the Senate and governor’s race as competitive, those numbers could matter, so we decided to take a look at how they stack up. Abrams told us she got the numbers from the U.S. Census, the actual count of people living in the United States that the government takes every 10 years. The primary focus of that numerical snapshot is to decide the number of seats each state will get in the U.S. House of Representatives. For that reason, the total count is quite reliable. In 2000, Georgia had 8,186,453 people. A decade later, the count was 9,687,653. That’s almost exactly the 1.5 million Abrams cites to HuffPost. More complicated is the question of minorities. The Census form specifically states that Hispanic origin is not race. For that reason, most recent Census form asked two questions about race – identifiers such as white or black – and ethnicity, which includes the question about Latino or Hispanic origin. Yet a growing share of Americans don’t pick a race category on the form, according to Census news releases. That results in figures that aren’t quite as refined, especially over time when the questions regarding race and ethnicity have changed somewhat. Robert Bernstein, a Census spokesman in Washington, D.C., walked us through the numbers as the agency sees it. Tucked into one table in both Census sets were population counts by race, and a separate breakout of those not considered Hispanic or Latino. "That is effectively the minority population," Bernstein said. For Georgia, there were 3,057,772 non-white people in the state in 2000. By 2010, that number increased to 4,273,733. That means 1.2 million of the 1.5 million new people in Georgia between Census counts were non-white – or 81 percent. Abrams said her focus was meant to be the substantial numbers involved in the population and how that matches up with voter registration. "The conversation is about engagement," Abrams aid. "There is an important philosophy of having all citizens engaged in the process." Citizen is the key word. The Census counts all people – regardless of age, legal status or citizenship – living in the state. Voting, of course, is open only to citizens who are at least 18 years old. That explains, in part, the other demographic reality: the majority of Georgia’s active voters, generally defined as someone who has voted in the past three years, are white. Data from the Secretary of State’s office shows that, in May 2002, 72 percent of the state’s active voters were white. That number plunged to about 59 percent as of November, data shows. But the 2013 figures also show more than 323,000 new white voters. That means the percentage of non-Hispanic whites is smaller than it had been, but even there, Georgia is seeing more voters, said Alan I. Abramowitz, an expert on American political demographics at Emory University. "There is a lag between the changing demographic of the population and the changing of your electorate," Abramowitz said. "Both are definitely changing, that is true, but not at the same rate." To wrap it up, Stacey Abrams hit the mark with her numbers. The significance of those changes, though, don’t immediately translate into similar shifts in the makeup of the state’s voters. If the point is to identify and register more would-be voters, more refined numbers about citizenship and age would be needed. For that reason, we rate Abrams’ statement as Mostly True.

pomt-03307	Says HJM 20 "was the only bill not assigned to a House committee."	false	/oregon/statements/2013/jul/29/oregon-catalyst/was-bill-condeming-irs-scandal-only-one-not-referr/	Remember that IRS scandal a few months back? An investigation found that the Internal Revenue Service had been closely scrutinizing the tax status of several conservative groups. Naturally, Republicans were not happy with this news. Some tried to tie the scandal directly to the Obama Administration, though no such link has been found. The issue has mostly faded from the headlines, but it still continues to bubble up from time to time. It did so recently in a piece on the conservative blog Oregon Catalyst. The article, which has no listed author, notes that "people all over Oregon and the United States have been deeply troubled by the growing scandal involving the Obama administration’s use of the Internal Revenue Service for political purposes. The notion that the IRS would be used to harass and intimidate conservative grassroots organizations is one that many find very offensive." Now, whether the Obama administration specifically used the IRS for anything is still open to debate. More recently it has come out that groups with words like "progressive" in their names were also scrutinized. However, we’re not fact checking that this time around. What we’re looking at is something else altogether. During the 2013 legislative session, Oregon Republicans introduced a House Joint Memorial that asked Congress to "take all appropriate action, including but not limited to further investigation of Internal Revenue Service actions and the drafting of any appropriate legislation, to rein in the powers of, and increase congressional oversight over" the IRS. But HJM 20 -- which we’ll note is a non-binding, symbolic piece of legislation -- didn’t go anywhere. Oregon Catalyst was not happy about that: "Unfortunately, HJM 20 was referred to the Speaker’s desk and stayed there until the session ended. It was never even assigned to a committee for consideration. In fact, it was the ONLY (emphasis theirs) bill not assigned to a House committee. "Maybe (Speaker of the House) Tina Kotek should stop covering for the Obama administration’s rampant abuses of power and stand up for our constitutional rights. And House Republicans should absolutely re-introduce a similar piece of legislation in next February’s month-long session." At PolitiFact Oregon, we love words like "only" "most" "first" -- superlatives in general. They’re typically easy to check. So leaving aside the motives of Kotek, a Democrat, we wondered if this really was the only bill not assigned to a House committee. The statement was easy enough to check. We went to the Oregon Legislature’s website and looked at a list of all the measures and bills and resolutions in the House and their histories. As it happens HJM 20 did have some company. Both House Bills 2010 and 2011 also died on the speaker’s desk. Both pieces of legislation were proposed by Republicans. House Bill 2010 concerned the Water Resources Department and House Bill 2011 addressed having public employees return wages from an administrative leave if the leave is determined to be the result of criminal conduct. We’re always curious at PolitiFact Oregon and flipped back a couple sessions to see if this has happened before. It turns out it’s exceedingly rare. In fact we could find no other such instance. One other fact worth noting: HJM 20 had its first reading to the full House on July 1, well after deadlines had passed to get legislation through a complicated committee and two-chamber process. In fact, at that point, most of the committees had likely stopped meeting altogether. Certainly it could have been given priority, but given that the Legislature adjourned a week later, it would have been a stretch. The other two bills mentioned above similarly did not get their first reading until July 1 or later. We asked Dan Lucas, the man behind Oregon Catalyst, to weigh in but he declined to comment. In an online post, Oregon Catalyst lambasted Kotek for not advancing HJM 20, saying it was the only bill not assigned to a committee. In fact, it was one of the three; rare but not unique. We rate this claim False.	None	Oregon Catalyst	None	None	None	2013-07-29T16:53:28	2013-07-17	['None']
pomt-07109	"Who are the most consistently misinformed media viewers? … Fox viewers, consistently, every poll."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jun/20/jon-stewart/jon-stewart-says-those-who-watch-fox-news-are-most/	EDITOR'S NOTE: On the June 21, 2011, edition of The Daily Show, Jon Stewart accepted our False verdict and apologized, saying, "I defer to (PolitiFact's) judgment and apologize for my mistake. To not do so would be irresponsible." On the June 19, 2011, edition of Fox News Sunday, comedian Jon Stewart -- host of The Daily Show on Comedy Central -- sat down for an interview with Chris Wallace. Many readers asked us to review one of his claims. "Who are the most consistently misinformed media viewers?" Stewart asked Wallace. "The most consistently misinformed? Fox, Fox viewers, consistently, every poll." Wallace didn’t challenge Stewart’s assertion that Fox -- widely perceived as a conservative-leaning network -- produced more misinformed viewers. But we thought it was an assessment worth checking. We found two polling organizations that have produced periodic "knowledge" surveys differentiated by the respondent’s frequent news sources. One is the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, and the other is worldpublicopinion.org, a project managed by the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland. Let’s start with Pew’s findings. Pew periodically studies media usage and public knowledge. They ask whether a respondent is a "regular" reader, viewer or listener of major print, television, radio and Internet news sources, and they ask a series of basic factual questions about news and public affairs to gauge how well-informed the respondent is. After conferring with Pew researchers, we found three surveys since 2007 that shed some light on how informed Fox viewers are compared to consumers of other media. Here they are: • February 2007 Political Knowledge Survey. Pew asked respondents 23 questions, such as who the vice president is, who the president of Russia is, whether the Chief Justice is conservative, which party controls the U.S. House of Representatives and whether the U.S. has a trade deficit. The ability to answer 15 of these questions correctly earned the respondent a place in the "high knowledge" category. Pew then categorized various media sources by the percentage of their followers who earned a high knowledge rating. The media outlets fell into three categories -- those that had 50 to 54 percent in the high knowledge group, those that had 40 to 49 percent in the high knowledge group, and those that had 34 to 39 percent in the high knowledge group. In descending order, the 50-to-54 percent group included The Daily Show and its Comedy Central cousin, The Colbert Report; major newspaper websites; the PBS News Hour with Jim Lehrer; Fox News’ The O’Reilly Factor; National Public Radio; and Rush Limbaugh’s syndicated radio talk show. The 40-to-49 percent category included national newsmagazines; television news websites; local daily newspapers; Internet news sources like Yahoo and Google; and CNN. Finally, the 34-to-39 percent group included the network evening news shows; online news discussion blogs; Fox News Channel; local television news; and the network morning shows. Now, let’s analyze the data. Fox isn’t last on the list, although it’s close -- 35 percent of Fox viewers earned a high knowledge rating, which was tied with local television news and was one point ahead of the network morning shows. However, Fox’s 35 percent score places it exactly at the national average. This seems paradoxical -- Fox ranks near the bottom of a long list of media outlets, yet it sits right at the national average. But there’s an explanation. Lots of respondents reported following none of the media outlets they were asked about, and those respondents did quite poorly on the knowledge quiz -- not surprisingly. That meant that the non-media-using respondents brought down the national average, but they didn’t constitute a separate category that ranked lower than Fox on Pew’s chart. Since Stewart was referring to "media viewers," this doesn’t undercut his point. However, the data includes an important counterpoint to Stewart’s claim: Viewers of at least one show on Fox scored quite well -- The O’Reilly Factor, of whom 51 percent made it into the high knowledge group. That made it equal to National Public Radio -- a longtime target of conservative complaints about liberal media bias -- and only three percentage points behind Stewart’s own show, at 54 percent. • April 2008 Media Survey. Compared to the 2007 survey, the 2008 survey looked at a wider variety of media outlets but used a narrower selection of questions designed to test the respondent’s current-affairs knowledge. The pollsters asked three questions: "Do you happen to know which political party has a majority in the U.S. House of Representatives?" "Can you tell me the name of the current U.S. Secretary of State?" And "who is the current prime minister of Great Britain?" Anyone who went three-for-three earned the high knowledge designation. Here, the range of results was much wider. Once again, Fox News was just about at the national average -- 19 percent of Fox viewers scored in the high knowledge category, compared to 18 percent of all respondents -- but this time a handful of news outlets scored lower than Fox did. With scores ranging from 17 percent all the way down to 9 percent, they were CNBC, local television news, network news, morning news shows, television newsmagazines, personality magazines, religious radio, the Weather Channel, CBS News, Access Hollywood and similar shows, and in last place, the National Enquirer. And once again, particular Fox shows scored well above the average. Hannity & Colmes was one of only four choices to exceed 40 percent -- the others were the New Yorker/the Atlantic, NPR and MSNBC’s Hardball -- while The O’Reilly Factor scored 28 percent, or 10 points above the national average. (Hannity & Colmes even exceeded Stewart’s Daily Show in this poll, 42 percent to 30 percent.) In all, this poll undercuts Stewart’s position even more than the 2007 poll did. • June 2010 Media Consumption Survey. For 2010, respondents were asked four questions -- which party controlled the House of Representatives, what post was held by Eric Holder, which company was run by Steve Jobs and which country has an active volcano that had recently disrupted international air travel. This time, Pew didn’t specifically use a "high knowledge" measurement but rather broke down responses by how many were answered correctly by each media outlet’s followers. Once again, Fox News as a whole ranked fairly low among regularly used media outlets -- 20 percent answered all four correctly and 18 percent answered three correctly. Still, those numbers beat the national average of 14 percent and 20 percent, respectively. (The best-scoring outlet, the Wall Street Journal, posted scores of 51 percent and 23 percent, respectively.) Fox actually scored better than its two direct cable-news rivals -- MSNBC, which is a liberal counterpoint to Fox, and CNN, which is considered more middle-of-the-road. Also scoring lower than Fox were local television news, the evening network news shows and the network morning shows. And for the third time, particular Fox shows scored well. Hannity ranked fifth (just ahead of MSNBC’s liberal shows hosted by Keith Olbermann and Rachel Maddow) and O’Reilly ranked ninth. For the first time, Pew included Glenn Beck in its rankings, and the Fox host finished 12th -- slightly ahead of Stewart’s own Daily Show. We asked Michael Dimock, Pew’s associate director for research, what he thought Pew’s data meant for Stewart’s claim. He said it’s crucial to understand that different news sources appeal to different types of people -- and that highly political programming of any type attracts regular readers and viewers "who are, most likely, already highly knowledgeable prior to their exposure to those particular sources. Separating what knowledge they bring with them from what they learn while reading or watching is virtually impossible." By contrast, Dimock said, for media outlets with a much broader reach -- including Fox -- "the average regular consumer of these sources is less informed than the more niche audiences, because these sources, by design, reach and appeal to a broader cross-section of the public. In most of our studies, the regular readers and viewers of these broad-based news sources are not significantly more or less informed than the average American, and there is no systematic pattern showing one broad-based source has a more knowledgeable audience than any other." Pew’s methodology is not immune from critique. Most notably, it’s not clear whether knowing the answer to a few current-affairs questions translates into being "informed." However, the experts we spoke to said that Pew is an unbiased source and that its data is credible. Given that, we conclude that the Pew data demonstrates that the reality of who’s "misinformed" is a lot more nuanced than Stewart makes it out to be. Now let’s turn to the studies by worldpublicopinion.org. We found two studies by the group that tracked current-affairs knowledge. • "Misperceptions, The Media and The Iraq War" study, 2003. This study focused on the Iraq War and the lead-up to it. It asked three questions: "Is it your impression that the U.S. has or has not found clear evidence in Iraq that Saddam Hussein was working closely with the al-Qaida terrorist organization?" "Since the war with Iraq ended, is it your impression that the US has or has not found Iraqi weapons of mass destruction?" And whether, "The majority of people favor the US having gone to war." On these questions, Fox clearly did the worst among the major news outlets. The "misperception rate" for Fox was 45 percent. The highest for other news outlets was CBS News at 36 percent; those with lower "misperception rates" included CNN, ABC, NBC, the print media and NPR/PBS, which was lowest at 11 percent. This study is probably the strongest support we found for Stewart’s claim, in part because the difference between Fox and the other news outlets was so stark, and in part because the questions asked have pretty clear-cut "right" and "wrong" answers. • Misinformation and the 2010 Election, 2010. This study inspired some of the most intense response of any we looked at. For instance, the liberal blog Daily Kos trumpeted the study with the headline, "CONFIRMED: New Study Proves That Fox News Makes You Stupid." But it’s also the study that prompted the fiercest counterattack on methodological grounds. The study asked 10 questions. Some are fairly cut and dried -- which president signed the TARP law to bail out Wall Street (Bush), which implemented the automaker bailout (both Bush and Obama), whether the stimulus bill included tax cuts (it did),and whether Barack Obama was born in the United States (he was). But a few were in a bit grayer area, often asking respondents to gauge what experts have concluded about policy trends. One was, "Is it your impression that most economists who have studied it estimate that the stimulus has created (a) saved or created several million jobs, (b) saved or created a few jobs, or (c) caused job losses." Another was, "Is it your impression that economists who have estimated the effect of the health reform law on the federal budget deficit over the next 10 years, (a) more think it will not increase the deficit, (b) views are evenly divided, or (c) more think it will increase the deficit." The Baltimore Sun’s television critic, David Zurawik, wrote a column shortly after the study appeared, expressing skepticism about the study. Zurawik wrote, "what you have for the definition of a respondent who is considered ‘informed’ is essentially someone who agrees with the conclusions of experts in government agencies. When specific questions in the survey are framed around facts, like who was president when a certain piece of legislation passed, you can say someone is misinformed." But that’s not the case with some of this survey’s questions. One question from the study that struck us as one that ordinary Americans might answer differently than economists asked, "Do you think now that the American economy is (a) starting to recover, or (b) still getting worse?" The study based the "correct" answer -- that the economy has begun to recover -- on the widely accepted judgment of when the last recession ended, as well as gross domestic product estimates and statistics for personal income. However, given the phrasing of the question, a respondent might think the question was asking for a personal opinion of how the recovery was going, rather than what the official statistics say. In a note, the study’s authors acknowledged such concerns, but defended their approach. "When dealing with topics that have been highly politicized, it is common to default to the position that all perceptions are relative and treatment of any position as more or less true is itself inherently political," the study says. "We believe that such a position is at odds with what is necessary for well-functioning democracy." We should note that like this study, PolitiFact often uses the Congressional Budget Office and the Medicare trustees as credible sources, and we often query experts to come up with our rulings. We think there’s a difference between bestowing a False rating on an elected official -- whose job it is to know about public policy -- and calling an ordinary American "misinformed" for getting the exact same question "wrong." At the very least, these questions seem less clear-cut than asking who the vice president is. For this reason, we believe that this study should carry less weight in analyzing Stewart’s comment. So we have three Pew studies that superficially rank Fox viewers low on the well-informed list, but in several of the surveys, Fox isn’t the lowest, and other general-interest media outlets -- such as network news shows, network morning shows and even the other cable news networks -- often score similarly low. Meanwhile, particular Fox shows -- such as The O’Reilly Factor and Sean Hannity’s show -- actually score consistently well, occasionally even outpacing Stewart’s own audience. Meanwhile, the other set of knowledge surveys, from worldpublicopinion.org, offer mixed support for Stewart. The 2003 survey strikes us as pretty solid, but the 2010 survey has been critiqued for its methodology. The way Stewart phrased the comment, it’s not enough to show a sliver of evidence that Fox News’ audience is ill-informed. The evidence needs to support the view that the data shows they are "consistently" misinformed -- a term he used not once but three times. It’s simply not true that "every poll" shows that result. So we rate his claim False.	None	Jon Stewart	None	None	None	2011-06-20T18:23:40	2011-06-19	['None']

pomt-03687	The Miami Dolphins "are the only NFL team in the entire nation that pays property taxes."	false	/florida/statements/2013/apr/22/carlos-gimenez/carlos-gimenez-says-miami-dolphins-are-only-proper/	The Miami Dolphins are attempting to score what would be an incredibly fast political touchdown: a one-month campaign to convince Miami-Dade County voters to sign off on a stadium construction deal. After nearly around the clock negotiations at the stadium and county hall, fueled by frequent runs for Cuban cafecito, County Mayor Carlos Gimenez hammered out a deal with the Dolphins. During the county meeting on April 10, 2013, when commissioners signed off on the referendum, Commissioner Sally Heyman asked if the stadium would continue to pay property taxes. During the negotiations, the Dolphins proposed turning over the stadium ownership to the county. The team had also appealed their property taxes two years in a row but then dropped the appeals. Gimenez replied: "Commissioner, as far as I know the Miami Dolphins are the only professional team in the state of Florida that actually pays property taxes. And, as far as I know, the Dolphins are the only NFL team in the entire nation that pays property taxes. This does not change." At PolitiFact Florida, our ears perk up when we hear that something is the "only" one in the country. Are the Miami Dolphins the only NFL team to pay property taxes? For the $350 million stadium deal to go forward, the tax-weary Legislature must sign off on some of the financing before the session ends May 3, and then Miami-Dade voters must approve it in a May 14 referendum. By May 22, the NFL will decide whether to award the 50th Super Bowl in 2016 to Miami or San Francisco. Focusing on property taxes is just one piece of the finances of a stadium. Nearly all NFL stadiums have received public financing of some sort. "No property taxes on stadiums is a part of the negotiation between the team and the relevant government entities – the trade-off very likely is a bigger subsidy coupled with property taxes, or smaller subsidies and property tax exemptions," Robert Baade, a business of sports professor at Lake Forest, told PolitiFact Florida in an email. Dolphins property taxes In making his statement, Gimenez was repeating something he heard from Dolphins owner Stephen Ross during negotiation meetings, County spokeswoman Suzy Trutie told PolitiFact Florida. "We’re the only team in the country that doesn’t have any public dollars with our stadium. We pay full real estate taxes. We’re the only team in Florida and the only team in the NFL that pays full real estate taxes," Ross was quoted in the Miami Herald in March. "We’re not looking to be relieved of that ... ." Dolphins spokesman Eric Jotkoff said Ross’ statement refers to the land and the stadium, although the land is owned by the county. Trutie said that the $3 million in real estate taxes is for "the building and the land, even though the county owns the land." The Dolphins tax bill for the stadium itself was about $3.6 million in 2012 -- that includes about $3 million in real estate taxes and the rest was for tangible personal property and local business taxes, Miami-Dade tax records show. The tax bill for the parking lots is about $368,000. Washington Redskins and Carolina Panthers pay stadium property taxes We contacted multiple NFL teams and found two in addition to the Dolphins that pay property taxes on their stadiums: the Washington Redskins and the Carolina Panthers. Spokespersons for the teams as well as local government officials confirmed for PolitiFact that the teams pay property taxes on the stadiums. The Redskins own FedEx Field in Landover, Md. The Redskins paid about $3 million for in 2013 -- most of that is for property taxes and includes a small fee for solid waste collection, according to Prince George’s County. The amount of business personal property taxes for a related stadium entity was $406,230.24. The Carolina Panthers paid about $1.7 million in property taxes on the Bank of America stadium in Charlotte for 2011, the year of the most recent valuation, according to Eric Anderson, deputy director in the Mecklenburg County assessor’s office. The Panthers lease the city-owned land for $1 a year. The team paid a tax on the lease, which was about $346,246 for 2011. The team also paid business personal property tax of about $313,800. The Panthers have had some battles in the past with Mecklenburg County about the taxes. During a revaluation of the property in 2003, the county raised the value. "The county gave you a huge break on this, if you want to know the truth," Ham Wade, the county's attorney, told the team's appraiser at one point during that battle. Payments in lieu of taxes In some cases, stadiums don’t pay property taxes but they do make a payment in lieu of taxes -- and that payment can be substantial. Take for example the town of Foxborough, population 17,000, that gets about $2 million for payment in lieu of taxes from the New England Patriots. That payment is about 40 to 60 percent less than the amount would be if the team paid property taxes, estimated the town’s finance director Randy Scollins. The payment plan is controversial, but Scollins told PolitiFact "I see the wisdom in it. The theory is that wouldn’t we be so lucky as to have an economic engine in your back yard." The New York Giants and the New York Jets don’t pay property taxes on their shared MetLife stadium in East Rutherford, New Jersey. (However, the borough is in negotiations and in court about whether the Giants should pay $1.5 million in property taxes on a training facility within the same sports complex as the stadium.) The city receives a payment in lieu of property taxes -- about $7.2 million through the New Jersey Sports & Exposition Authority. A portion of that comes from the stadium, East Rutherford mayor James Cassella told PolitiFact. "Technically they don’t pay property taxes, but they do pay money to the municipality," he said. Our ruling Gimenez said during a county meeting that the Miami Dolphins "are the only NFL team in the entire nation that pays property taxes." That’s not accurate: two additional NFL teams pay property taxes on their stadiums. For the most recent year available, the Carolina Panthers paid about $1.7 million while the Washington Redskins paid about $3 million. Some teams pay some sort of other payment in lieu of property taxes. Technically, those aren’t property taxes, but in the case of the New England Patriots, the $2 million payment to the town of Foxborough isn’t too shabby. Gimenez exaggerated when he said that the Dolphins are the only NFL team in the country that pays property taxes. We rate this claim False.

pomt-08824	"We are amassing most of our military strength in a country where fewer than 100 members of al Qaeda remain."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/aug/13/elizabeth-dennigan/dennigan-says-US-is-amassing-its-military/	As Washington debates the effectiveness of President Obama's counterinsurgency plan in Afghanistan, one congressional hopeful here has blasted the strategy. Elizabeth "Betsy" Dennigan, one of several candidates challenging U.S. Rep. James Langevin for his District 2 seat, criticizes the move to add troops in Afghanistan and questions Langevin's judgment in recently voting in favor of $33 billion in supplemental funding. Her take: "Our massive, expensive presence in Afghanistan undermines our efforts to eliminate safe havens for al Qaeda in Pakistan and to fight these determined terrorists globally." That's her opinion and she's entitled to that. But then she cited a fact that got our attention: "We are amassing most of our military strength in a country where fewer than 100 members of al Qaeda remain," she wrote. The latest numbers from the Department of Defense indicate there are about 100,000 troops deployed to Afghanistan, up from about 87,000 earlier this year. As of last week, there were 62,000 troops in Iraq, down sharply from recent months. But that's just the tally of those serving in the two major offensives. In total, the Pentagon reports that there are approximately 1.4 million active-duty U.S. military personnel. The 100,000 troops serving in Afghanistan represent less than 10 percent of total military forces -- hardly "most of our military strength." But as of March when the most recent calculation was done, the total U.S. deployment overseas numbered roughly 300,000. Given the changes in troop levels, that number is now closer to 200,000, including those in combat and non-combat situations. A very rough calculation would therefore suggest that the troops deployed to Afghanistan do account for around half of those. So Dennigan is slightly off the mark when she uses the phrase "most." The more interesting statistic in her statement is that there are fewer than 100 members of al Qaeda left in Afghanistan. The question of al Qaeda's strength has been debated for years in political circles, until earlier this summer when CIA Director Leon Panetta, in an appearance on ABC's "This Week," settled some of the mystery by offering his best estimate of al Qaeda's presence. The number, he said, is "relatively small." "At most, we're looking at maybe 50 to 100, maybe less," Panetta said. "It's in that vicinity. There's no question that the main location of al Qaeda is in tribal areas of Pakistan." The CIA director's assessment was so unusual that it quickly made the rounds on the Internet, generating millions of hits and political buzz aplenty. That's how the Dennigan campaign said they found the statistic, and why they felt comfortable repeating it. "He's the CIA director. He's the guy who would have the most information," said Dennigan spokesman Tim McLaughlin. Is there a way to know for sure whether Panetta's numbers are correct? No. At least not without a higher security clearance than we'll ever get. But for now it is the most up to date and official pronouncement we can locate. So unless and until we find a more accurate figure, we’ll rely on Panetta’s estimate and assume that Dennigan is right on that point. We rate this as Mostly True.

pomt-12074	Says Manny Pacquiao, Usain Bolt and Princes William and Harry have donated tens of millions of dollars to Hurricane Harvey victims.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/sep/01/blog-posting/celebrity-donations-tens-millions-dollars-harvey-v/	Three similarly worded posts published on News360-tv.com said Manny Pacquiao, Usain Bolt and Princes William and Harry had each donated tens of millions of dollars to Hurricane Harvey victims. They haven’t. Pacquiao, a Filipino boxer and politician, was said to have spent $50 million to rebuild Houston. Princes Harry and William were said to have given $100 million to assist and house victims of the flood. And Bolt, an Olympic sprinter, was said to have spent a whopping $150 million on hurricane relief. While other celebrities are indeed pledging thousands to the cause, these magnanimous donations haven’t been reported on any credible news sites, and the celebrities have not made any such announcements on social media. The stories about Bolt and Pacquiao used almost the exact same wording as a story we’ve already debunked claiming boxer Floyd Mayweather donated $200 million for hurricane relief. They each started with the quip "To whom much is given, much is expected." They also falsely claimed the athletes had traveled to Houston and attributed the same quotes to each. "It is a humanitarian gesture, an act of solidarity and support for a brotherly affected people," the stories attributed to Bolt, Pacquiao and Mayweather all say. Unlike some other fake news sites, this one doesn’t have a disclaimer about the veracity of quotes or news reports, but it has all the tell-tale signs of a fake news peddler, like unattributed facts, no publication date and click-bait ads.

pomt-14882	"Every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/10/ben-carson/ben-carson-said-raising-minimum-wage-will-increase/	At the Fox Business Network debate, it didn’t take long for the topic of the minimum wage to come up. During a back-and-forth with the moderators, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson urged caution on raising the minimum wage, saying, "People need to be educated on the minimum wage. Every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases." We checked a similar claim by Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md. In November 2014, Cardin made the opposite case, claiming that "every time we've increased the minimum wage, we've seen a growth in jobs." We rated Cardin’s claim Mostly False, after determining that during the 12 months following each of the 11 minimum wage increases since 1978, about half produced a net gain in jobs and about half produced a net loss of jobs. In this case, we decided we couldn’t rely on the exact same data, since Cardin referred to a growth in jobs, while Carson referred to an increase in joblessness. Those aren’t exactly the same things, though the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates both metrics. So we used the same methodology to look at the 12-month changes in unemployment level after those 11 minimum-wage hikes. The chart below shows what we found: Year of minimum wage increase New minimum wage Change in number of people unemployed over next 12 months Was a recession going on during the 12-month period? 1978 $2.65 Down 380,000 No 1979 $2.90 Up 574,000 Yes 1980 $3.10 Up 1,388,000 Yes 1981 $3.35 Up 1,326,000 Yes 1990 $3.80 Up 1,642,000 Yes 1991 $4.25 Up 976,000 No 1996 $4.75 Down 577,000 No 1997 $5.15 Down 356,000 No 2007 $5.85 Up 1,788,000 Yes 2008 $6.55 Up 5,664,000 Yes 2009 $7.25 Down 89,000 No The headline here is that joblessness rose after a minimum-wage hike more than half the time -- seven out of 11 occasions -- but fell four times. Since joblessness fell some of the time, it means that Carson’s sweeping claim -- that joblessness rises "every time" the minimum wage goes up is off-base. But there’s another factor that casts additional doubt on his assertion. As it happened, there was a recession under way during six of the 11 periods we studied. During each of those periods, joblessness rose after the minimum wage went up. This is not surprising -- but it does cast into doubt the cause and effect behind the rise in joblessness. The impact of a recession does, at the very least, raise questions about whether a minimum wage hike in and of itself caused joblessness. If you look instead at the five wage hikes that occurred when a recovery was under way, joblessness declined four of those times. The only exception was the 1991 wage hike, which took effect soon after a recovery began. Finally, we should note that economists are split over what effect a minimum wage hike has on job growth. There’s some research that shows raising the minimum wage negatively impacts job growth, and a lot that shows it has an insignificant effect. Our ruling Carson said, "Every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases." If you look at the 12-month period following every minimum-wage hike since 1978, joblessness did rise on seven occasions, but it fell on four occasions, undercutting his sweeping claim. In addition, it’s not at all clear that a minimum-wage hike was the primary culprit for the periods in which joblessness rose, since those periods also coincided with broader recessions in the economy. We rate his claim False.	None	Ben Carson	None	None	None	2015-11-10T22:46:38	2015-11-10	['None']

pomt-14668	Says Virginia Del. Mark Cole "wants schools to check children’s genitals before using bathroom."	false	/virginia/statements/2016/jan/18/occupy-democrats/occupy-democrats-grossly-twists-virginia-school-ba/	A left-leaning advocacy group says Del. Mark Cole, R-Spotsylvania, has introduced a bill that would require students to show their privates before using a restroom in a public school in Virginia. "Virginia Republican wants schools to check children’s genitals before using bathroom," read the headline of a Jan. 12 web post by Occupy Democrats, a group started in 2012 to - in its own words - "counterbalance the Republican Tea Party." The ensuing article elaborated that Cole’s bill "would force schools to check the genitals of their students in order to ensure that they are using facilities reserved for their ‘anatomical sex.’" Similar claims have been posted on the websites of at least two other liberal groups: The Raw Story and Peacock Panache, triggering some Internet debate that isn’t exactly flattering to Cole. We wondered whether the description of Cole’s bill is accurate. School bathrooms have been a scalding issue in Cole’s district, where some parents have objected to a transgender student’s use of a girls’ lavatory at a Stafford County elementary school. Officials at the school initially allowed the student to use the girls’ room. But amid an outcry from some parents, the school board reversed that policy and instead directed the student to use a single-stall lavatory at the school, a staff bathroom, or the boys’ restroom. Cole’s bill would direct school boards across the state to develop policies to ensure that any public school restroom and locker room "designated for use by a specific gender to solely be used by individuals whose anatomical sex matches such gender designation." The legislation defines "anatomical sex" as the "physical condition of being male or female, which is determined by a person’s anatomy." That measure, introduced Jan. 11, does not spell out exactly how school officials would verify a student’s gender. Colin Taylor, the managing editor of Occupy Democrats, and Omar Rivero, the group’s founder, told us in an email that the group "simply took Del. Mark Cole’s offensive proposal to its logical conclusion." "How else would an enforcing official determine whether or not the individual's anatomical sex matches Del. Cole's interpretation of binary gender designation?" they wrote. "Are they expecting children or adults to voluntarily turn themselves in? Will they have to submit to inspection by a doctor? Somebody will have to inspect to prove that an individual is or is not anatomically correct.’" But as our colleagues at the fact-checking website Snopes.com recently noted, there’s nothing in the bill explicitly calling for a genital inspection before students use the bathroom. There are, of course, other possibilities for verification, such as obtaining a doctor’s note, Snopes said. To clarify the matter, Cole introduced a second restroom bill Jan. 12 that calls for schools to verify a student’s "biological sex" by examining their birth certificate. Both his bills would carry a $50 civil fine for each violation by a student. Cole issued a written statement Jan. 13 accusing critics of mischaracterizing his bill, which he said attempts to provide clear policies on who can and can’t use a particular bathroom to shield school divisions from lawsuits. He said he introduced the bill at the request of parents in his district. "Contrary to what has been said about the legislation, it does NOT require genital checks," Cole wrote. He said the legislation would be enforced only when there was a complaint about a student’s choice of bathrooms. "If needed, gender could be verified by looking up student registration information or a birth certificate," he wrote. Cole told us on Jan. 15 that he will propose an amendment for his bill that will make it crystal clear it does not allow genital inspections. "It would be, I think, blatantly unconstitutional for someone to conduct such a search," Cole said. Our ruling Occupy Democrats said Cole "wants schools to check children’s genitals before using bathroom." There is nothing in Cole’s bill that says students will be forced to show their private parts to school officials before they can use the restroom. The group defends its statement by saying "it’s the logical conclusion" of legislation that’s silent on how it would be enforced. But there are other possibilities the group doesn’t consider. Cole suggests using birth certificates and student records to verify a student’s anatomical gender. The loose writing of the bill, which Cole is trying to tighten, leaves the legislator a little bit open to criticism. But it doesn’t entitle Occupy Democrats to make up a genital inspection claim and attach Cole’s name to it. We rate the group’s claim False.

pomt-01083	"About 30 percent" of those released from Guantanamo "have re-entered the fight."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/15/john-mccain/mccain-30-past-guantanamo-detainees-re-enter-fight/	Too many detainees released from Guantanamo are re-engaging in terrorism, according to several key Republicans pushing legislation to keep the prison open. Republican Sens. Kelly Ayotte, N.H., Richard Burr, N.C., Lindsey Graham, S.C., and John McCain, Ariz., proposed a bill Jan. 13 that would restrict detainee transfers from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The bill would prohibit the transfer of high or medium-risk detainees and any transfers to Yemen, as well as increase transparency about detainees’ risk assessments, among other measures. President Barack Obama in recent months has ramped up the number of people he’s transferred out of Guantanamo, in hopes of closing the facility by the time his term ends. During his 2008 campaign, Obama promised to close the prison, which opened in 2002 during the war on terror, but 122 prisoners remain. At a press conference announcing the legislation, McCain, chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, gave a statistic that he’s said before, regarding how many detainees go back to terrorism. "We know for a fact that roughly 30 percent of those who have been released have re-entered the fight, and usually at a very high level, because it's a badge of honor to have been an inmate at Guantanamo Bay," McCain said. "So instead we're going to continue to release batches of prisoners, according to this administration, with no plan, and the extreme likelihood that approximately one out of every three of them will re-enter the fight." Others critical of Obama’s policy on releasing Guantanamo detainees have recited the claim that 30 percent "re-enter the fight" -- including former Vice President Dick Cheney and Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla. It turns out that the numbers aren’t that strong when broken down into their parts. The facts Determining how many released prisoners have "re-entered the fight" is not an exact science, and some dispute the numbers provided by the federal government, particularly because the government does not release the names of individuals on its list. How they arrive at their numbers is not transparent. Here’s what we do know: At least every six months, the Director of National Intelligence, an Obama appointee, publishes a Congress-mandated report detailing the number of former Guantanamo detainees who have re-engaged in terrorist or insurgent activity since the prison opened in 2002. The latest report was published in September 2014 and has data from July 2014. A quick scan of these numbers shows problems with the 30 percent re-engagement claims. Total detainees held since 2002: more than 750 Detainees released: 620 Former detainees confirmed of re-engaging: 107 (17.3 percent) Former detainees suspected of re-engaging: 77 (12.4 percent) To get near that 30 percent figure, we have to group together those confirmed of re-engaging and those suspected of re-engaging. Also, of those 107 confirmed of re-engaging, 48 are either dead or in custody. So in total, 59 of 620 released Guantanamo detainees -- or about 9 percent -- are confirmed by the government to have re-engaged in terrorism and are currently at large. In an email to PolitiFact, McCain spokesman Brian Rogers acknowledged that the 30 percent figure includes both the confirmed and suspected categories. (In the same press conference, Ayotte also cited the 30 percent statistic, but she was careful to note the distinction between confirmed and suspected cases.) Of the first 20 prisoners brought to Guantanamo, only eight remain, according to a report out of the Miami Herald. Of those 12 who are no longer at Guantanamo, only one is known to have re-engaged in terrorist activity. In June 2014, the New America Foundation, a centrist think tank, conducted its own investigation of the 620 released former detainees, using Pentagon reports, media stories and other public information. They found that 54 of them "are either confirmed to be or suspected of engaging in militant activities against either the U.S. or non-U.S. targets." This is about one-third of the government’s figure -- 184 confirmed or suspected of engaging in these activities. In a CNN article, the New America Foundation researchers said it is possible that the publicly available information they used might not have identified some of the former detainees who are engaged in terrorist activity. However, they said they are "confident" in their numbers because terrorist groups "are eager to trumpet the identities of released Guantanamo detainees who join their ranks." In its reports on recidivism rates, the foundation’s researchers have not argued for or against releasing prisoners or closing Guantanamo, but they have called on the government to be more transparent with its list of individuals included in their counts. Stephen Vladeck, a law professor and expert in national security at American University, said the government numbers are suspect because it’s unclear how the government proves that someone has re-engaged in these activities and how much evidence is required. "To paraphrase a Scottish writer, Sen. McCain and his colleagues are using these numbers the way drunks use lampposts—more for support than for illumination," Vladeck said. An ongoing trend? McCain doesn’t necessarily blame Obama outright for the recidivism rate. But, at the very least, he implied that former detainees re-engaging in terrorism is an ongoing trend: "We're going to continue to release batches of prisoners, according to this administration, with no plan, and the extreme likelihood that approximately one out of every three of them will re-enter the fight," he said. The numbers show that the majority of releases that have resulted in re-engagement happened before 2009 -- during former President George W. Bush’s administration. Here’s the total number of released detainees and their re-engagement rates broken down over those two periods: Pre-Jan. 22, 2009 (Bush) Post-Jan. 22, 2009 (Obama) Total detainees released 532 88 Confirmed of re-engaging 101 (19 percent) 6 (6.8 percent) Suspected of re-engaging 76 (14.3 percent) 1 (1.1 percent) We should note Obama has sped up the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries since mid November. The government transferred five Yemenis Jan. 13. This report only includes data up until July 2014. Rogers, McCain’s spokesman, pointed out that "it can take some time for us to identify (former detainees) on the field of battle, and it would make sense that some recent releases may not yet have been identified or engaged." According to the annual report, the Director of National Intelligence has come to expect some relapse into criminal activity from its former detainees, particularly if they are transferred to countries with active conflicts and terrorist recruiting operations. To McCain’s point that those who have "re-entered the fight" do so "usually at a very high level," DePaul University history professor Thomas Mockaitis said this isn’t necessarily the case. "Those released who have been out of the fight for so long would probably not have been important players any longer, if they ever were," he said. "So it is not clear how much their going back to terrorism mattered." He added that, "Neither al-Qaida or (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) is short of recruits." Our ruling McCain said "about 30 percent" of those released from Guantanamo "have re-entered the fight." Government numbers show 17 percent of former Guantanamo detainees are confirmed to have re-engaged in terrorist or insurgent activity, while 12 percent are just suspected of re-engaging. Accounting for those who have been killed or taken back into custody, about 9 percent are confirmed to have re-engaged in terrorism and are currently on the battlefield. Additionally, McCain implies that this is a recent trend, which doesn’t seem to be the case. There are also some experts who dispute the government’s figures. The 30 percent figure doesn’t come out of thin air, but it doesn’t give an accurate picture. We rate McCain’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-06648	"In terms of the wealthiest Americans, we're at the lowest tax rate since the 1950s."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2011/sep/13/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-tax-rates-lowest-195/	Before the Republican candidates for president took center stage in Tampa on Sept. 12, 2011, for the CNN/Tea Party Express debate, Democratic National Committee chairwoman and Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz talked with CNN's Wolf Blitzer about the state of President Barack Obama's jobs bill. Wasserman Schultz was in Florida to counter the argument being made by many Republicans that since the stimulus didn't work, Obama's jobs bill won't either. In the middle of Wasserman Schultz's back-and-forth with Blitzer, the two had a disagreement about some tax figures. Blitzer tried to make the point that wealthy Americans might already pay their fair share while Wasserman Schultz countered that their tax rates are the lowest they've been since the 1950s. Here's the transcript of the conversation: BLITZER: You're here with a lot of Republicans here. You're a Democrat. We will talk politics in a moment. But do you think the Republican leadership in the House, Eric Cantor, John Boehner, they're serious when they say they're willing to compromise, willing to work with the president on this jobs bill? They hate some of it, but they're willing to accept some other parts? WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Well, I'm concerned that they're only willing to take up and consider the parts that are part of their record of supporting allowing the fox to guard the henhouse, focusing only on deregulation of business and not making sure that we can balance the investment, as well as the tax breaks, like the payroll tax. So I would like to take them at their word. BLITZER: From the White House perspective, it is not a take-it-or-leave-it $447 billion package. They're willing to negotiate, to compromise from the White House. Is that right? WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Oh, sure. From Day 1, President Obama has been willing to negotiate. We really haven't had willing partners on the other side. I'm certainly hopeful that the Republican leadership is willing to negotiate. But so far, they seem to only indicate that they will take up whatever it is they support and toss it back... BLITZER: But you shouldn't be overly surprised. They never want to increase taxes. And the president's plan is based in part at least on increasing taxes on wealthier Americans. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Well, you're right. The Republicans continue to refuse to ask for anything from the wealthiest and most fortunate Americans, to pay their fair share. They continue to want to pile all the pain on the backs of people who can least afford it, on the middle class, on small business owners, even though the overwhelming (number) of American people want there to be revenue and want there to be a balance between spending cuts and revenue. BLITZER: All right, we don't have to debate the whole issue of taxes and wealthy and all of that. (But) the wealthiest Americans, they pay the most in taxes already -- 50 percent of Americans don't even pay any federal income tax, because... WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: No, that's actually not true, Wolf. BLITZER: Fifty percent, you don't... WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: We're at the low -- in terms of the wealthiest Americans, we're at the lowest tax rate since the 1950s. BLITZER: I know, but they pay a huge chunk of the federal income tax, the wealthiest Americans. The top 2 percent or 3 percent pay whatever that number is, 30 or 40 percent. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: But they're still at the lowest tax rate since the 1950s. BLITZER: Yes, 35 percent. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: And there have been significant tax breaks from President Obama. BLITZER: All right. We're not going to get into all of that. Blitzer decided to cut off the debate there; at PolitiFact, we're happy to continue. In a previous item, we measured Wasserman Schultz's assertion that Blitzer was wrong to say that "50 percent of Americans don't even pay any federal income tax." Blitzer had his numbers right, so we ruled Wasserman Schutlz's claim False. In this fact-check, we're examining Wasserman Schultz's claim that the wealthiest Americans have the lowest comparative "tax rate since the 1950s." PolitiFact has heard a take on this claim before -- from President Barack Obama. During negotiations on an agreement to raise the debt ceiling, Obama was asked at a press conference whether tax increases should be a part of a deal to approve a new debt ceiling. "You can't reduce the deficit to the levels that it needs to be reduced without having some revenue in the mix," Obama said on June 29, 2011. "The revenue we're talking about isn't coming out of the pockets of middle-class families that are struggling -- it's coming out of folks who are doing extraordinarily well and who are enjoying the lowest tax rates since before I was born. If you're a -- if you are a wealthy CEO or a … hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are lower than they have ever been. They're lower than they've been since the 1950s." The most basic way to address this question is to use the highest marginal rates for ordinary income -- what's commonly called the "top tax bracket." This rate -- which today is 35 percent -- is applied to any money earned above a certain threshold. For 2011, that level is $379,150 for married couples filing jointly, for individuals and for heads of households, and $189,575 for married couples filing separately. Between 1960 and the 1980s, when President Ronald Reagan pushed through landmark tax cuts, top tax brackets had much higher rates than those in place today. For instance, the top rate was 91 percent in 1960 and 70 percent on the eve of Reagan’s election in 1980. By 1988, the top federal income tax rate fell to 28 percent, and it stayed there until 1990. It ticked up to 31 percent for 1991 and 1992, before rising to 39.6 percent in 1993. So, for five tax years -- 1988 through 1992 -- the top tax bracket had a lower rate than today’s top bracket. Put another way, out of 52 tax years since 1960, the top tax rate was lower than today’s only 10 percent of the time. (Today's top tax bracket has been steady since 2003, so in nine additional tax years, the earlier bracket was tied with today's.) In considering Obama's statement we also looked at trying to measure the effective tax rate (as in what a typical taxpayer actually pays after deductions, exemptions and the like.) We won't go through the complicated analysis again -- you can read it here if you like. Suffice it to say, effective tax rates for high-earning Americans are either at their lowest level since 1960 or at least very close to their lowest level. As for Wasserman Schultz, she said: "In terms of the wealthiest Americans, we're at the lowest tax rate since the 1950s." Since 1960 the top marginal income tax rates -- the most common way to measure Wasserman Schultz's statement -- were lower only between 1988 and 1992 than they are today. With that caveat, we rate her claim Mostly True.	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2011-09-13T14:28:48	2011-09-12	['United_States']

pomt-06294	"The median income of a middle class family went down $2,100 from 2001 to 2007."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/18/joe-biden/biden-says-middle-income-earners-lost-ground-reces/	Vice President Joe Biden visited a New Hampshire university Oct. 20, 2011, to promote President Barack Obama’s American Jobs Act before an audience whom he called "the 9/11 generation." Speaking to a full house inside Plymouth State University’s lecture hall, Biden talked about the need to restore the middle class and to bring jobs back to America. He said middle-income-earning Americans have been "under siege," long before the economic recession hit. "In the previous decade, before the current recession, the middle class was getting killed," said Biden. "During that period between 2001-07, productivity of American workers was up 20 percent, but median income of the middle class dropped by $2,100 during this time." Did the median of middle-income households really take a $2,100 hit before the economy hit the fan? We looked into Biden’s claim to find out. First we contacted Biden’s staff to find out which figures they were using to come to the $2,100 decrease in the median income for middle-class households. Tobin Marcus, Biden’s deputy economic policy adviser, told us the vice president was referring to real median household income for working age households. "We’re looking at the core wage-earning households as opposed to retirees," Marcus said. "Working age households" are typically considered houses headed by someone between the ages of 25 and 54, and the median income was chosen to represent middle income wage earners. Biden’s office cited the Census Bureau’s Annual Social and Economic Supplement to the Current Population Surveys for year-ending data for 2000 and 2007. They said they compared inflation-adjusted numbers, using the "annual average" increase column of the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index. We took a look at their numbers, and their calculations checked out. To be sure, we contacted Dennis Delay, an economist with the New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies and a New Hampshire State Forecast Manager for the New England Economic Partnership. He confirmed the calculations Biden’s campaign provided. "I looked at the data sources, and they appear to be correct, and the data calculated correctly," Delay said. Delay then pointed us to a report by the Economic Policy Institute which used the same data. From 2000-07, the Institute said the real median income of working age households fell from $61,574 in 2000 to $59,460 in 2007—a decrease of $2,114. The White House Task Force on the Middle Class cited a "weak labor market" and "anemic job growth of the 2000s" among some of the problems that contributed to the approximately 3.4 percent decline in the median of middle class incomes over the seven years leading up to the economic recession. "Clearly median inflation adjusted income fell much faster during the recession (2007 to present)," Delay said. "But the fall in that indicator during a period of economic expansion (2000 to 2007) is very troubling. I don’t believe any other period of economic expansion saw a commensurate decline in median inflation adjusted income." Our ruling: Vice President Biden said the median income of the middle class dropped by $2,100 from 2001-07, and the numbers check out. We rate Biden’s claim True.

But those born in the 1980s, the much-maligned Millennials, have only a 50-50 chance of doing better (financially) than their parents, despite being the best-educated generation in our history."	true	/california/statements/2017/oct/27/delaine-eastin/do-millennials-have-only-50-50-chance-doing-better/	Candidate for California governor Delaine Eastin says she wants to create "an economy that works for everyone." But with the state’s affordable housing crisis and deep poverty, Eastin believes that’s not happening now, especially for young people. "People become cynical," she wrote in an Oct. 11, 2017 op-ed in the San Francisco Chronicle "because the path to a brighter future is becoming more remote." Eastin continued: "Ninety percent of people born in the 1940s ended up doing better financially than their parents. But those born in the 1980s, the much-maligned Millennials, have only a 50-50 chance of doing better (financially) than their parents, despite being the best-educated generation in our history." Millennials are typically considered the children of the Baby Boomers and older Gen Xers. They were born between the early 1980s and the late 1990s. We wanted to know whether Eastin was right about this dramatic decline in children doing better than their parents. We set out on a fact check. Eastin’s background Eastin is one of several Democrats vying to succeed Gov. Jerry Brown in 2018. She served in the State Assembly from 1986 to 1994 and then as State Superintendent of Public Instruction from 1995 to 2003. She was the first, and remains, the only woman to hold that position. In addition to her desire to create a more equitable economy, Eastin has advocated for greater investment in education, the adoption of universal health care and continued work on climate change during her run for governor. Our research We asked Eastin’s campaign for evidence supporting her claim about millennials and their financial prospects. Jon Murchinson, her campaign spokesman, told us the statement is based on conclusions in a December 2016 study by the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research. The study is called "The Fading American Dream: Trends in Absolute Income Mobility since 1940." Its findings, indeed, show that the fraction of children earning more than their parents has plummeted -- from 90 percent for children born in the 1940s to 50 percent for those born in the 1980s. The study accounted for inflation, taxes and other changes between the generations. "It’s basically a coin flip as to whether you’ll do better than your parents," Stanford economist Raj Chetty, one of the study’s authors, said in a news release announcing the study’s publication in December 2016. SOURCE: The Equality of Opportunity Project Reached by email this week, Chetty told us Eastin’s characterization of this trend "appears accurate." David Grusky, the study’s co-author and director of Stanford’s Center on Poverty and Inequality, added that Eastin’s statement is "a fair summary of our headline conclusion." The Stanford study doesn’t examine whether millennials are the "best-educated generation in our history." That part of Eastin’s statement, however, was substantiated in a recent survey by the Pew Research Center. It found 27 percent of millennial women and 21 percent of millennial men had completed at least a bachelor’s degree by age 33. That was slightly higher than the percentages for men and women at the same age from Baby Boomer to Generation X populations. Inside the study While Eastin appears to have correctly represented the report’s findings, we wanted to know how the Stanford researchers came to their conclusions and whether other researchers agreed with them. Grusky told us the report used millions of Internal Revenue Service records and Census data to compare income between parents and children. The report specifically looked at people born between 1940 and 1984 and measured household income for parents and children when both were 30 years old. Even after accounting for changes between the generations, such as millennials entering the workforce at an older age than their parents, Grusky said the findings on upward mobility did not change significantly. Only slightly more than 50 percent of children at age 40 had higher income compared with their parents’ income when their parents were 30 years old. Unequal growth The Stanford study also accounted for the rapid economic growth experienced during the Baby Boomer generation, when the nation’s post-World War II economy created a surge of new jobs and industries. Assuming both generations had experienced the same economic growth rates, Grusky said only 62 percent of millennials would do better than their parents. The key factor holding back broader financial success of this younger generation, the report concluded, was today’s inequality of growth. Financial success, Grusky said, has become concentrated among a smaller share of families compared with the recent past. Ensuring that financial success is distributed more widely would "make a lot of headway" toward millennials doing better than their parents in future years, the researcher added. The report found declines in upward mobility for millennials across all 50 states. The biggest drops took place in Rust Belt states such as Ohio, Illinois and Michigan, Grusky said. Millennials in states such as California, New York and Massachusetts saw, on average, less substantial declines. SOURCE: The Equality of Opportunity Project For this study, Grusky said, researchers were not able to factor in student debt or address how people of different races and ethnicities are affected by the mobility trends. ‘Behind the starting line’ Tom Allison, deputy policy and research director at Young Invincibles, said the Stanford research "is right in line" with the conclusions reached by his Washington D.C.-based group. Young Invincibles advocates for expanding economic opportunities for young adults and encouraging them to get involved in the political process. Allison said the Stanford study is both transparent and relies on credible public data. Factors from the Great Recession to student debt to globalization have all put millennials "behind the starting line" compared with their parents, he said. "That is a cornerstone of the American Dream," Allison continued, "that if you work hard and play by the rules, then you can exceed the living standards of your parents. And we’ve seen a precipitous decline in that." Our ruling Delaine Eastin recently claimed millennials "have only a 50-50 chance" of doing better financially than their parents, while those born in the 1940s had a 90 percent chance of doing better than their parents. Her claim is supported by a 2016 Stanford study, "The Fading American Dream: Trends in Absolute Income Mobility since 1940." Stanford researchers found stronger economic growth combined with a broader distribution of that growth during the Baby Boomer generation drove greater upward mobility for people born in the 1940s. They said financial success has become more concentrated in recent decades, leaving millennials with much lower odds of doing better than their parents. Even after accounting for changes, such as inflation and millennials starting work at older ages, they found today’s younger generation faces comparatively smaller odds of earning more than their parents. Other research, notably by the advocacy group Young Invincibles, agreed with the Stanford findings. We rate her claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

Bill Richardson took a humorous jab at his fellow candidates who serve in Congress during the Democratic debate in Las Vegas on Nov. 15, 2007, saying their approval ratings are lower than Dick Cheney's and HMOs'. First of all, Congress' approval rating is not as low as 11 percent. Polls in October 2007 have hovered between 19 and 28 percent. Vice President Cheney's approval rating is not polled as often as Congress, but his most recent approval rating, in October 2007, was 23 percent. Polls on health maintenance organizations (HMOs) are even less frequent. But the Gallup Poll annually queries the public on opinions about the honesty and integrity of specific professions. The most recent poll in December 2006 rated HMO managers with approval ratings of about 12 percent, just above advertising practitioners and car salesmen. In fact, in that poll, both senators and congressman rated higher than HMO managers. Senators were at 15 percent and congressman were at 14 percent. So Richardson is wrong on all counts. Congress and Cheney are arguably neck-and-neck for approval ratings, while HMO managers lag behind. We rate his claim False.

pomt-12051	"Just in our first six months in office, Missouri moved up the rankings nine places ... of the best states to do business."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2017/sep/10/eric-greitens/greitens-claim-improving-business-climate-half-tru/	Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens recently announced the launch of a new website aimed at cutting the red tape that he believes is negatively impacting Missouri businesses. This is but one of the initiatives Greitens has taken to grow business in Missouri. In a Facebook Live Q&A (at the 4:48 mark) on Aug. 23, 2017, Greitens shared that Missouri’s economy is on the rise, thanks to his work on cutting regulations. "Just in our first six months in office, Missouri moved up the rankings nine places … in the rankings of the best states to do business," Greitens said in the Facebook Live video. Is that true? One list among many Parker Briden, Greitens’ press secretary, said the governor was citing CNBC’s annual list of America’s Top States for Business, which was published July 11. Missouri moved up nine spaces in 2017, from 31 to 22. Among other lists regarding the best states to do business is Forbes and Chief Executive, both placing Missouri at 25, falling within the range calculated by CNBC for its 2016 and 2017 lists. Five other lists also saw an increase in ranking for Missouri. Another site worth noting is Site Selection, which does not update its ranking until later this year. This could impact how progress is ultimately seen for states like Missouri. While consistent in nature, experts point out that compiling these rankings takes time, indicating that Greitens‘ "mission to turn Missouri around," as his campaign website states, might not truly be all his doing. "Much, if not most, of the data that goes into this ranking was collected more than six months ago. Thus, it may be a little premature to take credit for these changes," said Jeffrey Michael, director of the Center for Business and Policy Research at the University of the Pacific in Stockton, California. While these lists can garner a lot of media attention, they should be viewed cautiously. "The issue of ranking states as ‘best for business’ makes for interesting reading, but I expect most serious economists would be skeptical of any one approach," said Lee McPheters, an economist at the W.P. Carey School of Business at Arizona State University. CNBC’s methodology CNBC’s analysis compares states among 66 factors across 10 categories. The study takes into account what each state deems the most important to its business environment by analyzing each state’s economic development marketing materials. The 10 categories are workforce, infrastructure, cost of doing business, economy, quality of life, technology and innovation, education, business friendliness, access to capital and cost of living. Each category comes with individual point weights. The rankings are based mainly on publicly available sources from federal databases. Methodologies vary across different business surveys. "There are many of these studies with varying methodology and there is not usually a lot of solid economic research to back up most of them," McPheters said. McPheters points out that, in order to see progress for a state, the numbers do not necessarily need to match up, but there must be a consistent improvement among the differing lists. Our ruling Greitens, talking on Facebook Live about his first six months as Missouri governor, said, "Just in our first six months in office, Missouri moved up the rankings nine places … in the rankings of the best states to do business." Greitens credited this change to his cutting regulations, which he said is prompting a rise in the state’s economy. CNBC moved Missouri up nine spots on its annual America’s Top States for Business list. That’s only one ranking, among many, that can be considered, and it’s impossible to say that its methodology is perfect. Experts suggest that, while the methodologies of these lists vary significantly, it might be better to derive a decision if Missouri’s ranking has increased on all of them, which is true among five other lists. However, experts said it is premature for Greitens to assume credit for the improvement in rankings. Greitens is partially accurate. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-10830	"Dr. Paul never votes for legislation unless the proposed measure is expressly authorized by the Constitution."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/17/ron-paul/a-few-exceptions-to-his-small-government-principle/	Paul's campaign Web site declares: "Dr. Paul never votes for legislation unless the proposed measure is expressly authorized by the Constitution." There is no hedging in that promise. Indeed, Paul has earned the nickname "Dr. No" because he has a long history of standing against the tide on even very popular measures because he disagreed on principle. But "never" is a tough standard to meet, and 17 years in Congress covers an awful lot of votes. An examination of Paul's record shows that although he usually adheres to his principle, he has sometimes voted for programs that aren't "expressly authorized" in the Constitution. For example, in the late 1970s and early 1980s, he voted to authorize the continuing operation of NASA and to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday on the third Monday in January. More recently, he voted to change federal law governing organ transplants to make it easier for people to receive donated kidneys. He voted to designate the Ellis Island Library as the "Bob Hope Memorial Library." And he voted to change federal law so the American flag would be displayed on Father's Day. The Constitution discusses many things, but there's nothing that "expressly authorizes" organ transplant law, naming rights for libraries or flags on Father's Day. When we sent the Paul campaign an e-mail asking for an explanation of these votes, spokesman Jesse Benton declined to discuss them in detail. He quibbled over whether the measures technically could be considered legislation. "Your argument over semantics sounds more like a fishing expedition than good journalism," he said. Benton later e-mailed to say that one explanation for the NASA vote was that the agency "has a national security component." We checked with a congressional historian and two constitutional law professors who said they believe those votes do not meet Paul's claim. A.E. Dick Howard, a law professor at the University of Virginia, said Paul's claim "just doesn't stand up. ...My guess is you could find a hundred other examples." So we find that Paul's absolutist statement "never" is false.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2007-09-17T00:00:00	2007-09-17	['None']
pomt-05346	Says "I am happy to decline PERS so that the County can save over $68,000 over a four year term that would have been paid on my behalf."	half-true	/oregon/statements/2012/may/11/john-ludlow/will-clackamas-county-taxpayers-save-68000-over-fo/	In a previous item, PolitiFact Oregon ruled True a statement by John Ludlow, a candidate for Clackamas County Commission chair, that he is the only person in the four-way race who will refuse to join the Public Employees Retirement System. He faces Clackamas County Commission chairwoman Charlotte Lehan, county commissioner Paul Savas and state Rep. Dave Hunt in Tuesday’s election. Snubbing PERS is a nice symbolic pledge for someone running on a platform of limited government. It also won’t hurt Ludlow, who is 63 years old, as much as it would someone who is further away from retirement. But the next part of Ludlow’s claim really caught our attention. In a Facebook post dated March 30, he wrote, "I am happy to decline PERS so that the County can save over $30,000 per year that would have been paid on my behalf." (The post was changed Tuesday; we’ll explain below.) That sounded like a lot of money saved, given that a county commissioner’s annual salary is $81,000. We checked it out. In doing so, Ludlow clarified to PolitiFact Oregon and on Facebook that by declining PERS, "the County can save over $68,000 over a four year term that would have been paid on my behalf." We asked Ludlow why he had claimed $30,000 in savings a year, and now $68,000 over four years. He said it’s hard getting solid numbers from the Public Employees Retirement System. "I am now satisfied that the last numbers quoted by me are the correct numbers," he wrote us. Hmmm. We don’t think politicians, aspiring or otherwise, should claim savings without evidence. That’s careless. But let’s get back to how much county taxpayers will save should Ludlow decline retirement benefits. The county position pays $80,868 a year This is how public retirement payments work: Every employer pays a "contribution rate," depending on the type of employer and type of employee. The rates are set in advance. In the case of Clackamas County, the employer contribution rate is 11.99 percent for general service workers for the 2011-13 budget period. The 11.99 percent includes 6.13 percent that the employer puts in for a member’s retirement, plus 5.86 percent to cover the system’s "unfunded actuarial liability," or the money needed to pay for current and future retirees. In addition, the county pays -- or "picks up" -- the 6 percent the employee is required to contribute on his or her behalf. That adds up to $14,500 a year. But David Crosley, a spokesman for PERS, said the actual amount of money saved -- or avoided -- should Ludlow decline is closer to $9,800 a year, or a little more than $39,000 over four years. That’s because the county needs to kick in for unfunded actuarial liability anyway, regardless of whether Ludlow declines PERS for himself. "That amount gets spread over fewer people," Crosley said. "They’re not saving that in the long term." But let’s look at this from the county’s perspective, which is what Ludlow relies on. Marc Gonzales, the county’s finance director, confirmed the county budgets about $17,247 a year per commissioner for retirement-related costs. Why is it higher? In part, because the county calculates the figure with longer-term employees in mind, and they have higher retirement costs. Tim Heider, a spokesman for Clackamas County, wrote in an email that "the county would not incur any PERS cost for an employee who declines enrollment." So we’ve gone from $30,000 a year to roughly $17,000 a year to $9,800 a year. It’s undeniable that Ludlow will save taxpayers money by declining to join PERS, should he win. But he’s off on how much, and whether it would have been paid on his behalf. It’s certainly not the $30,000 a year he originally claimed. It may be $17,000 as he now claims, but that’s because the county has budgeted generously. (Ludlow as a new member will not cost taxpayers as much as employees who have been in the system for a long time.) The Public Employees Retirement System estimates money that would have gone to him is closer to $10,000 a year. Ludlow’s revised statement is partially true but missing information.

pomt-00177	Says Katie Porter is part of a "radical group of Democrats with an extreme agenda to abolish ICE."	false	/california/statements/2018/oct/22/mimi-walters/katie-porter-has-called-immigration-reform-not-abo/	U.S. Rep. Mimi Walters connected her challenger Katie Porter to Democrats who have voiced support for abolishing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, better known as ICE. But how true is Walters’ attack? The mailer from Walters to residents of California’s 45th Congressional District claims the "press has reported that Katie Porter is part of a radical group of Democrats running for Congress" and says she has an "extreme agenda" that supports abolishing ICE. It goes on to criticize Porter for supporting sanctuary city laws and that she wants free college and Medicare for illegal immigrants. For the purposes of this fact-check, we focused on the claim that Porter’s agenda includes abolishing ICE. It actually doesn’t. What media reports is the mailer referring to? The Walters campaign told us that the ICE charge comes from a McClatchy DC bureau article from Sept. 14. But the news story doesn’t back up the mailer’s claim. McClatchy reported that Porter is part of a "battery" of "even more liberal" candidates pushing for single-payer health care and abolishing ICE. The original version of the article had a sentence that said Porter and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in New York have both "pushed the ideological envelope for the party’s progressive wing, even popularizing once-radical positions like single-payer health care or abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency." This line was featured on the mailer. However, that reference was updated and clarified in the story three days later. (We spoke with McClatchy reporter Alex Roarty, who confirmed the change.) The section now reads that the candidates have "pushed the ideological envelope for the party’s progressive wing. Porter has embraced the once-radical position of single-payer health care while Ocasio-Cortez supports abolishing the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency." Perhaps a minor alteration in the story, but it’s a big hit on the accuracy of the mailer’s claim that Porter wants to abolish ICE. What Katie Porter has said about ICE Democrats have argued in the past that ICE, which formed in the aftermath of 9/11, needs to be abolished to prevent mistreatment of undocumented immigrants. But the notion gained new life over the summer amid stories of migrant children being separated from their families at the U.S. border. Porter’s campaign said she does not want to abolish ICE. We did not find evidence that she has called for ending the agency like some other candidates. The campaign pointed us to a Mercury News article from August. The story discusses how none of the Democrats running in the 10 most competitive House races in California support dissolving the agency, citing a survey of the candidates. It then lists each candidate’s comments on ICE, and quotes Porter saying that the immigration agency "should be focused on its core public safety mission, not targeting families. The real issue here is the failure of Donald Trump’s leadership." On her campaign website, Porter says that she believes the U.S. needs immigration reform "that will provide a fair pathway to citizenship for those who are undocumented." Our ruling Walters claimed that Porter has an extreme liberal agenda that supports abolishing ICE. The mailer relies on a news article that said she supports such actions, but that piece has since been updated, stopping short of saying the Democrat wants to do away with the agency and mentioning her position for single-payer health care instead. We also found comments from Porter expressing frustration with the agency, and that she supports changes to it, but not dissolving it completely. The claim is inaccurate, so we rate it False.

pomt-11743	"Gloria Allred Accuser **ADMITS** She Tampered With Roy Moore’s Yearbook 'Signature.' "	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/08/blog-posting/no-roy-moore-accuser-didnt-tamper-or-forge-yearboo/	A conspiracy-minded website attempted to cast doubt on evidence presented by one of eight women who accused Roy Moore of sexual misconduct in a misleading headline days ahead of the Alabama Senate race. "WE CALLED IT! Gloria Allred Accuser **ADMITS** She Tampered With Roy Moore’s Yearbook ‘Signature’ (VIDEO)," the headline reads on The Gateway Pundit. We found similar posts on Breitbart, "Roy Moore Accuser Beverly Nelson Admits She Forged Yearbook," and on the blog Silence is Consent, "Roy Moore accuser admits she forged yearbook inscription." Beverly Young Nelson accused Roy Moore of groping her when she was 16 years old and he, in his 30s, was the deputy district attorney of Etowah County. As evidence, Nelson presented a note she said Moore wrote in her high school yearbook before the incident took place. Nelson has been represented by celebrity lawyer Gloria Allred. The inscription reads, "To a sweeter, more beautiful girl I could not say Merry Christmas. Christmas 1977. Love, Roy Moore, D.A." Below the signature reads 12-22-77, Olde Hickory House. Moore’s defenders have pointed out the date and place seem to have been written in different ink and handwriting than the note. In a Dec. 8 Good Morning America interview with Nelson about Moore’s response to the allegations (he denies them) and her experience since taking her story public, Nelson addressed the inconsistency. Nelson said she added the date and place of the inscription. "He signed your yearbook?" ABC News reporter Tom Llamas asked Nelson. "He did sign it," Nelson said. "And you made some notes underneath?" Llamas asked. "Yes," Nelson said. "Nelson said she did make notes to the inscription, but the message was all Roy Moore," the video voiceover says. To summarize, Nelson says she added the time and location to the inscription. But she says the note and signature was from Moore. That’s not what the headlines of the Gateway Pundit, Breitbart or Silence is Consent. All three say Nelson said she either tampered with Moore’s signature or forged the inscription. There’s no evidence of that. Yet, the Gateway Pundit wrote that "Nelson admitting that she added to Moore’s alleged signature is the final nail in the coffin," the story reads. "Allred’s accuser is nothing but a fame-seeking fraud." Fox News made a similar misstatement in their headline and story about the ABC report, which they later walked back. "Roy Moore accuser admits she forged part of yearbook inscription attributed to Alabama Senate candidate," the original Fox News headline read. It was later edited to say she wrote, rather than forged, part of the inscription. The story did not include a clarification or correction when we last looked at it. The original Fox News story also said Nelson "wrote part of the disputed note" without specifying what she wrote, whereas the edited version clarified that "she added the date and place in the inscription." Our ruling The Gateway Pundit’s headline reads "WE CALLED IT! Gloria Allred Accuser **ADMITS** She Tampered With Roy Moore’s Yearbook ‘Signature’ (VIDEO)." But Nelson does not claim she tampered with Moore’s actual signature. She said she added a time and location below the signature. Nelson still attributes the note and signature to Moore. We rate the statement Pants on Fire. Correction (Dec. 11, 2017): We originally described the women's allegations against Roy Moore as sexual assault. We believe sexual misconduct is a more accurate phrase and have changed the story accordingly.

pomt-09453	"There's almost 1 million Texans who are unemployed and that's an all-time record number in our state."	true	/texas/statements/2010/mar/06/bill-white/white-says-almost-1-million-people-are-unemployed-/	Former Houston Mayor Bill White, who won the 2010 Democratic nomination for governor Tuesday, wasted no time attacking Gov. Rick Perry's legacy. Hint: White doesn't think it's shaping up so well. "Rick Perry and his consultants and his insiders will take credit for all the good times in Texas," White said. "But they won't take responsibility for the fact that today, there's almost 1 million Texans who are unemployed and that's an all-time record number in our state." The gauntlet is thrown. Do the jobless numbers back White up? According to the Texas Workforce Commission, more than one million people were unemployed in January, but that includes seasonal employees who were laid off after the holidays. The seasonally-adjusted data shows that 996,863 were unemployed — about 3,000 shy of 1 million. That number has been increasing steadily since early 2008. The latest count also is a Texas record, topping the 765,894 residents who were out of work in October 1986. But a head count isn't the only way to judge joblessness over time. We looked at the rate of unemployment, too. The state rate — 8.2 percent as of January — has also crept up since 2008, due at least in part to a nationwide recession. But it hasn't yet matched the worst times of the 1980s recession in Texas, which was driven by an oil bust. The monthly unemployment rate peaked twice that decade, reaching 8.4 percent in January 1983 and 9.3 percent in September 1986. The annual unemployment stats are similar. The 2009 unemployment rate was 7.6 percent — the same as the rate in 1992. But the state's annual unemployment rate has been higher; it was 8.5 percent in 1987 and 8.9 percent in 1986. So the unemployment rate isn't yet at its highest in Texas — not that having the third highest rate is anything to celebrate. Anyway, White didn't cast the rate as highest-ever. Nor did Nathan Daschle, executive director of the Democratic Governors Association, when he blasted Perry on primary election night for an "unemployment rate (that's) higher than it's been in decades." Two decades, to be precise. White is correct that the number of unemployed Texans — almost 1 million — is an all-time high. We rate his statement as True.
