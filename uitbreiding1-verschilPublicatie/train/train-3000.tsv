pomt-04051	"We just had someone last week in Neenah near a school kill someone with a bow and arrow."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jan/28/scott-walker/talking-gun-control-and-sandy-hook-gov-scott-walke/	Questions about gun control were on the mind of reporters when Gov. Scott Walker held a news conference in Madison on Jan. 10, 2013. Reporters, including one from the Wall Street Journal, asked the first-term governor about the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, where 20 children and six adults were killed in December 2012 by a man with a semi-automatic weapon. Did the carnage affect Walker’s stance on gun control? The governor responded that a variety of factors, including the mental health of the perpetrator, need to be considered to prevent future tragic events such as Sandy Hook and the August 2012 shooting at the Sikh temple in Oak Creek. Walker said too much attention is paid to the weapon in such shootings and cited a recent case as an example: "We just had someone last week in Neenah near a school kill someone with a bow and arrow." He added that if gun control efforts are "just focused on the weapon, that gets away from the question of who are the people committing these heinous acts and what is it that’s happening that we’re not able to prevent them from doing that." Walker has enjoyed considerable support from the National Rifle Association, and the group has given him an A-plus rating. His response to the gun control question was in line with groups fighting restrictions on guns: Don’t blame the weapons. There was only one problem with Walker’s statement about the bow and arrow murder. It never happened. We asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie to explain the governor’s comment the day after he spoke. He responded three days later with this emailed statement: "The Governor misspoke when he said someone was killed. I believe he was referring the recent standoff that involved a bow and arrow." Winnebago County Sheriff’s Department Capt. David Mack provided the details, starting with the most important one: "No one got killed. I know because I was there." In fact there were no serious injuries in the Jan. 3, 2013, domestic dispute in the Town of Clayton, located just west of Neenah. According to Mack: Authorities were called at 9:16 a.m. to a home after receiving reports of a disturbance between Shawn Coenen, 21, and his father. During the dispute outside the house, "the son shot an arrow at the father, but the arrow did not strike the father," Mack said. Instead, it hit a vehicle. Coenen was inside the house when authorities arrived. Initially, police weren’t certain that he was inside, so, as a precaution, they sent several officers to Clayton Elementary School, which is 2.5 miles away. "The school was in session, and they were advised about the situation and placed in lockdown," Mack said. Authorities determined that Coenen was in the house and were told by family members that there were a dozen firearms inside, but that the guns were locked in a gun cabinet. The SWAT team and crisis negotiators were called, and Coenen was arrested without incident at 1:22 p.m., Mack said. Coenen faces three felony charges -- second degree reckless endangerment, failure to comply with an officer, and being a felon in possession of a firearm. Our rating Reporters asked Walker about his views of gun control in the wake Sandy Hook school shooting. Walker responded by discussing a homicide involving a bow and arrow near a Neenah school. Trouble was, there wasn’t such a homicide. What’s more, while the incident was near a school (2.5 miles away) it didn’t have anything to do with the school. And the SWAT team was called because the suspect was holed up inside the house -- with potential access to guns. Finally, Walker’s staff allowed his statement to go uncorrected for four days and only admitted that it was incorrect after being asked about it by PolitiFact. Pants on Fire.

pomt-06325	"In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker has created a manufacturing-led jobs recovery. 30,000 new jobs were created this year, with 15,000 created in the struggling manufacturing sector."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/nov/11/state-tea-party-express-state-tea-party-express/tea-party-group-says-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-ha/	Gov. Scott Walker plays a prominent role in a nationally televised ad criticizing President Barack Obama’s proposed jobs legislation. The ad, titled "The Perry-Walker Way," cites job creation in Texas under Gov. Rick Perry and in Wisconsin under Walker. Both Walker and Perry, a presidential candidate, are Republicans. The ad says the Obama plan calls for more government spending, increased regulations and higher taxes on those who create jobs. It cites the performance of Perry and Walker as offering a "better way" to create jobs, and then continues: "In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker has created a manufacturing-led jobs recovery ... 30,000 new jobs were created this year, with 15,000 in the struggling manufacturing sector." We’ve had a lot of jobs-related statements lately. Does this one add up? Are we really in a manufacturing-led jobs recovery? We asked the Sacramento, Calif.-based State Tea Party Express for back up on the group’s claim about Walker’s performance on jobs. Spokesman Taylor Budowich sent us to a familiar source: PolitiFact Wisconsin, and specifically our Walk-O-Meter which tracks the governor’s campaign promises. Of course, the top campaign promise made by Walker is that the state would create 250,000 private-sector jobs during his four-year term. Each month we update the Walk-O-Meter using state data, for a promise that remains In the Works. Let’s dip -- again -- into the numbers. The Tea Party ad aired in the middle of October 2011. The latest state employment numbers available at that point said there were 2,346,800 private-sector jobs in Wisconsin in August 2011, an increase of 29,600 since Walker took office in January 2011. On the manufacturing front, a state report said there were 450,000 manufacturing jobs in the state, up 16,100 from when Walker took office. (We’re not using the most recent jobs report, issued Oct. 20, because the State Tea Party Express ad began to air before that report was issued. The latest report says the overall change in the number of jobs since Walker took office is 29,300, 900 fewer than the previous month.) So, the numbers are essentially accurate, but they are just part of the groups’ claim. The group maintains those numbers are evidence of a "manufacturing-led jobs recovery." Are we in one? A closer look at the month-to-month numbers show the situation is not nearly as encouraging as the ad suggests. Indeed, the state lost a net 11,600 private sector jobs in July and August. (And another 900 in September,). Even Walker’s administration recognize this as a concern. On Oct. 21 2011, the state Department of Revenue said that by 2014 the state will have added only 136,000 jobs in the private sector compared with 2010 -- far short of the 250,000 net new jobs promised. The department’s report says the manufacturing sector has recovered about a third of the jobs lost in the recession. It projects that sector will continue to grow this year, then slow between 2012 and 2014. "In spite of this sustained growth," the report states, "employment in this sector by the end of 2014 will still be 27,500 jobs short of its previous peak eight years ago." Beyond all that, the Tea Party -- like Walker -- highlights the private sector jobs. But the ad does not let viewers in on that fact. There is a somewhat different picture when you look at all jobs, including public-sector ones -- police, firefighters, teachers, sanitation workers and more. In Wisconsin, government employment as of August was 419,600, up 500 from when Walker took office. (That number tumbled in September to 409,300 - 10,000 fewer jobs than when the governor took office. That sharp decline was shown in the Oct. 20 report, after the ad began running.) The state’s seasonally adjusted unemployment rate is 7.8 percent for September, compared with 9.1 percent nationally. So the overall picture is not as rosy as the ad proclaims. Our conclusion With unemployment stubbornly high, jobs and job creation are central themes in state and national politics. In this case, the national Tea Party says Walker "created a manufacturing-led jobs recovery" that led to the "creation of 30,000 new jobs." The numbers are essentially on the money. But the group makes a broad statement about jobs, when it is looking only at the private-sector side of the equation. What’s more, it does not reflect that the most recent months have seen a loss of jobs and the Walker administration itself sees weaknesses in the economy and future job growth. We rate the group’s claim Half True.	None	State Tea Party Express	None	None	None	2011-11-11T09:00:00	2011-10-11	['Wisconsin', 'Scott_Walker_(politician)']

pomt-12940	"More college graduates are living at home than in decades."	true	/new-york/statements/2017/jan/09/andrew-cuomo/more-college-graduates-living-home-decades/	Congratulations graduate! Now go clean your room, help make dinner for the family and do the laundry. More college graduates are living with their families than in decades, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said in his State of the State speech Monday in New York City. "Student debt now surpasses credit card debt and consumer debt and more college graduates are living at home than in decades," Cuomo said. Cuomo’s comment came as part of his push to provide tuition-free public college to students from families earning $125,000 or less each year. Cuomo said graduates with less debt are more likely to afford living on their own. Is Cuomo right that more college graduates are living at home? Where the graduates live The Pew Research Center provided the latest analysis on this topic in May 2016. The center relied on data from the U.S. Census Bureau to track the percentage of young adults, ages 18 to 34, who moved back home after graduating college. Nineteen percent of graduates lived at home in 2014, according to the data. That’s compared with 46 percent of graduates who either lived with a spouse or partner. The remaining graduates lived alone, with roommates, or had a different living arrangement. The percentage of graduates living at home is the highest since the 1940s, when 29 percent of college-educated young adults lived at home, Pew said. By 1950, only 12 percent of graduates lived at home. That number hovered between 10 and 13 percent until 2006, when 15 percent of graduates lived at home. Since then, the latest data shows the percentage increasing. Census Bureau data shows the number of college graduates has increased each decade since 1940. That indicates the number of college graduates moving back home increased between decades even when the percentage stayed flat. Not just graduates The trend is the same for young adults who did not attend college. Thirty-six percent of those young adults were living at home in 2014, compared with 35 percent in 1940. That number dropped to 20 percent by 1960 but has increased since. About 32 percent of young adults lived at home in 2014 regardless of education level, up from 20 percent in 1960. That’s not an all-time high, but Pew noted that it is the first time in more than 130 years that young adults were more likely to be living at home than with a spouse or partner. About 36 percent of young adults were reported as living alone or in a different living arrangement, Pew said. Chris Tilly, an urban planning professor from the University of California Los Angeles, said the increase is caused by rising urban housing costs and a changing labor market. "There’s just a much higher level of economic uncertainty," Tilly said. "A lot of work is now precarious in a lot of ways. It’s part-time. It’s unsure. It’s stringing together a bunch of gigs." Our ruling Cuomo said "more college graduates are living at home than in decades." Cuomo is right, according to a Pew Research Center analysis. The percentage of college graduates living with their parents is at its highest since the 1940s.

pomt-00595	"Sixty million Americans depend on Social Security, and one-third of all the seniors in America depend on Social Security for 90 percent of their income."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/04/mike-huckabee/mike-huckabee-says-one-third-seniors-depend-social/	At a Disney World powwow of GOP stars, Mike Huckabee took a jab at Jeb Bush, in Bush’s own state of Florida and on a particularly Floridian issue: Social Security. Speaking at the Florida Economic Growth Summit on June 2, 2015, the former governor of Arkansas and current presidential candidate alluded to Bush’s comments on reducing benefits and raising the retirement age. Huckabee called the idea political and economic suicide. "Sixty million Americans depend on Social Security, and one-third of all the seniors in America depend on Social Security for 90 percent of their income" he said. "The government took that money from you involuntarily when you started working – with the promise that you’d get that money back when you retire. For the government to even think about breaking that promise is absolutely ridiculous." Huckabee’s numbers intrigued us. We reached out to his campaign but did not hear back, so we delved into the statistics. The actual number of people who receive benefits is slightly higher than what Huckabee said at 64 million. The majority of recipients, about 43 million, are over age 65—we’ll get to this group later. Of the remaining beneficiaries, in 2013, Social Security constituted at least half of the income for 61 percent of disabled recipients and for 44 percent of non-disabled beneficiaries (survivors of deceased workers and early retirees), according to a Social Security Administration spokeswoman. The latest data from the Social Security Administration show that Huckabee got the second number right, if we assume by "seniors" he meant those over age 65. In 2012, Social Security constituted 90 percent or more of income for 36 percent of that age group. Huckabee’s source, however, may be flawed. Some experts say the Social Security Administration’s definition of income—which only includes recurring flows like monthly benefits -- doesn’t take into account sporadic sources like money siphoned out of an IRA or 401k, typically on an as-needed basis. Leaving these out could mean discrepancies as wide as $18 billion versus $220 billion, according to a study at Boston College’s Center for Retirement Research. Just how many people have these plans and how much cash is in them? The U.S. Government Accountability Office broke it down by income quintiles for retirees age 65 to 74: Bottom Second Third Fourth Top Percent with savings (401k/IRA) 9% 33% 48% 65% 84% Median savings amount (no reliable estimate) (no reliable estimate) $104,000 $144,000 $468,000 Without factoring in the savings plans, the SSA probably overstated Social Security’s share of retirement income, especially for wealthier retirees, experts say. In 2008, the estimate for Social Security’s slice of the total income pie was 20 percentage points more than what tax filings showed, according to a study in the Journal of Retirement. "Huckabee is probably technically not correct since the numbers he relies on are flawed, though he’d have no real reason to know this, " said Andrew Biggs, who used to run the SSA’s policy office during the George W. Bush administration and now researches Social Security reform at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Biggs has written extensively on this topic. Here’s the catch to the catch: Half of Americans don’t have retirement savings at all, according to the GAO. This means that estimates for the people who rely the most on Social Security (low- and middle-income households) may only be marginally off. So Huckabee is correct, experts agree, in his point that many Americans rely heavily on Social Security (too heavily, to the point that middle- and upper-income families are not saving enough on their own, said Biggs). Most people who receive Social Security need the safety net, said Melissa Favreault, an expert on retirement and social programs at The Urban Institute, a public policy think tank. For many recipients, it’s "absolutely vital income," she said. AARP spokesperson David Bruns told us the same thing. "There are very substantial number of people who are disproportionatelyfemale, disproportionatelyminority, disproportionatelyblue collar, for whom Social Security is critical," he said. "I’ve run the math for myself: 40 percent of our retirement income will come from Social Security and I have a government pension. My wife and I have saved as hard as we can for all of our lives. We are not the only ones." Our ruling Huckabee said, "60 million Americans depend on Social Security, and one-third of all the seniors in America depend on Social Security for 90 percent of their income." Huckabee’s numbers reflect official statistics, though slightly lowballed: About 64 million Americans receive Social Security benefits and about 36 percent of seniors depend on it for 90 percent of their income, according to the Social Security Administration. Some take issue with those statistics, saying they understate the importance of irregular sources of income and therefore may overstate the importance of Social Security. However, experts agree with the gist of Huckabee’s idea: Broadly speaking, Social Security beneficiaries need the cash to make ends meet. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-10332	Obama "voted against critical resources: no to individual body armor, no to helicopters, no to ammunition, no to aircraft."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/23/republican-national-committee-republican/rnc-goes-cherry-picking/	On the heels of a McCain ad attacking Barack Obama for his 2007 vote against war funding, the Republican National Committee has ratcheted up the rhetoric with a radio ad that claims Obama voted against helicopers, ammunition and even body armor. "When it came time to act, he voted against critical resources," the announcer says about Obama. "No to individual body armor, no to helicopters, no to ammunition, no to aircraft. The bill Obama opposed even had funding for veterans' medical facilities and rehabilitation programs. And why did he say no? Obama chose Washington politics over the needs of our military." A casual listener might not notice that the ad's evidence is a single vote — a May 2007 appropriations bill. It's true that Obama voted against that bill, which raises two questions. Did the bill contain the items mentioned in the ad? And were those really what Obama was voting against? On the first question, yes, the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans' Care, Katrina Recovery and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007 , which Obama voted against, included provisions for purchasing body armor, helicopters, ammunition and aircraft, and for funding veterans' medical facilities and rehabilitation programs. But no, those items are not the reason Obama voted against the bill. As he took pains to explain at the time, he voted against it because it did not include a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq. Congress' power of the purse is a crucial tool of leverage for influencing the president's foreign policy, and with this protest vote, Obama and 13 other Democratic senators sought to push President Bush to draw down troop levels in Iraq. ''This country is united in our support for our troops, but we also owe them a plan to relieve them of the burden of policing someone else's civil war,'' Obama said at the time. ''Gov. (Mitt) Romney and Sen. McCain clearly believe the course we are on in Iraq is working, but I do not.'' Implying Obama's vote was specifically against aircraft, veterans' facilities and the like is misleading — about as misleading as it would be to say McCain voted for the bill because it funded tornado aid in Kansas and bereavement payments to relatives of deceased congressmen, to name two of the many items in the bill not related to the war. In some ways this ad illustrates the common wisdom that senators don't make good candidates for president, because senators often vote on controversial issues, and any one vote can be pulled out of context. For example, the Obama campaign, in responding to recent attacks, pointed to a 2005 vote to increase funding for armored vehicles. Obama voted to increase funding; McCain voted against it. The vote failed, largely along party lines. The claim in the RNC ad is technically true, but it leaves out important context that it was a single vote, and it distorts Obama's record by making him sound like he advocates cutting off funds for troops in the field. On several other occasions, Obama has voted in favor of funding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Earlier this year, Obama voted for a funding bill that passed 92-6. McCain was absent. In 2006, Obama voted for a war supplemental that passed 77-21. McCain opposed that bill, joining a group of Republicans who felt the legislation contained extraneous and unnecessary spending. In a news report, the Los Angles Times noted the Republicans "risked being labeled as voting against the troops to take a stand against what they considered excessive spending." Although the ad bases its claims on a kernel of truth — Obama did vote against the 2007 bill — the RNC gives the impression that Obama opposes body armor, helicopters, ammunition and aircraft generally. The RNC ad is misleading enough to merit a label of Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Republican National Committee	None	None	None	2008-07-23T00:00:00	2008-07-23	['None']
pomt-12774	"This year, 97 Missouri counties have only one insurer participating in the Obamacare exchanges. Last year, every Missouri county had at least two insurance options. In addition, most Missourians will see an increase in their premiums, with some facing an increase upward of 40 percent"	half-true	/missouri/statements/2017/feb/22/roy-blunt/roy-blunt-leaves-out-context-missouris-health-insu/	As a Republican-controlled Congress continues to advance plans to defund and eventually dismantle former President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, Missouri’s Sen. Roy Blunt has once again echoed his reasoning for supporting a repeal. "This year, 97 Missouri counties have only one insurer participating in the Obamacare exchanges," the Republican said in a Jan. 11 press release. "Last year, every Missouri county had at least two insurance options." It’s not the first time Blunt has mentioned the numbers, which his office noted were from HealthCare.gov (the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services’ website where individuals can enroll in health care). As insurance providers pull out of markets and premiums rise around the country, the health care exchange is certainly facing substantial changes. Even in that context, though, Blunt’s figures paint a drastic picture for Missourians, and we wanted to fact-check his statement. 97 out of 114 counties On the numbers, Blunt is correct. Ninety-seven Missouri counties will only have one insurance provider offering coverage on the health care exchange this year, according to data compiled and released by the official exchange provider, HealthCare.gov, and synthesized by the Missouri Hospital Association and the Kaiser Family Foundation. Fifteen counties and the city of St. Louis will have two providers, and two counties that include large swaths of Kansas City will have three. In 2016, 112 Missouri counties and the city of St. Louis all had at least three insurance providers participating in the health care exchange. No county had only one. The reduction in coverage is primarily the result of two major insurance providers exiting the individual state exchange at the beginning of the year. The providers, UnitedHealth Group and Aetna (known in Missouri as Coventry Health Care), are both staying in the state in other markets, but have opted out of participating in the exchange. "I wouldn’t say it’s impacting care as much as it’s impacting the ability to choose the provider you want," said Dave Dillon, vice president of public and media relations at the Missouri Hospital Association. In essence, he explained, it’s possible for an individual not to have the option to choose a plan that would allow them to visit their regular doctor. With this lack of choices, Dillon said, "clearly the incentive between insurance companies to compete in cost just isn’t there." During the open enrollment period, which ran from Nov. 1 to Jan. 31, nearly 250,000 Missourians enrolled in some form of insurance provided by the health care law. Metropolitan areas continue to have choice One notable feature of Missouri’s insurance exchange in 2017 is that all of the counties in the state’s two metropolitan hubs, Kansas City and St. Louis, will continue to have more than one provider. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, of Missouri’s roughly 6 million residents, about 63 percent live in the 17 counties and one city that will continue to have at least two provider choices. Nationally, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the trend is similar. Of exchange enrollees living in metropolitan areas, 62 percent will continue to have a choice of three or more providers while only 18 percent will have the option of only one provider. For those living in rural areas, the numbers are almost reversed. Forty-one percent of those enrolled in the exchange living in rural areas will have only one provider option while 29 percent will have three or more options. The out-of-pocket price In addition, most Missourians will see an increase in their premiums, with some facing an increase upward of 40 percent" — is also statistically accurate, according to the Missouri Hospital Association and the Kaiser Family Foundation. However, it does not accurately portray the out-of-pocket price Missourians will face in 2017. While premiums are on the rise in Missouri, as they are in the rest of the country, so, too, are the tax credits designed to offset the cost that the consumer bears. Speaking on the increases in price on the exchange this year, Dillon said, "The individual was not exposed to the full cost of the increase of the sticker price." The rhetoric surrounding premium increases often looks only at the sticker price and not the out-of-pocket price, he said. Again using data from HealthCare.gov, the Missouri Hospital Association compiled the costs of premiums both before and after the tax credit in the 10 Missouri health insurance marketplace rating areas. Looking strictly at the second lowest-cost silver plan, which is the plan used by HealthCare.gov to determine the financial assistance an individual or family may receive, eight of the ten counties will see an out-of-pocket monthly price of $26.52. Data for the other two counties was unavailable. So while premiums for the second lowest cost silver plan in each of the eight counties rose in 2017, the out-of-pocket cost saw a change of less than one percent — less than a dollar. Our ruling Blunt said: "This year, 97 Missouri counties have only one insurer participating in the Obamacare exchanges. Last year, every Missouri county had at least two insurance options. In addition, most Missourians will see an increase in their premiums, with some facing an increase upward of 40 percent." Blunt’s figures are misleading. Both of his claims use cherry-picked figures that excluded the necessary data to accurately represent the state of the health care exchange in Missouri. Although most counties only have one insurer participating in a health care exchange, a majority of Missourians have more than one option. And while premium costs have seen a dramatic rise, so have tax credits meant to blunt the impact of higher costs. Blunt’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details.

pomt-00113	"George Holding has voted 13 times to deny Kevin, and the 300,000 people like him in the 2nd Congressional District, coverage" for their pre-existing conditions.	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/29/linda-coleman/holding-voted-quite-consistently-healthcare-bills/	During a debate in the 2nd Congressional District in North Carolina, Republican Rep. George Holding made his stance on coverage for pre-existing health conditions clear when the topic of health care came up. "I support protecting folks who have pre-existing conditions," Holding said, according to The News and Observer. "I don’t know of any policymaker in Washington that wants to prevent people with pre-existing conditions from being able to get health care." His Democratic challenger, Linda Coleman, thinks otherwise. Coleman named a person with a pre-existing condition and said "George Holding has voted 13 times to deny Kevin, and the 300,000 people like him in the 2nd congressional district, coverage." In an ad from Coleman’s campaign, Kevin LeCount – a friend of Coleman’s who had leukemia, according to her campaign – says, "there are more than 300,000 people in this district, whose lives (Holding) put in danger when (Holding) voted to cut protections for people with pre-existing conditions." The Affordable Care Act, passed in 2010, bans insurers from denying anyone coverage based on pre-existing conditions. It was legal to do so before. What has Holding voted for? There have been numerous attempts in Congress to fully or partially repeal Obamacare. They had voted 54 times through 2014 to repeal parts of the health care legislation or the whole thing, according to the Washington Post. Not all of the legislation Congress has voted on would have denied protection for people with pre-existing conditions. But some of them did, and Holding voted for some of these bills that range from budget bills defunding Obamacare to full-on repeals that would have fully eliminated protections. Bill: Date of Holding Vote: HR 45 5/16/2013 HR 2009 8/2/2013 H. Con. Res 25 3/20/2013 3/21/2013 H. Con. Res. 96 4/10/2014 4/10/2014 HR 596 2/3/2015 H. Con. Res. 27 3/25/2015 3/25/2015 3/25/2015 S. Con. Res. 11 4/30/2015 H.R. 3762 10/23/2015 1/6/2016 2/2/2016 We found that Holding has voted 14 different times for bills that affect pre-existing conditions in some way. Of these bills, four were budget bills that would have defunded Obamacare. Only the budget bills from 2015 and 2016 mentioned protections for pre-existing conditions by saying the protections should be included in any future health care reform. Since these bills didn’t provide a clear path to offering protections, people with pre-existing conditions could have been vulnerable until other health care legislation passed. Two budget bills from 2013 and 2014 were full repeals of Obamacare, and did not promise protections for pre-existing conditions. Any full repeal of Obamacare would also fully repeal these protections. It is important to note that budget bills are not binding on policy, so it does not mean a vote for these will automatically repeal or defund Obamacare One bill would have prevented the Internal Revenue Service from enforcing any of the tax mandates necessary for funding Obamacare. .Holding also voted in favor of a reconciliation bill, which is a budget bill that does not allow for filibusters in the Senate. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit with a focus on health policies, notes that this bill does not allow insurers to deny coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Tim Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University, said in an email that this reconciliation bill would not have fully repealed Obamacare or protection for those with pre-existing conditions. That doesn’t mean things would’ve stayed the same. "[The repeal] would have made it much harder for people with lower incomes to afford coverage for pre-existing conditions," Jost said. Holding’s defense All of these votes came while President Barack Obama was in office, and Congress had no chance at successfully repealing Obama’s signature health legislation. The Republicans were well aware of that. Their repeal attempts were used to show they could organize as a party, and could get the job done if there was a Republican president. The game changed when President Donald Trump was elected. The Republican-controlled Congress pushed out its first health care bill. It would’ve fully repealed Obamacare and replaced it with the American Health Care Act. On May 4, 2017, Holding voted for this bill. During the debate, Holding cited his votes for the AHCA to prove he supported protections for people with pre-existing conditions. "I really do want to put this pre-existing conditions argument to rest. I voted to repeal Obamacare as many times as I was given an opportunity to vote for repealing Obamacare," Holding said. "... Obamacare didn’t work. The American Health Care Act would work, and it protects and gives coverage to people with pre-existing conditions." A previous fact check found that the AHCA says insurers wouldn’t have been able to limit access to health care for those with pre-existing conditions. It would’ve cut back on protections, however, by allowing for insurers to raise premiums based on an individual’s health status. Our ruling Holding voted numerous times on bills that affect the Affordable Care Act in some way. We found eight bills would have either affected protections for pre-existing conditions, or fully removed them. None of the budget bills Holding voted for were binding either, meaning they wouldn’t have necessarily defunded or repealed Obamacare. Holding voted on two budget bills that promised protections in future health care reform, but they offered no replacement. When he did vote for a replacement, the AHCA, it would have allowed insurers to raise premiums for people based on their pre-existing conditions. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-11245	"You know what Amazon paid in federal income taxes last year? Zero."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/03/bernie-sanders/amazon-paid-0-federal-income-taxes-2017/	The Forbes headline looked pretty good for Amazon chief Jeff Bezos: With the stock soaring, the world’s richest man accrued $9 billion in just two days. U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., offered a different take on the company. "You know what Amazon paid in federal income taxes last year?" Sanders tweeted. "Zero." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We’ve taken a look at a series of exaggerated claims about Amazon in the past. But in this case, Sanders is on the money. Amazon’s 2017 tax return is not public, and a company spokesman did not return our request for comment. So to find the answer, experts told us to look at the company’s annual filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The company could face stiff penalties from the SEC for misleading reports. In its annual report filed to the SEC in February 2018, Amazon estimated that not only would the company not be paying anything in 2017 federal income taxes, but it would be getting a $137 million tax refund. So how did Amazon, which reported $5.6 billion in profit, expect to get money from the federal government in April? Tax credits and stocks Amazon lists two line items that likely got them here: tax credits worth $220 million and stock-based compensation worth $917 million. These reflect the normal workings of the tax system, according to Annette Nellen, professor and director of the Master of Science in Taxation program at San Jose University. "I would stress Amazon is just following the provisions that are in the law," Nellen said. Companies aren’t required to spell out which tax credits they claim in their annual report, but Nellen said they likely include write-offs for research and development, domestic production, and equipment depreciation for Amazon. Stock-based compensation, on the other hand, is spelled out a bit more clearly. Stocks are often handed out as a form of compensation to employees (usually executives) at small startups without much cash on hand. It’s also a common incentive for executives to make the company more profitable. Companies are taxed on their income, which is revenue minus costs. When stocks are offered as compensation, they are counted as a cost. This reduces the company’s taxable income. The trick for companies? They get to write off the value at which the stock was later traded, not the original price for which they sold their stock to employees. "Even if the grant was pennies on the dollar, the companies get to write off the full market value," said Matt Gardner, senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy. This year was the first time Amazon didn’t pay anything in federal income taxes. Gardner attributed that to executives cashing out on stocks they had been sitting on for a while. How the new tax law will change Amazon’s bill A 1993 law capped untaxed executive compensation at $1 million — but the cap doesn’t apply to stock-based compensation. The new tax law signed by President Donald Trump subjects these stocks to the same rule, which will apply to Amazon’s 2018 taxes. Overall, the new tax law largely works in Amazon’s favor, driving down the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent. While that will only apply to Amazon’s 2018 income, its impact can be felt today. Deferred taxes mostly apply to capital investments, or such things as equipment and new warehouses. Taxes on these items are deferred throughout the lifetime of the investment. So even if the tax rate was 35 percent at the time the investment was made, when the company actually pays these deferred taxes, the new 21 percent rate will apply. This line item shrank Amazon’s estimated future taxes by $789 million. Paying below the statutory tax rate isn’t new for Amazon. From 2011 to 2016, Amazon reported a total $8.2 billion of pre-tax income and $944 million in federal income taxes, which amounts to a tax rate of 11.4 percent in the last five years, Gardner calculated. Amazon, which launched online in 1995, long resisted charging a sales tax. But by 2012, it was collecting and paying sales taxes in multiple states. In 2017, it officially began paying taxes in every state where sales taxes exist, plus Washington, D.C. Our ruling Sanders said, "You know what Amazon paid in federal income taxes last year? Zero." We can’t know that for certain until we see Amazon’s tax return. But experts say the closest estimate is that Amazon indeed paid zero in federal income taxes. In fact, Amazon estimates a $137 million rebate. Experts said there was no indication of foul play. The tax credits and write-offs for stock-based compensation that enabled this were passed by Congress. We rate this statement True.

pomt-01345	"We've had 27 (Ebola) outbreaks around the globe and they've never spread outside of the confines of the countries that were initially affected."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/22/corey-hebert/counting-number-ebola-outbreaks/	The latest news on Ebola finally seems to be headed in the right direction. The World Health Organization declared Nigeria and Senegal to be Ebola-free. None of the people who lived in the apartment of Thomas Eric Duncan, the man who died in Dallas, have contracted the disease. Beyond the two nurses now in treatment, there are no reports that hospital staff who helped care for Duncan have the virus. While the situation in Sierra Leone, Liberia and Guinea remains dire, more equipment and medical professionals are arriving on the scene. Based on all this, MSNBC host Chris Hayes took an optimistic stance during his show on Oct. 20. "It is a disease that can be wrestled to the ground and essentially snuffed out the way you might fight a forest fire," Hayes said. "If there's sufficient resources in those three West African countries." Hayes’ guest, pediatrician and health care television personality Corey Hebert, backed up that view. "We've had 27 outbreaks around the globe and they've never spread outside of the confines of the countries that were initially affected," Hebert said. "So, it's not something that we have to worry about like in the movie Outbreak. It's not like that." The 1995 film Outbreak did pretty well at the box office, but our fact-check focuses on Hebert’s numbers, not his taste in movies. We emailed him to learn where he got his figures and did not hear back. We found two lists of Ebola outbreaks, and while it's pretty clear that Hebert overshot the number of outbreaks, his general point is accurate. In the past, thanks to public health efforts, the virus has not spread beyond the borders of the countries that were first affected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lists a total of 34 incidents involving one strain or another of the Ebola virus since it was first identified in 1976 in Zaire. However, not every incident meets the definition of an outbreak. In places such as England, Italy and Russia, some people caught it in their labs. A strain of the virus infected some pigs in the Philippines and some workers there developed antibodies but never showed any symptoms. There were instances where just a single person died. If you discount exposures in the laboratory, infections of animals, you are left with 19 outbreaks before the current one. Add in the three lone deaths unrelated to a lab exposure, and the total is 22. The World Health Organization has its own list that doesn’t include lab or animal infections. Its list has 20 episodes and includes four incidents in which there was a single death or no deaths at all. Adjusting for those individual cases, the WHO’s outbreak count is 16. Here’s the WHO list: Year Country Cases Deaths 2012 Democratic Republic of Congo 57 29 2012 Uganda 7 4 2012 Uganda 24 17 2011 Uganda 1 1 2008 Democratic Republic of Congo 32 14 2007 Uganda 149 37 2007 Democratic Republic of Congo 264 187 2005 Congo 12 10 2004 Sudan 17 7 2001-02 Congo 59 44 2001-02 Gabon 65 53 2000 Uganda 425 224 1996 South Africa (ex-Gabon) 1 1 1995 Democratic Republic of Congo 315 254 1994 Cote d'Ivoire 1 0 1994 Gabon 52 31 1979 Sudan 34 22 1977 Democratic Republic of Congo 1 1 1976 Sudan 284 151 1976 Democratic Republic of Congo 318 280 Source: World Health Organization In both tallies, each outbreak happened in just one country. The current crisis is the first where Ebola has hit several nations simultaneously. (Through Oct. 17, Ebola has affected seven countries and 9,216 people have been diagnosed with the virus. There are 4,555 reported deaths so far.) A likely explanation for the difference this time has to do with where the virus struck, and not the nature of the disease itself. According to a recent article in the New England Journal of Medicine, the latest outbreak started in Guinea in December 2013. That was a very unfortunate location with many residents and decent transportation.There are plenty of roads that allow the people in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia to move easily among the three countries and between rural areas and dense urban centers. But the research team that wrote the article said that the biological characteristics of the virus are largely the same. Quick and robust public health measures could have stopped the Ebola outbreak early, but the steps that were taken fell short. "The critical determinant of epidemic size appears to be the speed of implementation of rigorous control measures," the article authors wrote. Our ruling Hebert said there have been 27 outbreaks of of Ebola and in no case did the disease spread to a second country. His number is high. A more accurate figure would be between 16 and 22. However, he is correct in his main point, that past efforts have successfully contained the disease. The combination of an exaggerated number and an accurate assessment of the importance of the public health response leads us to rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-02762	"The 'Denver Post' has actually hired an editor to promote pot."	false	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/12/bill-oreilly/oreilly-denver-post-hired-editor-promote-pot/	The Denver Post’s decision to hire a "pot editor" to cover the legal recreational use of marijuana in Colorado has drawn the ire of Bill O’Reilly, who twice in four days attacked the newspaper on his Fox News program. Among other things, O’Reilly called the Post’s top editor a pinhead and warned that the paper was promoting intoxication that would put more dangerous drivers on the road. "The Denver Post has actually hired an editor to promote pot," O’Reilly exclaimed on Monday’s show. Both of his guests on Monday’s show pushed back. Mary Katharine Ham argued that this was a legitimate matter of public policy. Juan Williams said since pot would soon be legal in Colorado, talking about it would be no different from the wine reviews you can find in many newspapers. O’Reilly would have none of it. "You can drink wine without getting inebriated," he said. The only reason to use marijuana, O’Reilly said, "is to get high." We reached out to Fox News for more details from the show and did not hear back. This fact-check focuses on whether the Denver Post is promoting pot, but O’Reilly and his guests raised some important points and we’ll cover some of them too. Reporting vs. endorsing We should be clear that O’Reilly did not say the Post’s coverage would have the unintended effect of encouraging the consumption of marijuana. He said promotion was the newspaper’s intent, calling the Post a "very far left concern." We can never be entirely certain when it comes to intent but here is how the newly appointed editor, Ricardo Baca, described the scope of his mandate. "We will have voices in the mix from all sides of the story," Baca said in an article published by his paper. "You smoke (or eat or vaporize) everyday. You got high once in high school and never again. You stopped after you had kids but are thinking about returning. You’re anti-pot and wish it weren’t one of the biggest issues in Colorado. I want to talk with all of you." Baca promised that the beat would cover cannabis culture and news "from a professional, journalistic and critical point of view." So yes, the Post will have a freelance pot critic and a freelance pot adviser, but it will also use staff reporters to follow how the legalization of marijuana unfolds in the state that has gone further than any other (although Washington runs a close second). Colorado’s unique status makes the Post’s work very intriguing to Dr. Eric Wish, director of the Center for Substance Abuse Research at the University of Maryland. "People have been debating this for a long time and there’s been no place where we could have an experiment to see what happens.," Wish said. "Now the voters made Colorado the experiment. Anything that the Denver Post can do to inform people of the consequences of this experiment is going to be good. We need to know." The Post’s editor says he expects the new beat to engage the public. That can mean many things. Safe to say, the newspaper plans to attract readers. That’s a long way from encouraging people to use marijuana. Comparing cannabis and alcohol Coloradans voted on a measure that aimed to treat marijuana the same as alcohol. Opponents, such as O’Reilly, would maintain that the two chemicals are so fundamentally different, we should never confuse them in our minds or our laws. We can’t resolve that dispute, but our research did produce some useful data. First, coverage of beer, wine and spirits is widespread. Barbara Fusco, director of sales and marketing at the Brewers Association, a beer trade group, searched one database and found 168 reporters and editors who report on beer, wine and spirits at daily newspapers nationwide. "I’d consider this number low, as it doesn’t include magazines, newswires, blogs, websites or broadcast outlets," Fusco said. "Of those, 168 reporters, 60 are specifically identified as covering beer." That’s about twice as many beer reporters from five years ago when the association said fewer than three dozen papers had regular coverage. Arnie Robbins, executive director of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, says based on what he’s seen, newspapers are expanding the space they give to all kinds of alcoholic drinks. "On the New York Times baby boomer blog they have a column called A Quiet Drink," Robbins said. "They cover where can you find a cool bar that isn’t crazy loud and it’s about the drinks there." We visited A Quiet Drink and read about an "iced black tea made with Jim Beam bourbon, simple syrup and cardamom pods" and a mai tai "with two kinds of rum — Zacapa 23 and Cana Brava — and a pleasant undercurrent of orange, from Creole Shrubb liqueur." To our eye, this wouldn’t seem to discourage drinking. But O’Reilly’s main point was that you can drink without getting drunk while getting stoned is the only reason to smoke pot. This made us curious. Can we calibrate the effects of alcohol in ways that we can’t with pot? "It may be a false dichotomy to say you can do it with alcohol but not marijuana," said Wish at the University of Maryland. Wish pointed to reports of people who have used marijuana medically and were given the choice of using pills or smoking the drug. They said they were able to control the effects more precisely by smoking. Wish has many concerns about the consequences of legalization. He warns about the combined impact on driving with both alcohol and marijuana in the blood stream. He says if legal pot is taxed at too high a rate, it could encourage the use of cheaper synthetic cannabis which can be a very risky compound. But as to our relative ability to manage our consumption of alcohol and marijuana, he says we should not assume we do a great job with either. "I’m not so sure people calibrate so well once they get inebriated," Wish said. Our ruling O’Reilly said the Denver Post was a "far left concern" that had "actually hired an editor to promote pot". This goes to the newspaper's intent. The Denver Post said it planned to cover many aspects of the unfolding story of legalized marijuana in the state, ranging from policy and laws to the culture of pot users. While that coverage has yet to unfold, the stated goals of the Post do not match O’Reilly’s description of the newspaper’s intentions and we heard nothing from the show that supported O’Reilly’s view. We rate the claim False.	None	Bill O'Reilly	None	None	None	2013-12-12T14:59:44	2013-12-09	['None']
pomt-14851	When President Barack Obama said ISIS, or ISIL, was contained, he "was responding very specifically to the geographic expansion of ISIL in Iraq and Syria."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/15/ben-rhodes/what-barack-obama-said-about-isis-being-contained/	Last week, President Barack Obama said the Islamic State is "contained" -- a comment that has been scrutinized in the wake of the deadly attacks in Paris that have been attributed to the terrorist group. But has Obama’s comment been taken out of context? ABC This Week host George Stephanopoulos presented White House deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes with a list of politicians criticizing Obama for his Nov. 12 remarks. Republican presidential candidate and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, for example, said Obama sees the world "as a fantasy." Rhodes said Obama was talking about a particular aspect of containment that in no way dismissed the possibility of terrorist attacks in the West. "The president was responding very specifically to the geographic expansion of ISIL in Iraq and Syria," Rhodes said, using another acronym for the group. "A year ago, we saw them on the march in Iraq and Syria, taking more and more population centers. The fact is that we have been able to stop that geographic advance and take back significant amounts of territory in both northern Iraq and northern Syria. At the same time, that does not diminish the fact that there is a threat posed by ISIL, not just in those countries but in their aspirations to project power overseas." This reminded us of a prior fact-check, when Obama said he didn’t specifically describe ISIS as a "JV team" -- a statement we rated False because he was clearly talking about the Islamic State at the time. We decided to look back at Obama’s comments on containing ISIS to see his comments in their complete context. Rewind In the context of Obama’s Nov. 12 interview with Stephanopoulos -- the day before the Paris attacks -- it’s actually quite clear that when he says ISIS is contained, he is talking about ISIS’s territorial expansion in Syria and Iraq. Here are the relevant parts of the interview: Stephanopoulos: "Some of your critics say, even your friendly critics say, like Fareed Zakaria, that what you have on the ground now is not going to be enough. Every couple of months you're going to be faced with the same choice of back down or double down." Obama: "I think what is true is that this has always been a multiyear project precisely because the governance structures in the Sunni areas of Iraq are weak, and there are none in Syria. And we don't have ground forces there in sufficient numbers to simply march into Al-Raqqah in Syria and clean the whole place out. And as a consequence, we've always understood that our goal has to be militarily constraining ISIL's capabilities, cutting off their supply lines, cutting off their financing at the same time as we're putting a political track together in Syria and fortifying the best impulses in Baghdad so that we can, not just win militarily, but also win by improving governance." Stephanopoulos: "And that's the strategy you've been following. But ISIS is gaining strength, aren't they?" Obama: "Well, no, I don't think they're gaining strength. What is true is that from the start, our goal has been first to contain, and we have contained them. They have not gained ground in Iraq. And in Syria they'll come in, they'll leave. But you don't see this systematic march by ISIL across the terrain. What we have not yet been able to do is to completely decapitate their command and control structures. We've made some progress in trying to reduce the flow of foreign fighters." When Obama said "we have contained them," it’s within a plainly defined scope: ISIS’s territorial ambitions in Iraq and Syria. This context is bolstered by the fact that Stephanopoulos asks Obama about the ground efforts in those two countries. He wasn’t saying, as critics have shorthanded, that ISIS no longer presents a threat -- an assertion that the Paris attacks would have negated. In fact, in the same interview, Obama acknowledged that ISIS might have surpassed al-Qaida as the greatest terror threat in the world, adding that they are constantly looking for "a crack in the system" to exploit to carry out attacks. "I think that one of the challenges of these international terrorist organizations is that they don't have to have a huge amount of personnel," Obama said. Is ISIS contained in Iraq and Syria? The region Obama refers to is significant because it’s the epicenter of ISIS’s caliphate. We surveyed a number of experts, and they all said Obama is accurate when he says ISIS hasn’t gained territory in Iraq and Syria in recent months, though it does not give a full picture of ISIS’s global reach. "It’s a choice of words that isn’t great, but what he is referring to -- as opposed to the way people have interpreted it -- is correct," said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. While ISIS has captured a couple towns in the past few months, it has ultimately lost roughly a quarter of its Iraq and Syria territory overall. A good portion of the losses resulted from United States airstrikes but also from fighting with Iraqi forces and regional groups, Gartenstein-Ross said. This is a far cry from a year ago, when there was serious concern that ISIS would capture Baghdad. But even though they haven’t expanded territorially recently, ISIS continues to counterattack anti-ISIS forces in the region, noted Frederick Kagan, director of the Critical Threats Project at the American Enterprise Institute. He added that ISIS has actually expanded globally -- with strongholds and cells in Libya, Yemen, the Sinai region, and Bangladesh, as well as establishing ties with other terrorist organizations in Africa. This November map from the Institute for the Study of War shows where ISIS has ties. The stars indicate where ISIS has a remote "governorate." And, as we know from the Paris attacks, ISIS is able to flex their muscle in the West, too. "They are being contained geographically by traditional military but they are leapfrogging over it using terrorism," said Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma. He added that Obama used "your grandfather’s notion of containment." Our ruling Rhodes said that when Obama said ISIS was contained, he "was responding very specifically to the geographic expansion of ISIL in Iraq and Syria." Looking back at Obama’s interview where he made this comment, it is quite clear that it’s within a narrowly defined scope: ISIS’s territorial expansion in Iraq and Syria. He did not rule out the potential for a terrorist attack, and he also made it clear that the United States’ anti-ISIS efforts are a work in progress. References or suggestions that Obama claimed ISIS no longer presents an active threat are incorrect. Further, experts told us that Obama is right that ISIS hasn’t expanded in the region in recent months, though this doesn’t give a full picture of ISIS’s global reach. Rhodes’ statement rates True.

pomt-00956	ISIS is "now the predominant Islamist group in Benghazi."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/feb/19/marco-rubio/isis-holds-sway-benghazi-rubio-says/	Sen. Marco Rubio hasn’t declared himself a presidential candidate yet, but that didn’t stop him from visiting Iowa a little early. Rubio, R-Fla., fashioned himself as a foreign policy wonk during a Feb. 13, 2015, radio appearance, discussing at length the extremist group Islamic State’s goals and strength across Africa and Asia. He then invoked the name of a city many Americans likely would remember. "ISIS has now set up a very significant hub in Libya," Rubio said. "They are now the predominant Islamist group in Benghazi." Two days after Rubio’s remarks, ISIS released a video showing black-clad extremists beheading 21 Coptic Christians from Egypt on a Libyan beach. Egypt responded to the executions by bombing the coastal city of Derna, considered an ISIS stronghold. Rubio’s comments highlighted the state of disarray in Libya, but we wondered if he was right in saying Islamic State militants were the major force in Benghazi, the country’s second-largest city. First, we need a brief lesson in recent history. The Libyan crisis Libya has largely been in chaos since revolutionaries -- with NATO help -- deposed and killed dictator Moammar Gaddafi in 2011. An interim, Islamist-filled government was elected to help Libya make the transition to a democracy, but refused to give up power after its term was up. Gen. Khalifa Haftar (at right), who served in the army during the Gaddafi regime and fought against the dictator during the 2011 coup, was instrumental in replacing the interim government so a new parliament could be elected in 2014. Control of the country is now split between an Islamist government based in Tripoli in the west and an internationally recognized government led by Prime Minister Abdullah al-Thani in Tobruk in the east. Haftar now commands forces fighting Islamist extremists to support the Tobruk government. The country is dotted with militias, clans and terror groups, many of whom fight among each other for territory and almost indiscernible goals. ISIS became one of these groups in 2014, taking control of the eastern city of Derna with fighters from Syria and Iraq and uniting other militant Islamic factions under their banner. The port of Benghazi is to the west of Derna (shown on the map below as Darnah) along the Mediterranean Sea. So who is in charge in Benghazi? As for Rubio’s specific claim, ISIS isn’t the predominate "Islamist group in Benghazi," experts told us. That distinction would go to a terror group known as Ansar al-Sharia, or the Partisans of Islamic Law. Most Americans would know them as the group considered responsible for the Sept. 12, 2012, attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi that killed two diplomats and two former Navy SEALs working as security personnel (a charge they have denied in the past). Relatively small factions across the the region, in places like Tunisia and Yemen, all use the name Ansar al-Sharia, although their aims and origins may differ. Ansar al-Sharia Libya has a significant presence in Derna, as well, although that group is not exactly the same as the one in Benghazi, where the picture gets a little murkier. Several reports (including one from the United Nations) have said Ansar al-Sharia Derna pledged allegiance to ISIS in October 2014, but it seems Ansar al-Sharia Benghazi leadership has not endorsed ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Anonymous jihadists groups are the Libyans who have pledged loyalty to ISIS. Aaron Zelin, a fellow at the Washington Institute and creator of Jihadology.net, told PolitiFact Florida that Ansar al-Sharia members have defected to ISIS, but they are not allies. It’s Ansar al-Sharia that is most visible in Benghazi and not ISIS, Zelin said. Other experts we talked to agreed, though they noted Ansar al-Sharia may be in decline in the city. UCLA history professor James Gelvin said Ansar al-Sharia do share a goal with ISIS -- imposing Sharia law where it is possible. Rubio may have been trying to use Benghazi as a buzzword people would recognize, but he is not correct to say ISIS is "the predominant Islamist group" there. While ISIS has a presence in many cities, they only truly have a foothold in Derna, Gelvin said. "I think what Rubio is doing is conflating Ansar al-Sharia with Islamic State," Gelvin said. "They (Ansar al-Sharia) have not been absorbed. … They still maintain their integrity as a group." We reached out to Rubio’s office but didn’t hear back. For the record, it wouldn’t be accurate to say that either Ansar al-Sharia or ISIS is in charge in Benghazi; Haftar’s forces have been retaking large portions of the city, including the airport and a military installation. As of this writing, the city is still contested, but analysts see Ansar al-Sharia’s clout diminishing. So if neither government, Haftar’s army or any militant group run Benghazi, who controls the city? "No one does," Gelvin said. Our ruling Rubio said ISIS is "now the predominant Islamist group in Benghazi." While there are myriad militias, radical militants, armed groups and even multiple governments in Libya, Islamic State’s footprint is still relatively small. Besides some activity in pockets across the country, the group holds sway in Derna, but not so much in Benghazi, experts say. There, the Islamist group Ansar al-Sharia has been most visible among radicalized factions. Some reports say the group has formed an alliance with ISIS, but researchers dispute that, though some Ansar al-Sharia members almost certainly have defected. Experts also say the situation is fluid, which provides Rubio some additional, albeit small, amount of cover. His statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/0fde4734-30cf-47be-b99a-d5e7b551db6f	None	Marco Rubio	None	None	None	2015-02-19T10:08:13	2015-02-13	['Benghazi']
pomt-04917	It’s "typical" for a presidential candidate to release 10 or 11 years of tax returns.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/01/bill-clinton/its-typical-presidential-candidates-release-10-or-/	President Barack Obama’s campaign intends to keep the pressure on Mitt Romney to release more of his tax returns. The campaign released a Web ad Wednesday hammering that point and asking, "When will he release his tax returns?" Romney has provided his 2010 return and his preliminary return for 2011. He said he will release the final version for 2011, but no additional years. Former President Bill Clinton said the usual standard is much higher. "You know, it's typical, I think, that we all release 10, 11 years," Clinton said on NBC’s Today Show on July 13. "I think Sen. McCain released over 20 years of tax returns." The Obama campaign recently announced that Clinton would be given a prime-time speaking slot at the Democratic National Convention. We wanted to examine if the former president has it right. Is it customary to reveal a decade of tax returns? The high-water mark for disclosure was set by Sen. Robert Dole, R-Kan., in the 1996 election. He released 30 years of tax returns. Second place honors go to Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., for providing 20 years worth when he ran in 2004, although he had released 15 of those returns before he launched his presidential bid. (Kerry’s wife, Teresa Heinz Kerry, had considerable wealth and released only a portion of her 2003 taxes.) After that, there is a tie between Romney’s father, George Romney, in 1968 and Bill Clinton in 1992. Both men released 12 years of tax returns. Close on their heels is Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., with 10 when he was Kerry’s running mate. Several candidates released anywhere from six to nine years of returns. In 2000, George W. Bush provided nine and Al Gore eight. In the 2008 primary, then Sen. Barack Obama, D-Ill., delivered seven, a move that was matched by Hillary Clinton about a month later. In 1988, Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis released six years of returns. There is a difference for incumbents and challengers. Ever since 1976, when Jimmy Carter became president, sitting presidents and vice presidents have released their taxes each year they are in office. By the time re-election rolls around, they have put at least four tax returns into the public record. Challengers generally match or exceed that. Our colleagues at Factcheck.org looked at this and found that since 1980, only two general election candidates have revealed just two years of tax returns. One was Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., in 2008 and the other is Mitt Romney (at least so far during this campaign). For the record, in 1980, Ronald Reagan offered up just one return. We should note here that Clinton was way off when he said McCain released 20 years of returns; McCain only released two. Similarly, Romney has said that Kerry released only two years of returns when Kerry had released many more than that. But again, our fact-check here is intended to gauge what’s "typical" for presidential candidates. As our tally above indicates, though, there's a lot of variation in how many tax returns candidates released. Mathematically speaking, our tally shows the median number of tax returns released to be seven and a half. But individual candidates released anywhere from 30 to one. Providing tax returns is often a campaign strategy, although whether disclosure becomes a significant issue will vary. In 2008, Obama wanted to put pressure on his primary rival, Hillary Clinton. To some extent it worked, because Clinton then had to explain why she and her husband were so wealthy. Romney’s father had something of the same idea when he revealed a dozen tax returns. Our ruling Clinton said most candidates release about 10 years of tax returns. That's more than the two years of returns Romney has released. Clinton is exaggerating a bit when he puts the "typical" number at 10. Over the decades, we found candidates released anywhere from 30 years of tax returns to one year. A majority of the recent candidates we surveyed did not in fact release a full 10 years of tax returns. On the other hand, a majority of recent candidates did release far more than two years of tax returns. So Romney lags behind most of the pack. Clinton’s statement is partially accurate, but it leaves out important details. We rate his statement Half True.	None	Bill Clinton	None	None	None	2012-08-01T17:40:46	2012-07-13	['None']
pomt-02323	Georgia has recovered more than $60 million that was lost to Medicaid fraud	true	/georgia/statements/2014/mar/28/ed-lindsey/state-lawmakers-claim-medicaid-fraud-recovery-corr/	The state has been going after people who commit Medicaid fraud, and it has been paying off, according to Edward Lindsey, an Atlanta state lawmaker, lawyer and 11th District congressional candidate. "Since the implementation of the original Medicaid False Claims Act, which I sponsored in 2007, Georgia has recovered more than $60 million in the last three years alone," Lindsey, a Republican, said in a press release issued March 20. Reports of fraud in government contracts have been widely circulated, well documented and long concerning. The first False Claims Act, also dubbed the "Lincoln law," was enacted during the Civil War to combat fraud by companies selling supplies to the Union Army. Today, Georgia and other states have their own False Claims acts, targeting Medicaid fraud. These laws allow states to take civil action against people who swindle money from Medicaid, the state-federal program that covers health care costs for millions of low-income families, the disabled, children and the elderly. But has the state recouped more than $60 million in three years as Lindsey claims? We decided a truth test was in order. Medicaid fraud can take many forms, but commonly involves billing for services or medications that aren’t provided or aren’t needed. Overbilling and double billing are other common tactics. Big money is at stake. Georgia’s Medicaid program doled out about $9.4 billion in the 2013 state fiscal year. At the state Department of Community Health, which runs the Georgia Medicaid program, officials estimate that $52.2 million was reclaimed through civil proceedings between July 1, 2010, and Feb. 17, 2014. That’s shy of Lindsey’s forecasts, but it’s also not the full picture. Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens’ office has gone after Medicaid fraud, both civilly and criminally. In three years, his office has recouped $159.4 million for both the state and federal government, according to data submitted to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Office of the Inspector General. Most of that money -- including the $52.2 million counted by DCH -- was reclaimed using the Medicaid False Claims Act, according to Olens’ office. Lindsey said he opted for a conservative estimate, based largely on the DCH data. "It appears I understated our success," he said. Lindsey brought the topic of Medicaid fraud before lawmakers during the recent General Assembly because of a looming deadline. The state’s Medicaid False Claims Act, which Lindsey sponsored in 2007, had to be amended to comply with new federal regulations. Those amendments, which were approved by lawmakers in Lindsey’s House Bill 973, have to be signed into law by April 15. Otherwise, Georgia could lose what’s effectively a 10 percent bonus for recovering fraudulently lost federal funds. In the last three years, that 10 percent brought $11.6 million to the state, according to DCH data. How much fraud is being perpetrated here and across the nation is a topic for debate. What’s generally considered the most credible look at the issue came from the respected Institute of Medicine in 2012. The institute’s analysis of 2009 data found that the nation spends $2.6 trillion each year on health care -- including Medicaid and Medicare -- and likely loses $75 billion a year to fraud. Our conclusion: Georgia has submitted documentation to the feds that it has recovered $159.4 million lost to Medicaid fraud in three years in both federal and state money. Lindsey was very conservative in saying the amount recouped was "more than $60 million." We rate Lindsey’s statement True.	None	Edward Lindsey	None	None	None	2014-03-28T00:00:00	2014-03-20	['None']
pomt-04808	Says under Wisconsin law, he cannot remove his name from the ballot for re-election to Congress.	true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/20/paul-ryan/ryan-says-candidates-congress-cant-remove-themselv/	Thousands of voters in southern Wisconsin will see something unusual and historic when they cast their November 2012 ballots: Paul Ryan’s name in stereo. The Janesville Republican will appear on the ballot for re-election to his congressional seat. And he’ll also appear as the GOP vice presidential candidate. Ryan discussed this oddity Aug. 12, 2012, on "60 Minutes" -- his first TV interview after being picked by Mitt Romney as his running mate. CBS correspondent Bob Schieffer asked Ryan: "Now I understand you're also gonna run for reelection in your congressional seat. Are you kind of hedging your bets here?" "No, I'm already on the ballot," Ryan responded. "You can't even go off the ballot. So I've already filed. Our filing deadline was in June. I'm already on the ballot, so it has nothing to do with that." That comment raised a few eyebrows: Is Ryan really requiredto be on the ballot twice? In short, yes. That’s due to a quirk in state law and the timing of Ryan’s pick, according to Reid Magney, spokesman for the state Government Accountability Board, which runs elections. State law generally prohibits a candidate to appear on the same ballot for two partisan offices. But there is one exception: If he’s running for president or vice president. That so-called "favorite son" law was passed in the late 1960s. On the timing question: Ryan, who is seeking an eighth term in the U.S. House, had until June 1, 2012, to submit his name for re-election to the 1st Congressional District seat. He did so. The Government Accountability Board met June 8, 2012, and approved his and other names for the fall ballot. (Indeed, that included the Aug. 14, 2012, primary election, three days after his VP pick. Ryan’s name was listed even though he was unopposed for the GOP nod.) In November, Ryan faces Democrat Rob Zerban of Kenosha. There’s only one way for a candidate to get his name off the ballot after the accountability board has acted -- and it takes, well, a pretty extreme step. The candidate would have to die. Even then, the death would have to happen before the ballot was printed, Magney said. Ballots are printed about 50 days before an election and they don’t get reprinted because of a death. Our rating Ryan said since he’s already on the ballot for re-election to Congress he could not get his name removed. Indeed, at this stage, death is the only way off the House ballot. We rate Ryan’s statement True.	None	Paul Ryan	None	None	None	2012-08-20T09:00:00	2012-08-12	['United_States_Congress', 'Wisconsin']

pomt-13929	"As governor, in the face of partisan attacks, (Charlie Crist) had the courage to save jobs and lead his state into economic recovery."	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/jun/23/barack-obama/charlie-crist-led-florida-economic-recovery-stimul/	Former Gov. Charlie Crist once faced withering criticism for hugging President Barack Obama, but now Obama is returning the favor by embracing Crist’s congressional campaign. Obama endorsed Crist, a Republican-turned-independent-turned-Democrat, for a U.S. House seat in a June 20, 2016, statement. He said Crist "has always put people above politics," and proved it during his single gubernatorial term between January 2007 and January 2011 — right as the Great Recession gripped the state following the housing market’s crash. "As governor, in the face of partisan attacks, he (Charlie Crist) had the courage to save jobs and lead his state into economic recovery," Obama said. By "courage," Obama means Crist, as a GOP governor, had the chutzpah to accept federal stimulus money from a Democratic president against the wishes of many Florida Republicans. Is it fair to credit Crist with saving jobs and helping Florida recover? The data during Crist’s term is mixed, experts say, but the state did recover and accepting the stimulus certainly helped. A stimulating review Remember that the recession officially began at the end of 2007, during Crist’s first year in office. The declining tax revenues and spiraling unemployment left the state facing massive budget shortfalls that were sure to result in cuts to state employees, including educators and law enforcement. Obama, meanwhile, had pushed Congress to pass the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Washington’s $787 billion stimulus package. Vehemently opposed to anything Obama-related, Florida Republicans turned up their noses at the idea. But Crist committed a cardinal GOP sin by advocating for the stimulus, calling it a "pragmatic, commonsense opportunity to move forward." He lobbied the Florida congressional delegation to support the stimulus and made heart-eyes at Obama over the legislation. Then came that infamous hug at a Fort Myers rally with Obama on Feb. 10, 2009, the same day the Senate passed its version of the bill. Obama signed the stimulus into law a week later. Republicans weren’t keen to forgive Crist for pushing Obama’s stimulus package. "I don't know that my governor understands all the details in this package — that there will be nothing here to help with Florida's housing economy," U.S. Sen. Mel Martinez said in February 2009. (Martinez had announced in 2008 he wouldn’t seek re-election, which we’ll get to in a second.) Broward County Republican state committeeman Ed Kennedy said Crist was "cooking his own goose." The state then got some $3 billion to shore up road construction, Medicaid, job training and more, and used more stimulus money to plug a $5 billion hole in the 2009-10 fiscal year budget. There also was a lot of borrowing from state trust funds and creative new taxes and levies, as well as a pay freeze for state workers. Before signing the stimulus-laden budget, Crist declared in May 2009 he would run for U.S. Senate as a Republican to replace Martinez. Although Crist was the initial favorite for the job, his stimulus push continued to haunt him. Republican groups wanted to censure Crist and the conservative Club for Growth bashed him in an online ad, saying he should spend more time fixing the economy, not "passing more debt." The state again relied on stimulus money for the 2010-11 budget, but the issue proved to be a liability for Crist in his U.S. Senate campaign. Crist eventually even waffled a bit on his own support for the spending package. Facing pressure from Republicans, including Rubio, Crist announced in in April 2010 that he would continue the race as an independent in a three-way race with Rubio and Democratic challenger Kendrick Meek. Rubio continued to attack Crist over the stimulus, deriding the package by saying on Fox News, "If it's bad for America, it can't possibly be good for your state." He also attacked Crist in debates, saying in one that, "If you like Obamacare, if you like the stimulus plan, you can vote for Charlie Crist or Kendrick Meek." Rubio won the seat with almost 49 percent of the vote. Meek won 20 percent, and Crist garnered 29.7 percent. So did the stimulus help? Experts we’ve spoken to all say one thing is clear: Florida’s economy would have been worse without it. "It is true that federal stimulus money helped reduce the recession’s magnitude and duration," Moody’s senior economist Chris Lafakis told us. "Florida’s economy bottomed out in terms of jobs in December 2009, when Crist was still in office." His fellow Moody’s economist Kwame Donaldson added that it was "undeniable" the stimulus saved jobs in Florida, in part by keeping the state’s GDP from a continued decline in 2010. The full scope of the jobs picture is fuzzy at best. A lot of figures have been bandied about, but one that is usually accepted is that stimulus money prevented the loss of close to 20,000 full-time equivalent jobs in the education system, which relied heavily on the stimulus for two years. That’s not all educators, mind you, and even some in the school system who had been laid off were rehired as the state recovered. Some 14,000 other full-time equivalent state jobs were shielded in part by the stimulus, too. There is at least some data to suggest Florida was already limping back to a recovery by the time Crist left office. While Florida’s unemployment rate had ballooned to 11.4 percent by January 2010, a year later it had dropped to 10.9 percent, and kept falling. As of April 2016, the rate is 4.8 percent. Under Crist, the state lost more than 800,000 jobs, although you can’t blame that squarely on Crist’s policies given the larger forces of the country’s recession and housing crisis. But it was still a fact Gov. Rick Scott was happy to bring up when Crist attempted a return to the governor’s office as a Democrat in 2014. By and large, indicators show the state’s economy had stopped sliding, thanks in part to the stimulus money Crist had sought. But it’s not as if he rode a white horse into a recovery — Scott has enjoyed the big gains since 2011, as Florida joined the rest of the country climbing out of the recession. We do have to provide our usual disclaimers when dealing with whether an official is responsible for something. Economists and analysts have told PolitiFact Florida countless times now that there are many caveats to looking at economic indicators as a measure of an elected figure. Furthermore, any single governor’s policies are still subject to forces out of their control, such as, say, a global financial meltdown. Experts routinely contend it’s difficult to look at events in a vacuum, or to give credit for good outcomes while ignoring bad ones. Our ruling Obama said, "As governor, in the face of partisan attacks, he (Charlie Crist) had the courage to save jobs and lead his state into economic recovery." Crist was a vocal advocate for the federal stimulus, and it cost him politically as his fellow Republicans attacked him for it. The state ended up using billions to plug holes in the budget, and economists we’ve consulted agree that funding prevented Florida’s dismal economic picture from getting even worse. It’s a bit more difficult to entirely credit Crist with leading the state into a recovery, because most of the gains came after he left office, as the entire country emerged from the recession. The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details.

pomt-11369	Four years after Gov. Andrew Cuomo promised universal pre-K, "79 percent of 4-year olds outside New York City lack full-day pre-K."	mostly true	/new-york/statements/2018/mar/30/cynthia-nixon/do-most-children-outside-new-york-city-lack-full-d/	Gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon says more than three-quarters of 4-year-olds outside New York City don’t have access to state-funded full-day pre-kindergarten. Nixon blames Gov. Andrew Cuomo for the lag, calling it a broken promise. "In 2014, Andrew Cuomo promised that he was going to expand pre-K to all of New York's children, not just those in New York City," Nixon said at a press conference in Albany. "But four years later, 79 percent of 4-year-olds outside New York City lack full-day pre-K." Cuomo and state lawmakers approved a five-year plan in the 2014 state budget to subsidize statewide pre-K. The plan earmarked $1.5 billion for pre-K through 2019, with $340 million for the first year. Most of the first-year money — $300 million — went to New York City schools. Is Nixon right that 79 percent of 4-year-olds outside New York City don’t have access to full-day pre-K? The data Nixon was citing a statistic from a report by a handful of education advocacy groups, including the Alliance for Quality Education The report used data from the state Education Department. A spokesperson for the department sent us the data. The numbers reflect access to state-funded pre-K for 4-year-olds during the 2016-2017 school year, the latest data available. The state counted 103,679 4-year-olds outside New York City during that school year. Only 22,124 of them had access to state-funded full-day pre-K, according to the data. That translates to about 21 percent of 4-year-olds outside New York City with access to state-funded full-day pre-K. So that means 79 percent of the children did not have state-funded full-day pre-K, confirming Nixon’s claim. That doesn’t mean the other 81,555 4-year-olds did not have access to pre-K altogether. Twenty-five percent of 4-year-olds outside New York City had access to state-funded half-day pre-K, meaning 46 percent of them had pre-K during that school year. Added to the New York City 4-year-olds who had full-day pre-K that year, about two-thirds of 4-year-olds statewide had access to state-funded full- or half-day pre-K. Between New York City, Long Island, and upstate New York, about 66 percent of 4-year-olds statewide had access to either state-funded full or half-day pre-K. Was there a deadline? Nixon is right that Cuomo promised to expand pre-K to children statewide. But Cuomo never promised statewide pre-K by the 2016-2017 school year, and the 2014 state budget did not set a deadline. Cuomo pledged funding for statewide pre-K during a radio interview before the state budget passed in 2014. "We’re going to have a statewide pre-K program funded by the state," Cuomo said. "That’s what we said we’re going to do, and that’s what we’re going to do." Cuomo said after the 2014 budget passed that timing would depend on local districts. "We have to watch the implementation rate and how fast we can actually make universal pre-K a reality and where," Cuomo said. "But we have the funding to move the program at the pace the localities can move the program." The state has more than doubled its funding for pre-K since 2013, from $410 million to more than $800 million. The boost in funding did not change the share of 4-year-olds with access to pre-K outside New York City between the 2014 and 2016 school years. Only about 46 percent of those students had access to either full or half-day pre-K during the 2014-2015 school year, according to state data. That share was the same two years later. Our ruling Nixon claimed that 79 percent of 4-year-olds outside New York City don’t have access to full-day pre-K four years after funding was earmarked in the state budget. The latest data supports Nixon’s claim, though it’s from the 2016-2017 school year. That’s three years after Cuomo and lawmakers committed funding for universal pre-K, not four as Nixon said. There was also never a deadline to implement statewide pre-K by the start of that school year. Her claim was accurate but we thought it needed additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

pomt-00612	"Once a woman enters into the sex trade, her average life expectancy is seven years."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2015/may/31/rebecca-quigley/does-becoming-prostitute-mean-youve-only-got-about/	Amid a growing awareness that sex trafficking is a problem in Rhode Island, the public access program "State of the State" broadcast a discussion of the issue. During the show, host Rebecca Quigley offered several statistics about sex workers. One in particular caught our ear. "Once a woman enters into the sex trade," she said, "her average life expectancy is seven years, with AIDS and homicide as the top killers." So if a 18-year-old woman starts working as a prostitute, she's likely to be dead by age 25? We decided to check out that provocative statistic. We found the claim echoed in many sites on the Internet, including Ohio Catholic Conference, The Straight Dope, CNN and others. In contrast, we located a 2004 study in the American Journal of Epidemiology that used 33 years of data to examine the lives of female prostitutes in Colorado Springs, Colorado. Nearly 2,000 were ultimately tracked. Some had been in the business for a few years, others for much longer. The researchers found that fewer than 8 percent died over the three decades. When we tracked down the authors, they said the actual life expectancy, like so many statistics used in the prostitution debate, isn't really known. But, they said, it's not seven years. "If you had a life expectancy that short, you'd have difficulty replenishing the pool with new prostitutes," said coauthor Devon D. Brewer, who directs Interdisciplinary Scientific Research, a Seattle-based research and consulting firm. "It's tough to put into words how dramatic an overstatement that is. There's zero basis that I'm aware of for making statements like that." "The truth is, the vast majority of women who enter into prostitution leave the trade alive, so to say a life expectancy of seven years . . . There is no basis for anything that incredibly dramatic," he said. "That's a statement that gains credence because it's repeated so often and it perhaps has very little to do with reality," said chief author John J. Potterat, now retired from the El Paso County Department of Health and Environment in Colorado Springs. When we heard back from Quigley, she cited several sources we had seen that made the same claim, including an article from Emergency Physicians Monthly that traced a variant of the claim to Melissa Farley, clinical psychologist, founder and director of Prostitution Research and Education, based in San Francisco. She's an anti-prostitution activist. Farley told us that, although she's heard the statistic, she's never seen any documentation to back it up. What is true, the experts all agreed, is that prostitution is a very dangerous profession. The fact that the seven-year statistic is wrong, said Brewer, the Seattle scholar, "doesn't take away from the fact that the risk of death that prostitute women face is higher than any other set of women ever studied, at least the risk of homicide. Does that mean most prostitutes are getting killed? No. It means compared to other women in other professions it's the one you're mostly likely to be murdered in." Brewer and his colleagues estimated that the women they studied faced a 1 percent chance of being murdered during their prostitution career. That murder rate, by the way, has also spawned another bogus statistic — that prostitutes typically die around age 34. What Brewer, Potterat and their colleagues actually found was that among the 21 prostitutes in their study who were murdered, their average age when they died was 34. As retired call girl Maggie McNeill noted last year in the Washington Post, to say that's "the average life expectancy of all street workers, or of all sex workers . . . would be analogous to saying that because the average soldier who is killed in battle is 21 years old, the average man who joins the military dies at 21." Quigley's best source supporting her claim — and one we found as well — was the FBI. In an FBI document titled "FY 2011 Budget Request At A Glance," the bureau asks for $333 million and 831 positions to fight child exploitation. The fact sheet claims, "Studies estimate between 200,000 and 300,000 children are being forced into prostitution at any given time in the United States. The average age of a new child prostitute is 13, and the life expectancy after becoming a child prostitute is 7 years." No source is cited. We couldn't find another FBI document that repeated the seven-year claim. So the FBI was only talking about child prostitution, not prostitution in general. And when we contacted the FBI, the agency repudiated the statistic. Spokesman Christopher M. Allen said that after checking with the bureau's Violent Crimes Against Children Section, it appears that the seven-year life expectancy claim may have come from a case the FBI handled, one that involved several victims. "It should not be considered a general statement of FBI findings," Allen wrote in an email. Our ruling Rebecca Quigley said, "Once a woman enters into the sex trade, her average life expectancy is seven years." She — like many others on the Internet — are incorrectly quoting a FBI budget report that only deals with child prostitution and offers no documentation. And the FBI is now trying to set the record straight. There’s little doubt that prostitution can be one of the most dangerous endeavors undertaken by a woman. But the seven-year claim is flat out False. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-13936	"I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war (in Iraq), and yes, even before the war ever started."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jun/22/donald-trump/trump-still-wrong-his-claim-opposed-iraq-war-ahead/	Presumptive Republican presidential Donald Trump keeps selling the myth that he was against Iraq War even before the war started. In a policy speech June 22, 2016, in New York, Trump tried to contrast himself with his likely fall opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton. "In short, Hillary Clinton’s tryout for the presidency has produced one deadly foreign policy disaster after another," Trump said. "It all started with her bad judgment in supporting the War in Iraq in the first place. "Though I was not in government service, I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started," Trump said. Trump is correct that Clinton supported the war in Iraq. But Trump is wrong to suggest he opposed the war before it started. We searched newspaper articles and television transcripts from 2002 and 2003 amid the debate leading up to the Iraq War. We didn’t find any examples of Trump unequivocally denouncing the war until a year after the war began. Trump’s comments Most damning to Trump’s claim is a September 2002 interview in which Trump said he supported the Iraq invasion. Shock jock Howard Stern asked Trump if he supported the looming invasion. Trump responded, "Yeah, I guess so." This goes directly against Trump’s claims that he criticized the rush to war before the war began. On Jan. 28, 2003, just under three months before the invasion, Fox News’ Neil Cavuto asked Trump whether President George W. Bush should be more focused on Iraq or the economy. Speaking of Iraq, Trump said, "Well, he has either got to do something or not do something, perhaps, because perhaps shouldn't be doing it yet and perhaps we should be waiting for the United Nations, you know. He's under a lot of pressure. I think he's doing a very good job. But, of course, if you look at the polls, a lot of people are getting a little tired. I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned." Trump’s comment here suggests he was skeptical of the mission in Iraq, and he said the economy should be a higher priority. But does this prove Trump prove was "among the earliest to criticize the rush to war"? Hardly. A week after the United States invaded Iraq on March 19, 2003, Trump gave differing takes. At an Academy Awards after-party, Trump said that "the war’s a mess," according to the Washington Post. He told Fox News that because of the war, "The market’s going to go up like a rocket." Trump’s harshest criticism came more than a year into the war, in an August 2004 article in Esquire: "Look at the war in Iraq and the mess that we're in. I would never have handled it that way. Does anybody really believe that Iraq is going to be a wonderful democracy where people are going to run down to the voting box and gently put in their ballot and the winner is happily going to step up to lead the country? C'mon. Two minutes after we leave, there's going to be a revolution, and the meanest, toughest, smartest, most vicious guy will take over. And he'll have weapons of mass destruction, which Saddam didn't have. "What was the purpose of this whole thing? Hundreds and hundreds of young people killed. And what about the people coming back with no arms and legs? Not to mention the other side. All those Iraqi kids who've been blown to pieces. And it turns out that all of the reasons for the war were blatantly wrong. All this for nothing!" He told CNN’s Larry King in November 2004, "I do not believe that we made the right decision going into Iraq, but, you know, hopefully, we'll be getting out." Clearly Trump opposed the Iraq War in its early years. There’s no evidence, though, that he advocated against the war in the first place, or that he was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war. Our ruling On the Iraq War, Trump said, "I was among the earliest to criticize the rush to war, and yes, even before the war ever started." The record just doesn’t support this. We could only find one example of Trump commenting on the Iraq War before the invasion where he seemed apprehensive but not vehemently opposed to the operation. In another interview, Trump said he supported the invasion. This claim rates False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-06-22T11:45:54	2016-06-22	['Iraq']

pomt-01600	Says Sen. Jeanne Shaheen’s "wealth has surged while in public office."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/02/ending-spending-action-fund/conservative-group-says-jeanne-shaheens-wealth-has/	Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., insists an ad running against her is so blatantly false that her campaign asked a station to take it down. Meanwhile, the makers of the ad, the conservative group Ending Spending Action Fund, told us the ad is "100 percent accurate." Sounds like a job for PolitiFact. The ad, a 60-second spot, claims that New Hampshire families are struggling, but "Shaheen’s wealth has surged while in public office." The ad goes on to say that "news reports raise questions about Shaheen’s family profiting from her votes in Congress, a shady stock deal and a conflict of interest." The ad concludes: "The Shaheen family gets richer. New Hampshire families get the bill." Shaheen’s Republican opponent will be determined in a primary on Sept. 9 and the odds on favorite is former Sen. Scott Brown. Has Shaheen’s wealth surged in office? Shaheen’s worth Brian Baker, president of Ending Spending, emailed us the backup for the ad. He also told us that the despite Shaheen's protests, the ad continues to run in New Hamsphire, though it was tweaked to add a citation at the request of one television station. The evidence for this claim comes from OpenSecrets.org, a website run by the campaign finance watchdog group Center for Responsive Politics. OpenSecrets.org estimates a candidate’s net worth using financial disclosure reports. But it’s not an exact science. The forms don’t require candidates to list their actual holdings, but rather check a range of values for every job, bank account, investment or asset they hold, as well as their debts. For example, Shaheen marked down in 2008 that she has between $15,001 and $50,000 in a Ocean National Bank checking account. According to OpenSecrets.org, in 2008 when Shaheen was elected to the U.S. Senate, her net worth was $3.4 million. This is calculated by finding the mean of her total assets, which ranged from $2.94 million and $6.08 million, and subtracting the mean of her total liabilities, ranging from $650,000 to $1.5 million. Many of her assets are listed as shared with her husband, Bill Shaheen, with whom she files taxes jointly. Using the same methodology, OpenSecrets.org estimated Shaheen’s networth in 2012 was $5.4 million. Ending Spending compared the 2008 numbers with 2012 and came up with a $2 million increase. This is already problematic. Shaheen filed her disclosure forms for 2013 in May. So Ending Spending is not using the most up-to-date figures. Those figures show Shaheen’s net worth is $2.7 million, or $700,000 less than what it was in 2008. How did we get that? Shaheen’s 2013 form indicates that both the low and high end of her total assets are up from 2008, ranging from $3.75 million to $7.89 million. But her liabilities were up, too: between $2.03 million and $4.2 million. A lot of the added liabilities are for mortgages. In 2008, Shaheen had four mortgages and a promissory note. By 2013, she had 10 mortgages and two promissory notes. It’s important to stress that we don’t know where her assets fall in the range. The 2013 values overlap quite a bit with the figures reported in 2008. In that respect, it’s possible her assets haven’t gone up at all. But it’s fair to say that since 2008, the Shaheens have acquired stakes in several commercial and residential real estate properties, and the number of investments and financial ventures listed have increased. When the average voter’s net worth falls, it’s typically not because they are taking out multiple loans and purchasing more real estate property while their investments expand. Baker said only Shaheen's assets should be taken into consideration, not her debts. However, traditionally, wealth is measured by looking at both assets and liabilities to calculate net worth. There’s another way we can look at Shaheen’s finances. In June, her campaign allowed members of the media to view eight years of tax returns. They paint a mixed picture, according to news reports, and show Shaheen's income since taking office is flat and tied to her Senate salary, while her husband's ventures have gone up and down. The Telegraph in Nashua, N.H., reported that the couples’ highest income year came in 2012 — when Shaheen earned $580,000 between her Senate salary and her husband’s law firm. But Bill Shaheen’s business partnerships have also lost nearly $1 million over the past five years, the Telegraph found. For example, in 2010, the Shaheens reported $522,000 in income, but also $300,000 in losses resulting in a gross adjusted income of $186,000, according to the Concord Monitor. In 2013, the couple made about $505,000, the Monitor reported, which is close to their average annual pre-tax salary of $474,000 during the eight years released. Profiting from votes? The ad also insinuates that Shaheen’s wealth is somehow tied to her congressional action. All of the evidence from Ending Spending comes back to a June Boston Globe article largely focused on stock options her husband owned in Ultrawave Labs — stock options the campaign says were never exercised. The Globe reported that Shaheen’s husband had stock options in the company in 2009 valued between $1,000 and $15,000. Around the same time, Ultrawave Labs — a company "developing new imaging technology to detect breast cancer," according to the article — received about $78,000 in stimulus money. Shaheen voted for the stimulus — along with every other Democrat (except a sick Sen. Ted Kennedy). The money for Ultrawave came through the National Science Foundation, and was not specifically earmarked by Shaheen, as FactCheck.org noted in their own analysis of the ad. The ad says Shaheen "failed to properly report" the stock. What it doesn’t tell you is the stock options were "misreported" only because Shaheen failed to show it had already expired, her campaign said. According to the forms, in 2013 the stocks were valued between $0 and $1,000. The Globe also notes that Ultrawave Labs has lobbied Congress and the Defense Department to allocate more money for breast cancer research. During her time in Congress, Shaheen has pushed legislation to do the same, at one point supporting a program that would fund breast cancer research through the military (Shaheen sits on the Armed Services Committee). The law firm Shaheen’s husband works at, Shaheen & Gordon, also sought to help clients get stimulus money by creating a "stimulus opportunities team," according to the Globe. The firm told the Globe it had no clients and was "short-lived." The Globe quoted a good-government group that’s critical of the Shaheens business practices, and it’s certainly worthwhile for voters to consider these findings at the ballot box. However, the points raised in the story don’t seem to prove the central premise of the ad that Shaheen’s wealth has surged as a result of her congressional action. Our ruling The Ending Spending Action Fund ad claims "Shaheen’s wealth has surged while in public office." By one measure, Shaheen’s net worth has actually gone down since she took office. Though she and her husband have listed more assets, investments and financial ventures than in 2008, they also have considerably more debt from more mortgages. Her tax returns, filed jointly with her husband, have shown wide fluctuations in income since 2006, making it hard to discern whether her wealth "surged." Her 2013 income was just slightly higher than her average earnings during the past eight years. Ending Spending pointed to a story that has raised questions about the business practices of Shaheen’s husband and their relation to her votes in Congress. However, the findings of the story don’t indicate a surge in wealth by the family. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.	None	Ending Spending Action Fund	None	None	None	2014-09-02T16:52:38	2014-08-25	['None']
pomt-02723	"60 percent of the jobs lost in the 2008 recession were living-wage jobs. Of the jobs we’ve gotten back, only 40 percent are living-wage."	true	/oregon/statements/2013/dec/20/jeff-merkley/have-far-fewer-living-wage-jobs-come-back-were-los/	The United States has long been proud of its middle class and the ability of average citizens to afford a home or put their kids through college. But in the wake of the Great Recession and sluggish recovery, some wonder whether the economic landscape for middle-class Americans has changed forever. Oregon Democratic Sen. Jeff Merkley added his voice to the discussion during a Dec. 4, 2013, talk to the Human Services Coalition of Oregon’s annual meeting. "Sixty percent of the jobs we lost in the recession of 2008 were living-wage jobs," he said. "Of the jobs we’ve gotten back, only 40 percent are living-wage jobs." Those numbers suggest the middle class is headed for long-term trouble. PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. We called Merkley’s Washington, D.C., office and asked where he got his numbers. Spokeswoman Martina McLennan sent us an eight-page study released in August 2012 by the New York-based National Employment Law Project. The non-partisan, non-profit organization’s report drew on statistics available through the second quarter of 2012. She also provided this statement: "Senator Merkley defines a living-wage job as a job that can support a family’s necessities -- paying the bills and putting food on the table -- and leave a little left over to save for hard times and goals like college or retirement. Obviously, the exact number at which that becomes possible varies for each individual family. However, for a typical Oregon family of four, the minimum would likely fall in what the study calls the ‘mid-wage’ jobs range." The study, titled "The Low-Wage Recovery and Growing Inequality," echoed Merkley’s assertion. Mid-wage occupations, it said, constituted 60 percent of recession losses but only 22 percent of recovery growth. Higher-wage occupations were 19 percent of recession job losses and 20 percent of recovery growth. Lower-wage jobs represented 21 percent of recession losses but 58 percent of recovery growth. The 60 percent "jobs lost" figure Merkley used in his claim appears in the report. The 40 percent "jobs gained" figure he cited can be obtained by adding the number of mid-wage and higher-wage jobs listed in the report. Both, after all, constitute "living-wage" jobs. Next we called Anastasia Christman, the law project’s deputy director of access and opportunity. She walked us through the statistics, which she said came from her organization’s analysis of the Current Population Survey, a joint effort between the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau. Law project analysts, Christman said, defined mid-wage occupations as those capable of "approaching income percentiles where you stop qualifying for assistance or safety-net programs." "No one is getting rich at that level," she said, "but you’re not in poverty, either." While Merkley’s claim pertained to the national economy, we wondered if Oregon has seen a similar situation. State economist Mark McMullen pointed us to an 18-page report written and released in October by Josh Lehner, a senior economist in the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis. "The vast majority of the job loss during the recession occurred in both the upper middle- and lower middle-wage occupations," the report says. "Out of the state’s total job losses of slightly more than 138,000, 88 percent were in either upper-middle or lower-middle occupational groups." Similarly, job growth since 2012 has been dominated by both high- and low-wage occupations, Lehner wrote. The 7 percent gain in high-wage jobs compares to a less than 1 percent gain in upper-middle wage jobs. "The findings in Josh’s report," McMullen wrote in an email, "have a similar flavor to the Senator’s numbers." And although the study Merkley relied on numbers available only through the second quarter of 2012, the same trends in job creation are still occurring, he said. We then called Gordon Lafer, an associate professor at the University of Oregon’s Labor Education and Research Center. He hadn’t heard Merkley’s claim before we contacted him but agreed with McMullen that it seemed on the mark. "What he’s saying is true," Lafer said. "The general point he’s making certainly fits with everything I’m seeing." The economy, both nationally and in Oregon, has had a rocky ride since much of the bottom fell out in 2008. Unemployment statistics have improved, but thousands remain out of work. The number of mid-wage jobs added back during the recovery, according to statistics no one disputes, are far outstripped by the number of jobs added for lower-wage and higher-wage occupations. Merkley, in his talk to the Human Services Coalition of Oregon, said 60 percent of the jobs lost starting around 2008 were mid-wage positions, while only 40 percent of the jobs added during the recovery fit that description. His numbers line up with those found by the National Employment Law Project and with similar statistical analyses conducted by Oregon state economists. And though he based his assertion on the recovery using mid-2012 numbers, economists say the trend is holding. We rate his claim True.

pomt-12628	"It’s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care."	false	/florida/statements/2017/mar/31/ted-yoho/florida-us-rep-ted-yoho-misleads-claim-about-medic/	U.S. Rep. Ted Yoho, a Florida Republican, is a frequent critic of the Affordable Care Act but opposed his party’s health care plan. The ACA passed under President Barack Obama included the expansion of Medicaid, a program that provides health coverage for about 74 million poor Americans. (Yoho’s state of Florida rejected the expansion.) Yoho, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, says the law has driven people to Medicaid, a program he described as a worldwide failure. "With the Affordable Care Act, what’s happened is, all these people have been running to Medicaid, and it’s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care," he said in a March 14 interview on PBS, about a week and a half before the Republicans canceled a vote on their health care plan. Yoho spokesman Brian Kaveney walked back the congressman’s statement somewhat when we asked for evidence that Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world. "Hindsight being 20/20, the congressman didn’t mean to use the word ‘worst,’ " Kaveney said. "The congressman was pointing out that since the implementation of ACA, health care trends have not improved." Kaveney added: "To say that Medicaid expansion under ACA has resulted in better health outcomes would be a very debatable point." Experts we interviewed about Medicaid outcomes said they were unaware of any research comparing Medicaid outcomes with the rest of the industrialized world. Leighton Ku, an expert on health policy at George Washington University, said that Medicaid improves access to care for poor people, but research about outcomes comes with caveats. "There is no question -- and there is a lot of research -- that Medicaid improves poor people's access to health care, in terms of seeing a doctor, getting medications, etc.," he told PolitiFact. "The problem with comparing health outcomes is that Medicaid recipients start out sicker, both because they are poor, but also because people who are sick really need to get Medicaid to get access to care, while healthier poor people may go uninsured because they don't need much care." Studies about Medicaid Yoho was referring to two articles in 2017 by Oren Cass, a senior fellow at the conservative Manhattan Institute and a policy director for Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign. Cass argued that Medicaid studies show that the program doesn’t improve public health. But there aren't studies comparing its health outcomes to other industrialized countries. "Whether people on Medicaid have better or worse outcomes than people in other countries doesn’t tell you anything about the effectiveness of Medicaid," Cass told PolitiFact. "The question is whether there are public programs that have as little effect on outcomes relative to the baseline of no-insurance in that country." Let’s look at the studies that Cass cited, some of which we have reviewed before. Oregon study: Cass wrote that a 2013 study about Medicaid expansion in Oregon showed "recipients gained no statistically significant improvement in physical health after two years." The Oregon Health Insurance Experiment compared about 6,000 patients who got a slot in a 2008 Medicaid expansion and about 6,000 who didn’t. Over two years, the study found that while patients in the program initially reported feeling better, there was no real change in health indicators such as diabetes control, cholesterol or blood pressure. However, patients in the study did report better access to care and improvements in mental health. Harvard study: Harvard researchers compared the effects of Medicaid expansion programs in Arizona, Maine and New York with other states that made no change in the 2000s. "Only one of the three achieved a statistically significant reduction in mortality," Cass wrote. One of the study’s authors, Ben Sommers, said when examining each state individually only the largest state -- New York -- was significant on its own. Sommers has since done additional research and found that deaths from causes most treatable with timely medical care — such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes — did go down in the other two states expanding Medicaid as well. (Sommers did part-time work for the Obama administration.) Study on life expectancy and income: Cass also cited a study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association that examined the relationship between life expectancy and income. The study was not about Medicaid, but found differences in life expectancy for low-income individuals is not significantly correlated with measures of the quantity and quality of medical care. "Our study shows that behavioral conditions such as smoking and obesity are very important in mortality," study author Raj Chetty told PolitiFact. "The study does not imply that Medicaid is not important, let alone that it has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world." Cass cited one positive health impact from Medicaid: He wrote that it "may have significant positive effects on pregnant women and young children." Researchers at the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation looked at the big picture for Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Kaiser reviewed 108 studies about the expansion of Medicaid under the law. They found that most research shows that the expansion positively impacts access to care and improved self-reported health. More research was needed, however, to know the effects on health outcomes. Harold Pollack, a University of Chicago professor of social services administration, said that Medicaid, much like private insurance, is a weaker tool in improving health outcomes than experts would like to see. But Medicaid critics sometimes omit context about the program for the poor. "Many studies that compare Medicaid recipients to others find negative associations between Medicaid and health for the simple reason that Medicaid serves individuals facing the greatest social and health risks," he said. "These cannot be interpreted as identifying a harmful causal role of Medicaid." Our ruling Yoho said "It’s been proven over and over again Medicaid has the worst outcomes in the industrialized world as far as the quality of health care." Yoho’s spokesman said that he didn’t mean to use the word "worst." His evidence focused on studies about Medicaid outcomes within the United States with no comparison to other countries. Yoho intended to argue that Medicaid under the ACA hasn’t improved health outcomes. Kaiser examined multiple studies and found Medicaid expansion improves access to care and self-reported health, but additional research is needed to determine effects on health outcomes. As far as Yoho’s original statement, we rate it False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Ted Yoho	None	None	None	2017-03-31T10:24:25	2017-03-14	['None']

pomt-15011	Planned Parenthood has "now (been) found to also illegally sell baby parts."	false	/florida/statements/2015/oct/07/john-stemberger/planned-parenthood-has-been-found-illegally-sell-b/	An Orlando-based conservative Christian group has called on Gov. Rick Scott to choke off all forms of state funding for Planned Parenthood, saying the organization has broken the law and doesn’t deserve taxpayer money. In a letter dated Sept. 22, 2015, Florida Family Policy Council President John Stemberger thanked Scott for investigating state Planned Parenthood affiliates after videos showing officials discussing fetal tissue were released by the anti-abortion Center for Medical Progress this summer. But Stemberger wanted Scott to go further. Stemberger said because of what the videos show, the group should not get money through the state’s Medicaid program and Title X, a federal grant program for family planning and preventive health services. "No organization with a record of illegal activity and abuse, now found to also illegally sell baby parts and likely altering abortion practices to do so, should receive taxpayer dollars," Stemberger wrote. (GOP presidential candidate and former Gov. Jeb Bush ended direct state subsidies for the group in 2001.) Planned Parenthood has been subject to hearings in the U.S. House of Representatives because of the videos, but has it been proven the organization broke the law with their fetal tissue donations? The short answer is no, but there’s no shortage of accusations. State investigation To get up to speed, part of a Center for Medical Progress video shows Deborah Nucatola, senior director of medical services at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, telling undercover activists that fetal tissue can be obtained for fees in the $30 to $100 range. Activists against abortion rights say this is proof the group has a history of trying to "illegally sell baby parts," as Stemberger’s letter said. Many critics have argued Planned Parenthood has broken the law. But there has been no legal ruling against the group. The National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 allows a woman to consent to donating fetal tissue after an abortion. This tissue then can be donated to researchers, but allows providers to charge vaguely defined "reasonable payments associated with the transportation, implantation, processing, preservation, quality control, or storage of human fetal tissue." Planned Parenthood said discussions of payments were only about recouping costs, not making a profit. Experts largely agree that the fees Nucatola describes are within the scope of the law. The videos led to several congressional hearings on how Planned Parenthood uses federal funding. Planned Parenthood is a network of affiliated nonprofit organizations that cooperate with each other, led by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. Funding comes from a wide range of sources, including private donations, grants, health center revenue and Medicaid. State and federal money cannot be used for abortion services. Scott ordered the investigation into 16 Planned Parenthood health centers that provide abortion services and are operated by Florida’s two affiliated chapters. None of the state locations participate in a fetal tissue donation program. The state Agency for Health Care Administration, which ensures health centers comply with state guidelines, cited three clinics for allegedly providing second-trimester abortions without a license, violations Planned Parenthood has denied. A fourth was cited for improper recordkeeping. (Planned Parenthood has sued Florida over the investigation.) None were cited for how they handled fetal tissue. Other allegations Stemberger’s letter makes reference to the result of the Florida investigation, and also mentions a 2008 incident in which Planned Parenthood ended its affiliation with four clinics in Broward County and one in Boca Raton. The chapter running those clinics, formerly known as Planned Parenthood of South Palm Beach and Broward Counties, was mired in harassment complaints and the possible misuse of nearly $450,000, which was just less than the $500,000 it received in taxpayer funding. Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates Executive Director Laura Goodhue said the organization ended its affiliation with that chapter over the mismanagement. The Alliance Defending Freedom, another conservative Christian group that Stemberger said does legal research for the Florida Family Policy Council, included this incident in a report on potential fraud. It’s the only mention of Florida in the report. But Stemberger’s letter goes on to say, "This is merely a short list of the abuses committed by Planned Parenthood in Florida, not including its stunning failure to report sexual abuse of minors, waste, abuse, and potential fraud of taxpayer dollars." Stemberger told PolitiFact Florida that he was referring in part to accusations that clinics in other states had failed to report sexual abuse. Alliance Defending Freedom tracks abuse accusations in Arizona, Colorado, Ohio and other places. Accusations of not reporting sexual abuse also are a subject of sting videos by another group called Live Action. Planned Parenthood maintains its policy is to report all suspected instances of sexual abuse. While we found no concrete evidence of similar accusations in Florida, Stemberger said Planned Parenthood as a whole was still culpable. "If none of these violations occurred in Florida, it still holds true," he said. "There’s a commonality of practice here that ties the two together." Both Scott’s office and Planned Parenthood have disagreed with Stemberger’s assertion that the governor could end state funding through Medicaid and Title X, saying it would be a violation of federal law. The state said about $45,000 in matching funds goes to Planned Parenthood through Medicaid, and three clinics have contracts for newborn health screening and other services. The clinics have to comply with state and federal laws. Stemberger maintained funding can be pulled if Planned Parenthood no longer qualifies as a provider. Scott’s response to Stemberger’s letter reiterated his disdain for Planned Parenthood, but didn’t offer more detail. "We took aggressive, immediate action to investigate Planned Parenthood offices in Florida when the horrific videos were released," Scott said in a statement in response to the letter. "When we found that some of their facilities were not complying with state law, we held them accountable." As for Stemberger’s assertion of other wrongdoing, Goodhue said she didn’t have records of any other investigations besides inquiries this summer. "We’re heavily regulated. AHCA can investigate us at any time," she said. Our ruling Stemberger said Planned Parenthood has "now (been) found to also illegally sell baby parts." Videos from the Center for Medical Progress have led to lots of debate among activists and politicians, but federal law allows for fetal tissue donations to researchers. Abortion providers also are allowed to charge a fee for facilitating those donations. At any rate, the Florida affiliates are not participating in these types of transactions. Stemberger’s letter makes it sound as if Planned Parenthood had been proven guilty of a crime, which is not accurate. He also made a host of other accusations against the Florida organization for which we can’t find evidence. We rate his statement False.

pomt-06395	"After I had resigned or announced my resignation, I abolished -- I prohibited pay-to-play for people that had county or state contracts."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/oct/30/jim-mcgreevey/jim-mcgreevey-claims-he-prohibited-pay-play-state-/	Less than two months before leaving office in the wake of a sex scandal, former Gov. Jim McGreevey did more than just talk about the practice of political donors making contributions in exchange for government contracts. The way he tells it, McGreevey eliminated so-called "pay-to-play" on the state and county levels. "After I had resigned or announced my resignation, I abolished -- I prohibited pay-to-play for people that had county or state contracts," McGreevey said during an Oct. 10 interview with Allan Wolper on WBGO. McGreevey needs to refresh his memory on this one. PolitiFact New Jersey found that the former governor issued an executive order restricting pay-to-play for certain state contracts, but not county contracts. But even for state contracts, McGreevey’s actions didn’t "prohibit" all such donations. Donors could still donate up to $300, and a future governor would address some loopholes in the regulations laid out by McGreevey. McGreevey told us in an email: "The Executive Order was, like my radio comment, all too far from perfect. Hopefully, it began to change the terms of the debate in New Jersey. Thanks are due to the efforts of many, who labored for reform and substantially improved the measure." First, let’s talk more about this executive order. In June 2004, McGreevey signed a pay-to-play bill, criticized at the time for its loopholes. After announcing his resignation that August, McGreevey issued an executive order the following month that imposed tougher restrictions on political donors doing business with the state. That executive order prohibited awarding state contracts of more than $17,500 to business entities that had made certain donations to various political organizations. The order exempted contracts in response to a public emergency. Before McGreevey left office in November 2004, the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services questioned the legality of the executive order, saying it unconstitutionally usurped the Legislature’s authority. The Legislature and acting Gov. Richard Codey then later turned McGreevey’s pay-to-play reform into a law enacted in March 2005. But that executive order and the subsequent law did not deal with county contracts, as McGreevey claimed in the radio interview. So he’s wrong on that point. OK, now McGreevey initiated pay-to-play regulations for state contracts under certain circumstances, but did he "prohibit" the practice entirely? Jeff Brindle, executive director of the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission, told us that wasn’t the case, pointing out how entities with contracts exceeding $17,500 can still donate $300. "There’s no prohibition," Brindle said. "To prohibit, would be, in my opinion, unconstitutional." Heather Taylor, communications director for the Citizens Campaign, an ethics group, said McGreevey prohibited certain contributions, marking "a real strike at the pay-to-play system." But, she added, "It’s not zero tolerance." The law signed by Codey also still had its share of loopholes. Soon after its enactment, the Star-Ledger reported that a lawyer had drafted a memo explaining how state contractors could get around the law by donating up to $10,000 annually to the Democratic State Committee’s federal campaign fund. Gov. Jon Corzine closed other loopholes through an executive order in September 2008, which expanded both the definition of a "business entity" as well as the list of political organizations receiving contributions. Still, New Jersey is leading the nation in terms of pay-to-play regulations, according to Craig Holman, a campaign finance lobbyist with Washington, D.C.-based Public Citizen. "It is one of the strongest pay-to-play laws on the books," Holman said. "It’s quite a good law." Our ruling In a radio interview, McGreevey claimed he "prohibited pay-to-play for people that had county or state contracts" after announcing his resignation in August 2004. McGreevey did issue an executive order, but that only dealt with state contracts. Also, the regulations did not represent a complete prohibition on such political donations, and some loopholes were left in place. However, since McGreevey put in motion what is considered one of the strongest laws in the nation, we rate the statement Half True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-00167	Kathy Manning got "$30 million of your tax dollars plus $2.3 million a year" to build a luxury hotel and parking lot	false	/north-carolina/statements/2018/oct/23/ted-budd/budd-falsely-accuses-manning-getting-30m-taxpayer-/	Republican U.S. Rep. Ted Budd is accusing his Democratic opponent Kathy Manning of benefiting from a development in Greensboro. Budd represents North Carolina’s 13th Congressional District, which covers much of the Greensboro-High Point area as well as the mostly rural area south of Winston-Salem and north of Charlotte. Manning is an attorney, and Budd has criticized her for donating more than $500,000 to the Democratic Party and its candidates. A recent Budd ad, though vague on details, accuses Manning of profiting off a government project. "A parking deck that nobody needed, benefiting a luxury hotel and Kathy Manning," a narrator says in the ad. "$30 million of your tax dollars plus $2.3 million a year to Kathy Manning and her husband, filling the Manning’s swanky hotel and their own French castle." It concludes: "From her castle, it’s no surprise Queen Kathy doesn’t care about doubling parking rates for workers and commuters because Kathy Manning makes government work for her and we pay the price." Manning called on Budd to remove the ad because, she says, it’s nearly identical to a video ad by the America First Action Super PAC that was removed from a pair of Triad-area radio stations. PolitiFact contacted the Budd campaign about the claim. Budd’s spokeswoman, Elizabeth Oglesby, cited several stories about the Westin Hotel being built in Greensboro by Elm Street LLC. Randall Kaplan, Manning’s husband, is a part of the group. But those stories don’t support the ad’s claims. About the project Kaplan is described as a leader of Elm Street LLC, which is developing the Westin Hotel project. The city of Greensboro agreed to reimburse developers up to $30 million to build a parking deck adjoining the hotel, the Greensboro News & Record reported. The deck is expected to be six stories tall and have 850 parking spaces, according to Jake Keys, communications manager for the city of Greensboro. The $30 million isn’t pure profit for developers. It’s to pay developers to build the deck. That includes material, labor and other costs. "Under the reimbursement agreement, the developer will build a new public parking deck for the City in conjunction with the development of their hotel project. Once complete, the City will fully own and operate the new public parking deck," Keys said in an email. An overestimation The city would own the deck and spend an estimated $2.6 million a year to maintain it and pay down the debt, according to the city’s website. The operating cost will include general deck maintenance, cleaning it and keeping the lights on, Keys said. The city would raise yearly parking spot rental rates from $65 to $128 by 2025, according to another News & Record story provided by the Budd campaign. But that doesn’t go to Kaplan’s group, either, Keys said. "The City will maintain the deck, thus any amount (whether it is $2.3M or much less) will be completely an internal expense of the City paid for through revenues associated with the deck," he wrote. "In the end, the hotel will pay for parking spaces in the City owned and operated deck just as any other business or individual." Whatever money Kaplan does receive from the project will be donated to the Community Foundation of Greater Greensboro, the foundation announced on Aug. 21. "The donations will be used to support a range of charitable programs, including economic and workforce development, health care, education, arts, poverty alleviation and social services in the Central Piedmont region of North Carolina and elsewhere," the foundation wrote on its website. Our ruling Budd’s ad said Kathy Manning got $30 million "of your tax dollars plus $2.3 million a year" from a luxury hotel and parking lot. While Manning’s husband was involved in the project, Manning was not. And the $30 million represents the entire cost of the parking deck project — not gross profit for Manning or her husband. In fact, Kaplan is donating his profits. And the $2.3 million isn’t going to Manning or her husband’s group, either. We rate this claim False.

pomt-10279	"I argued for years that we need to move from a 'Musharraf policy' to a 'Pakistan policy.' "	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/21/barack-obama/obama-stretches-foresight-on-musharraf/	For years, the U.S. government has had an uneasy relationship with Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf. While there was discomfort with Musharraf's dictatorial ways, he was also seen as a key ally in fighting al-Qaida, a moving target between Afghanistan and parts of Pakistan. Musharraf resigned on Aug. 18, 2008, rather than face imminent impeachment proceedings, and two days later Sen. Barack Obama issued a bit of an I-told-you-so. "I argued for years that we need to move from a 'Musharraf policy' to a 'Pakistan policy,'" Obama said in a speech before the Veterans of Foreign Wars National Convention on Aug. 19. "We must move beyond an alliance built on mere convenience or a relationship with one man. Now, with President Musharraf's resignation, we have the opportunity to do just that. That's why I've co-sponsored a bill to triple nonmilitary aid to the Pakistani people, while ensuring that the military assistance we do provide is used to take the fight to the Taliban and al-Qaida in the tribal regions of Pakistan." The question here is whether Obama inflated his foresight on Musharraf in an effort to bolster his credibility on foreign policy. What did he say and when did he say it? The Obama campaign provided a handful of citations. In July, Obama said on CNN's Larry King Live: "In order for us to be effective in dealing with the resurgence of al-Qaida and the Taliban as they use Pakistan — the northwest provinces — as a sanctuary, we've got to have a stronger relationship with the Pakistani government — the new Pakistani government. We had put all our eggs in the Musharraf basket." And then there's this from Obama, in Newsweek, in April: "There is a sizable middle class [in Pakistan] that believes in rule of law and believes in a government that is accountable to the people. So our willingness to put all our eggs in the Musharraf basket without understanding this other tradition, and without understanding that our choice in a place like Pakistan is not simply [between] military dictatorship or Islamic rule, led us to make a series of miscalculations that has weakened our fight against terrorism in the region." And in March, Obama in the Washinton Post: "In Pakistan, I will reject the false choice between stability and democracy. In our unconditional support for Musharraf, we have gotten neither." And in February, at a Democratic debate: "I've said very clearly that we have put all our eggs in the Musharraf basket. That was a mistake. We should be going after al-Qaida and making sure that Pakistan is serious about hunting down terrorists, as well as expanding democracy." Last November, Obama helped lead a Senate resolution that condemned Musharraf for invoking a state of emergency; and called on Musharraf to relinquish his position as chief of army staff of Pakistan and to allow for free and fair elections. That clearly puts Obama on record in the past year. "I believe Obama is correct in stating that he has wanted to move past a Musharraf-centric strategy in Pakistan for some time now," said Daniel Markey, a senior fellow for India, Pakistan and South Asia at the nonpartisan Council on Foreign Relations. "To some extent, this shows genuine foresight, but it is important to note that Obama was not alone in this view," Markey told PolitiFact. "In fact, many people outside the Bush administration have been saying this — or something similar — since shortly after 9/11. It has been the common refrain of many think tankers, and of course it has been reiterated by Pakistani opposition leaders (from Benazir Bhutto down) who were excluded from power by Musharraf." The question here is whether Obama's position is one he has advocated "for years." Last August, Obama made headlines when he said during a speech in Washington, "If we have actionable intelligence about high-value terrorist targets (in Pakistan) and President Musharraf won't act, we will." Sen. John McCain later called that statement "naive" and said, "You don't broadcast that you are going to bomb a country that is a sovereign nation and that you are dependent on the good will of the people of that country to help you in the war — in the struggle against Taliban and the sanctuaries which they hold." One could argue that Obama's vow to act independently against terrorist cells in Pakistan, if Musharraf wouldn't, amounted to advocacy for moving from a "Musharraf policy" to a "Pakistan policy." And that would put him on record a year ago. But by way of rebuttal, the McCain campaign provided this Obama nugget from an MSNBC Democratic presidential debate on Aug. 7, 2007 (just days after Obama's if-Musharraf-won't-we-will line): "I did not say that we would immediately go in (to Pakistan) unilaterally. What I said was that we have to work with Musharraf, because the biggest threat to American security right now are in the northwest provinces of Pakistan and that we should continue to give him military aid contingent on him doing something about that." So even Obama, at this point, was talking about still trying to work with Musharraf. Part of our conundrum here is that in the course of 24 hours, Obama changed the timeline on his claim of advocating the United States move from a 'Musharraf policy' to a 'Pakistan policy' — first stating that he advocated it "a year ago" and then ratcheting it up a day later, saying he had argued it "for years." We checked the congressional record and couldn't find any statements from the floor or in the text of any legislation that Obama co-sponsored that suggests this was a "years"-old position. If Obama had said he has been advocating this position for months, he'd be on solid footing. And he rightly gets credit for some foresight on the issue. But when he says it's a position he has argued "for years" he is giving himself more credit than even his campaign can confirm. We rate Obama's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-04710	Federal law adopted "under Tommy Thompson's watch" prohibits the government from negotiating for "better prices" on prescription drugs for senior citizens	true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/04/tammy-baldwin/uncle-sam-barred-bargaining-medicare-drug-prices-s/	When it comes to the massive Medicare Part D prescription drug program, you’d think Uncle Sam would have pretty good leverage in negotiating drug prices. But the government is actually barred from doing such bargaining, according to Democratic Wisconsin Congresswoman Rep. Tammy Baldwin -- who lays blame on her opponent for the U.S. Senate, Republican Tommy Thompson. Baldwin attacked Thompson, who served as health and human services secretary under GOP President George W. Bush, in an Aug. 15, 2012, interview. She told John "Sly" Sylvester, a liberal talk show host on WTDY-AM and -FM in Madison: "We have written into law, under Tommy Thompson's watch, a prohibition for the federal government to be involved in negotiating with pharmaceutical companies for better prices for seniors for drugs. That's unbelievable. You know, if you buy in bulk, you get a better deal." Let's check both parts of Baldwin’s claim -- that the government is prohibited from negotiating on drug prices and that Thompson played a role in creating the ban. Negotiating drug prices Medicare Part D is a voluntary insurance program for prescription drugs for people on Medicare. Congress created it by passing legislation in 2003, although the program didn’t take effect until 2006. Here is some background from PolitiFact National: In rating as Half True a claim by former GOP presidential candidate Rick Santorum -- that Medicare Part D came in 40 percent under budget because of its design -- our colleagues explained that private insurance companies offer a variety of plans subsidized by the government, and beneficiaries get to choose the plan that's best for them. PolitiFact National has also reportedon the program as part of its Obameter, which tracks promises President Barack Obama made as a candidate in 2008. Since Congress approved the program, proposed by Bush, Democrats have groused that it was a huge giveaway for the pharmaceutical industry because it did not allow Medicare to negotiate drug prices. Obama vowed to change the program to allow Medicare negotiate lower prices. But he backed away from the pledge during negotiations over his health care reform bill, and no provision on negotiating drug prices was included in the bill that became law in 2010. (That eventually led our colleagues to rate Obama’s pledge as a Promise Broken.) That isn’t to say there isn’t any negotiating. A July 2006 New York Times article cited by Baldwin campaign spokesman John Kraus reported that "Congress -- in what critics saw as a sop to the drug industry — barred the government from having a negotiating role. Instead, prices are worked out between drug makers and the dozens of large and small Part D drug plans run by commercial insurers." Thompson campaign spokesman Brian Nemoir also cited the negotiating done by the various companies offering Medicare Part D plans, arguing it has resulted in the overall cost of Medicare Part D to be lower than projected. (PolitiFact National found in June 2011, in rating Santorum’s claim, that the program came in under budget because fewer people than expected used it, drug spending increased less than expected and the program had encouraged use of generic drugs.) But we’re not here to settle Nemoir’s claim; and one could argue, as Baldwin does, that costs could be even lower if the federal government did the negotiating. When we checked back with Nemoir, he acknowledged that the federal government is prohibited from negotiating drug prices on behalf of Medicare Part D plans. Thompson’s role The second part of Baldwin’s claim is that the prohibition was put into law "under Thompson’s watch" -- indicating he didn’t unilaterally impose the ban, but played a role. Kraus cited a number of news articles, including one in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel that said Thompson was the Bush administration’s "point man" on getting Medicare Part D through Congress; and one in the Philadelphia Inquirer that said Thompson "lobbied tirelessly" for the plan. Moreover, Nemoir acknowledged that the prohibition on the federal government was done under Thompson. Our rating Baldwin said federal law adopted "under Tommy Thompson's watch" prohibits the federal government from negotiating for "better prices" on prescription drugs for senior citizens. Her reference was to the Medicare Part D prescription program, which Thompson lobbied for and which includes the prohibition she stated. We rate Baldwin’s statement True.

pomt-08475	Taking the Fifth Amendment in a deposition about the Columbia/HCA hospital chain he founded "means a truthful answer to the questions that (Rick Scott) was asked would incriminate him."	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/12/florida-democratic-party/does-rick-scott-invoking-fifth-amendment-imply-gui/	Democrat Alex Sink is airing a rare, two-minute ad that whacks Republican gubernatorial candidate Rick Scott for alleged fraud at his former health care company, Columbia/HCA, as well as his current health care business, Solantic. A key part of the ad, called "Fraud Files," is a discussion about Scott taking the Fifth Amendment 75 times in a legal case involving Columbia/HCA. During a discussion about Scott taking the Fifth Amendment, Florida Democrats and Sink use video of Palm Beach County state attorney Michael McAuliffe. He says about halfway through the campaign commercial that taking the Fifth Amendment "means a truthful answer to the questions that he was asked would incriminate him." That's the claim we're analyzing in this fact check. First, a little bit of back story on Scott and Columbia/HCA. Scott started what was first called Columbia in the spring of 1987 by purchasing two El Paso, Texas, hospitals. He quickly grew the company into one of the country's largest publicly traded hospital chains, and in 1994, merged Columbia with Tennessee-headquartered HCA and its 100 hospitals. In early 1997, federal agents revealed they were investigating the Columbia/HCA chain for, among other things, Medicare and Medicaid fraud. Allegations included that Columbia/HCA billed Medicare and Medicaid for tests that were not necessary or ordered by physicians, and that the hospital chain would perform one type of medical test but bill the federal government for a more expensive test or procedure. Agents seized records from Columbia facilities across the country in Tennessee, North Carolina, Texas, Oklahoma, Utah and Florida. Scott resigned in the middle of the federal investigation in July 1997. Scott said he wanted to fight the federal government accusations; the corporate board of Columbia/HCA wanted to settle, and did. In 2000, the company pleaded guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies and agreed to pay $840 million in criminal fines and civil damages and penalties. The company agreed to further settlements in 2002, paying an additional $881 million in fines. About the Fifth Amendment As we noted in another item, Scott indeed did give a deposition in 2000 where he invoked the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution 75 times. The amendment reads in part that no one "shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself." But Scott's deposition was not part of the criminal fraud case being pursued by the federal government as the ad suggests (he was never officially questioned). Instead, the case in question was a civil case involving Columbia/HCA and Nevada Communications Corp. Nevada Communications alleged that Columbia/HCA breached the terms of a communications contract. Scott's lawyer interjected after an opposing lawyer began the deposition by asking if Scott was employed. "Under normal circumstances, Mr. Scott would be pleased to answer that question and other questions that you pose today," Scott's lawyer, Steven Steinbach, said. "Unfortunately because of the pendency of a number of criminal investigations relating to Columbia around the country, he's going to follow my advice, out of prudence, to assert his constitutional privilege against giving testimony against himself." Scott then went on to read the same answer to every question Nevada Communications lawyers asked, even when asked if Scott is a current or former employee of Columbia/HCA -- "Upon advice of counsel, I respectfully decline to answer the questions by asserting my rights and privileges under the Fifth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution." Does that mean truthful answers to the questions he was asked would incriminate him? Not necessarily, legal experts we talked to said. For one thing, invoking the Fifth Amendment cannot be used in a criminal court to suggest guilt, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1956. The case is an interesting one. Brooklyn College professor Harry Slochower was called to testify before a U.S. Senate committee led by Joseph McCarthy to determine if he was a member of the Communist Party. Slochower invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege not to answer questions about his party membership in 1940 and 1941. As a result, the college fired Slochower. But the court said the college could not fire Slochower for invoking his constitutional rights. "The privilege against self-incrimination would be reduced to a hollow mockery if its exercise could be taken as equivalent either to a confession of guilt or a conclusive presumption of perjury," the court wrote in the Slochower case. That means McAuliffe could never tell a criminal jury what he's telling voters on TV. "If this was a criminal prosecution I would not refer to his invocation of the Fifth Amendment, but that’s not what we’re talking about," McAuliffe said. "This is not a criminal prosecution. It’s the political process and he has put himself out there to be vetted by voters. They're the jury in this case." In a civil case, things get a little murkier. Judges and juries can infer that a person who uses the Fifth Amendment would not incriminate themselves if they answered honestly. They also, however, can infer the opposite. What does that mean? Put simply, Scott's answers to those 75 questions may or may not be used to incriminate him. "The bottom line is that in a civil case, the judge and jury are free to draw the inference that 'a truthful answer to the questions that he was asked would incriminate him,' " said George R. Dekle, Sr., a professor of law at the University of Florida. "However, there can be myriads of reasons other than guilt which prompt a person to claim a Fifth Amendment privilege, and it might be just as reasonable to infer that the witness refused to answer for some other reason." We talked to two other legal scholars who seemed surprised that Scott used the Fifth Amendment so much in a deposition, especially when answering routine questions about his employment history. "You should not use the Fifth Amendment privilege if you don't think there's possible criminal liability," said Bruce Jacob, a law professor at Stetson. That said, it's not an admission of guilt, said Oscar Michelen, a New York lawyer who has written articles on the Fifth Amendment. It can also be used as a way to protect the innocent from wrongful prosecution, he says. Investigators try to link people to crimes, he said. Not prove they did it. It reminds of us of a Law & Order episode -- the cops find a suspect and make a case. But halfway through the show, they realize they have the wrong person. "Experienced litigators and particularly experienced criminal defense lawyers will tell you that 9 out of 9.95 times if there is any remote possibility that you may be charged with a crime or become a target of a criminal investigation or proceeding, you should 'take the Fifth,' " Michelen said. Our ruling We find a couple of things lacking in the claim that Scott, if he answered those depositions honestly, would "incriminate himself." First, the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled that in criminal cases courts cannot take the use of the Fifth Amendment to mean guilty. Second, while judges and juries may infer that a truthful answer in a civil case may incriminate Scott, they also may infer the opposite. Part of the confusion in this ad is that the Democrats imply that Scott's deposition is part of the criminal prosecution when, in fact, it was a civil case, making McAuliffe's description of the case awkward. (UPDATE: To clarify, we also have to acknowledge a bit of legalese here. McAuliffe uses the word incriminate, which is lawyer for "help make a case against." It doesn't mean, "he did it." The ad does a poor job of providing the distinction, but that's no fault of McAuliffe's.) One of the questions Scott refused to answer, for instance, is whether he worked for Columbia/HCA. Using basic logic we feel comfortable thinking that an honest answer to that question wouldn't harm him. Legal experts say, that though Scott may have used the privilege too freely, there are myriads of reasons other than guilt to claim a Fifth Amendment privilege. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-05301	The recent process of awarding $3 billion worth of airport vending contracts was the "most open and transparent procurement process in the city’s history."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/may/21/kasim-reed/mayor-kasim-reed-airport-concession-awards-most-op/	Critics dogged the city of Atlanta every step of the way during its long slog to award $3 billion worth of contracts at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport. Businesses vying to sell food and gifts to travelers howled in protest last year when the city rebooted the process after too many hopefuls fouled up their paperwork. Some complained decisions were made in haste, or favored businesses with political connections. Others protested when a major vote took place after a closed-door City Council session. Companies that lost out, including Virginia-based SSP America, filed suit. Mayor Kasim Reed’s administration waged a public war against them. An April 25 press release issued by his office called SSP out by name. "The city is hopeful that SSP America . . . will finally cease its litigious and wasteful efforts to overturn the fairest, most open and transparent procurement process in the city’s history," said the release, which was sent out by Reed’s representatives. The most "open and transparent"? That sounds out of character for Hartsfield-Jackson, where dealings have a history of being anything but these things. In the 1980s and early 1990s, concession operators paid more than $1 million in bribes to elected officials, according to a federal investigation. Seven people, including two former city councilmen, were convicted or pleaded guilty to related crimes. Former Mayor Bill Campbell famously served federal prison time in the mid-2000s for failing to pay $160,000 in taxes. Prosecutors said he secretly used airport and other city contracts to make himself and his friends rich. And last year, the city agreed to a $3.9 million legal settlement with Atlanta businessman Billy Corey and his business Corey Airport Services. He argued that the procurement process was rigged when he lost out on an airport advertising contract in 2002. Now, we’ll cover why Atlanta officials think this latest round was the most open and transparent in city history. City spokeswoman Sonji Jacobs, whose name was listed on the press release, gave four major arguments: City officials put a big bundle of airport concessions contracts out to bid at once. Businesses competed for 11 concessions contracts: nine for restaurants and two for shops. They were worth about $3 billion in revenue over 10 years. Something similar took place in February 1995. The city tried to wipe the slate clean by opening bidding on "almost every concessions space at Hartsfield," including restaurants and gift shops, according to a story in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. City officials released names of project evaluators. Reed announced in June 2011 that he would release the names of evaluators on a panel that reviews and recommends proposals. He said this transparency would head off accusations of conflicts of interest. Instead, the city waited until January -- after the City Council approved the contracts. Jacobs said in the mayor’s defense that this was earlier than state open records law requires. But council members Michael Julian Bond and Felicia Moore told PolitiFact Georgia that under prior administrations, they received evaluator names and related information before the bids went before the full council. And Jacobs’ point about public records law is debatable. Nothing in state law says names of committee members appointed by a public agency can be kept secret, Hollie Manheimer, executive director of the Georgia First Amendment Foundation, told PolitiFact Georgia. Reed returned legally obtained campaign contributions from those vying for contracts. Reed stopped receiving campaign donations from these businesses in late June 2011, and returned some money. We found no evidence that prior Atlanta mayors have taken this step. However, this is more of an anti-influence peddling measure than a transparency effort. The city released more than 1 million pages of records detailing the procurement process. We found no evidence that other administrations have gone through the expense and effort of releasing this many documents. But at first, they didn’t do it willingly. Officials released these documents in January after losing concessionaires sued, saying the administration violated public records law by withholding them. The Fulton court’s chief judge wrote in a March order that "only after entry of several court orders" did the city begin to produce more public records related to the bid process. Since then, though, it has provided many of them. SSP’s lawyer accused the city’s chief procurement officer of directing city workers to destroy them, but George Maynard, the hearing officer assigned to SSP’s appeal, determined there was no evidence of "fraud, corruption or abuse." Watchdog groups and some elected officials want more. They noted Maynard was appointed by the mayor, and were concerned that the city’s transportation committee had 12 hours or less to inspect key concessions contract documents before they voted to approve them. To conclude: This latest round of airport contract proposals was not as open as it could have been, and three of the four arguments the city used to claim unprecedented transparency fall short. Still, it may well have been more transparent than all others in Hartsfield-Jackson history. We could find no other instances where more than 1 million pages of documents were put out for public review. That said, the city was legally obliged to provide those pages. The statement is likely accurate, but meaningless. It’s no great achievement for a city to do what the law requires. Unless that city is Atlanta. This claim lacks important details, which means it earns a Half True.	None	Kasim Reed	None	None	None	2012-05-21T06:00:00	2012-04-25	['None']

pomt-15204	Wisconsin's pension system is the "only one fully funded in the country."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/aug/14/scott-walker/wisconsin-only-state-fully-funded-pension-system-s/	Scott Walker fired off 13 tweets on July 26, 2015 that cite accomplishments and highpoints during his time as Wisconsin's governor. This was one of them: "Overall bonding in latest WI state budget is at 20 year low. State pension system is only one fully funded in the country." We decided to check the second part of the statement to see if anything has changed since we first rated it True in 2013. The fully-funded pension system is also a prominent talking point for Walker in his quest for the Republican presidential nomination. Where pension benefits come from The Wisconsin Retirement System provides retirement, disability and death benefits not only to all state employees, but to nearly all local government employees in Wisconsin. With some $85 billion in what are known as actuarial assets, it covers more than 256,000 active public employees, including teachers and municipal employees, plus 154,000 retirees and others who are no longer active employees. The funds come from three sources: employer contributions, employee contributions and investment earnings. The employer-employee split was changed dramatically by Act 10, Walker's 2011 collective bargaining reform law. Before Act 10, the state, as well as the local governments participating in the state retirement system, had agreed to make almost of the contributions that employees were required to make toward their pensions. In other words, often as a result of union bargaining, the employers were making the employer contributions to the pension fund and nearly all of the employee contributions, as well. In 2010, for example, state and local government employers made 99 percent of the employer-employee contributions to the system. As of 2013, the latest figures available, employers paid 57 percent and employees 43 percent. So, just how healthy is the pension fund, and how does it compare? How close to fully funded? The state's most recent actuarial evaluation showed that as of the end of 2013, the retirement system was in balance. That is, the expected total retirement benefit obligations equalled the assets ultimately expected to be available to the system. More specifically, the Gabriel Roeder Smith & Co. firm said the pension fund was 99.96 percent funded. It’s worth noting the actuarial reports have shown the retirement system funding at 99 percent or greater not only during Walker's tenure, but dating back to 2003. Wisconsin's pension system has long been viewed as a national model. When we rated Walker's 2013 claim that Wisconsin’s pension fund was the only fully funded one in the country, we relied primarily on a report from the non-partisan Pew Charitable Trusts. It was since updated, with the most recent version published in July 2015. That report shows that in 2013, South Dakota's pension system had joined Wisconsin as being fully funded. Pew actually ranked South Dakota first and Wisconsin second, even though both were 99.9 percent funded. The national average was 72 percent. Illinois was lowest, at 39 percent. Another report -- which included some actual as well as estimated data for 2014 -- also listed South Dakota and Wisconsin as the only fully funded pension systems. That report, from the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, estimated that Wisconsin had an asset-to-liability ratio of 104 percent for 2014, up from 99.9 percent in each of the three previous years. Actual data for South Dakota, meanwhile, showed that state's pension system was funded at 100 percent in both 2013 and 2014. (The report also examined local pension plans. The City of Milwaukee's was estimated at 100.8 percent funded in 2014.) Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, told us Wisconsin and South Dakota are well funded because their investments have performed well and their retirement benefits "have remained fairly reasonable." In addition, in Wisconsin’s case, retirement benefits go down when investments don’t perform up to par, he said. Our rating Walker says Wisconsin's "pension system is only one fully funded in the country." That was the case among state pension plans in 2012, but newer reports show slightly different results. According to Pew Charitable Trusts, both South Dakota and Wisconsin were fully funded in 2013; and according to Boston College, both were fully funded in 2013 and 2014.

pomt-05593	A bill that could restrict free speech when the president is nearby was signed by President Barack Obama "in secret."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/30/andrew-napolitano/andrew-napolitano-chain-email-say-barack-obama-si/	A new chain email says a bill signed by President Barack Obama raises the specter of Nazi Germany. "Who would have believed this would ever happen in the USA . . . . . or is this 1933, and are we in NAZI Germany . . . "This is serious and it just was signed into law last Thursday, March 15th in SECRET!! HR 347. Our glorious politicians on both sides, and Obama do it again!" The email links to a Fox News segment with legal commentator Andrew Napolitano, as well as a Cincinnati TV station’s "reality check" on the law, and a blog post by the American Civil Liberties Union. Because most of the material provided by the email is in the realm of opinion -- indeed, it would likely be subject to interpretation by federal courts -- we will limit our fact-check to the suggestion that the law was signed "in secret," a claim made not only by the email but also by Napolitano, who in the interview said the law was "a slow, creeping destruction of some of our basic liberties, and the president signed it in secret." Let’s start by taking a look at the law, and the critics’ interpretations of it. What the law says The Federal Restricted Buildings and Grounds Improvement Act of 2011 was signed by Obama on March 8, 2012. The law is filled with legalese that gives only hints of its potential reach. A summary on THOMAS, the database run by the Library of Congress, suggests the law puts up restrictions for buildings when the president or anyone else protected by the Secret Service is nearby. It says the law: Amends the federal criminal code to revise the prohibition against entering restricted federal buildings or grounds to impose criminal penalties on anyone who knowingly enters any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority. Defines "restricted buildings or grounds" as a posted, cordoned off, or otherwise restricted area of: (1) the White House or its grounds or the Vice President's official residence or its grounds, (2) a building or grounds where the President or other person protected by the Secret Service is or will be temporarily visiting, or (3) a building or grounds so restricted due to a special event of national significance. The punishment would be a fine or imprisonment for not more than 10 years, or both, if it involves a weapon or results in "significant bodily injury." For lesser offenses, the punishment could be a fine and imprisonment for not more than one year. The critics’ concerns So what is Napolitano concerned about? Here’s an excerpt from his interview with Fox News’ Eric Bolling. (Napolitano didn’t respond to our interview request made through his website.) "This is not like a traffic ticket," Napolitano said. "For standing and protesting, the type of thing that for 230 years Americans took for granted because it was protected by the First Amendment - 'Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech' – has actually been abridged. By legislation the president signed last Thursday, supported overwhelmingly by both parties, with very very little public debate and very little debate in Congress, basically allows Secret Service agents to decide where there are ‘no-free-speech zones’ …. And anybody by the Secret Service, protected by the Secret Service, can ask those agents to ban protests wherever they are. So I can think of three violations (of constitutional protections): speech violations, association violations, the right to petition the government for a redress of your grievances. What good is free speech if the people in the government are so far away from you that they can't hear you?" The ACLU expressed concerns about the bill as well, but in a more measured fashion. In a blog post, Gabe Rottman, a legislative counsel and policy advisor in the ACLU’s Washington Legislative Office, wrote that "it's important to note — contrary to some reports — that H.R. 347 doesn't create any new crimes, or directly apply to the Occupy protests. The bill slightly rewrites a short trespass law, originally passed in 1971 and amended a couple of times since, that covers areas subject to heightened Secret Service security measures." Rottman added, "Any time the government lowers the intent requirement, it makes it easier for a prosecutor to prove her case, and it gives law enforcement more discretion when enforcing the law. To be sure, this is of concern to the ACLU. We will monitor the implementation of H.R. 347 for any abuse or misuse. … Rest assured we'll be keeping an eye on how this law will be interpreted and used by law enforcement — especially in light of the coming elections." The 'secret' signing So was the bill signed "in secret"? If it was, then how would we know about it to write this fact-check? The strongest evidence that the bill was signed "in secret" was that Obama didn’t sign it in a public ceremony. The White House released a brief statement after it was signed. The statement said, in its entirety, "On Thursday, March 8, 2012, the President signed into law H.R. 347, the ‘Federal Restricted Buildings and Grounds Improvement Act of 2011,’ which makes it a federal crime to enter or remain knowingly in any restricted area of the White House, the Vice President’s official residence, or their respective grounds without lawful authority." But that statement wasn't secret. In fact, it was a statement from White House Press Secretary Jay Carney that was emailed to journalists on the White House email list -- a list estimated to include several thousand addresses, according to the White House. In addition, the White House told PolitiFact that the bill had been listed on a White House web page for pending legislation before it was signed. And it's important to note that most bills are signed without public ceremonies, according to Senate historian Don Ritchie. So there wasn't the hoopla that surrounds some signings, but it was no secret. In addition, the existence of the bill itself had been known for more than 14 months, and its passage by both chambers of Congress -- and its delivery to the president for his signature -- was public for the whole time. The bill was introduced in January 2011 by Rep. Tom Rooney, R-Fla. Within weeks, it was considered by both the relevant subcommittee and the full committee. On February 28, it was debated on the House floor, in speeches televised on C-SPAN. Rooney urged his colleagues to vote for the measure and the bill was seconded on the floor by a Democrat, Rep. Hank Johnson of Georgia. No one rose to speak against the bill. The bill then proceeded to a vote, under a process called "suspension of the rules" -- a fast-track process used for bills considered non-controversial by the leadership. Using this streamlined process, a bill needs a two-thirds vote to pass, rather than just a simple majority. In this case, the House voted in favor of the bill, 399-3. At that point, the bill went to the Senate, where it became stalled. In November 2011, an amended version made it through the Judiciary Committee, and on Feb. 6, 2012, the Senate announced that it had passed by "unanimous consent" -- a process by which Senators approve a bill without a formal vote, after all Senators have been consulted and none have offered objections. Because the Senate passed an amended version of the bill, it had to go back to the House to be reconciled. On Feb. 27, 2012, the House began a new debate on the amended bill, in which Rooney and Johnson once again spoke on its behalf. Once again, no one rose to speak against the bill. And once again, the bill was put to a vote under suspension of the rules. For a second time, the vote was lopsidedly in favor -- 388-3. With the House and Senate both having passed the bill, it went to the president for his signature on March 1, 2012. Eight days later, Obama signed it, and it became Public Law 112-98. So while it’s true that Obama didn’t invite the media or other observers in for a signing ceremony, the bill had gone through a very public process on its way to becoming law. It twice received a debate (albeit brief ones) on the House floor. The House twice voted on it publicly, in proceedings aired on C-SPAN. And after the second House passage, it was hardly a state secret that the bill was headed to the president’s desk for his signature. Our ruling Napolitano said the law was signed "in secret." But the path of H.R. 347 to the president's desk was very public. It was introduced in public, discussed in public, voted on in public, and then signed the same way as most bills. The White House says it posted the bill on its web page for legislation awaiting the president’s signature. It’s true that there weren't cameras present, but if they had been, what would they have captured? That Obama signed the bill. That fact was announced by the White House the same day in a statement sent to thousands of journalists. There may be legitimate reasons to question whether the law infringes on constitutional rights. But there were many occasions during its public consideration when critics could have questioned lawmakers and the White House about the law. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-06419	"Minimum wage = $16,000/year CEO-Goldman Sachs (Lloyd Blankfein) $16,000/Hour."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2011/oct/26/occupy-providence/occupy-providence-protester-says-goldman-sachs-ceo/	In downtown Providence, as in other cities around the globe, protesters inspired by the Occupy Wall Street movement are trying to raise awareness about economic inequalities. On a recent visit to Occupy Providence’s encampment at Burnside Park, a Providence Journal reporter spotted a hand-written sign that compared the earnings of a minimum wage worker with those of Goldman Sach’s CEO, Lloyd C. Blankfein. The sign read: "Minimum wage = $16,000/year CEO-Goldman Sachs (Lloyd Blankfein) $16,000/Hour." It goes without saying that Goldman’s CEO earns piles more money than most Americans, never mind Rhode Island’s minimum-wage workers. Ever since the New York investment bank accepted a $10-billion government bailout during the financial crisis in 2008, Goldman Sachs has made national headlines for its super-sized executive compensation packages. But we had our doubts about whether Blankfein, Goldman’s chief executive, actually earned in one hour what a minimum wage worker in Rhode Island earned in an entire year. So we decided to check it out. The facts The minimum wage in Rhode Island is $7.40 per hour, so simple math shows that someone who works 40 hours per week for 52 weeks (or 2,080 hours) will earn $15,392 a year. (The minimum wage was the same in 2010 as this year. Many minimum wage workers don’t get benefits, unlike CEOs. But we’ll get to that later.) The protest sign said $16,000, which is pretty close. But calculating the pay of chief executives is more complicated because a large share of their compensation is typically in the form of stock options, pension contributions and other non-cash payments. In 2010, Goldman reported it paid Blankfein a salary of $600,000 plus a bonus of $5.4 million, for a total of $6 million, according to its 2011 proxy statement, the most recent available data. That’s 375 times more than a minimum age worker would earn in Rhode Island. But it’s a mere $2,885 an hour, not $16,000. (We’re basing this calculation on a 40-hour work week.) But wait, there’s more. Besides his salary and bonus, the company reported that it gave Blankfein $12.6 million in restricted stock, boosting his annual compensation to $18.6 million. If he worked 40 hours per week, his hourly rate would amount to $8,942. And that’s without benefits. Goldman also paid Blankfein $464,067 in 401(k) matching contributions, term life insurance premiums, medical and dental premium payments, long-term disability insurance premiums, life insurance premiums and perks such as his company car and driver. (The protesters might have mentioned that the $185,000 Goldman paid for Blankfein’s car and driver last year is more than 3½ times Rhode Island’s median household income in 2010.) In all, Blankfein’s compensation in 2010 totaled about $19.06 million. But once again, simple math shows that the estimated cash value of his compensation that year is $9,165 an hour -- not $16,000 an hour as the protest sign declared. Our ruling The Occupy Providence protest sign was close when it stated that the minimum wage in Rhode Island is $16,000 a year (it’s actually just under $15,400). And its point -- that CEOs such as Blankfein make enormous sums of money while people at the bottom of the economic ladder make almost nothing -- is well taken. But the claim that Goldman Sachs’ CEO earned $16,000 an hour was way off. We rate it False. (Get updates from PolitiFactRI on Twitter.

pomt-05236	Georgia Public Service Commission member Stan Wise "has received about 95 percent of his campaign money from the utilities he is supposed to be regulating."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/jun/05/pam-davidson/ga-candidate-questions-incumbents-donor-list/	Elected officials are often accused of being beholden to the folks who bankroll their campaigns. In one Georgia race, a similar attack by one candidate for a seat on the state’s influential Public Service Commission against the current officeholder has sparked a verbal volleyball match between the two candidates. PolitiFact Georgia was eager to leap in. It all began a few weeks ago when PSC candidate Pam Davidson launched her campaign against incumbent Stan Wise with a statement on her website. "Over the past 18 years, the incumbent candidate has received about 95 percent of his campaign money from the utilities he is supposed to be regulating," she wrote. "This fosters a cozy relationship with those utilities, and Georgia consumers, quite literally, have paid the price." The Public Service Commission regulates natural gas, telecommunications, electric power companies, limousines, bus carriers and towing companies. It does not regulate cable television, telephone service, propane gas and interstate transportation. Davidson made a promise written in bold letters with the next sentence in her statement: "I will not accept campaign contributions or gifts from the entities regulated by the PSC either before or after the election." Davidson nearly won the Republican Party primary race for a PSC seat in 2008 against Lauren "Bubba" McDonald, despite Davidson’s 13-1 fundraising disadvantage. We asked Davidson for information to back up her claim. The candidate said it was an estimate on her part and soon thereafter had a staffer compile data on Wise’s disclosures for one of those 18 years. Before we review those contributions, PolitiFact Georgia had to examine the nuances of Davidson’s statement. The candidate said Wise received nearly all of his contributions "from the utilities he is supposed to be regulating." Wise called that part of the statement incorrect and "silly." Georgia’s campaign finance laws prohibit PSC members from accepting contributions from businesses regulated by the agency, Wise noted. Those businesses can make contributions to members of the Georgia Legislature. "[H]er claim on its face is completely false," Wise said. Wise said he’s "proud" of the contributions he’s received. He doubted that 95 percent of contributions he’s received came from individuals connected to companies regulated by the PSC, describing those donations as "employees exercising their constitutional right to free speech." Davidson countered that Wise may be in line with the letter of the state law on contributions. But he’s fallen out of step with the spirit of the rules, she said. "He’s getting money indirectly," she said. "If the CEO or lobbyist gives me money, it’s for all intents and purposes from the utility." Davidson provided us a report on Wise’s disclosures in 2006. PolitiFact Georgia simultaneously did its own research and reviewed nearly 500 campaign contributions recorded by Wise from 2001 to 2012 that were available on state government websites. Our analysis shows about 66 percent of the contributions were made by people who work for companies regulated by the PSC. An additional 25 percent came from attorneys who work for law firms with clients who do business before the commission. Some of those law firms are the largest in Georgia, and attorneys who work there regularly donate to political candidates in all sorts of campaigns. About 9 percent came from donors we believe have no ties to any utilities. There were some contributions we could not determine whether or not the donors worked for or represented any utilities, and we did not include them in our analysis. We discussed this with Helen O’Leary, senior counsel for Georgia Watch, an organization that advocates for pro-consumer policies at the state Capitol and the PSC. She said some PSC members receive a large percentage of their contributions from donors who work for utilities, particularly attorneys. O’Leary said the organization wished those individuals would refrain from giving to PSC candidates. But there is nothing in current state law that prohibits those contributions. "As an attorney who has appeared before the PSC in matters affecting ratepayers, it is frustrating to take positions against rate increases when you know that opposing counsel, members of his law firm, and employees of the utility he represents have made tens of thousands of dollars in campaign contributions to the same elected officials that will decide these important cases," she said. So where does this leave us? Davidson would get a higher rating on the Truth-O-Meter if she had said that close to 95 percent of Wise’s contributions came from individuals and attorneys who work for or represent the interests of utilities. There’s no proof that her exact statement is accurate. Her over-reaching point appears correct -- people associated with the utilities are contributing about 90 percent of PSC Commissioner Stan Wise’s campaign war chest. However, that money is not coming directly from the utilities, which is prohibited under the law. Many of the lawyers who donated to Wise have colleagues who’ve also given large sums of money to candidates in other races, so some context is necessary. Davidson might be making a good political point, but her statement needs a lot of context to move any higher on the Truth-O-Meter. Our rating: Half True.

pomt-04620	An aide "acted on his own" and "was not representing the Thompson campaign" when he sent an email criticizing the sexual orientation of U.S. Senate candidate Tammy Baldwin.	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/17/tommy-thompson/thompson-says-aide-wasnt-representing-campaign-ema/	Hours before U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin of Madison gave the most important speech of her political career, to the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., a disparaging email made the rounds. Baldwin is facing former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson in a bid for a key open U.S. Senate seat, the one now held by Democrat Herb Kohl. The email criticized Baldwin, who had said that her Sept. 6, 2012, convention speech would focus on "heartland values." Here’s the email message: "Yesterday, Madison-Liberal Tammy Baldwin cited "heartland values" as the topic for her prime time speech to the DNC tomorrow night. Clearly, there's no one better positioned to talk "heartland values" than Tammy" The email included a link to a YouTube videoand then added these words: "A primer of her values---note event, and enjoy." The video is of Baldwin, who would be the first openly gay member of the U.S. Senate, dancing on stage with a costumed band at a 2010 gay pride event in Madison. The email -- and several similar tweets -- were sent to more than a dozen conservative political contacts, including bloggers and those in the media, by Brian Nemoir, senior adviser/communications for the Thompson campaign. One of the recipients forwarded the email to WisPolitics.com, which wrote the first story on the matter and called the messages"a negative hit from Tommy Thompson’s campaign."The tweets were sent from Nemoir’s personal account, according to the Wisconsin State Journal.That account has since added privacy settings. The emails drew a far broader audience, and quickly drew attention -- and criticism -- since it was the first time Baldwin’s sexual orientation had been made an issue in the contentious campaign. In an email to reporters, another Thompson aide, Darrin Schmitz, wrote that Nemoir "acted on his own" and "he was not representing the Thompson campaign in this matter." Is that accurate? Let’s pause for a quick note: When we examine claims from campaign spokespersons, we typically attribute the statement to the candidate. After all, that is what spokespersons are hired to do -- speak for the candidate. We will do that here when evaluating the statement issued by Schmitz, who like Nemoir, has frequently spoken to the media on behalf of the campaign. Five days after the emails were sent, Thompson told reporters after an appearance in Milwaukee:"I thought it was a mistake, I'm sorry, and he's apologized, I believe. He shouldn't have done it." Thompson also said a person's sexual orientation is "absolutely not an issue" in the race. After the email was made public, Nemoir’s role with the campaign changed, and he was replaced as the campaign’s spokesman, according to Thompson. But what about that not-part-of-the-campaign claim about the email? When asked to back up that position, Schmitz said Nemoir’s email was an "unauthorized statement." "As you well know, this is not the first time an employee of any business, organization, campaign or media outlet has shared personal thoughts through a work email," Schmitz said in an email. Maybe so, but some things just don’t add up. In the past, most of Nemoir’s correspondence with reporters had been through his email address with his consulting firm, Full Impact Communications. This email was sent from his email account with the Thompson campaign. The email contained Nemoir’s name and listed his then-position with the campaign: senior adviser/communications. It also contained the web address for the Thompson campaign. It certainly appeared official. What’s more, it arrived a key political moment in the campaign. It was sent out hours in advance of Baldwin’s convention speech, and was tied directly to the theme of that speech "heartland values." Although the email text didn’t note her sexual orientation in depth, the link made the message was clear: Baldwin does not represent "heartland values" because she is gay. "This sounds like a good/bad cop routine. An aide makes an attack through the campaign but the organization disavows the attack," said Darrell West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. "This can be a very effective strategy if the media pick up the attack." West added that "making an issue of someone's sexuality is not a casual decision. Campaigns think very carefully about the up and downside of that." He likened the message to "lobbing a nuclear bomb into a meadow." Our rating A Thompson consultant said the campaign was not responsible for an email that criticized Baldwin as not representing "heartland values." But the email came from the campaign’s chief spokesman on a campaign account at a key political moment in the campaign. It was sent to conservative bloggers and others. It was clearly meant to draw attention to the video of Baldwin’s appearance at the gay pride event. The average reader of the email got the message loud and clear: Thompson’s campaign was criticizing Baldwin. Schmitz’s statement is false, and it’s ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-05652	Despite President Barack Obama's promise to cut healthcare costs, "the average cost of a family policy is up $1,300."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/20/republican-national-committee-republican/rnc-ad-blames-obama-1300-spike-family-health-care-/	Republicans are expecting to use health care as a wedge issue in the 2012 elections -- an approach made clear in a web ad released by the Republican National Committee on March 19, 2012. "Barack Obama promised to cut health care costs," the ad says. After airing a clip of Obama saying, "We will bring down premiums by $2,500 for the typical family," the ad continues: "But it didn't happen. Six in 10 americans are seeing their premiums rise. The average cost of a family policy is up $1,300. And a key part of Obama's health care takeover will cost $100 billion more than promised. Higher costs for patients, higher costs for taxpayers. Another broken promise for Obama." Elsewhere, we’ve given Obama a rating of Stalled for his promise to lower family premiums by $2,500. So the RNC has a point that Obama over-promised on family premiums. But is the RNC on safe ground when it blames Obama for "the average cost of a family policy" rising by $1,300? The ad references a widely respected study produced annually by the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent group that studies health care, and the Health Research and Educational Trust. It’s a sample based on surveys of benefits administrators working for about 2,000 employers that offer health care plans. The 2011 edition of this survey found that the average cost of all private plans was $15,073, which was up from the $13,770 found in 2010 -- a difference of $1,303, almost exactly what the ad said. So the RNC’s number is legitimate. But we think it’s worth adding some context. First, the figure in question refers to the entire cost of the health coverage -- that is, both the portion paid by the employee and by the employer. And as it happens, most of the $1,300 increase between 2010 and 2011 was picked up by the employer -- not the employee. Employees and their families saw their cost of health care increase by a much smaller amount -- $132. Employers, by contrast, had to foot a $1,171 increase. The ad is technically correct when it uses the $1,300 figure, and additional employer health care costs don’t simply disappear; they can directly reduce the amount of money available for employee pay, meaning that employees may indirectly bear that burden. "Workers sooner or later pay pretty much all of the cost of the insurance that employers ‘provide,’ " said Henry Aaron, a health care specialist at the Brookings Institution. Still, when watching the ad, it’s easy for a viewer to assume that the average family is shelling out $1,300 more -- but that’s not the case. It’s only about one-tenth of that, at least directly. Second, the link between Obama’s policies and health care premium increases is more nuanced than the ad makes it, because most of the health care law hasn’t taken effect yet. Jonathan Oberlander, a health policy professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, said that he is uncertain about how the law will affect health costs in the long run, but he added that it’s premature to draw a straight-line link between the law and rising premiums. "Blaming the health care law for rising premiums or faulting it for failing to lower them is misleading," Oberlander said. One private-sector study of health insurance premiums, by the firm Aon Hewitt found that overall, the new law "is anticipated to increase costs by an average of 1.5 percent in 2011," which the firm said was in line with other studies. The increase was greater than that for individually purchased plans and smaller for large employer plans. This average increase of 1.5 percent is well below the overall increase in premiums found in the Kaiser/HRET study, which suggests that factors other than the law were driving the overall increase. One piece of evidence to support this view can be found in the Kaiser/HRET report itself. Since 1999, both the employee’s and the employer’s health care premium costs have each risen at an average of 13 percent to 14 percent a year. So these increases have been going on for a long time, primarily because of technological advances and rising physician and pharmaceutical costs. Such longer term trends are more important benchmarks anyway, experts say. "What happens over a year or two typically means little," said Aaron of Brookings. "What happens over longer period does matter." Our ruling The RNC ad uses a legitimate figure, though its meaning can’t be fully understood without additional context. Families aren’t shelling out $1,300 more for health coverage this year; they are paying $132 more, with their employers picking up the rest, a financial burden that may, or may not, be passed on indirectly to the employee. Meanwhile, uncertainty remains about why premiums have risen in the past year. Given that some provisions of Obama’s health care law are already in effect, such as the requirement that health plans include children to age 26, the law has probably had some impact. However, premiums were already on an upward track well before the law was passed. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-08205	"The law, right now, permits companies that close down American factories and offices and move those jobs overseas to take a tax deduction for the costs associated with moving the jobs to China or India or wherever."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/nov/21/sheldon-whitehouse/whitehouse-says-companies-get-tax-break-moving-job/	It's bad enough when companies take U.S. jobs and move them overseas to take advantage of lower labor costs. But does the U.S. tax code actually offer an incentive for firms to engage in such "offshoring?" That was the assertion of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse earlier this fall when he went on the floor of the Senate to argue for a bill, designated S-3816 and known as the "Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act." The proposal, he said, "would close some really perverse loopholes in the tax code that, right now, reward American companies for moving American jobs overseas. The law, right now, permits companies that close down American factories and offices and move those jobs overseas to take a tax deduction for the costs associated with moving the jobs to China or India or wherever." There's nothing controversial about allowing companies to deduct their expenses for doing business, but does the tax system actually help companies cover the cost of moving local jobs to another country? Absolutely, said Thea Lee, deputy chief of staff of the AFL-CIO, a 12-million member labor organization that opposes offshoring. "You can take a business deduction for the costs associated with moving the job. So if you close down your factory in Providence, pack everything up and have to train the workers and ship the machinery overseas, all the costs associated with that are tax deductions," she said. As a result, companies get back roughly a third of their expense at the expense of U.S. taxpayers, she said. "There have been a lot of attempts over the years to get rid of this," but corporation lobbyists have argued that the loophole is needed because it creates more jobs, said Lee. "You can believe that or not. I don't give it a lot of credence." Robert E. Scott, senior international economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal-leaning think tank that deals with issues of concern to low- and middle-income workers, confirmed that relocation expenses are deductible and that existing tax law makes no distinction between whether a company moves part of its operations to another state or to another country. "Businesses that have expenses of any kind are allowed to deduct them against income, and that would include any kind of shutdown expenses having to do with a plant," he said. "They could also play games, potentially, with writing down any undepreciated value, so if they decide to scrap equipment they're shipping to China they could write down the depreciated value and take that off against their taxes as well. Both are options available to companies, and I suspect they are widely used." On the same day Whitehouse made his statement, Scott A. Hodge, president of The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax policy, released a statement saying the problem that served as the premise of the legislation isn't as big as people imagine. He cited a Bureau of Labor Statistics report from the second quarter of 2010 showing 338,064 mass layoffs. When seasonal layoffs are subtracted, only 6 percent of the remaining workers -- 10,206 people -- lost their jobs during that quarter due to any movement of work. When the destination of the relocation was known (most of the time it wasn't) about 29 percent of the movement was to places outside the U.S. We checked more-recent numbers from the third quarter of this year; they showed a similar pattern.) "The bottom line is that offshoring accounts for a small percentage of overall job losses . . . The offshoring of jobs may make for good headlines and political points, but it is not supported by the data," Hodge concluded. In this case, the bill, which would also have given companies two years of payroll tax relief for jobs they brought back to the U.S. from overseas, was opposed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in part because it contained another provision limiting the ability of companies to defer paying U.S. taxes on money earned overseas. The chamber argued that it would limit the ability to compete overseas. S-3816 was essentially voted down Sept. 28 after it garnered only 53 of the 60 votes required to close off debate. Among 57 Democrats, 52 supported it (one didn't vote), 40 of 41 Republicans opposed it (one didn't vote) and the two independents were split. So the law Whitehouse decries is still the law. There is little debate that the current system allows companies to get a tax break for their expenses when they send jobs outside the U.S. We rate Whitehouse's statement True.

pomt-02926	As CFO, Alex Sink oversaw "a $27 billion loss in the state's pension fund."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/nov/01/republican-party-florida/florida-gop-says-alex-sink-oversaw-27b-loss-pensio/	Just hours after Democrat Alex Sink announced her run for the congressional seat left vacant after C.W. Bill Young’s death, the Republican Party of Florida started a full-court press attack. The Florida GOP posted a YouTube video criticizing Sink on a host of issues, presumably attacks they pulled from their arsenal when she ran against Rick Scott for governor in 2010. "As Florida’s CFO, Alex Sink failed Florida taxpayers by using the state plane as her own personal charter, overseeing a $27 billion loss in the state’s pension fund and supporting a $5.2 billion increase in Florida’s debt," the video’s text reads. We’ll examine other claims from the ad during the race, but in this fact-check we’ll focus on looking into Sink’s tie to the state pension fund. Is it accurate to say she oversaw $27 billion in losses? As the state’s chief financial officer, Sink’s responsibilities included accounting, auditing and managing Florida’s finances. She also served on the State Board Administration of Florida, the office that oversees the pension fund. In their Feburary 2013 report, the SBA put the value of pension assets at $132 billion. In 2007, the year Sink took office, the pension was worth $136.3 billion, according to the SBA. In 2010, her last year as CFO, that value was down to $109.3 billion. That makes the net loss $27 billion, as the ad said. This claim echoes those made by the party when Sink ran for governor against Republican Rick Scott. As we’ve noted before, there are several important caveats to this claim. The action of comparing how much the pension is worth at different points in history is not as devastating as it might sound. There’s no permanent loss in value until the assets are sold. Although the pension was temporarily worth less in 2010 than in 2007, the money isn’t gone by any means. When the nation started recovering from the recession a couple of years ago, the Florida pension followed suit. "The pension fund is in pretty good shape right now," said Kurt Wenner, vice president for tax research at Florida TaxWatch, a business-backed institute focused on tax issues. "It certainly wasn’t a critical situation." Besides the figures not being permanent, the implication that Sink, as CFO, is to blame for the loss in value is also misleading. Three SBA trustees jointly oversee the pension fund: the governor, the attorney general and the CFO. There’s nothing that suggests Sink’s responsibilities should be singled out above those of either former Gov. Charlie Crist or former Attorney General Bill McCollum (who were both Republicans at the time, by the way). Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said there was a loss of pension assets of $27 billion during Sink’s term as the state’s CFO. But that doesn’t represent a permanent loss of funds. We also see no reason why Sink deserves more of the blame than the other two trustees. And, Sink was CFO during a historic recession. Given these sizeable caveats, we rate the Florida GOP’s claim Half True.	None	Republican Party of Florida	None	None	None	2013-11-01T15:52:55	2013-10-30	['Alex_Sink']

pomt-04157	"The price tag amounted to nearly $4,200 for every man, woman and child in the state."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/dec/23/steve-lonegan/steve-lonegan-says-hurricane-sandy-aid-package-amo/	Count conservative activist Steve Lonegan among those not pleased with President Obama requesting $60 billion in aid for New Jersey, New York and other states hit hard by Hurricane Sandy. That money’s coming from somewhere – taxpayers – and the bill appropriating the money reportedly has millions in pork-barrel projects attached to it, according to Lonegan, state director for the New Jersey chapter of Americans For Prosperity. Lonegan issued a news release on the matter Tuesday, calling the request to Congress "ridiculous," and noting that "the price tag amounted to nearly $4,200 for every man, woman and child in the state." We asked Lonegan spokesman Mike Proto whether Lonegan meant the $4,200 as a cost or grant for each New Jerseyan. "Neither," he said. "It’s just simply doing the math of what it (the aid package) would equate to." Lonegan, however, used the words "price tag" in his statement, which implies cost or debt. And in our calculations, the numbers don’t add up. Let’s first review the facts that led to Obama’s request. Hurricane Sandy walloped the state on Oct. 29, shredding houses along the Shore and inland. Millions lost power for extended periods and 40 people from 13 counties in New Jersey died as a result of the storm. Obama came to New Jersey and toured the damage with Gov. Chris Christie. Obama also later toured New York. The damages amount for New Jersey has fluctuated, but Christie’s latest estimate is approximately $37 billion. The total damages estimate for all three states is $82 billion, according to estimates from Christie, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Connecticut Gov. Dannel P. Malloy. Proto said Lonegan’s calculation is based on the New Jersey damage estimate and U.S. Census Bureau population data for 2011. Dividing $37 billion by the state’s population of 8,821,155 equals $4,194, which is correct, when looking at Lonegan’s estimate of "about $4,200" per person. But there’s a couple of problems. First, Lonegan didn’t use $37 billion in his news release, he used $60 billion - four times. That makes the per-person amount $6,801. Second, any federal aid package is going to be paid by the entire country, not just New Jerseyans. The current U.S. population is 314,981,492. That means a $60 billion aid package would cost every U.S. man, woman and child $190.48. A $37 billion aid package would cost each person $117.46. Lonegan favors no aid for the damages caused by Sandy. "There is a moral question here," Lonegan said in an e-mail. "Should a group of people who have had their homes damaged by a hurricane have more political clout than a single person who has had their home destroyed by a tragedy?" Aid of any amount would further increase debt, Lonegan added. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-NJ) spoke Monday on the Senate floor about the need for funding to help New Jersey rebuild, and acknowledged cost concerns. "Unfortunately, there are those voices who are saying the cost to help families rebuild and recover is too much; that it should be reduced; that in this emergency, unlike many other similar emergencies in the past, we should do something smaller and wait to do the rest later," Menendez said. "Those who make such arguments could not be, respectfully, more wrong." Our ruling Lonegan said in a news release that the "price tag" for $60 billion in aid requested by Obama "amounted to nearly $4,200 for every man, woman and child in the state." Price tag implies cost. That calculation is only correct if it’s based on New Jersey’s damages of $37 billion, an amount Lonegan didn’t mention in his news release. A $60 billion aid package would amount to $6,801 for every New Jerseyan. Further, the nation would share in the cost of an aid package, not just those in the Garden State, bringing the per-person cost to less than $200. Since there is an element of truth to Lonegan’s claim, we rate this statement Mostly False. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-07603	"Since 1980, over 145 incidents have been documented of suction entrapment in swimming pools and spas, including 36 deaths of children."	true	/texas/statements/2011/mar/23/leticia-van-de-putte/state-sen-letiticia-van-de-putte-says-there-have-b/	Filing legislation that would require someone selling property to disclose whether a home swimming pool or hot tub has a hazardous drain, state Sen. Leticia Van de Putte, D-San Antonio, said in a press release: "Too many Texas children are harmed and killed in pools." "Since 1980, over 145 incidents have been documented of suction entrapment in swimming pools and spas, including 36 deaths of children," according to her Feb. 16 press release. Her proposed legislation amends the state’s seller’s disclosure notice so that sellers say whether the property has a single blockable main drain in a pool, hot tub or spa, which "may cause a suction entrapment hazard for an individual." Van de Putte spokeswoman Sarah Gomez told us the senator has offered pool safety legislation the past three sessions. In 2009, the Senate approved her measure requiring residential pools and spas built or installed in Texas to be enclosed by barriers preventing small children from entering unsupervised, among other stipulations. It died in the House. Responding to our request for back-up for the senator’s numbers, Gomez sent us the background from a 2007 federal law, an earlier study of entrapment dangers and articles indicating a federal agency has long tracked entrapment incidents and resulting deaths. The background section of the 2007 Virgina Graeme Baker Pool and Safety Spa Act, a federal law setting tougher safety standards for public pools and spas, says that at least 33 children 14 and younger died from 1985 through 2000 as a result of drain entrapment. Gomez also provided a May 2006 study by Safe Kids Worldwide, a Washington-based group which launched in 1988 to advocate childhood injury prevention. The group joined with Nancy Baker to advocate for the act named after her daughter, who drowned in a hot tub at a family friend’s home in Virginia after she was entrapped by the drain’s suction. The study states that "entrapment occurs when part of a child’s body becomes attached to a drain as a result of the powerful suction of the water circulation system, or an arm or leg is inserted into a drain with a missing or broken cover." A child can drown if the suction overpowers his or her ability to disengage. According to an October 2003 Pool & Spa News article, the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission confirmed 147 suction entrapment incidents from 1985 and March 2002, resulting in 36 deaths — not all of them children. We asked Gomez about the senator’s reference to 36 child deaths, Gomez said Van de Putte misread that statistic. "It was 36 total deaths," she said. "It was not intentional and she was not trying to mislead anyone." Next, Tanya Chin Ross, director of policy for Safe Kids Worldwide, pointed us to a May 2010 memo from the product safety commission tracking drain entrapments and deaths each year from 1999 to 2009, listing 94 entrapments in pools, spas and whirlpool tubs — including 49 incidents in residential facilities. The agency’s tally suggests that at least six entrapped children died from 2001 through 2009, a result that would make the total of confirmed child deaths from such incidents since 1985 at least 39. According to the memo, the commission eliminated reports that didn’t involve drain entrapments or were duplicates. Commission spokeswoman Kathleen Reilly told us that the agency investigates incident reports it receives directly. Otherwise, the agency tries to confirm claims "by getting as much data as possible," including hospital and police reports, she said. Reilly told us that between 1985 and 2009, the agency received reports of 154 incidents resulting from pool, spa, hot tub or whirlpool entrapments, including 54 deaths; she didn’t have a count for children who died. Finally, we sought Texas-specific data. Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman with the Texas Department of State Health Services, told us the agency tabulates pool drownings, but not yet drain entrapments. All told, it looks like Van de Putte understates the 154 people, at least, who have been sucked into a U.S. pool or spa drain. While her backup information didn’t prove that 36 children died as a result, the sources we culled suggest that at least 39 children have perished. We rate her statement as True.

pomt-11810	Californians pay "the highest electricity bills" in the nation.	false	/california/statements/2017/nov/16/john-cox/does-california-have-highest-electricity-bills-nat/	Californians pay a premium to live in the Golden State. Our housing costs are astronomical, gas prices are the highest in the nation and many state taxes are at or near the top. In a recent interview on Capital Public Radio, Republican candidate for governor John Cox said he wants to reduce the financial strain on Californians. "The state has been rendered unaffordable by the politicians in Sacramento. It’s got the worst business climate in the nation. We’re a laughing stock. And I want to change that," Cox, a San Diego businessman, said in the interview conducted Oct. 21, 2017. Cox cited several of the state’s high costs from housing to gas prices. We fact-checked those in a related article. He went on to say, however, that Californians also pay "the highest electricity bills" in the country. California, the center of the nation’s solar industry, is known for both producing and consuming huge amounts of electricity. But do we also pay the most on our electricity bills? We decided to shine a light on this claim. Our research California has the nation’s sixth highest retail price of electricity in the residential sector, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which provides independent analysis of energy data. So, one might assume with this high cost Californians also pay more than most states on their bills. In fact, it’s just the opposite, at least for two key sectors. California’s average residential monthly electricity bill in 2016 was $95.20, or less expensive than 39 other states, according to EIA data. Nationwide, the average bill was $112.59 per month. Meanwhile, the state’s average industrial monthly electricity bill was $3,408, or 42nd in the nation. That was about half the national average. California’s average commercial monthly electricity bill was $866, or fifth highest in the nation, much closer to the top, but by no means "the highest." "California has some of the highest rates, but they also have some of the lowest consumption per customer, so they have lower bills than most states," said Marc Hanish, an EIA expert on state electricity profiles. Indeed, California ranks 49th in the nation in per capita electricity consumption. Hanish said that’s driven both by high prices and by the state’s strong commitment to energy efficient buildings and appliances. Cox’s campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Our ruling Candidate for governor John Cox recently claimed California has "the highest electricity bills" in the country. Data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows California’s average monthly electricity bills in 2016 ranked far below the national average, particularly in the residential and industrial sectors. They were 40th and 42nd, respectively. The state’s average monthly commercial electricity bills were more expensive, at fifth highest, though still not "the highest" as Cox claimed. California’s electricity prices are more expensive than in many states. Customers in the state, however, consume far less electricity than the national average, which drives down the cost of bills. Even if Cox had claimed California had the highest electricity rates, he would still be off the mark. Cox’s campaign offered no evidence to back up his claim. We rate it False.

pomt-11834	Since 1965, California has built "six (college) campuses but 23 prisons."	false	/california/statements/2017/nov/09/delaine-eastin/false-claim-california-has-built-nearly-four-times/	Candidate for California governor Delaine Eastin bills herself as the education candidate. She has, after all, spent her career in education - serving as a community college professor, as the state’s superintendent of public instruction and on the boards of the University of California and California State University systems. Early in her campaign, the Democratic candidate has called for a "reinvestment in education," including funding for universal preschool and tuition-free college. Also on the topic of higher education, Eastin has claimed in recent months that California has failed to prioritize college construction in favor of prisons. "We’ve built six total (college) campuses — one UC, three CSUs, two community colleges — since 1965. That’s six campuses but 23 prisons," Eastin said in an interview with Capital Public Radio on Oct. 16, 2017. This is not the only time Eastin has made this colleges-to-prisons comparison. In May, during her speech at the 2017 California Democratic Party State Convention, Eastin asserted that California had built "just six colleges but 22 prisons" since 1985. Was Eastin right? Has California built nearly four times as many prisons as colleges since 1965, or perhaps since 1985? We set out on a fact check. Our research First, we looked at prisons. The portion of Eastin’s claim about 23 prisons built since 1965 is correct, according to a chronological list produced by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Twenty-one have opened since 1985. Altogether, California operates 35 state prisons and houses about 129,000 inmates, according to a March 2017 report by the California Legislative Analyst’s Office. California is also home to 12 federal prisons. But because the state is not responsible for their construction or operation, we have decided not to include them. Colleges A glance at the history of the UC and CSU systems shows Eastin is again correct, at least on this portion of her claim: The University of California at Merced opened in 2005, the lone campus in the 10-campus UC system added since 1965. Meanwhile, the state has constructed three California State University campuses during this period: Cal State San Marcos in 1990, Cal State Monterey Bay in 1995 and Cal State Channel Islands in 2002. They are the newest additions to the 23-campus CSU system. We found, however, a glaring error on Eastin’s count of community colleges. There have been 41 of those campuses built since 1965 -- not the two she claimed in the radio interview. That’s according to a list on the California Community Colleges Chancellor’s Office website. See a list of the colleges below: California Community College Construction Infogram "I think it speaks to the important role that California community colleges play in meeting local education demand," said Erik Skinner, the community college system’s deputy chancellor, about the pace of construction. Skinner said the system has also opened 70 smaller community college "satellite centers," across the state during this period. Nine of the system’s full-scale community colleges have been built since 1985, again far more than the two Eastin claimed for this time period in her convention speech. "An error in good faith" Eastin’s spokesman Jon Murchinson acknowledged the inaccuracy of the community college statistic -- a figure that greatly throws off her "six colleges" to "23 prisons" comparison. He told PolitiFact California it was "an error in good faith as (Eastin) had heard the number from someone," and that she "regrets using it without verifying the source." He said she won’t be using it in the future. While Eastin missed the mark, a look at campus data shows the California community college system has significantly slowed its pace of construction. It built a combined 32 campuses in the 1960s and 70s but only nine in the nearly four decades after. Skinner, the system’s deputy chancellor, said construction is driven by population growth and economic conditions, which fueled the campus boom in the ‘60s and ‘70s. It has focused on adding to its existing colleges and on student completion rates in recent decades. Our ruling In a recent Capital Public Radio interview, candidate for California governor Delaine Eastin claimed the state has built only six college campuses, including two community colleges, "but 23 prisons" since 1965. Eastin was right in her count of state prisons. But she was way off the mark on colleges: California has opened 41 community colleges, three California State University campuses and one University of California campus for a total of 45 campuses since 1965. Eastin made a similar claim at the California Democratic Convention in May, though she used a more recent timeline. She said California had built "just six colleges but 22 prisons" since 1985. That statement is also inaccurate. Eastin’s campaign told us the candidate made a mistake and will correct her figures in future statements. We rate Eastin’s claim from her radio interview False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-14807	In 2008, Maggie Hassan voted against legislation to "prevent sanctuary cities in New Hampshire."	mostly true	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/nov/25/jennifer-horn/did-maggie-hassan-vote-against-legislation-prevent/	Ever since New Hampshire Gov. Maggie Hassan decided to run for U.S. Senate against incumbent Republican Kelly Ayotte, the two-term Democratic governor has come under GOP fire. The state Republican party recently took aim at Hassan’s record on immigration, suggesting that Hassan has supported so-called "sanctuary city" policies that protect illegal immigrants from federal laws. "In 2008, then-state Sen. Maggie Hassan voted to kill legislation that would have blocked any effort to promote sanctuary city policies in New Hampshire and protect illegal immigrants convicted of violent crimes," party chairwoman Jennifer Horn said in a memo titled "Maggie Hassan’s terrible campaign kickoff." PolitiFact New Hampshire decided to take a closer look at Hassan’s voting record in the state Senate. Before we get into the the specific New Hampshire legislation, let’s explain what the term "sanctuary city" means. As PolitiFact has noted before, there is no specific legal definition of "sanctuary city." Generally, though, the term refers to places where local law enforcement officers aren’t required to alert federal authorities to residents who may be in the country illegally. The policies have come into question nationally following the recent shooting death of a San Francisco woman, allegedly by a Mexican native with a criminal record. San Francisco’s quarter-century-old law declaring it a "city and county of refuge" generally bans public employees from assisting Immigration and Customs Enforcement with investigations or arrests unless required by a law or a warrant. In New Hampshire, the issue of sanctuary cities came up for debate during the 2008 legislative session. Then, former state Sen. Joe Kenney, a Republican, proposed legislation that would have barred New Hampshire from serving "as a sanctuary for illegal aliens." The bill also mandated that state law enforcement agencies enforce federal immigration laws "to the extent authorized by federal law." Hassan, then a state senator, was one of 13 Democrats who voted to kill the bill, which went down in a 13-10 vote along party lines. The state Republican Party pointed to that 2008 vote to back up their claim that Hassan voted against any effort to curb sanctuary city policies and protect illegal immigrants convicted of violent crimes. The bill, SB353, specifically stated New Hampshire "shall not serve as a sanctuary for illegal aliens" and police "shall enforce federal immigration laws to the extent authorized by federal law." A spokesman for Hassan’s senatorial campaign said she voted against it because it was an unfunded mandate. It’s worth noting New Hampshire was not home to any sanctuary cities then, nor were any efforts in the works to establish sanctuary cities in the state. And more than seven years later, New Hampshire still has no sanctuary cities, according to national lists and state officials. In other words, this was mostly symbolic legislation, since no efforts were under way to promote sanctuary cities then, nor are there any efforts now. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service published a 2006 report listing 31 cities and counties that "will generally promote policies that ensure such aliens will not be turned over to federal authorities." No New Hampshire municipalities appeared on the list. The Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors stricter immigration laws, regularly updates a map on its website detailing sanctuary cities, counties and states. No New Hampshire cities or counties appeared on that map either. And New Hampshire didn’t appear on a list created by the Ohio Jobs and Justice PAC, which was founded by Steve Salvi, a critic of sanctuary cities. In addition, both New Hampshire Deputy Attorney General Ann Rice and Tilton Police Chief Robert Cormier, who heads the New Hampshire Association of Chiefs of Police, said they are unaware of any sanctuary cities in the state. That brings us to the second piece of the bill, which would have required police to enforce federal immigration laws, to the extent allowed by federal law. Several years before SB353 was filed, in 2005, New Hampshire made national news because two of its police chiefs -- one in tiny New Ipswich and the other in the larger town of Hudson -- decided to use local criminal trespassing laws to arrest and detain immigrants who couldn’t prove they were here legally. A judge later ruled that the chiefs had violated the Constitution by trying to enforce federal laws, and the charges were dismissed after immigration lawyers challenged the trespassing charges levied against 8 men. New Hampshire police only have the authority to enforce state laws and local ordinances, not federal immigration laws, Rice said. Still, New Hampshire police do play a role in immigration enforcement. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the federal agency known as ICE, gets fingerprints from local law enforcement officers when they arrest and book a suspect. Under an initiative called Priority Enforcement Program, ICE then determines whether to detain the person for removal. ICE targets people who have been "convicted of significant criminal offenses or who otherwise pose a threat to public safety." If ICE decides the suspect should be detained, the federal agency requests a transfer from local law enforcement. "All we do, is we would contact ICE and they would make a determination," said Cormier, who doesn’t know of any local police departments that don’t comply. "We are sworn to uphold all state and federal laws, and part of that is to notify federal authorities if we get a hit on someone they are looking for," he said. Our ruling The New Hampshire Republican Party said that Maggie Hassan, as a state senator, "voted to kill legislation that would have blocked any effort to promote sanctuary city policies in New Hampshire." Hassan did vote against a 2008 bill that would have prohibited New Hampshire from serving as a "sanctuary for illegal aliens." However, it’s worth noting there were no efforts to establish sanctuary cities in the state at the time, nor are there any efforts today. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Jennifer Horn	None	None	None	2015-11-25T15:22:38	2015-10-21	['None']
pomt-11242	"I come from the poorest ZIP code in San Antonio."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/may/03/lupe-valdez/lupe-valdez-I-come-poorest-zip-code-san-antonio-te/	Lupe Valdez, who ran ahead of fellow Democratic candidates for governor in the party’s March 2018 primary, later told a commentator she’s better qualified than the other Democrat still in the race because of challenges she’s overcome. Valdez replied to an April 2018 question about why she’s the better pick heading in the May 22, 2018, primary runoff with Houston investor Andrew White: "First of all, I come from the poorest ZIP code in San Antonio and I had to struggle to get to where I am. I had to struggle to go to school. I had to struggle to go to college. I had to struggle in the military. I was always a person struggling to get further along. I know what it is to have to struggle in your everyday life. And the majority of Texans are still struggling today." Valdez has long lived in Dallas County, where she served as the county sheriff into 2018. Still, we were curious about the relative poverty of where she grew up on San Antonio’s Westside. Campaign cites editorial When we sought more information, Kiefer Odell of Valdez’s campaign replied by email that Valdez grew up on Calles Street, which runs just a few blocks, "in the 78207 zip code in San Antonio and lived there until she went to college." Odell pointed out a March 2016 San Antonio Express-News editorial describing the 78207 ZIP code, which had been featured nearly 50 years earlier in a CBS News documentary, "Hunger in America," In 78207, the editorial said, "nearly half of the adults don’t have a high school diploma. Nearly 60 percent of adults are not working. Unemployment is up. Income is far below the state’s median level. The poverty rate is stuck at 42 percent." The editorial said: "Generations have passed, and it’s hard to say that life in the 78207 ZIP code is demonstrably better than when ‘Hunger in America’ was released." Odell pointed too to a September 2017 account from the Rivard Report, a San Antonio news website, citing a new study finding 78207 among the city’s most distressed areas. The analysis by the Economic Innovation Group, a think tank and advocacy group whose mission is to "advance solutions that empower entrepreneurs and investors to forge a more dynamic American economy," includes a clickable U.S. map that enabled us to isolate San Antonio’s ZIP codes by levels of distress. According to the research, rooted in American Community Survey data for 2011-15, the inner-city 78207 ZIP code ranks among nine San Antonio ZIP codes with distress scores of 90 percent or more. Within 78207, the research suggests, 47 percent of adults lacked a high school diploma; 46 percent weren’t working; and 41 percent of residents lived in poverty. Parsing federal estimates From the start, we confronted a hitch in fact-checking Valdez’s claim; the U.S. Postal Service put ZIP codes in place everywhere in July 1963. At the time, Valdez, born in 1947, was in her teens. Still, we were able to get information tied to ZIP codes for recent years and nearly 20 years past plus data reflecting on poverty rates by neighborhood tracing as far back as 1960. With help from Jeff Bloem of the Minnesota Population Center at the University of Minnesota, a resource suggested by Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer, we downloaded information collected in 1989 for the 1990 Census. Our sort of those results showed that at the time, 51 percent of residents of the 78207 ZIP code lived in poverty and the ZIP code ranked first among local ZIP codes in its raw count of residents in poverty (28,155). On the flip side, three less populous San Antonio ZIP codes had bigger shares of residents in poverty -- 78203 and 78208 (57 percent each, with 4,234 and 2,901 residents in poverty, respectively) and 78215 (53 percent, 657 people in poverty). For close-to-current data, we queried the bureau’s American FactFinder to fetch estimated poverty rates by ZIP code according to the American Community Survey covering 2012-16. Results: In those years, the 78207 ZIP code ranked second in San Antonio with 41 percent of residents (20,122 people) living in poverty--trailing the less populous 78202 ZIP code, which had 45 percent of residents (5,426 people) living in poverty. According to our sort, San Antonio ZIP codes with the next-highest poverty rates were 78203 (37 percent, 2,343 people); 78208 (35 percent, 1,527 people); and 78225 (33 percent, 4,576 people). By email, Potter cautioned against reaching conclusions based solely on the differing percentages. Once you consider ACS margins of error, Potter advised, the 78207, 78202, 78203 and 78208 ZIP codes had poverty rates not statistically distinct from each other. 78207 "is one of four ZIP codes with the highest percent living in poverty" in San Antonio, Potter summed up, and "we couldn’t say anyone was more poor than the other with statistical certainty." Potter also pointed us to Heywood Sanders, a University of Texas at San Antonio professor. When we inquired, Sanders had handy older breakdowns of poverty by neighborhood. By email, Sanders provided a 1974 bureau report, based on surveys taken in 1969, indicating that Westside neighborhoods including Calles Street accounted for the city’s greatest concentration of low-income residents. In 1969, the report states, 51,215 of the area’s 117,800 almost entirely "Spanish language" residents, 43.5 percent, lived in poverty; the report states that 36.2 percent of residents of the next-worst-off San Antonio neighborhood lived below poverty. Sanders also checked his records for poverty levels gauged for the 1960 census. According to that census, Sanders told us, the census tract taking in Calles Street ranked about sixth in the city for its share of residents in poverty with worse-off neighborhoods mostly on the Westside, which was once known as the Mexican Quarter or, more colloquially, Little Mexico, Sanders said. Why so long? We also inquired into the roots of 78207’s persistent high poverty. Potter, saying that he works in the ZIP code, said it’s "commonly known to be one of, if not, the poorest areas of the city. Many people familiar with the city would be likely to say that even without looking at the data." Another authority, Christine Drennon, director of the urban studies program at San Antonio’s Trinity University, identified a few factors. By email, Drennon said that when housing in the area was "originally built in the early part of the 20th century, most of it was NOT deed restricted, yet (it) was situated amongst deed-restricted neighborhoods. In addition, the lots were smaller and the infrastructure nearly nonexistent. "That resulted," Drennon wrote, "in a non-Anglo population living in very humble housing which was later redlined and thus denied capital for rehab or upgrades. Due to local and federal policies like these, wealth was racialized, such that today this area is both poor and non-white. The housing was never replaced, thus it continues to house some of our poorest families," Drennon said. Patti Radle, a member of the San Antonio Independent School District board of trustees, said by phone that she’s lived in the 78207 ZIP code since 1969. Poverty abides, she said, "but it’s a wonderful place to live because of the character of attention to family." Affordable housing remains a need, Radle said, and smaller streets lack sidewalks though thanks to citizen activism, many streets are far better than before. Our ruling Valdez said: "I come from the poorest ZIP code in San Antonio." Poverty rates by ZIP code aren’t available for much of Valdez’s growing-up years though figures based on surveys taken in 1959, 1969, 1989 and from 2012 through 2016 show Valdez hails from the part of San Antonio long home to the greatest number of people in poverty. That said, a few other less populous ZIP codes occasionally had greater shares of residents in poverty. We rate her claim Mostly True.

pomt-10127	Obama "voted for ... $3-million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/oct/10/john-mccain/obama-sought-the-money-but-its-no-mere-projector/	Note: This item has been updated since it originally was published, with new information that has changed the ruling. Seeking to paint his Democratic rival as a spendthrift, Sen. John McCain highlighted a request Sen. Barack Obama once made to help a Chicago landmark. “He voted for nearly a billion dollars in pork-barrel earmark projects, including, by the way, $3-million for an overhead projector at a planetarium in Chicago, Illinois,” McCain said during the Oct. 7, 2008, presidential debate. “My friends, do we need to spend that kind of money?” McCain was referring to a spending request for the 2008 budget. And, indeed, the Web site of Obama’s Senate office shows Obama asked for $3-million for the Adler Planetarium. According to Obama’s office, the equipment had begun to fail and deprived people of a learning experience. “The projection equipment in this theater is 40 years old, and is no longer supported with parts or service by the manufacturer,” his office said in a June 21, 2007, announcement. McCain refers to the item as an "overhead projector," conjuring images of those little projectors on carts in public school libraries all over America, but calling this piece of equipment an overhead projector is like calling the space shuttle a bottle rocket. The projector at Adler that would be replaced is 2½ tons, 18 feet in diameter and elevates from 12 to 20 feet. It's used to display 7,000 stars and planets that are visible, said Mark Webb, director of theaters at Adler. It has motors and gears. “The characterization of it as an overhead projector is not very accurate,” said Webb, who has been at the planetarium more than 25 years. While the museum has not settled on a specific replacement, the $3-million would help cover most of the cost of a new system of projectors. It will be computerized with light sources that would display all the visible stars plus the deep space stars and planets. It would have hard drives and software to transfer megabytes of data, he said. The projector system is part of a $10-million theater upgrade at Adler, the first U.S. location with a planetarium. As PolitiFact has previously reported , Obama has sought — but not necessarily received — $931.3-million in spending, including the projector system money. More broadly, annual votes for spending bills mean Obama, like other Congress members, has likely supported a lot more earmarks. But Obama didn’t actually vote for the projector as McCain stated. The request — which was a tenfold hike from a failed request a year earlier — never made it past the Senate appropriations committee, said Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense. And Obama isn’t a member of the panel. But Obama did go for the money. “I think for most voters it’s a fine line to draw,” Ellis said. We originally rated McCain’s statement as Mostly True when we confined our review to the earmark issue. But after several readers alerted us to the true nature of the projector, we decided further reporting and study of the details of the project were required. McCain is right that Obama sought the money (though not a vote), but because McCain mischaracterizes the size of the projector to enhance his argument that money is being wasted, we have changed our ruling. We say Half True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-10-10T00:00:00	2008-10-07	['Chicago', 'Barack_Obama']

pomt-04380	"George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/19/barack-obama/obama-says-bush-never-sought-defund-planned-parent/	During a town hall presidential debate in which audience members got to ask the questions, one woman asked Mitt Romney how he would differ from the last Republican to occupy the White House: George W. Bush. "Since both you and President Bush are Republicans, I fear a return to the policies of those years should you win this election," said undecided voter Susan Katz. "What is the biggest difference between you and George W. Bush, and how do you differentiate yourself from George W. Bush?" Romney detailed several ways he would depart from Bush’s policies, then President Barack Obama chimed in, saying Romney was actually further to the right than Bush. "George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood, so there are differences between Gov. Romney and George Bush," Obama said, as one example. Planned Parenthood provides low-cost reproductive health services but is also the nation’s leading provider of abortions. Romney and other Republicans have vowed to eliminate its federal funding, a move Obama opposes. But where did the 43rd president stand on the subject? We decided to check it out. Planned Parenthood and federal funding The organization, founded in 1921, has received federal funds since 1970, when President Richard Nixon signed a law amending the Public Health Service Act. Title X of that law provides funding for family planning services, including contraception and family planning information. Planned Parenthood now operates more than 800 clinics in all 50 states. The bulk of their work is women’s health care: cancer screenings, STD treatment, sex education, contraceptives, pregnancy care and breast exams. In many states, they also perform abortions -- more than 330,000 a year. The group receives millions in federal money every year, in the form of grants and reimbursements for the health services its provides. In 2009, its federal funding totalled $360 million. Planned Parenthood says abortions account for 3 percent of its services, which are prohibited from being paid for with public money. The group says it is careful to keep the money separate. Still, it’s that 3 percent that makes it a target in the national abortion battle. What Bush did In one of his first acts as president, Bush reinstated what is known as the Mexico City policy, or (as abortion rights advocates called it) the global gag rule, in January 2001. The rule denies money to overseas family planning clinics (such as Planned Parenthood’s international arm) that provide abortion counseling in foreign countries. At the end of Bush’s term, International Planned Parenthood Federation said that during those eight years, they lost more than $100 million for family planning and health programs. The consequence of losing those funds, the group said: 36 million unplanned pregnancies and 15 million induced abortions. When Obama took office, he revoked the Mexico City policy. What Bush didn’t do As president, Bush called himself a "compassionate conservative" and spoke of supporting "a culture of life." He steered money to faith-based groups, and he signed a federal ban on late-term abortions in 2003. When he ran for re-election in 2004, Planned Parenthood endorsed Democrat John Kerry, the first time the group formally backed a presidential candidate. That said, we searched media reports from Bush’s eight years in office and found no instances of the president pushing to eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood’s work in the United States. We contacted Planned Parenthood itself, which also couldn’t cite evidence of Bush targeting their federal money. On the contrary, we found ample evidence that Bush was satisfied with the status quo. In 1999, when he was first running for president, he declined to sign a pledge to defund Planned Parenthood, saying he supported "incremental changes helpful to America's pro-life movement." The Obama campaign also pointed us to information on Title X funding (which pays for the health services Planned Parenthood provides) during the Bush years. His 2002 budget proposal eliminated contraceptive coverage for federal employees but maintained funding for Title X, including $66 million for Planned Parenthood. A budget bill he signed in 2007 provided "the largest increase in Title X family planning funding since 2000, a $16.8 million increase from the previous year," according to a Planned Parenthood press release. Romney’s stance Eliminating funding for Planned Parenthood has gotten more attention since a Republican majority, backed by the new tea party wave of conservatism, took control of the House of Representatives in 2011. "This is when we're going to defund Planned Parenthood. Now is the season for us to do this," Rep. Cliff Stearns, R-Fla., said in February 2011. (Stearns later lost his primary battle to a more ardent tea party candidate.) The House voted in February 2011 to block Planned Parenthood funding, and all money for family planning. (The Democrat-controlled Senate rejected the package.) The message also caught on in the Republican presidential primary contest. Newt Gingrich, at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition dinner that same month, said, "I would immediately move to defund Planned Parenthood and take that money and devote it to adoption services to create an alternative to abortion." Romney, for his part, has repeatedly pledged to revoke Planned Parenthood’s funding. His website says he would "eliminate Title X Family Planning Funding — Savings: $300 Million. Title X subsidizes family planning programs that benefit abortion groups like Planned Parenthood." And after he told the Des Moines Register on Oct. 9, 2012, that there’s no abortion legislation on his agenda, he was forced to re-state his anti-abortion stance: "The actions I’ll take immediately is to remove funding for Planned Parenthood. It will not be part of my budget. And also I’ve indicated that I will reverse the Mexico City position of the president." With the spotlight on the organization, Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards told the Washington Post in August, "I’ve never seen anything like this. I’ve never seen a presidential election where women’s basic access to birth control is practically on the ballot. Defunding Planned Parenthood is practically on the ballot. It’s been incredible to witness the last year and a half and this debate we’ve had over access to care. ... This is not something that John McCain was campaigning to do. George Bush wasn’t either. I’ve never seen anything quite like it." Our ruling Obama said in the debate that, "George Bush never suggested that we eliminate funding for Planned Parenthood." In fact, one of Bush’s first acts as president was to cut off funding for Planned Parenthood and other groups working overseas that counsel women about abortion. But as for eliminating Title X funding for health services that Planned Parenthood provides in the United States -- which is what Romney and other Republicans of today favor -- Obama is right. We found no evidence that Bush sought such a change, and Title X funding actually increased during his presidency. We rate Obama’s statement Mostly True. Editor's note: This report has been changed to note that abortion rights advocates refer to the Mexico City policy as "the global gag rule." Anti-abortion advocates oppose referring to the policy by that term.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-10-19T13:22:22	2012-10-16	['Planned_Parenthood', 'George_W._Bush']

pomt-08570	Says with the ongoing economic downturn, child abuse is on the rise.	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2010/sep/28/jeff-merkley/jeff-merkley-says-economic-downturn-oregon-seeing-/	Sen. Jeff Merkley appeared at the new Children’s Center in Clackamas County to raise awareness about an increase in child abuse and, according to his news release, to highlight "the correlation to the economic downturn." "Even one case of child abuse or neglect is too many, and with the ongoing economic downturn, the numbers of Oregon children suffering from abuse is on the rise," said Merkley. "We must do everything in our power to reduce the number of children being abused and help provide sanctuary to those in need." The Children’s Center received some federal money last year. And the visit was a good photo op for a freshman senator during a congressional break. But at Politifact Oregon, we wondered if child abuse really is on the rise and if there is actually a cause-and-effect connection between child abuse and dismal economic times. Merkley is correct about the increase: More Oregon children are suffering abuse and neglect. The Oregon Department of Human Services reports that 11,090 children were victims of abuse or neglect last year, a 6.4 percent increase from 2008. Population growth isn’t the only culprit behind the higher numbers. The state reports that the rate of abuse increased from 11.8 victims per 1,000 children to 12.5 per 1,000. A check with the agency’s number-crunchers indicates the trend holds this year, with abuse reports up between 6 percent and 7 percent between July 2009 and July 2010. Though reports don’t always turn out to be confirmed cases, officials say they expect the number of child victims will rise again for 2010. But is the increase because of high unemployment? Merkley’s spokeswoman, Courtney Warner Crowell, said she hadn’t seen any research linking a rise in abuse to an economic downturn. But she said several people she’d talked to blamed the increase in child abuse on the economy. But there isn’t any statistical evidence drawing a direct link between increased child abuse and a bad economy. "We can’t say that factually and we can’t prove it," says Katharine Cahn, executive director of the Child Welfare Partnership at Portland State University. The number of child abuse victims can rise, even in good times, Cahn says, simply because more people are reporting the abuse. State stats do show alcohol and drug abuse, domestic violence and parental run-ins with police among the common stress factors that contribute to child abuse. Cahn concedes that people do feel stressed and depressed when the economy goes bust and may drink or use drugs in an attempt to cope. And that, she says, may be the indirect tie to Oregon’s rising numbers. So, it appears that while Oregon’s junior senator was right about the numbers of kids abused, the sour economy may not be deserve all the blame. We find the claim Mostly True. Comment on this item.

pomt-01521	"The U.S. State Department has ordered 160,000 Hazmat suits for Ebola, prompting concerns that the federal government is anticipating the rapid spread" of the virus.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/19/blog-posting/infowars-us-ordering-16000-hazmat-suits-sign-ebola/	As Ebola continues to spread in Africa, the United States has committed over $100 million in aid, in the form of both supplies and personnel. But fringe voices on the Web are suggesting that Ebola is even a bigger threat than the U.S. government is letting on. The conspiracy website InfoWars reported this week that "the U.S. State Department has ordered 160,000 Hazmat suits for Ebola, prompting concerns that the federal government is anticipating the rapid spread of a virus that has already claimed an unprecedented number of lives." The InfoWars report cites a press release from Lakeland Industries, which manufactures protective clothing, and the InfoWars report says that "only 1,400 federal workers are currently in the region (western Africa), suggesting that the 160,000 figure is far higher than what would be required merely for sending medical workers abroad." From there, InfoWars cites a German virologist to the effect that Ebola’s death toll will climb to 5 million (the Ebola outbreak has claimed 2,630 deaths at time of writing), and suggests that "Ebola could have gone airborne to at least a limited extent." (We found plenty of other examples of the Hazmat story floating around the Internet.) We’re not going to touch speculation about Ebola’s evolution, but we wanted to check his claim that the State Department has ordered 160,000 Hazmat suits for Ebola, and that their order reflects the federal government’s anticipation of a "rapid spread" of Ebola. The press release The Lakeland press release, which announces its increased "manufacturing capacity" for the "specialty protective suits to be worn by health care workers and others being exposed to Ebola," only has a sentence relating to the State Department’s order. "With the U.S. State Department alone putting out a bid for 160,000 suits," they say, "we encourage all protective apparel companies to increase their manufacturing capacity for sealed seam garments so that our industry can do its part in addressing this threat to global health." That’s not much to go on, but there’s a crucial distinction that InfoWars glosses over: The press release mentions a bid, not an "order." That means that while a purchase of 160,000 suits may be in the works, it’s not final yet and may not even happen. U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) spokesman Matt Herrick said that he couldn’t "speak to specific procurement that is in process and not awarded," but confirmed that the Lakeland press release "is in reference to USAID and our ongoing efforts to secure personal protective equipment to combat the spread of Ebola." The bid InfoWars is referring to comes from USAID, which is technically independent of the State Department. The two organizations, though, work closely together. USAID USAID has been providing protective equipment to partners in Africa since March, Herrick said. That includes Hazmat suits like the ChemMax 1 suit referred to in Lakeland’s press release. The suit, while not Ebola-exclusive, is designed to protect against infectious agents. Beyond the suits, USAID’s assistance to African organizations has come in the form of disease-control experts, funding and a variety of emergency supplies. Herrick referred us to this series of press releases on USAID’s efforts. "Last month, USAID airlifted more than 16 tons of medical supplies and emergency equipment to Liberia," Herrick said, including 10,000 Hazmat suits, water treatment units, and plastic sheeting to create Ebola treatment units. That might seem like a lot of suits, but "the equipment set is designed to be worn just once and then disposed of once treatment is administered," said Herrick. "So many sets are needed for each health provider." "USAID has procured and delivered more than 100,000 suits to date, and we are on track to procure and deliver more than 130,000 additional suits," Herrick said. "The equipment is provided to local health care workers and nongovernmental partners working in the affected countries." Herrick wouldn’t elaborate on how the suits from the bid related to USAID’s plans, but the figures he gave are crucial context. The 160,000 suits aren’t actually "far higher than what would be required merely for sending medical workers abroad," as InfoWars claimed. USAID has provided almost that many suits already, and there seems to be an immediate need for more. This information is also public via USAID’s press releases, so it's not as though they’re privately predicting a "rapid spread" of Ebola beyond the scope of the current outbreak. Our ruling The website InfoWars claimed that the State Department "has ordered 160,000 Hazmat suits for Ebola," demonstrating that "the federal government is anticipating the rapid spread of a virus that has already claimed an unprecedented number of lives." The federal government agency in question is USAID, but that’s something of a technicality. A USAID official told us that the suits are one use only, so 160,000 suits aren’t actually an astronomical amount. In fact, USAID has already delivered 100,000 suits to the Ebola-infected regions of Africa. Their new bid, while an expansion of their efforts, is in line with what USAID has done so far, and doesn’t demonstrate that the federal government is anticipating any sort of "rapid spread." We rate the claim Half True.	None	Bloggers	None	None	None	2014-09-19T11:00:00	2014-09-15	['United_States_Department_of_State', 'Ebola_virus_disease']
pomt-02776	"One-third of all bank tellers (are) on public assistance."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2013/dec/08/james-carville/james-carville-13-bank-tellers-are-public-assistan/	One of the economic challenges facing the country is a growing inequality of income. Wealthier people are getting richer while the great majority of Americans are either making no gains or actually losing ground. The political parties differ on how they frame this problem. Republicans tend to say the solution is to create more jobs. Democrats agree but add that the quality of a job, primarily the pay, matters just as much. Democratic strategist James Carville waded into this debate during ABC’s This Week. Carville picked an industry where the gap between the upper and lower ends is particularly strong. "Can I just make one jaw-dropping point? This week it came out, a UC Berkeley study … said one-third of all bank tellers are on public assistance," Carville said. "Why don't we pass a law to say if you were bailed out or you get free money from the fed or your deposits are insured or you're too big to fail, if the government backs you to that extent and you're that profitable an industry, you have to pay people a living wage?" We’ll set aside the question of bailouts and livable wages. Our focus is on the claim that a third of bank tellers are on public assistance. As Carville said, that statistic comes from a study by the University of California - Berkeley Center for Labor Research and Education. A New York City group, the Committee for Better Banks, commissioned the analysis. The committee says it represents the interests of frontline and back office bank workers. "Salaries for bank tellers nationwide are so low that 31 percent of bank tellers and their family members are enrolled in some type of public assistance program," the committee cites in its report. That public assistance takes many forms. The grand total is nearly $900 million, with Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program accounting for over half. Food stamps, the Earned Income Tax Credit and welfare (Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) make up the remainder. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the country had 560,000 tellers in 2010. The median wage was about $11.55 an hour, or $24,100 a year. About three-fourths of these people worked full time. In contrast, the median pay for a bank CEO was more than $550,000 last year and industry profits were over $140 billion. Carville pretty accurately quoted the report except in one respect that doesn’t make an enormous difference. He said one-third of bank tellers are on public assistance. The report actually spoke of bank tellers and their family members. That would include a worker’s child who gets health care through the Children’s Health Insurance Program. But since that child is eligible because the family makes less than a certain amount, we think it’s a minor point. The Berkeley Center recently did a similar analysis of fast food workers. When PunditFact looked into claims based on that report, we found that there was some disagreement among experts as to whether children’s insurance and the Earned Income Tax Credit should be counted as public assistance because these programs help families making as much as $50,000 a year. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 10 percent of bank tellers make more than about $32,000 a year. The government might have designed these programs to help somewhat more comfortable working families but that doesn’t change that the majority of bank tellers have very modest household incomes. The center used the same analytic method in both the fast food and bank teller studies. It is a model that involves a complex blending of different government data sets. In our last fact-check, experts generally agreed that the approach would produce reasonably accurate results. Our ruling Carville said that one-third of bank tellers are on public assistance. In large part, Carville was faithful to a labor market analysis conducted on behalf of a group that advocates for better pay for lower-level bank employees. Carville made a minor error in talking about the bank tellers themselves when the study included their children. And there is debate among experts as to whether children’s insurance and the Earned Income Tax Credit should be counted as public assistance. Because of those caveats, we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-13111	"Prior to Obamacare here in Wisconsin, 95 percent of Wisconsinites were covered by insurance. After Obamacare, 95 percent of Wisconsinites were covered by insurance. It hasn’t had an impact."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2016/nov/04/ron-johnson/debunking-ron-johnson-claim-obamacare-had-no-impac/	U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson has offered many critiques of Obamacare, but in an October 2016 debate he claimed that in Wisconsin the health care law has also failed to accomplish its most fundamental goal — insuring more people. In an Oct. 14 debate with challenger Russ Feingold in Green Bay, Johnson criticized the Affordable Care Act for boosting premiums and limiting access to doctors. And he said this: "The fact of the matter is, prior to Obamacare here in Wisconsin, 95 percent of Wisconsinites were covered by insurance. After Obamacare, 95 percent of Wisconsinites were covered by insurance. It hasn’t had an impact." Let’s take a look at the numbers. Wrong number When we reached out to Johnson’s team for supporting evidence, spokesman Ben Voelkel said Johnson made a mistake in his claim. He meant to say 94% were insured before Obamacare and 95% after. That’s not a huge difference, but it changes Johnson’s point that the law "hasn’t had an impact." Voelkel said those numbers came from the 2010 and 2014 Wisconsin Family Health Survey, conducted by the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. That looks at how many people had insurance for all or part of the preceding year. The Affordable Care Act was signed into law in 2010, but the individual health insurance mandate and most other core elements didn’t take effect until 2014. Using the 2010 survey is problematic since DHS changed its methodology and warns against comparing surveys before 2012 with those after. That doesn’t make a big difference in this case, however, because the 2012 survey showed the same 94 percent insured rate as 2010. But 2014 isn’t necessarily a great choice for an "after" statistic, since it was a transition year. And there’s more recent data available. DHS hasn’t released the results of its 2015 survey yet, but the U.S. Census Bureau and other surveys have. And those numbers tell a different story than Johnson. Uninsured numbers drop The U.S. Census Bureau gathers figures annually on insurance status and shows a significant drop in the number of Wisconsinites without insurance since Obamacare took effect. After hovering between 9 percent and 9.4 percent uninsured from 2008 to 2013, Wisconsin dropped to 7.3 percent in 2014 and 5.7 percent in 2015, according to the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey. That’s a drop of nearly 40 percent from before Obamacare to after. "Johnson’s claim is way off base," said Jon Peacock, research director for the nonprofit, non-partisan Wisconsin Council on Children and Families. Peacock said the American Community Survey is the best source for such health data. Like the DHS survey, it counts people as insured if they had health insurance for any part of the prior year. Other sources show the same trend. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit think tank focusing on national health issues, says the percentage uninsured in Wisconsin dropped from 9 percent in 2013 to 7 percent in 2015, based on the Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey. The Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, a point-in-time survey that measures whether the survey taker currently has health insurance, showed an even larger drop, from 11.7 percent uninsured in 2013 to 5.9 percent in 2015. Our rating Johnson claimed that 95 percent of Wisconsinites were insured both before and after Obamacare. The claim runs into problems on several fronts. He misspoke on the statistic he was trying to cite, and he references a 2014 survey when more recent data is available. But above all, he uses the numbers to claim Obamacare hasn’t had an impact on the number of uninsured in Wisconsin. And that’s simply not the case. We rate the claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/426b9f15-987a-490a-a236-7ce830040a17	None	Ron Johnson	None	None	None	2016-11-04T09:58:37	2016-10-14	['Wisconsin', 'Patient_Protection_and_Affordable_Care_Act']

And they’ll likely continue as opponents of the measure have raised more than $35 million, while supporters have collected about $17 million. We wondered whether there’s any truth to the claim that Prop 56 ‘cheats’ schools out of all that money. Our research Nearly three decades ago, voters in California approved Proposition 98 requiring a minimum level of funding for public education. It requires the state to dedicate roughly 40 percent of new General Fund revenues to K-12 schools and community colleges. Prop 56 would generate up to $1.4 billion in tax revenue its first year. But instead of sending that revenue to the General Fund, Prop 56 would place it in a special fund to help pay for Medi-Cal, which provides health coverage for millions of low-income Californians. We asked the No on 56 campaign for evidence that the tobacco tax measure ‘cheats’ schools. A spokeswoman pointed to language in the measure that exempts Prop 56 from the school funding guarantee. The campaign said this exemption is proof that the measure undermines the funding guarantee and ‘cheats’ schools. But the experts we spoke with say there’s nothing new about this proposal. Past tobacco taxes, in 1988 and 1998, also established special funds rather than sending money to the General Fund. One of the experts said the opponents’ claim is misleading. "When I think of this claim that the schools are going to be cheated -- particularly that word ‘cheated’ out of this money -- that suggests something that’s wrong or illegal. And this is not the case," said Steve Boilard, executive director of Sacramento State University’s Center for California Studies. "There’s plenty of examples where new revenue is raised that is not subject to the Prop 98 funding guarantee." Boilard pointed to Proposition 63, a tax on wealthy Californians that funds mental health services. Curran Kelleher / Flickr Others reject claim State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson rejected the claim that the new tax measure ‘cheats’ schools. In a recent letter circulated by the Yes on 56 campaign, he wrote: "Make no mistake, Proposition 56 will not divert a dime away from schools. Rather, it will raise revenues for school based tobacco prevention and intervention programs." A report by the Legislative Analyst’s Office estimates Prop 56 will add $20 million for those school based programs. The Sacramento Bee’s fact-checking team, PoliGRAPH, recently examined the same claim about Prop 56 ‘cheating’ schools. It found that it "isn’t fair to say the measure 'cheats' schools out of $600 million a year. Nothing in the measure reduces school funding. If the measure passes, the budget for schools does not decrease." Our ruling The No on 56 campaign is running ads that say the proposed tobacco tax "cheats schools out of at least $600 million a year." The measure includes an exemption from the state’s school funding guarantee. A portion of its revenues, estimated at up to $1.4 billion, could otherwise have been directed toward school funding. But past tobacco taxes and a tax to fund mental health services have also legally avoided this guarantee. Those had exemptions allowing their revenues to fund health services. This doesn't mean, however, that money will be taken from schools or community colleges under Prop 56. The measure, in fact, sends about $20 million to schools for tobacco prevention programs. The claim that Prop 56 "cheats" schools goes too far. It might have been accurate to say the measure exempts most all revenue from going to schools. But the term chosen by No on 56 is misleading. We rate the claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-11241	Says "precisely zero terrorists, terrorist groups or terror plots have ever been connected with the U.S.-Mexico border to do harm to people within the United States."	false	/texas/statements/2018/may/03/beto-orourke/beto-orourke-zero-terrorists-harm-Americans-Mexico/	At a North Texas campaign stop, Democratic U.S. Senate hopeful Beto O’Rourke declared there have been "precisely zero" terrorists, terror groups or plots against Americans also connected to the U.S.-Mexico border. None ever? That seemed like a big gulp. We heard the El Paso congressman's comment by watching his campaign’s Facebook Live video of his 35-minute Jan. 3, 2018, "town hall" in Greenville, the county seat of Hunt County. O’Rourke took aim at President Donald Trump’s desire for a border wall, saying: "At this time of vicious rhetoric, paranoia and fear and hatred and bigotry aimed at the rest of the world, can you get this: a 2,000-mile, $25 billion, 30-foot-high, pure concrete wall at a time of record U.S.-Mexico border security, at a time that zero, precisely zero, terrorists, terrorist groups or terror plots have ever been connected with the U.S.-Mexico border to do harm to people within the United States?" O'Rourke cites testimony O’Rourke made a similar statement on Facebook in 2015, writing: "As a member of the House Homeland Security committee in the 113th Congress, I asked the director of the FBI, the director of the National Counterterrorism Center and the Secretary of Homeland Security if there was currently any terrorist threat on the Southern border. They answered that there was not, nor had there ever been, any terrorist, terrorist plot, or terrorist organization that was able to exploit our border with Mexico." When we asked O’Rourke’s campaign to provide his basis for declaring no connections ever between terrorists or terror plots and the U.S.-Mexico border, campaign spokesman Chris Evans emailed us a document centered on whether terrorists made moves along the border into late 2014. The document, titled "Border ISIL Fact Sheet #1," references 2014 video clips of and numerous news reports about Department of Homeland Security officials rebutting claims that ISIS had plans to enter the U.S. through Mexico. Some of the reports note that conservatives, including U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, the Republican who seeks re-election against O’Rourke this November, raised concerns that members of ISIS could enter or might have already entered the U.S. Federal officials pushed back. According to a New York Daily News account cited in O’Rourke’s document, Jennifer Lasley, a Homeland Security official, told House members at a Sept. 10, 2014, hearing: "We don't have any credible information that we are aware of, of known or suspected terrorists coming across the border." A Texas document O’Rourke’s information was more than three years old when he made his claim in Greenville. So as part of gauging his claim, we searched the Nexis database for news accounts posted since 2011 of terrorist plots connected to the border, finding none. We also took note of nine past PolitiFact fact-checks of border terrorist claims that did not prove accurate. In February 2018, for instance, we found Pants on Fire a claim that "along the southern border of the U.S.," the government apprehends "seven individuals a day who are either known or suspected terrorists." No facts backed up that border-specific claim. Nationally in 2017, Homeland Security reported stopping 2,554 individuals on its terrorist watch list from entering the country, most of whom tried to enter by air. Earlier, though, PolitiFact Florida in 2016 found Mostly True a claim that according to reports, U.S. Customs and Border Protection had "apprehended several members of known Islamist terrorist organizations crossing the southern border in recent years." There had been one such report, by a Texas agency. Yet in its 2015 document assessing state-level border security efforts, the Texas Department of Public Safety also acknowledged no plots uncovered. The document, obtained at the time by the Houston Chronicle, notes that Mexican drug cartels draw on transnational gangs to commit crimes in Texas. It goes on: "Illegal aliens from countries documented by the U.S. Department of State as having a known terrorism presence continue to be smuggled into and throughout Texas and the nation on a regular basis, and it is impossible to determine how many of these individuals have actually entered the U.S. undetected." "Texas," the document says, "leads the nation in the apprehension of ‘special interest aliens’ (SIA), and there is a legitimate concern that terrorists from around the world could exploit our country’s porous Southwest border to enter the U.S. undetected, if they have not done so already." Such individuals, the document says, are "citizens of 35 countries that could represent a terrorist threat," most of which are in the Middle East and North Africa. Smuggling Somali nationals The report also singles out law enforcement encounters with Somali nationals described as having connections to terrorist groups. Of the Somali travelers, the document says, one was a member of terror group al-Shabaab and claimed to have defected and another was previously denied a visa and on "multiple U.S. terrorism watch lists." A third, Ahmed Muhammed Dhakane – the only one identified in the document – was an active member of the terror group, the document says, and a "guerilla fighter and human smuggler who knowingly helped move into the U.S. several potentially dangerous Somali terrorists who he believed would commit violent acts if ordered to do so." The document also mentions an American citizen who, "for a period of several years until January 2010," smuggled 272 Somalis into the country through Cuba and Mexico. "Investigators stated that he acknowledged that leaders of al-Shabaab solicited his services but that he declined," the report states. "However, investigators found an email exchange in which he acknowledged, ‘I helped a lot of Somalis and most are good but there are some who are bad and I leave them to Allah.’" Newspaper specifies terrorist ties More detail came to our attention in a Jan. 15, 2017 Christian Science Monitor news story that also pinpointed other cases tracing terrorist plots or organizations to the Mexico-U.S. border. The story, citing court documents, identifies the smuggler of Somalis as Anthony Joseph Tracy. Under the scheme, the story said, Tracy's clients flew from Kenya to Dubai to Moscow to Cuba. From there, the story says, they would fly to Belize and then travel to Mexico to make their way across the U.S. border. Tracy, the story says, pleaded guilty to a single charge of conspiring to induce non-citizens to enter the country without legal authorization. The Monitor story also lists the cases of Mahmoud Kourani, Adnan El Shukrijumah and Abdullahi Omar Fidse. According to the story, Kourani was a Hezbollah fundraiser smuggled into the U.S. from Mexico in 2001. He was later sentenced to prison after pleading guilty to "conspiring to support a terrorist organization," according to a June 15, 2005 Associated Press news account. Shukrijumah, who landed on the FBI’s most-wanted list after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, was said to have hidden in northern Mexico—among varied places—and then plotted a foiled 2009 New York City subway suicide bombing attack. It’s unclear whether that plot involved the U.S.-Mexico border; the Monitor story says Shukrijumah was killed near the Pakistan-Afghan border in 2014. The story states that Fidse entered the U.S. from Mexico at the Hidalgo, Texas port of entry in 2008 and told officials he was a Somalian refugee. Officials later learned that he lied about his background, the story says, and Fidse confided to an FBI informant that he supported Osama Bin Laden, Al Qaeda and Al Shabab. "Fidse was denied asylum," the story says. "Instead he was prosecuted and sentenced to eight years in prison for lying to federal agents." The 2015 DPS document, despite detailing some such activities, notes a lack of evidence of terrorist plots or activities associated with the border, stating: "We judge that foreign terrorists almost certainly are aware of the U.S.-Mexico border’s vulnerability to illegal entry, though we currently are not aware of any specific and credible information indicating a terrorist plot associated with the border." State Department: No ‘credible information’ Web searches led us to a recent federal analysis with a similar nothing-known bottom line. The State Department’s 2016 Country Reports on Terrorism, published in July 2017, states that the agency’s work with Mexico has maintained border security. "Counterterrorism cooperation between the Mexican and U.S. governments remained strong," the department summed up, going on: "There are no known international terrorist organizations operating in Mexico, no evidence that any terrorist group has targeted U.S. citizens in Mexican territory, and no credible information that any member of a terrorist group has traveled through Mexico to gain access to the United States." To our inquiry in April 2018, Nicole Thompson, a State Department spokeswoman, said by email that the judgment that no terrorist had traveled through Mexico to gain U.S. access still held. We were unsuccessful eliciting judgments on terrorist threats tied to the border from the Department of Homeland Security as well as border and homeland security officials for the states of Texas, New Mexico, Arizona and California. Cato Institute: No terrorist plots We also reviewed a non-government analysis, reaffirmed in 2018, that found no terrorist plots involving adults crossing the U.S.-Mexico border--but one ultimately foiled plot involving ethnic Albanians who'd entered the country as youngsters accompanying their parents. In 2016, Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst for the Cato Institute, a libertarian public policy research organization, wrote a "risk analysis of the visa categories" used by foreign-born terrorists who had carried out attacks in the U.S. between 1975 and 2015. Over the 40 years, Nowrasteh concluded, nine terrorists carried out or had plans to carry out U.S. attacks after entering the country illegally. "Those nine terrorists killed zero people in terrorist attacks on U.S. soil from 1975 through 2017," Nowrasteh said in a Jan. 19, 2018, article on the institute’s website. "Of those nine terrorists who entered illegally," Nowrasteh elaborated, "only three did so along the border with Mexico: Shain Duka, Britan Duka, and Eljvir Duka crossed as children with their parents in 1984. They are ethnic Albanians from Macedonia. They were three conspirators in the incompetently planned Fort Dix plot that the FBI foiled in 2007, long after they became adults and more than two decades after they entered illegally." That plot, the New York Times reported in 2007, was stopped thanks in part to government infiltrators. The newspaper said the plotters were part of a group of extremists who "represent the newest breed of threat: loosely organized domestic militants unconnected to — but inspired by — Al Qaeda or other international terror groups." That Fort Dix plan, Nowrasteh commented by phone, wasn’t one 23 years in the making. "It was just…you’re going to have an immigrant terrorist, he had to have entered at some time, and these kids happened to enter when they were children," Nowrasteh said, "and then grew up to become really bad terrorists who didn’t kill anybody and got caught." Nowrasteh said he gathered the identities of terrorists from nine data sets and documents and used "news stories, court documents, government reports and publicly accessible databases" to round out his research. Also by phone, Sanho Tree, a fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, a progressive think tank, said he didn’t know of terror plots with ties to the southern border but sees "serious vulnerability" in that terrorists could collaborate with drug cartels. Then again, Tree said, that’s not likely at moment because "no head of a cartel wants to engage with terrorists because if they’re ever caught, then the entire weight of the U.S. federal government falls on their head and not on their rivals." A 2011 assassination plot To our inquiries, experts including Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a right-leaning foreign policy think tank, referenced a 2011 plot to assassinate Adel al-Jubeir, then the Saudi ambassador to the United States. Iranian-born Manssor Arbabsiar, a Texas car salesman, who ventured south from Texas into a Mexico border city to enlist a Mexican drug cartel willing to carry out the hit. Arbabsiar had plans beyond that, including wanting to attack the Israeli embassy to the U.S. in Washington, D.C., and Israeli and Saudi embassies in Argentina, according to a January 2015 Chronicle news story. Arbabsiar thought his plan was underway, the story says, but the federal government was building a case against him. Arbabsiar, ultimately sentenced to 25 years in prison, later would cooperate with federal officials and say he acted alone, according to the Chronicle. Gartenstein-Ross told us: "Fortunately the person who was trying to orchestrate it ended up talking to a" Drug Enforcement Administration "agent who was standing in, posing as a cartel member, but that was clearly a plot, which was directed up through the southern border" to kill Jubeir, who later became the Saudi minister of foreign affairs. Gartenstein-Ross said by phone that Iran is said to have been behind the plot to assassinate the ambassador, but that’s also in dispute--though whether there was a plot isn’t disputed. Gartenstein-Ross made the same point as Tree did about potential border-linked threats. "It’s much more of a potential danger rather than a danger that has materialized, but when you have a potential danger that has not materialized, things could change fairly quickly," he said. By email, Nowrasteh suggested to us that the assassination "plot" proved to be no more than an individual getting duped by an informant--a point also made to us by phone by O'Rourke's spokesman, Evans. Nowrasteh wrote: "This case doesn’t show that terrorists crossed the Mexican border or that this was a real threat. The Mexican ‘source’ during the investigation was a DEA informant the entire time, and the convicted terrorist had no contact with any real cartel member." Jessica Vaughan, an analyst for the Center for Immigration Studies, which says it has a "pro-immigrant, low-immigration vision," countered, when we inquired, that it shouldn’t matter if federal law enforcement unplugged Arbabsiar’s plan. It was still a terrorist plot, she said by phone. To our inquiry, Fred Burton, a former State Department official serving as chief security officer for Stratfor, an Austin-based geopolitical intelligence company, also pointed out Arbabsiar’s stymied plans. Burton said he’d describe the intended assassination as a "transnational terror plot that originated in Mexico that affected the target in the United States." Burton said he was unaware of other terror plots connected to the border. Next, we circled back to O'Rourke's campaign with what we'd learned. In reply, Evans reminded us that O'Rourke was told directly by Homeland Security at a 2014 hearing that there'd been no terrorists or terror plots against Americans tied to the border. "There's been no indication that that information has changed," Evans said by phone. Our ruling O’Rourke said that "precisely zero terrorists, terrorist groups or terror plots have ever been connected with the U.S.-Mexico border to do harm to people within the United States." State Department declarations support this claim while experts told us such instances have proved extremely rare. However, zero means nothing--and it’s not so that there have been absolutely no cases of terrorists or terrorist plots tied to the border. It also looks to us like authorities have foiled every known plan. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-05725	Says in the 2012 State of the Union address, President Obama "didn't even mention the deficit or debt."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/05/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-president-ignored-debt-problems-s/	Firing up a crowd of supporters in Ohio ahead of Super Tuesday, Mitt Romney chided President Barack Obama for his economic record. "He gave a speech the other day at his State of the Union address. He didn't even mention the deficit or the debt, even as the world is reeling, watching what's happening in Europe, recognizing that, unless we change course, we will face that as well and, yet, he has nothing to say about it," Romney said at a rally in Cleveland on March 2, 2012. No mention of the deficit or the debt? We decided to give the speech a read. 2012 State of the Union The first evidence we found that Romney’s claim is bogus shows up in the 12th paragraph of the speech, given Jan. 24, 2012. "In the last 22 months, businesses have created more than 3 million jobs. Last year, they created the most jobs since 2005. American manufacturers are hiring again, creating jobs for the first time since the late 1990s. Together, we’ve agreed to cut the deficit by more than $2 trillion. And we’ve put in place new rules to hold Wall Street accountable, so a crisis like this never happens again." About midway through the speech, Obama tossed out this proposal for paying down the national debt: "In the next few weeks, I will sign an executive order clearing away the red tape that slows down too many construction projects. But you need to fund these projects. Take the money we’re no longer spending at war, use half of it to pay down our debt and use the rest to do some nation-building right here at home." In offering a plan for helping under-water homeowners, he gave this assurance it wouldn’t push the country further into the red: "I’m sending this Congress a plan that gives every responsible homeowner the chance to save about $3,000 a year on their mortgage, by refinancing at historically low rates. No more red tape. No more runaround from the banks. A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it won’t add to the deficit and will give those banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust." Obama framed his proposals on tax cuts saying, "A return to the American values of fair play and shared responsibility will help protect our people and our economy. But it should also guide us as we look to pay down our debt and invest in our future." Then, about the deficit: "When it comes to the deficit, we’ve already agreed to more than $2 trillion in cuts and savings. But we need to do more, and that means making choices. Right now, we’re poised to spend nearly $1 trillion more on what was supposed to be a temporary tax break for the wealthiest 2 percent of Americans. Right now, because of loopholes and shelters in the tax code, a quarter of all millionaires pay lower tax rates than millions of middle-class households. Right now, Warren Buffett pays a lower tax rate than his secretary. "Do we want to keep these tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans? Or do we want to keep our investments in everything else –- like education and medical research; a strong military and care for our veterans? Because if we’re serious about paying down our debt, we can’t do both." That’s six mentions of either the deficit or the debt. Our ruling Romney said that Obama "didn't even mention the deficit or the debt" in his State of the Union address. We never heard back from Romney’s campaign about that claim, and we’re at a loss to understand how he could make it. At least six different times in his 2012 State of the Union address, Obama mentioned the debt or deficit by name. And if Romney meant that Obama made no mention of how to address the government’s debt problems, well, yes he did. He proposed paying down the debt using money no longer being spent in Iraq and advocated for letting a top-bracket tax cut expire so as not to add to the deficit. For a ruling we turn to our Truth-O-Meter definitions: This statement "is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim." Six mentions in a speech in which Romney said there were none?

pomt-04898	As a congressman, Mark Neumann "voted four times to increase our debt."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/aug/05/eric-hovde/hovde-says-neumann-voted-four-times-increase-us-de/	In the Republican U.S. Senate race, Mark Neumann has portrayed himself as a budget-cutter extraordinaire during his four years in Congress, but one of his rivals is painting him as a piggish paragon of waste. "In Congress Mark Neumann voted for over 2,000 earmarks, including the ‘Bridge To Nowhere,’" a TV ad by fellow Republican Eric Hovde charges. "Congressman Neumann voted four times to increase our debt." Neumann did vote in 1998 for a massive transportation bill that included many earmarks, including that infamous Alaska bridge project, we reported in an item during Neumann’s failed 2010 bid for the Republican nomination for governor. But what about the claim of voting to raise the nation’s debt ceiling? The debt ceiling is the legal cap on borrowing by the federal government. Raising it is routinely done under presidents of both parties, but periodically that move stalls, as in the summer of 2011 when a stalemate pushed the nation to the edge of default. Neumann’s record on the issue takes us back to 1995 when he entered Congress as a member of the GOP freshman class that ushered in the Republican Revolution under new House Speaker Newt Gingrich. Voting records show Neumann had four chances to vote for or against extending the debt ceiling. In all four instances, he voted to increase the limit, according to the online database maintained by the Library of Congress: -- October 26, 1995: Neumann helped squeak through an attempt to boost the debt limit, in a broader bill, on a 227-203 vote largely along party lines. President Bill Clinton vetoed the bill. -- November 9, 1995: Neumann, along with nearly every House Republican, voted to temporarily push the public debt limit to $4.967 trillion. Clinton vetoed this as well. -- March 7, 1996: Congress again sent Clinton a broad fiscal bill that included an increase in the debt limit to $5.5 trillion. The vote was bipartisan, with 127 Democrats joining the majority on a 328-91 vote. Thirty Republicans dissented, but Neumann joined the majority. Clinton signed it. -- July 30, 1997: Neumann again voted with most Republicans and 52 Democrats to boost the limit to $5.95 trillion, again as part of a broader bill. The tally was 346-85, with 32 Republicans voting no. The president signed it. Like so many of the claims in the four-way GOP primary, Hovde’s ad takes a snippet of information that is accurate, but strips it of important context. The thrust of the ad is that the votes show Neumann to be pro-spending and government growth. In the 2012 campaign Neumann is running on a platform to balance the budget on a five-year plan. A look at the votes shows they came as Neumann and other conservatives pushed the Democratic president for significant spending cuts. Compromise talks failed, leading, famously, to two temporary government shutdowns. The 1995 votes were part of the legislative battle over the GOP’s balanced budget act, which aimed to accomplish a balanced budget in seven years. In fact, in three of the four votes Hovde cites, the debt-limit increase was part of very broad fiscal measures. The March 1996 debt action, for example, was tucked into a multifaceted bill to reduce federal regulation of business, and as we noted it drew significant Democratic support. Finally, the August 1997 increase in the debt limit was approved as part of an act the New York Times described as "sweeping legislation intended to balance the federal budget for the first time since 1969." The government actually ran a surplus from 1998 to 2001, thanks to what observers said was a combination of an earlier tax increase, spending restraints, economic growth and stock market gains. Foreshadowing the 2011 showdown, Neumann, an early crusader on the perils of debt, was trying to leverage the deadline over raising the debt ceiling to get deeper spending cuts. That sounds a lot like Hovde’s position, which he laid out at a candidate forum in April 2012. He said he could support a debt-ceiling increase but only if its tied to strict spending restraints that balance the budget within two years. Our rating In a TV ad, Hovde paints Neumann as a go-along-to-get-along congressman who was cavalier about federal spending and helped raise the nation’s debt. Neumann did vote four times to extend the debt ceiling, but the ad leaves out important details: The votes were part of a historic drive by Republicans to balance the budget, and were wrapped into huge fiscal bills. That pushes his claim down to Half True on the Truth-O-Meter.	None	Eric Hovde	None	None	None	2012-08-05T09:00:00	2012-07-13	['None']
pomt-06132	Says America spends "over 17 percent of its GDP on health care costs when our closest competitor nations are spending about 12."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/dec/25/cory-booker/cory-booker-says-united-states-spends-more-17-perc/	If the United States wants a robust economy, Newark Mayor Cory Booker said the country needs to rein in its spending on health care. During a recent stump in New Hampshire for President Barack Obama, Booker, a Democrat, said he’s proud that there are leaders in the U.S. making progress, but said the health care law Obama signed wasn’t "perfect." He claimed the U.S. has a major problem: it spends more on health care as a percentage of gross domestic product, the total value of all goods and services produced within a nation, then its closest competitors. "I'm the first person to tell you that health care legislation wasn't perfect -- wasn't perfect -- and that we have a severe problem. America cannot spend … over 17 percent of its GDP on health care costs when our closest competitor nations are spending about 12," Booker said during a Dec. 9 speech in Manchester, N.H. "We're not going to be able to sustain a bold economy unless we start controlling these costs. But I'll tell you one thing right now, I'll defend Barack Obama as the day is long because what he did to me was heroic." The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development keeps tabs on the health spending of the 34 nations that belong to the group. According to the organization’s latest data, Booker’s numbers are spot on. Spending on health care in the U.S. in 2009 totaled 17.4 percent of the country’s gross domestic product. That puts the U.S. at the top of the group for medical spending. The Netherlands took second place, at 12 percent of its gross domestic product. Following behind by tenths of a percentage point: France at 11.8 percent; Germany at 11.6 percent; Denmark at 11.5 percent; and Canada and Switzerland, both at 11.4 percent. PolitiFact New Jersey reached out to health care experts to gauge the significance of the difference. Robert Field, a professor of law and health management and policy at Drexel University, said in an email that "experts differ on how much we should be concerned" but, he said, "without question, there are two major worries - health care costs are the biggest driver of Medicare spending growth, which will be the biggest driver of federal deficit growth in coming years, and there is a tremendous amount of inefficiency, so we are not getting better health for our extra spending." David Auerbach, a health policy researcher with the RAND Corporation said there’s "cause for worry because we seem to be growing faster than [Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development] countries in the past decade or so." "We still don't have much more in the system in the way of checks on spending and it could well continue into the future eating into government and personal spending for other needs," Auerbach said. Our ruling Booker claimed that the U.S. spends "over 17 percent of its GDP on health care costs when our closest competitor nations are spending about 12." The United States outspends 33 other large, industrialized democracies on medical costs. The country’s health care spending hit 17.4 percent of the nation’s economy in 2009, compared with 12 percent for the Netherlands, according to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

pomt-14624	"I have never supported cap and trade."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2016/jan/29/marco-rubio/rubio-says-he-has-never-supported-cap-and-trade-de/	Sen. Marco Rubio defended past support of a cap-and-trade bill in the Florida House by saying it was an attempt to protect the state from future federal regulations. Fox News moderator Bret Baier asked Rubio about the issue at a Republican presidential primary debate in Des Moines, Iowa, on Jan. 28, 2016. Baier said Rubio had "wanted Florida to get ahead of other states and establish a cap-and-trade system" while he was House speaker in 2008, and asked why Rubio had changed his mind. Rubio denied he backed a popular plan supported by then-Gov. Charlie Crist, claiming he was looking to insulate Florida from restrictions a future president might impose. "I have never supported cap and trade, and I never thought it was a good idea, and I was clear about that at the time," Rubio said. Rubio has been very outspoken during this campaign about his opposition to cap and trade, which lets businesses trade pollution credits if they don't meet emission caps. But is his retelling of what happened in 2008 accurate? Cap and trade mission We literally went to the tape to find out, because the key evidence in this claim is a snippet from a March 13, 2008, appearance Rubio made on WFSU’s Florida Face to Face. Rubio was discussing HB 7135, an energy and climate change bill championed by Crist that included the Florida Climate Protection Act. That part of the law allowed the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to formulate a cap-and-trade program for greenhouse emissions from electric utilities. "Florida should position itself for what I believe is inevitable, and that is a federal cap-and-trade program. Florida should do everything it can to be an early complier so it can access early compliance funds and so that it can help influence what that cap-and-trade looks like at the federal level," Rubio said on the show, which ran during the legislative session. "And so I’m in favor of giving the Department of Environmental Protection a mandate that they go out and design a cap-and-trade or a carbon-tax program and bring it back to the Legislature for ratification some time in the next two years." Crist used a portion of this clip during his 2010 Senate primary campaign against Rubio in an attempt to show Rubio favored a cap-and-trade program. WFSU, which operates The Florida Channel covering state government, demanded Crist stop using footage of the show because of a law barring use of its footage in political campaigns. This limited portion of the show has been resurrected online during the presidential primary, leading some conservative sites to question Rubio’s stance on the issue. But wait, as they say, there’s more. Rubio’s campaign had complained the clip was out of context, and it appears it really was. They have pointed to a longer edit of the footage that shows Rubio going on to say: "I’m in favor of them designing it. I’m not in favor of them designing it and implementing it. I’m in favor of them designing it and then bringing it back to the Legislature. The way we’re going toclean up our environment, the way we’re going to lower carbon emissions, is not through government mandates." That certainly changes the context of his statement. Rubio’s campaign did not respond to PolitiFact’s questions about his potential support of cap and trade, but they have addressed this issue before. In 2007, Rubio wrote an op-ed for the Miami Herald that said Crist should be applauded for his efforts, but "the government mandates he has proposed will not only fail to achieve their desired result, they carry actual negative consequences." Rubio did cite proposals from his book 100 Innovative Ideas for Florida's Future to increase ethanol production, develop bio-fuels and provide tax incentives for better fuel efficiency. But he concluded that "instead of adopting measures that will have little if any impact on our environment and make life in Florida more expensive, we need a strategy that encourages environmental conservation, fuel efficiency and energy diversity, while continuing to stimulate our economy." Rubio also said in a March 2007 speech that Florida was ripe to change energy policy because it was both environmentally sound and potentially lucrative. "This nation, and ultimately the world, is headed towards emission caps and energy diversification," he said. "Those changes will require technological advances that make those measures cost effective. The demand toward such advances will create an industry to meet it. Florida should become the Silicon Valley of that industry." Rubio did seem to change his tune a bit by 2009, when he was being criticized for his full-throated opposition of cap and trade after presiding over the passage of HB 7135. Environmentalists and scientists noted Rubio had shepherded the entire process as House speaker. "The legislation was passed to move forward on cap-and-trade policy, and certainly Marco Rubio didn't stand in the way of that legislation passing and my understanding was that he was supportive of the process," John Reilly, a leading climate change expert from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology hired by Rubio to advise lawmakers, told the Miami Herald. "He certainly seemed to accept the science of climate change." Rubio argued then that he wanted to take executive authority away from Crist, although the DEP countered they would have always needed legislative approval. Cap and trade planning fell by the wayside as Crist waged a losing Senate primary battle against Rubio. "It has worked out as it was designed to work out, which was to stop a cap-and-trade system in Florida," Rubio said in 2009. Some critics at the time doubted that was Rubio's true plan, as it was a big gamble that the Legislature would shut down any proposed DEP cap and trade proposal. But a 2015 article in the National Journal said that while the bill passed (and it passed the House and Senate unanimously), Rubio did add wording that prevented the plan from being implemented. The final bill indeed only allowed DEP to develop a potential plan, and required legislative approval to become practice. The National Journal quoted former House minority leader and state Rep. Dan Gelber, D-Miami Beach, who said, "I fully credit him with the gutting of the bill." Our ruling Rubio said, "I have never supported cap and trade." As House speaker in Florida, Rubio did preside over the unanimous passage of an energy bill that allowed the state to develop a cap-and-trade plan for electric utility emissions. But it appears his comments on the bill have been taken out of context, and that there may have been some legislative craftiness afoot. Rubio said he wanted Florida to cook up a plan of its own before federal regulations were imposed on the state. He also voiced opposition to government mandates and inserted a roadblock to letting any plan actually be implemented, details that get left out when Rubio is accused of supporting the measure. He now is much more vocal in his opposition of cap and trade, but it looks as if he has always favored a largely hands-off approach from government. We rate Rubio’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-15291	The five Guantanamo detainees swapped for Bowe Bergdahl "are right now back on the battlefield."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/23/donald-trump/trump-guantanamo-prisoners-swapped-bowe-bergdahl-a/	Donald Trump says you can tell that America’s current leaders are the only people in the country who haven’t read his book, The Art of the Deal, because they make such bad deals. At a campaign rally in South Carolina July 21, 2015, Trump, the wealthy businessman-turned-Republican presidential candidate, called out the White House for making deals he disagrees with. One he cited specifically was the controversial decision to exchange five Guantanamo detainees for Taliban prisoner Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in May 2014. Bergdahl has since been charged by the military with desertion and misbehaving before the enemy. "We get a traitor, a no-good, rotten traitor like Bergdahl," Trump said. "And they get five killers that they most wanted in the whole world, who are right now back on the battlefield, trying to kill everybody, including us. Okay? What kind of a deal is this?" Are the five former detainees -- who were senior Taliban operatives -- now "back on the battlefield" and re-engaged in terrorism? We decided to take a closer look. In September 2014, we gave a Pants on Fire rating to a claim that "Three of five detainees swapped (for Bergdahl) are now ISIS leaders." Has something changed since then? Best as we can tell, no. The five detainees (sometimes called the Taliban Five) were released to the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar. Qatar is understood to be a neutral state, as opposed to a "battlefield" for insurgent activity. Under the agreement, the five released detainees are not allowed to leave the country. This travel ban was initially supposed to last one year, ending June 1, 2015, but it has been extended. Multiple administration officials and experts told us the Taliban Five haven’t left Qatar, and we couldn’t find any evidence to the contrary. "They’re all still in Qatar," said Myles Caggins, a spokesman for the National Security Council. The United States and Qatar are working together to keep tabs on the Taliban Five. Caggins declined to comment on specific security and surveillance arrangements. But he said "the State Department is in continual discussion with the government of Qatar" regarding the former detainees. Another barrier to the ex-detainees’ return to the battlefield is an additional travel ban beyond the U.S.-Qatar agreement. Four of the five are restricted from leaving the country due to a travel ban imposed by a 1998 United Nations Security Council Resolution, said Barnett Rubin, associate director of the Center on International Cooperation at New York University. Of course, this doesn’t necessarily mean the former detainees aren’t trying to reconnect with the Taliban or other insurgent groups. At least one of the Taliban Five is suspected by the United States of having attempted to contact Taliban associates. And Afghan intelligence officers arrested two suspected insurgents who tried to visit former detainee Mohammad Nabi Omari in Qatar, according to the New York Times. It’s also possible that some or all of the Taliban Five have had more contact with the Taliban or other jihadist networks without the public (or even the government) knowing, said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. But mere communications, or even giving orders from a distance, is not the same thing as literally being "back on the battlefield." "There are indications that they would like to return to the battlefield," Gartenstein-Ross said. "There’s reason for concern, but there’s not evidence to support (Trump’s) particular claim." Even if the Taliban Five has re-engaged in insurgent activities electronically -- a contention that, we reiterate, is not confirmed by any publicly available information -- it would be a stretch to conclude that this counts as returning to the battlefield. "At least one of them called some of his relatives. I don't know what he said on the phone. If making a phone call now constitutes returning to the battlefield, we are in 1984 territory," Rubin said, referring to the George Orwell novel. Our ruling Donald Trump said the five Guantanamo detainees swapped for Bowe Bergdahl "are right now back on the battlefield." The Taliban Five are known to be in Qatar, where they have been since their release over a year ago. Qatar is considered neutral ground -- not a battlefield -- and they are not allowed to leave the country. At least one of the five has been in contact with suspected insurgents, but experts said there is not enough information available to know the extent of these communications. And even if they had communicated with insurgents from afar, that would not the same as literally going back to the battlefield. Because there is no evidence to support Trump’s claim, we rate it False.	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2015-07-23T13:25:53	2015-07-21	['Bowe_Bergdahl', 'Guantanamo_Bay_detention_camp']

pomt-12290	Under the House health care bill, Medicaid spending "actually goes up 20 percent over the next 10 years."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2017/jun/28/newt-gingrich/gingrich-misleads-point-house-bill-grows-medicaid-/	Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich said all the media coverage that declares the Republican health care bills would cut Medicaid is wrong, because he claimed the program actually gets a significant boost over the years. Reports about both the House and Senate bills have pointed out the measures reduce funding for Medicaid, the joint state and federal health insurance program for the very poor. Using the House bill as an example, Gingrich said it’s really the opposite. "After all the news media talking about cutting Medicaid in the House Republican bill, I did some research," Gingrich said June 27, 2017, on Fox & Friends. "It actually goes up 20 percent over the next 10 years." Gingrich said Republicans had a "communications problem" for not pointing this growth out when discussing the bill, resulting in coverage focused on deep Medicaid cuts. Those news reports mostly focus on analyses by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The bill before the Senate would reduce Medicaid spending by $772 billion over 10 years by 2026, the CBO said. A similar analysis for the bill that passed the House in May would winnow Medicaid spending by $834 billion in the same time frame. So where is Gingrich getting his 20 percent increase in Medicaid spending from? We reached out to his office and didn’t hear back. But it appears he’s talking about the rate at which Medicaid will grow over the next decade — something the program’s slated to do whether Republicans pass a health care law or not. The GOP proposals, however, put major limits on future funding for that growth. Medicaid costs keep going up Medicaid originally was a program for low-income children, pregnant women, elderly and disabled individuals, and some parents, but it excluded other low-income adults. As part of its efforts to provide health coverage options for as many people as possible, the Affordable Care Act allowed states to expand Medicaid and help pay for it with more federal dollars. Thirty-one states plus Washington, D.C., currently have extended Medicaid benefits to essentially all adults making up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The poverty line for a family of four is $24,600 in 2017. That coverage is expensive, and it’s only going to cost more as the years go on. For calculating how the GOP bills may affect Medicaid spending, the CBO used baseline figures from March 2016 to draw estimates for how much the program would cost. "There are two reasons Medicaid costs go up: More people are being served and the cost of serving them is going up," said Joan Alker, Georgetown University public policy professor and executive director of the Center for Children and Families. Costs could rise due to increasing drug prices, inflation, an aging population with more older Americans, or any number of other considerations. "CBO's baseline projects what Medicaid will need to account for these factors," Alker said. From 2017 through 2026, the federal government would spend more than $5 trillion on Medicaid under current law, the CBO projected. Another way to measure that growth is to calculate the percent change from current spending levels to that estimated 2026 level. If the Affordable Care Act stayed in place and nothing changed, the CBO said Medicaid spending would increase from $393 billion in 2017 to $624 billion in 2026. That’s a 58.8 percent increase. Now come the semantics: The House and Senate bills both slow the rate of that increase in spending, although they do so in different ways and on different schedules. But they both assume major reductions in how high the dollar amount for funding increases. Opponents of the GOP bills call that a cut. The CBO calls that "reductions in outlays." Gingrich is saying it’s an increase. How? How the GOP bills slow Medicaid spending It looks like Gingrich focused on the projection for how the House bill would affect future funding. Starting with the $393 billion in spending in 2017, Medicaid spending would go up steadily each year to reach $474 billion in 2026, under the House bill. That’s a 20.6 percent increase. The Senate’s plan would increase funding to $466 billion in 2026, or about 18.5 percent higher than 2017. The projections assume what would happen if the bills took effect, with reductions starting in 2018. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The CBO said that under the House’s bill, 14 million fewer people would be enrolled in Medicaid by 2026, relative to current law. The Senate bill would see 15 million fewer enrollees. Keep in mind that Medicaid spending goes up under any scenario. It’s just at a far lower rate under the Republican health care bills. Policy analysts told us it makes reductions to Medicaid with no allowance for how the program may need to grow in the future. "If he's claiming that there's no cut in the (House bill) because Medicaid spending in 2026 would be higher than it is now, that's largely irrelevant," Ben Sommers, a Harvard University health policy and economics professor, told PolitiFact. "Given that this dramatically reduces spending to what would occur under current law, most people would call this a ‘cut.’ " Such reductions also put new limits on how many people have access to Medicaid. The changes all but guarantee states will have to alter eligibility requirements and take away benefits — without regard to whether people actually need them. "The bills restrain the rate of increase well below Medicaid’s actual rate of increase," said Sara Rosenbaum, a George Washington University health law and policy professor. "Of course it’s a cut. If federal growth is kept artificially low, the only choice is to spend more to make up the deficit." Our ruling Gingrich said under the House health care bill, Medicaid spending "actually goes up 20 percent over the next 10 years." By any CBO projection and under any proposed legislation, Medicaid spending will increase over the next decade — because health care costs are increasing. The House health care bill limits that increase to 20 percent, while maintaing the status quo requires a 60 percent increase, according to the CBO. Both the bills in the House and the Senate limit the growth of spending. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

pomt-02969	Gov. Lincoln Chafee has imposed "a mandatory abortion fee" on all Rhode Islanders who buy health insurance through the state’s Obamacare exchange.	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/oct/23/barth-bracy/anti-abortion-activist-barth-bracy-says-people-who/	The Affordable Care Act, widely known as Obamacare, is controversial enough. But the question of coverage for abortion adds yet another layer of contentiousness. Antiabortion activists do not want their premiums used to pay for a procedure they regard as murder. They have been pushing without success to require the Rhode Island health insurance exchange, known as HealthSource RI, to give consumers a choice by offering plans that do not include abortion coverage. Barth Bracy, executive director of the Rhode Island Right to Life Committee, said in an Oct. 2 news release that because no plans on the exchange exclude abortion coverage, all customers must pay a fee for such coverage -- and Governor Lincoln Chafee is responsible. Wrote Bracy: "We have been fighting in the General Assembly since 2011 trying to blunt Chafee’s extreme agenda on government subsidies for insurance plans that cover abortion-on-demand and, more recently, his imposition of a mandatory abortion fee on all Rhode Island individuals, families and businesses who wish to purchase health insurance through HealthSource RI." We wanted to know whether there really is a separate, mandatory abortion fee and, if so, whether Chafee had anything to do with it. First, a little background. Chafee created Rhode Island’s health insurance exchange in September 2011 through an executive order after an effort to do so through legislation stalled in the General Assembly over abortion language. Abortion opponents, including close to 40 legislators, sued to overturn the order. The lawsuit is pending in Superior Court. When we asked Bracy for the source of his claim, he sent us to the "Special Rules" portion of the Obamacare law (Section 18023 of the U.S. Code). Beginning with paragraph b(2)B, the law says the entity that issues an insurance plan through an exchange must "collect from each enrollee . . . a separate payment" for money that will be used for abortion coverage. (How much is that payment? The insurance companies are required under the law to break out the monthly cost of abortion coverage based on the assumption that everyone gets abortion coverage. If it's less than $1 per subscriber, it is considered to be $1. For all of the plans in the Rhode Island marketplace, it's the $1 minimum.) This separate payment for abortion coverage would certainly seem to meet the definition of the "abortion fee" Bracy is referring to. It turns out to be a hidden fee. "The customer is not billed a separate fee," Dara Chadwick, spokeswoman for HealthSource RI said in an email. The way the system is set up, the issuer of each plan (an insurance company such as Blue Cross) does not bill the customer directly. HealthSource RI does. She asserted that another portion of the law, subsection b(3), prohibits separate billing because abortion services can only be mentioned in the summary of benefits when the person is enrolled. We're not convinced, but that's a side issue. Regardless of the mechanics of this fee and whether or not consumers see it, it's clear that the fee is required by federal law. It was not imposed by Chafee. Bracy said Chafee is responsible because there are insurance plans that exclude abortion coverage, yet none are being offered by the Rhode Island marketplace. More important, he said, the Chafee administration could have offered people a choice and made such a plan part of the exchange, but didn’t. (By 2017, all exchanges must offer a plan that doesn’t cover abortion.) "The fact that ALL the Exchange plans do cover elective abortion, and thus there is no exception to the abortion premium (thereby making it mandatory for all who wish to purchase insurance through the exchange), can rightly be attributed to Chafee," said Bracy. Chafee spokeswoman Christine Hunsinger disagreed. "It would be inappropriate for the governor to dictate what is or is not covered. It's the Executive Committee on Health Reform that determined the benchmark plan and the essential health benefits." The plans the insurance companies chose to submit covered abortion. Our ruling Rhode Island Right to Life's Executive Director Barth Bracy said Governor Chafee has imposed "a mandatory abortion fee" on all Rhode Islanders who buy health insurance under Obamacare. There is a fee, whether it's hidden in the bill or presented as a line item as the law seems to require. That element of his statement is accurate. Did Chafee impose the fee? That's a big stretch. It’s a federal requirement, although Chafee, who created the insurance exchange system in Rhode Island, could have pushed for a plan that didn’t cover abortion, which would have allowed antiabortion consumers to have a choice on the issue. Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate it Half True.

pomt-06225	The U.S. economy "is three times as big as China's."	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2011/dec/05/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-us-economy-three-larger-chinas/	Congressman Eric Cantor recently weighed in on how the United States’ economy compares to the domestic output in China, which is seen as an rising economic rival. "Our economy is three times as big as China’s," Cantor, R-7th, said when asked about China’s currency during a Nov. 14 meeting with reporters. There’s been plenty of speculation on about just how much progress China’s economic engine has made in catching up to the United States, so we wanted to check to find out if Cantor was correct. We ran the congressman’s statement past Derek Scissors, a research fellow in Asia economic policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation. Scissors said that when measuring the two countries by a standard comparison of each nation’s gross domestic product, Cantor is almost on target. For 2009, Cantor’s number is right, Scissors said. But using the latest annual numbers from 2010, he’s off just a bit. "For 2010, it’s more like two and a half to one (advantage for the U.S.)," Scissors said. We asked Cantor’s office where he got his information for the statement. Megan Whittemore, a Cantor spokeswoman, cited numbers from the World Bank, showing that U.S. GDP in 2010 was about $14.6 trillion while China’s GDP was nearly $5.9 trillion. "So the U.S. economy is about 2.5 times the size of China’s economy, but the congressman rounded up to three," Whittemore said in an e-mail. Cantor is not alone in making the claim that the U.S. economy is outpacing China’s by a 3-to-1 ratio. In a Jan. 19, 2011, joint news conference with Chinese President Hu Jintao, President Barack Obama said the U.S. economy is still three times larger than China’s, according to a USA Today blog post. A March 11, 2011, report from the Congressional Research Service said that after three decades of brisk economic growth, China has the second largest economy in the world behind the United States. But the report added that despite China’s rise, "the United States’ economy is three times larger than China’s." But that’s not the end of the story. There are different ways of measuring a country’s Gross Domestic Product. One way is to compare each country’s GDP using nominal exchange rates that convert China’s economic data into U.S. dollars, according to a 2007 Congressional Research Service report. It’s by that measure that the U.S. economy is three times bigger than China’s. But that Congressional Research Service report noted there’s been considerable debate among economists over the actual size of China’s economy. Many economists, the CRS noted, contend using the nominal exchange rate significantly understates the size of the Chinese economy. Another way to gauge GDP is to use purchasing power parity, or PPP, a measurement that converts foreign currency to U.S. dollars based on that currency’s purchasing power, the CRS report states. That measurement gives a huge boost to China’s GDP, making it much closer to the size of U.S. Data from a September 2011 report from the International Monetary Fund said that when measured on a purchasing power parity basis, China’s 2010 GDP was about $10.1 trillion, while the U.S. was at $14.5 trillion. By that gauge, the U.S. economy is only 30 percent larger than China’s. The Central Intelligence Agency’s World Factbook puts more stock in measuring China’s economy by using the purchasing power parity measure. It notes that measuring China’s GDP by the lower official exchange rate understates the China’s output compared to the rest of the world. "In China’s situation, GDP at purchasing power parity provides the best measure for comparing output across countries," the CIA’s factbook states. But using that GDP larger measure also has drawbacks, Scissors wrote in an April 2011 report. He said that purchasing power parity estimates change over time, noting that the World Bank cut the size of its 2005 purchasing power parity GDP estimate for China by 40 percent. Since 2005, Chinese inflation has outpaced that in the U.S., meaning the latest purchasing power measurements are out of date, Scissors wrote. He added that measuring GDP by that method overstates Chinese GDP. And we should also note that the 2007 Congressional Research Service report urged caution in using purchasing power GDP estimates for China, noting the prices of many goods and services in that country are distorted due to price controls and government subsidies. Our Conclusion: Cantor said that the U.S. economy is three times the size of China’s. By a standard and commonly-used measure of Gross Domestic Product, he’s pretty close. Annual figures from 2010 show the U.S. economy is two and a half times the size of China. That gives credibility to what Cantor is saying. But by a second measure, adjusting for purchasing power, the U.S. output is still larger than China’s, but the gap is much smaller. The U.S. economy by that score is only one-third larger than China’s. Neither set of statistics is universally accepted as the only way to gauge the size of China’s output.

Chris Christie wanted the crowd to listen a second time to a statistic about the number of "college ready" students in Camden. "How bad has it been in Camden? How ‘bout this -- Last year, only three students graduated college ready," Christie said during his Jan. 14 "State of the State" address. "I want you to listen to that again. In the entire public school system in Camden last year, only three students graduated college ready." The Republican governor’s claim refers to a statistic recently cited by Camden Superintendent Paymon Rouhanifard in regard to students whose SAT scores met the "SAT College and Career Readiness Benchmark" developed by the College Board, which administers the standardized test. That benchmark -- a combined score of 1550 -- indicates a 65 percent likelihood of achieving a B- average or higher during a student’s first year at a four-year college, which in turn is associated with a high likelihood of college success, according to the College Board. The highest possible score on the SAT is 2400. Christie said "three students graduated college ready" in Camden in 2013, but the actual statistic is related to the number of 12th-graders enrolled in Camden during the 2011-12 school year who took the SATs and hit that benchmark, according to data provided by the school district. Of the 214 students who took the exam, only three students reached that benchmark, the data shows. It’s worth noting that many other Camden students didn’t take the SATs at all. In addition to those 214 test-takers, there were 255 12th-graders enrolled that year who did not take the exam, the data shows. The district does not track how many students take the ACT, district spokesman Kevin Shafer said. Rouhanifard acknowledged how many Camden students go on to college without reaching that SAT benchmark or without taking the SATs. "A lot more than three students are going to college," he said. Still, the superintendent noted how once Camden students begin attending Camden County College, for example, a large number of them need to take remedial courses. The statistic about the SAT benchmark indicates that "the rigor isn’t always there and students aren’t always prepared," he said. But some education experts were divided last week over the value of using that SAT benchmark. Paul Reville, a professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, said the benchmark was a "useful indicator for policy makers and others to use," and he said Christie was making a valid point about the failure to adequately prepare urban youth for college or careers. "The fact is that overall there are far too many students coming out of Camden and virtually every other urban center who are neither prepared for college nor career, and that’s a crisis," Reville said. "And so in that regard, irrespective of what rhetoric he might be using or facts to support it, I think the governor’s on target in pointing to this as a challenge that we need to deal with," he added. But Christopher Tienken, an assistant professor of education administration at Seton Hall University, argued that the benchmark does not account for other factors, such as a student’s grade point average. "I think we need to use multiple measures," Tienken said. "Putting all your eggs in the standardized testing basket, I think you run the risk of really misidentifying whether students are college ready or not." In a statement, the College Board said it developed the benchmark to help school officials and others evaluate the effectiveness of academic programs to better prepare students for college, but the group also said falling below that benchmark does not mean students will not be successful. "If a student does not meet the SAT benchmark score of 1550, it does not mean he or she can’t or won’t be successful in college," the statement read. The governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment. Our ruling In his "State of the State" address, Christie said: "In the entire public school system in Camden last year, only three students graduated college ready." But that statistic does not refer to high school graduates in 2013. It refers to the three 12th-graders enrolled during the 2011-12 school year who took the SATs and received a combined score of at least 1550, a benchmark developed by the College Board to measure college readiness. Since Christie’s statement is "accurate but needs clarification or additional information," we rate it Mostly True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-11960	On whether higher federal deficits are acceptable.	full flop	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/oct/04/mick-mulvaney/did-budget-director-mick-mulvaney-flip-flop-higher/	President Donald Trump’s budget director raised eyebrows during a recent appearance on Fox News Sunday when he seemed to display a tolerance for bigger deficits. Mick Mulvaney’s comments came during a discussion of Trump’s tax plan, which, due to a variety of tax cuts, has been independently projected to add nearly $5.6 trillion to the federal debt over the next 20 years when compared to the current path of debt growth. Host Chris Wallace reminded Mulvaney about his tenure in the House, when Mulvaney often took a hard line on deficits and the debt. "You were a deficit hawk," Wallace said. "What happened, sir?" After a brief back-and-forth about the groups that had projected the debt increase, Mulvaney responded, "I've been very candid about this. We need to have new deficits because of that. We need to have the growth, Chris. "If we simply look at this as being deficit-neutral, you're never going to get the type of tax reform and tax reductions that you need to get to sustain 3 percent economic growth. We really do believe that the tax code is what's holding back the American economy." Was Mulvaney’s embrace of future deficits a flip-flop, as Wallace suggested? We put his position on the Flip-O-Meter, which describes whether someone’s stand has changed and is not meant as a value judgment. The evidence shows it has changed. Railing against rising deficits Mulvaney’s remarks on Fox News Sunday clashed in tone and substance with a portion of his opening statement at his Senate confirmation hearing in January 2017. "We can turn this economy, and this country around, but it will take tough decisions today in order to avoid impossible ones tomorrow," Mulvaney told the Senate Budget Committee. "Our gross national debt has increased to almost $20 trillion. That number is so large as to defy description. ... I believe, as a matter of principle, that the debt is a problem that must be addressed sooner, rather than later. I also know that fundamental changes are needed in the way Washington spends and taxes if we truly want a healthy economy. This must include changing our government’s long-term fiscal path, which is unsustainable." Mulvaney’s tough-on-debt remarks at his confirmation hearing were consistent with his position while in Congress since 2010. Mulvaney made clear shortly after taking office that he had little patience with rising debt. In January 2011, Mulvaney joined a faction of Republicans seeking to cut federal spending by $2.5 trillion over 10 years, significantly faster than the official party position. He then told Politico that President Barack Obama’s 2011-12 budget proposal was "a joke. It’s hard to explain how detached from reality this is, to think that the country can spend another $1.6 trillion when it doesn’t have the means." And in an interview with Fox News that April, host Alisyn Camerota asked Mulvaney whether he would vote to to raise the debt limit, which some had called "Armageddon." (Experts have agreed.) Mulvaney responded, "It's no more Armageddon and no more catastrophic than what we're doing right now -- spending, what, $1.5 trillion we don't have this year." During a debate over raising the debt ceiling, Mulvaney ended up authoring a budget bill dubbed "Cut, Cap and Balance" in 2011 that would have capped spending and added a balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution. Mulvaney also held a series of "Spending, Debt and Deficit" town halls around his district in 2011, telling attendees at one of the gatherings, in the Sun City Carolina Lakes development, that "the country’s debt is much worse than I ever thought. Forty-two cents of every dollar Americans spend is borrowed. Allowing this figure to increase compromises U.S. foreign policy." In January 2013, Mulvaney sought across-the-board cuts in federal spending to offset $51 billion in proposed aid for those hit by Hurricane Sandy. While Mulvaney acknowledged the need for Sandy aid, he added, "I believe we can provide that relief while finding ways to pay for it rather than adding to the nation's ballooning deficit." In March 2015, as lawmakers were considering whether to find ways around budgetary spending caps, Mulvaney sided with sticking to the caps because "deficits matter. Still," he told the Washington Examiner. The authors of the Almanac of American Politics 2016 noted Mulvaney’s strident position, writing, "In his first term, he often bucked his party’s leadership in the name of fiscal discipline and voted against several spending bills backed by House Speaker John Boehner." An explanation from Mulvaney Asked about the discrepancy, OMB spokesman John Czwartacki said it stems from the change in the political dynamics of Washington. When Mulvaney was in Congress, there was a Democratic president and, for much of the period, a Democratic Senate, both of which preferred to stimulate the economy through spending. Mulvaney did not have the "chance to support tax cuts with a chance of passage," so Mulvaney fought instead to decrease the deficit by challenging the Obama administration on spending, Czwartacki said. Since Trump’s election, Republicans have had unified control of Washington, so Mulvaney "is now in a place where he can drive the idea of spending restraint while at the same time emphasizing the need for economic growth through deregulation, fairer trade, and of course tax cuts." Experts say Mulvaney’s defense doesn’t add up Independent budget experts still see a stark contrast between Mulvaney’s views then and now. At an Oct. 4 tax policy panel on Capitol Hill sponsored by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, PolitiFact asked panel members what they thought of Mulvaney’s Fox News Sunday comments. Marc Goldwein, the group’s senior vice president, said as recently as a few months ago, when Trump released his annual budget proposal, Mulvaney "called for revenue-neutral tax reform," a sign that he came into his new position as "one of the true fiscal hawks in the Trump administration." However, he added, Mulvaney is "now saying that we need big debt to grow the economy. I think that's backwards. If you got Congressman Mulvaney from two years ago to look at this statement and told him that it was Obama's OMB director (saying it), I can only imagine what he would say." Stan Collender, a budget specialist and executive vice president at the MSL Group consulting firm, called Mulvaney’s switch "hypocrisy" and that "there are no extenuating circumstances" for it. Deficits from tax cuts should not get a pass if deficits from spending don’t, experts said. Both add to the debt. "Our nation's debt situation makes deficits at the current and predicted level unsustainable," said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. "It doesn't matter if the deficit comes from a shortfall in revenue or increased discretionary or mandatory spending -- it all adds to the debt." Our ruling Asked about the additional deficits that are projected to accompany Trump’s tax proposal, Mulvaney said "we need to have new deficits." That’s a sharp contrast with his long record of statements, both as a member of Congress and as a nominee for OMB director, that deficits and debt are a major problem.

pomt-08892	A transcript released by Occidental College proves that Barack Obama was an Indonesian citizen.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/30/chain-email/e-mail-claims-obamas-college-transcripts-reveal-in/	One of our readers tipped us off to a chain e-mail that contains a purported Associated Press article claiming that, among other things, smoking-gun evidence has been found that proves Barack Obama really is not eligible to be president. "The group 'Americans for Freedom of Information' has released copies of President Obama's college transcripts from Occidental College," read the alleged AP article. "Released today, the transcript school [sic] indicates that Obama, under the name Barry Soetoro, received financial aid as a foreign student from Indonesia as an undergraduate. The transcript was released by Occidental College in compliance with a court order in a suit brought by the group in the Superior Court of California. The transcript shows that Obama (Soetoro) applied for financial aid and was awarded a fellowship for foreign students from the Fulbright Foundation Scholarship program. To qualify, for the scholarship, a student must claim foreign citizenship." We wondered if Occidental really had given out Obama's transcripts, and if it proved that he was a foreign imposter. First of all, as you may have expected, it's not really an AP article. Jack Stokes, a spokesperson for AP was unequivocal when he said, "It is not an AP story." A search of Google and Lexis-Nexis turned up no evidence of a group named Americans for Freedom of Information as of April 1, 2009. April 1 was the date of the purported AP story which materialized in 2009. A satirical WordPress blog was set up after the fact, as well as a far more serious AmericansforFreedomofInformation.com.Our friends at FactCheck.org found that the latter website was registered on May 11, 2009--after the date of the fake AP story. Website owner Debra Smith, says on her own personal website that she had nothing to do with chain e-mail. Nevertheless, it could still be true. Barack Obama did attend Occidental college for two years before transferring to Columbia University. He writes about the experience in his book Dreams From My Father, and three rare photos have surfaced that show the young Obama while atttending Occidental. The falsehood starts with the claim that Obama's transcript was released. That's not true, according to Jim Tranquada, director of communications at Occidental College. No court has ordered Occidental to release the transcript. Barack Obama's records at Occidental remain sealed under the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Rights Act, which applies to all students. Unless Obama gives Occidental permission to release his record, it is illegal for them to do so, and Obama has not given Occidental permission, according to Tranquada. When Obama entered Occidental, he was known as Barry Obama. Around the time he left, he preferred Barack. Soetoro was the last name of Obama's stepfather, with whom he lived in Indonesia before moving in with his grandparents in the United States. "All the alumni and students that I have spoken to knew him as Barry or Barack Obama," said Tranquada. And he registered under the name Obama, not Soetoro, according to the college. Although the e-mail lied about the release of transcripts and the name, conspiracy theorists could argue that Obama won't release his records because he is hiding the fact that he is an Indonesian citizen and actually did receive a Fulbright. As for the Fulbright claim, Fulbright scholarships are almost never awarded to undergraduate students. They are almost exclusively awarded to students pursuing advanced degrees, according to James Lawrence, a public affairs officer for the Fulbright program. The American Indonesian Exchange Foundation now handles Fulbright awards for Indonesian citizens, and only those with an undergraduate degree and applying for a master's or doctoral degree are eligible. However, AMINEF was established in 1992, and it is unclear who handled Indonesian Fulbrights before that, or if Indonesian Fulbrights even existed in 1981. An attempt to contact the organization in Indonesia was unsuccessful. This chain e-mail is wrong about AP, the transcripts and the name, and we found no evidence of a Fulbright, so we're giving it a Pants On Fire.

pomt-11399	"In the Senate, (Mike) DeWine voted with Hillary Clinton to let illegal immigrants receive Social Security. And in Ohio, DeWine allowed illegal immigrants to receive driver's licenses."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2018/mar/23/onward-ohio/ohio-tv-ad-misleads-attack-mike-dewine-about-immig/	A TV ad portrays Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine, a Republican candidate for governor, as out of step with President Donald Trump on immigration. Onward Ohio, a political action committee, launched a statewide TV ad on March 20. "If you like President Trump then you won’t like Mike DeWine," states the narrator. "In the Senate, DeWine voted with Hillary Clinton to let illegal immigrants receive Social Security. And in Ohio, DeWine allowed illegal immigrants to receive driver's licenses." DeWine’s May 8 primary opponent, Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor, is a former chair of the PAC and echoed the attack on Twitter. The ad attacks DeWine’s position on other topics including his grade from the NRA, which we have previously fact-checked. We found that the ad doesn’t accurately explain DeWine’s Senate vote related to Social Security and requires some context to explain why as Attorney General he concluded that some undocumented immigrants should receive driver’s licenses. We emailed Onward Ohio and did not get a reply. 'Let illegal immigrants receive Social Security' The ad makes it sound as if DeWine wanted to provide a new entitlement for undocumented immigrants by allowing them to qualify for Social Security -- an attack we have seen before against Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., and Harry Reid, D-Nev. In reality, the 2006 vote concerned a much narrower issue -- the treatment of past payroll taxes paid by former undocumented immigrants who would have become legal under an immigration overhaul bill that included border security, a new temporary worker visa and a path to legal status. At the time, undocumented immigrants had a right to receive credit in their benefits calculation for Social Security payments they had made while working illegally, typically while using an unauthorized Social Security number. They received such credit only after they had received legal working papers and a genuine Social Security number. During a Senate debate over the broader bill, then-Sen. John Ensign, R-Nev., offered an amendment to prevent anyone from earning credit for Social Security payments made using an unauthorized Social Security number. On May 18, 2006, the Senate voted 50-49 to table the amendment, effectively killing it. DeWine and Clinton, then a New York senator, were among those who voted in favor of tabling it. DeWine’s campaign spokesman Ryan Stubenrauch said that DeWine "voted to table the amendment because he believed that people should keep what they had earned if they could meet the steep requirements to become legal residents." DeWine had expressed support for the overall bill because it included border security and also addressed the 12 million undocumented immigrants. "It's a dangerous thing to have them in the underground. We have to put some paper on them and document them," he said several weeks before the bill passed. The House passed its own version, and the two chambers didn’t work out a compromise, so the bills died. 'DeWine allowed illegal immigrants to receive driver's licenses' This part of the ad could leave viewers with the misleading impression that DeWine took actions to allow all undocumented immigrants to get drivers’ licenses. DeWine’s recommendation while he was Ohio attorney general pertained only to a narrow slice of immigrants. In 2013, Ohio lacked a uniform policy regarding whether to grant driver’s licenses to immigrants who had temporary status through the 2012 program Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which began under President Barack Obama. Some state officials issued driver’s licenses, while others refused. On March 29, 2013, the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles announced that Ohio would allow the issuance of temporary licenses to qualified participants in DACA. The bureau reached a decision after reviewing guidance by DeWine "that DACA grantees are eligible for temporary driver licenses under Ohio law." DeWine wrote in a March 19 letter to the Ohio Latino Affairs Commission that DACA recipients could get a Social Security number and work permit. "With these documents and any other documents normally required by the BMV, an individual can provide the BMV with the information necessary to receive a driver’s license," he wrote. "I encourage any citizen who is concerned about the law or policy to contact their legislators and voice that concern. As Attorney General, I do not have the authority to introduce or vote on legislation." DeWine’s campaign said he didn’t issue a formal advisory opinion -- he only expressed his view in a letter, and then it was up to the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to issue driver’s licenses. The TV ad cites a Cleveland Plain Dealer article that mentioned DeWine’s conclusion. David Leopold, an immigration lawyer at Ulmer & Berne in Ohio and former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association, worked in an advocacy capacity closely with Jose Mendez, a DACA recipient who pushed the issue at the time in Ohio. Leopold told PolitiFact that it wasn’t a case of DeWine allowing undocumented immigrants to receive driver’s licenses. He was simply interpreting the DACA policy under Ohio law. Since DACA holders were considered "lawfully present," they were able to provide the necessary information to apply for a driver’s license. There were around 1,900 immigrants with DACA status in Ohio by the end of May 2013 when U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Service first started tracking state data. Overall, there were 95,000 undocumented immigrants in Ohio. As of 2013, the majority of states already gave driver’s licenses to DACA recipients. Two states, Arizona and Nebraska, implemented policies that excluded DACA grantees from driver’s license eligibility, but as a result of litigation or legislative action, both states later issued driver’s licenses, according to the National Immigration Law Center. Trump announced in 2017 he would rescind DACA. While a federal judge ordered his administration to continue renewals they are not required to process new applications. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to take it up and Congress hasn’t been able to reach any agreement on DACA. Our ruling Onward Ohio said in a TV ad that "in the Senate, DeWine voted with Hillary Clinton to let illegal immigrants receive Social Security. And in Ohio, DeWine allowed illegal immigrants to receive driver's licenses." On both of these attacks, the ad makes a sweeping statement without filling in viewers about the scope of what a bill and a policy actually said. The Social Security provision was more narrow than the ad suggests, because it addressed the treatment of past payroll taxes paid by people who at one time had been undocumented immigrants. While attorney general, DeWine concluded that undocumented immigrants who had temporary status through the federal DACA program were entitled to driver’s licenses, but that didn’t apply to all undocumented immigrants. There are kernels of truth here, but the ad fails to provide a complete picture of DeWine’s actions. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-05613	President Barack Obama "reduced the cost of prescription drugs for nearly 3.6 million Americans in 2011."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/mar/27/barack-obama/obama-ad-claims-credit-cheaper-prescription-drugs/	As the U.S. Supreme Court hears arguments on the national health care law, a new Barack Obama campaign ad touts the improvements in Medicare benefits contained in the legislation. Video clips of President Obama speaking about eliminating Medicare fraud play are interspersed with still shots of the president embracing retirees. The text: "As president he signed the Affordable Care Act ... and reduced the cost of prescription drugs for nearly 3.6 million Americans in 2011." We’re checking whether the ad is accurate that the health law -- and Obama, by extension -- are to credit for that many Medicare recipients paying less for prescription drugs last year. The doughnut hole Medicare Part D, which covers prescription drugs for beneficiaries, has always contained a coverage gap. The plan pays for drugs up to a dollar amount, but then Medicare recipients must cover the entire cost of prescriptions until catastrophic coverage kicks in. Currently, beneficiaries in the Medicare Part D program must pay the first $310 for prescriptions. Then insurance then pays up to $2,830. At that point they’re in what's known as the doughnut hole with a gap in coverage until they hit an out-of-pocket limit of $4,550. At that point, their coverage takes over again, usually paying about 95 percent of the costs. Jack Hoadley, a health policy analyst at Georgetown University, co-wrote a study for the Kaiser Family Foundation last year on the coverage gap. He pointed out that even those who reach the catastrophic threshold do so only after they have been paying the full price of their prescriptions for several months. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, slowly phases out the doughnut hole through price discounts and government subsidies, eliminating it completely in 2020. The 2011 phase Last year, under the terms of the health care law, the doughnut hole shrank a little with those eligible for Medicare receiving discounts on drugs once they reached the coverage gap. Drug manufacturers were required to provide a 50 percent discount for covered brand name drugs, while there were federal subsidies (7 percent discount) for generic drugs, said Elizabeth Hargrave, a senior research scientist at the University of Chicago and co-author of the study with Hoadley. "The brand-name drug discounts do not cause beneficiaries to reach the catastrophic coverage more slowly – they’re counted as if beneficiaries paid these amounts out of pocket. So this is true savings even for beneficiaries who subsequently reach the catastrophic limit," Hargrave added. Both discounts will increase over time until the doughnut hole is effectively closed in 2020, she said. So the reduced drug costs are real. What about the number of people who benefitted? ‘Nearly 3.6 million Americans’ The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services, estimated that total discounts added up to $2.1 billion, or an average of $604 per beneficiary. It also said 3,576,640 people enjoyed those savings. (For a state-by-state breakdown, check out the chart at the bottom of the fact sheet.) The CMS numbers are based on 2011 Part D claims data received through Feb. 29, 2012, the agency said. We didn’t see any reason to doubt the figures, but CMS is a federal agency under Obama, and this is an Obama campaign ad. So we ran it by Hoadley and Hargrave, who both said the 3.6 million figure checks out. Hargrave pointed us to another CMS chart, which totalled the number of beneficiaries in the doughnut hole in 2011 at 3,758,024 -- including the territories -- and about 3.6 million in the 50 states. (See the first chart in the zip file.) Our ruling Obama’s campaign ad credits the president, by fighting for and signing the health care law, with reducing the cost of prescription drugs for nearly 3.6 million Americans in 2011. The law is saving Medicare beneficiaries money by phasing out the coverage gap, or doughnut hole. It accomplishes that by requiring discounts from drug companies and by providing subsidies in increasing amounts until the gap is eliminated. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid said about 3.6 million people saved about $2.1 billion on drugs in 2011. The claim holds up. We rate it True.

pomt-09098	"Health reform eliminates co-pays, deductibles, and other costs for preventative care and provides for free annual wellness checkups starting next year."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2010/jun/23/jane-kidd/health-reform-gives-seniors-free-checkups-democrat/	Even after all the hollering over health care reform, average citizens remain confused over how the bill will change their lives. Among them are retirees, a powerful voting bloc, which means Democrats who pushed for the reform have some explaining to do. How do they convince them that they have their best interests in mind? Enter Georgia's Democratic Party, whose chair Jane Kidd wrote a column to address these concerns. That opinion piece was e-mailed to the press. Thanks to health care reform, the op-ed said, seniors will get free services that can help keep them healthy. She wrote: "For example, while seniors today must pay for preventative care, health reform eliminates co-pays, deductibles, and other costs for preventative care and provides for free annual wellness checkups starting next year – ensuring that every Georgia senior has the care they need to better maintain their health." Free? Is this too good to be true? To back up their claim, Georgia's Democrats referred us to an article in The Record newspaper of Troy, N.Y., that cited the AARP. It states that "many preventative services . . . will now be free for Medicare beneficiaries, and they won’t have to shell out co-pays for those services." They also sent an article from CNN.com that said, "Medicare will provide free annual wellness visits and personalized prevention plans starting in 2011," and a fact sheet from WhiteHouse.gov that said the same thing. We called the AARP, a group known for its extensive research on issues that affect seniors. They confirmed that seniors who have Medicare will receive annual wellness visits and personalized prevention plans starting in 2011. These benefits were established by Title IV of the massive health care overhaul bill, dubbed "Prevention of Chronic Disease and Improving Public Health." By 2010, Medicare recipients will receive free "annual wellness visits" from their health care providers. The checkup will include the creation of a personal prevention plan and a schedule of recommended health screenings for the next five to 10 years, the bill states. Since the AARP took sides on the issue, we sought additional verification. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the government agency that administers these programs, confirmed the AARP account and gave some additional information. There is some question about whether members of Medicare Advantage plans -- the privately managed plans that operate under the Medicare umbrella -- will also receive these wellness visits for free. A spokesman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said federal law requires that Medicare Advantage plans provide, at a minimum, the services included in Medicare. So by 2011, these plans will also have to provide wellness visits without charge. Generally speaking, the health care law has several provisions that attempt to change Medicare so that it pays for good outcomes instead of paying per procedure, a system known as "fee for service." The free preventive care is part of that overall philosophy. Tests such as cancer screenings that are already free under Medicare will remain so, and additional tests may also be included, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said. Still, we at PolitiFact Georgia remained dubious. Is there no provision that will make seniors pay for the "free" preventive services in an indirect way? Well there's free. And then there's "free." It's free if you paid your Medicare taxes, and make below a certain income. Over time, higher-income seniors will find that their overall Medicare costs increase, according to tax expert Howard Gleckman, a resident fellow at the nonpartisan Urban Institute, Joseph Antos, a health policy expert with the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, a nonpartisan think tank with conservative roots, and a PolitiFact Georgia review of the legislation. Under the current system, recipients with individual incomes of $85,000 or family incomes of $170,000 pay higher premiums to receive coverage. Under the new system, the pool of people who pay this bigger bill will gradually increase because the income thresholds will not be adjusted for inflation until 2019,according to Section 3402 of the legislation. For those who cross the threshold, this could mean an increase of roughly $50 a month, Antos said. All taxpayers, including seniors, who make more than $200,000 individually or $250,000 as a family will pay more in payroll taxes under Section 9015 of the bill. Also, seniors who like to work on their tans -- whoever you are -- should watch out. Indoor tanning salons will have to pay an excise tax under the new law.

pomt-00126	"We know dangerous criminals can slip through immigration at airports just like ours. Yet Joe Donnelly stood right here with the radical left against all efforts to secure our most vulnerable entry points."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/oct/26/national-republican-senatorial-committee/nrsc-distorts-joe-donnellys-immigration-record/	A National Republican Senatorial Committee ad in the Indiana Senate race will have you believe Democratic incumbent Joe Donnelly has a radical outlook on immigration. He doesn’t. "We know dangerous criminals can slip through immigration at airports just like ours," the ad says. "Yet Joe Donnelly stood right here with the radical left against all efforts to secure our most vulnerable entry points. Just like he stood with the radical left in Washington. Open borders, taxpayer-funded benefits. Putting them in front of Hoosiers. Joe Donnelly stood right here and showed us whose side he’s on." Donnelly has consistently voted in favor of tougher immigration enforcement. He has voted to defund sanctuary cities and called eliminating ICE a "terrible idea." He voted three times to fund Trump’s border wall, and even said he would be "fine" providing "$3 (billion), $3.5, $4 or $5" billion for the wall. We rated a claim that he voted to grant amnesty to undocumented immigrants Mostly False. The clip of Donnelly is taken from a protest against President Donald Trump’s travel ban at the Indianapolis International Airport on Jan 29, 2017. The executive order, signed Jan. 27, temporarily halted the entry into the United States of people from seven majority-Muslim countries impacted by terrorism. It also paused admission of all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely stopped the entry of refugees from Syria. "This is wrong," the ad shows Donnelly saying, emphasizing each word. But footage from that same speech shows he was actually quoting Republicans to support his position — not the "radical left". "(Senators) John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) came out today and said: This is wrong. This does not make us safer. And so I say to all of you here, thank you. Thank you for standing up for America and American values," Donnelly said. Donnelly was paraphrasing a joint statement McCain and Graham released on Jan. 29, 2017. "This executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country," they wrote. "That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security." Trump produced three iterations of the ban. The first two were struck down by the courts. The third was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court. Trump's travel restrictions currently apply to nationals of Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, North Korea and Venezuela. NRSC did not respond to multiple requests for comment. Our ruling NRSC said, "We know dangerous criminals can slip through immigration at airports just like ours. Yet Joe Donnelly stood right here with the radical left against all efforts to secure our most vulnerable entry points." Donnelly has mostly stood with Republicans when it comes to immigration. He stood with Democrats and several prominent Republicans, whom he quotes in the video, in decrying Trump’s executive order to halt the entry of people from countries impacted by terrorism. That’s not the "radical left". We rate this statement False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	National Republican Senatorial Committee	None	None	None	2018-10-26T12:56:13	2018-10-24	['None']
pomt-03823	"Scientists tell us that we could have a cure in 10 years for Alzheimer's" were it not for "overzealous regulators, excessive taxation and greedy litigators."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/20/michele-bachmann/michele-bachmann-said-alzheimers-disease-could-be-/	Are bureaucrats, high taxation and trial lawyers keeping America from tackling Alzheimer’s disease? Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., said they are during a speech to CPAC, the annual conservative conference. After recalling the history of vaccinations against polio, Bachmann said, "We have another disease ... that's hurting us today. It's called Alzheimer's. ... There is no known treatment for Alzheimer's on the horizon. … Scientists tell us that we could have a cure in 10 years for Alzheimer's, if we'd only put our mind to it. So why aren't we seeking to cure diseases like Alzheimer's, or diabetes, juvenile diabetes, heart disease, cancer, Parkinson's disease? How did we possibly get to this point of political malpractice? Because our government, proclaiming to care so much, has created a cadre of overzealous regulators, excessive taxation and greedy litigators. That's not caring. It's time we care." We wondered if it was accurate for Bachmann to say that "scientists tell us that we could have a cure in 10 years for Alzheimer's" were it not for "overzealous regulators, excessive taxation and greedy litigators." So we checked with a variety of Alzheimer’s researchers and policy experts. (Bachmann’s office did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) We found a strong consensus among Alzheimer’s disease experts that Bachmann’s factors are either minor obstacles or not obstacles at all. Instead, they cited two primary concerns -- insufficient funding and the complexity of the disease itself. First, let’s look at funding. "The only thing keeping us from developing successful treatments for Alzheimer's disease is the lack of adequate funding for research from NIH and other federal agencies," said Robert A. Stern, a neurologist and neurosurgeon, as well as a director of the Alzheimer's Disease Center at the Boston University School of Medicine. "That has nothing to do with her naive and scary statements. It only has to do with Congress deciding that it is worth spending money on." We should note that the Obama administration did shift $50 million into Alzheimer’s research for fiscal year 2012 and requested an additional $80 million for fiscal year 2013. It also dedicated nearly $80 million in stimulus money to Alzheimer’s for each of two fiscal years, 2009 and 2010. Still, these temporary increases were not built into the ongoing baseline. The baseline level has remained fairly constant since Obama took office, at about $450 million a year. And that amount is due to be cut back this year due to the across-the-board cuts known as sequestration. "After many years of expansion under the Clinton administration, the budget for the National Institutes of Health has remained relatively stagnant for more than a decade," said Deborah E. Barnes, an Alzheimer’s specialist at the University of California, San Francisco. "This has put the squeeze on scientists. In the past, the top 25 percent to 30 percent of research proposals would receive funding. Now it is the top 5 percent to 10 percent. This means that a lot of really good research is not being funded, and our progress toward finding a cure for Alzheimer's and other important disorders has been slowed. The funding for NIH comes from taxpayer dollars, so excessive taxation is clearly not the problem." The other key obstacle our experts cited is the nature of the disease itself. If Bachmann is looking for diseases that have been sidetracked by bureaucratic or regulatory hurdles, "Alzheimer's is about the worst example she could give," said R. Alta Charo, a bioethicist at the University of Wisconsin. The disease, she said, "develops over years from causes still unclear. The real dilemma for Alzheimer's drug trials -- or for trials of any disease that develops slowly with symptoms that may easily be due to other diseases and which may be of varying intensity -- is that there is no form of standard clinical trial that can test interventions and cures within a reasonable time frame." As a result, she said, the FDA has allowed various kinds of abbreviated trials that don’t evaluate progress in slowing or reversing the disease itself. Instead, they track "surrogate markers" -- indicators that seem to suggest that a drug is helping. But not all markers translate over time into clinical benefit, she said. Such practical challenges have produced a trail of broken hopes. In a 2012 "setbacks report" on Alzheimer’s drug research, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, the nation’s leading trade group for drugmakers, tallied 101 "failed" Alzheimer’s drugs since 1998, with a rate of 34 setbacks for every drug approved. And even the medicines that have won approval have provided symptomatic relief to some patients, rather than actually rolling back the disease itself. One might expect PhRMA, one of the most influential pro-business lobbying groups in Washington, to applaud the notion that overzealous regulation, high taxation and aggressive plaintiffs attorneys are curbing the industry’s efforts. But in the case of Alzheimer’s, at least, the "setbacks report" doesn’t even touch on those issues. So what does the report point to instead? It talks largely about the practical challenges of dealing with a complicated disease. "Scientists still do not fully understand the underlying causes and mechanisms of the disease, particularly when it comes to separating potential causes from effects of the disease. This makes selection of viable targets for new medicines very difficult," the report says. It adds that "the limited utility of current models of the human disease is a huge barrier in preclinical testing of drug candidates." The difficulty of finding testable indicators of the disease, the report continues, "makes it particularly challenging to evaluate, enroll, follow up, and retain patients in clinical studies. Ultimately this leads to long and very expensive clinical trials." Our ruling Bachmann said that "scientists tell us that we could have a cure in 10 years for Alzheimer's" were it not for "overzealous regulators, excessive taxation and greedy litigators." The 10-year goal may or may not be plausible, but if it’s not, there’s wide agreement that the three factors Bachmann mentioned are not the primary obstacles. Instead, researchers pointed to stagnant funding and the fact that Alzheimer’s is a particularly tricky disease to research, given its slow and stealthy advances. If Bachmann was looking to score points about bureaucracy and taxation, she has made a particularly poor choice of case study. Bachmann has taken a popular theme and assigned it to a complicated health condition, simply to score political points. The experts say her claim is unfounded. We rate her claim Pants on Fire!

pomt-00555	"A black male baby born today, if we do not change the system, stands a one-in-three chance (of) ending up in jail."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/15/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-black-male-baby-born-today-has/	Several 2016 presidential candidates in both parties have discussed how the criminal justice system might be improved. The latest to address this issue was Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders during a June 11, 2015, interview on PBS. "A black male baby born today, if we do not change the system, stands a one-in-three chance (of) ending up in jail. This is (an) unspeakable tragedy." When we took a closer look, we found that the statistic may not be far off -- but it’s hard to know for sure, because the data Sanders relies on is so old. As with other dramatic talking points we’ve seen over the years, this one has been repeated and repeated over a decade and a half without being updated, despite evidence that the underlying trends have changed direction. The statistic dates back to a 2003 paper published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, a division of the U.S. Justice Department. The Bureau of Justice Statistics paper includes the line, "About 1 in 3 black males ... are expected to go to prison during their lifetime, if current incarceration rates remain unchanged." By contrast, the paper said, one of every six Hispanic males and one of every 17 white males can be expected to go to prison during their lifetime. (For this fact-check, we’ll ignore Sanders’ imprecise use of "jail," where people are held temporarily, rather than "prison," where inmates are typically serving substantial sentences.) Not only was this data published 12 years ago, but the paper is based on data from 2001 -- a full 14 years ago. Despite its age, the statistic has been cited repeatedly -- notably in 2013 with the publication of a report by the Sentencing Project, a group that advocates for prison reform and promotes alternatives to incarceration. That report’s claim -- that "if current trends continue, one of every three black American males born today can expect to go to prison in his lifetime" -- was footnoted to a 2011 paper by Marc Mauer, the Sentencing Project’s executive director. When we contacted Mauer, he said he doesn’t know of any updated research that would shed light on the percentage today. "It's a very complex analysis to produce, so that's at least part of the reason that it hasn't been replicated in recent years," Mauer said. We did, however, find reason to believe that the trend line that had been assumed in the 2003 paper has changed course. According to annual Justice Department reports, in 2001 there were 3,535 sentenced black male prisoners under state or federal jurisdiction for every 100,000 black male residents. By 2013, the equivalent number was 2,805. So black incarceration rates were 21 percent lower in 2013 than they were in 2001. That said, there’s little doubt that black men have disproportionately higher incarceration rates. For instance, a study published in the journal Crime & Delinquency found that nearly half of black males and almost 40 percent of white males in the United States have been arrested by the age of 23. But because of the complexities of modeling the statistics, Mauer said, it’s hard to know how much the decline in incarceration rates would specifically change the one-in-three statistic Sanders used. "We can't necessarily say that the one-in-three figure should be reduced by 21 percent, although if we did, it would bring it down to about 1 in 4, which is still quite dramatic," Mauer said. Our ruling Sanders said that "a black male baby born today, if we do not change the system, stands a one-in-three chance (of) ending up in jail." This calculation, while it’s the most recent one available, is 14 years old, and changes in the underlying data suggest that the actual odds of incarceration may be somewhat smaller today. Still, other evidence suggests that blacks have a disproportionate likelihood of ending up in prison. On balance we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-01883	Cranston's 2014-2015 "budget funds 100 percent of the local police and fire pension and other retiree benefit costs."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/jul/09/allan-fung/does-mayor-allan-fungs-budget-cranston-cover-all-r/	It wasn't that long ago that Cranston was facing an overwhelming bill for retirees and potential retirees, a crisis that prompted Mayor Allan Fung to seek concessions from the city's police and fire unions. The city was in trouble because, for years, its elected officials failed to invest enough money to cover the retirement benefits they were promising. So it caught our attention when Fung, who is running for governor as a Republican, sent out a letter with the city's new tax bills reporting that "Our budget funds 100 percent of the local police and fire pension and other retiree benefits costs." So is Cranston's pension problem fixed and up to speed? We decided to look at the numbers. Cranston actually has several pension plans. Police and fire workers hired over the past two decades, along with municipal employees, are covered by the state-run Municipal Employees' Retirement System. The state sets a percentage of payroll that municipalities in the MERS system must contribute to cover their costs. If the municipalities don’t pay up, the state withholds aid to make up the shortfall. For the current fiscal year, Cranston’s minimum was 13.69 percent of payroll; the city’s budget includes that amount -- about $4.8 million on the non-school side of the ledger. In other words, it’s paying 100 percent of the state-mandated MERS requirement. Then there’s the funding level, the percentage of what the plans need to meet their pension obligations. The city’s MERS plans are not funded exactly at 100 percent, but they're fairly close. According to the latest actuarial report, the city has 95.9 percent of the projected police retiree costs, 107.1 percent of the projected firefighter retiree costs, and 95.1 percent of all other municipal retiree costs. Any plan with a funded ratio below 80 percent is considered to be in trouble. However, the old police and fire pension programs, administered by the city, are a different story because, over the years, Cranston's elected officials neglected to put enough money into those programs to cover future retiree costs. Although they have been closed since 1995, the city would need an additional $231 million to fully fund them. (To put that amount in perspective, the city's entire budget for the current fiscal year is $262 million.) The old police pension is only 18.3 percent funded and the old fire pension program is just 24.1 percent funded, according to information from the city's latest actuarial report. They’re far from 100-percent funded. However, the city is now on a payment plan designed to wipe out that shortfall by 2042. (The date has been 2037, but a recent court settlement with the unions forced the date to be pushed back by five years.) Under that plan, the city should be paying $22,353,591 this year, according to the city's actuarial firm, Buck Consultants. Fung, in an email to PolitiFact Rhode Island, showed where the city's appropriation for this year will actually be $22,518 more than the recommended amount. To cover other benefits, primarily retiree health insurance, Buck recommended that the city budget $5.1 million. The city has set aside $4.6 million and plans to cover the remaining $500,000 by using about a third of its $1.6 million hospital stabilization account, which is savings accumulated because the city self-insures its workers. Fung, in an interview, said he didn't intend to leave the impression in his letter to taxpayers that the city had covered 100 percent of all its pension obligations. "If I had meant that, I would have said it was 100 percent fully funded, which is not true." Instead, he said his point was that, unlike in past years, the city is paying for 100 percent of its annual required contribution to solve its pension problems. We should note that Fung has not been shy about talking about the unfunded liability of the city's old pension systems, mentioning it in interviews and on other occasions. Our ruling Cranston Mayor Allan Fung said, "Our budget funds 100 percent of the local police and fire pension and other retiree benefit costs." The city is making the minimum required payments for retirement benefits through the state-run MERS system and to pay down this year's share of the bill for the huge long-term liability incurred by the city's older police and fire pension systems. But his statement could lead a reader to conclude that 100 percent of the city’s $231 million debt for the old plans is covered by this year's budget when, in fact, the only thing the city is paying in full is this year's installment on a plan that won't retire that debt for another 28 years. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-10794	"I cut taxes 23 times when I was mayor of New York City."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/09/rudy-giuliani/not-by-himself-he-didnt/	Rudy Giuliani has repeatedly said that he cut taxes 23 times while he was mayor of New York. He repeated the claim during a debate in Dearborn, Mich., on Oct. 9, 2007. The problem is, he was opposed to one of the tax cuts he lists, and several other cuts were championed by others or involved state funds — not city funds. The most glaring example is the expiration of the 12.5 percent personal income tax surcharge on New York City residents. Peter Vallone, then the city council speaker and a candidate for governor, championed letting the tax expire, while Giuliani opposed him. After about five months, the mayor and the city council came to a budget agreement, and Giuliani changed his mind and let the tax expire. Some New Yorkers have disputed whether the mayor may appropriately take credit for the STAR program, a property tax rebate that Gov. George Pataki initiated and paid for with state funds, according to an analysis of the cuts by the New York Daily News. The Annenberg Political FactCheck, a fact-checking Web site, looked at the "23 tax cuts" line when the campaign used the figure in a Giuliani radio ad. FactCheck concluded, based on information from New York City's Independent Budget Office, that eight of the tax cuts Giuliani boasts about actually should be credited to state government initiatives. In addition, FactCheck said he did not deserve credit for the personal income tax surcharge and that overall, he could rightly claim only 14 of the 23 tax cuts. The Giuliani campaign has argued that Giuliani deserves credit for any tax cuts under his watch. Giuliani made the case himself to a reporter in an exchange that was captured on video. In the video, Giuliani said he deserves credit for the tax cuts because he publicly argued for them and lobbied for them, and that he was the chief executive of the tax base that was affected. Still, we find it's a stretch for Giuliani to personally take credit for 23 when many of them were primarily pushed by others. So we find his claim to be Half True.

pomt-07289	"No other Northeastern state has passed a photo ID law"	true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/may/22/rhode-island-aclu/aclu-says-ri-would-be-lone-northeastern-state-adop/	Got ID? A bill before the General Assembly would require all voters in Rhode Island to show photo identification before casting a ballot. Sen. Harold Metts, D-Providence, and Secretary of State Ralph Mollis, who worked together to introduce the bill, say it would help prevent fraud and ensure the integrity of elections. Critics argue that fraud is rare and that obtaining a valid ID is an obstacle to voting for the poor, the elderly, people with disabilities and racial minorities. In opposing the bill, the Rhode Island Affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union stated in a news release, "No other Northeastern state has passed a photo ID law." Is Rhode Island truly alone among other states in the region? We elected to find out. Both the ACLU and the secretary of state’s office, who are on opposite sides of the issue, directed us to the bipartisan National Conference of State Legislatures. The first thing we learned is that nearly half of the states -- including Rhode Island -- only require voters to provide a signature at the polls. But that’s been changing rapidly. In 2000, just 15 states asked for ID, such as a birth certificate, Social Security card, photo ID or voter registration card. But today, the number has grown to 28. Another 13 state legislatures have taken up voter ID legislation this year, including 8 that are considering expanding their ID requirements to include photo identification. The laws "are becoming more prevalent and stricter," said Jennie Bowser, senior fellow at the National Conference of State Legislatures. "It has been slowly growing over the last decade. And there has been a big pickup in activity this year." Photo ID laws differ on what’s considered an acceptable form of ID and who is exempted from showing one. (Kansas, for example, exempts those whose religious belief prohibit photo identification.) Another variable is what happens when someone arrives at a poll without a photo ID. Florida’s canvassing board reviews whether the vote may be tallied. Hawaii asks voters without a photo ID to recite their address and date of birth. Several states accept a provisional ballot, but only count it when certain requirements are met. Georgia, for example, gives voters two days to present a valid ID. Idaho and Louisiana offer the option of submitting an affidavit, which if filled out falsely can result in criminal charges. Rhode Island’s proposed law (passed by the Senate, but held for more study in the House) would go into effect in stages. Beginning in 2012, voters would have to show a college ID, driver’s license, passport or other government issued card. IDs without a photo, such as a Social Security or Medicare card, would be accepted, but only until 2014. At that time, voters without a photo ID would have two choices. First, they would have to obtain, at no charge, a voter identification card from the state prior to going to a polling place. Second, they would have to go to their polling place and cast a provisional ballot that would have to be inspected by a review board before being counted. Now, returning to the ACLU’s claim, are there any states with photo ID laws in the Northeast? Since the ACLU didn’t say what it means by Northeast, we’ll use the U.S. Census Bureau definition: the six New England states plus New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The National Conference of State Legislatures reports that none of these states requires, or even requests, a photo ID. (In fact, only one Northeast state -- Connecticut -- requires any ID at all.) "As far as I know there is no Northeastern state that has photo ID as a requirement," agreed Sean Greene, manager of research for the Pew Center on the States, which tracks voter ID legislation. There are certainly states close to the Northeast with stricter rules. Delaware, Virginia and Ohio all require identification. Michigan and Indiana are among nine states nationwide that request or require photo IDs. "The majority of bills pending this year are photo [mandates]," said Bowser, of the National Conference of State Legislatures. Among them are two New England states, Maine and New Hampshire. Connecticut, too, has in the past considered photo identification, but has so far rejected the idea. In its attempt to portray Rhode Island as remarkably isolated on the issue, the ACLU has omitted some relevant facts: other states in the country are increasingly turning to photo ID laws; the majority of new bills under consideration across the country would require photo IDs; and two of Rhode Island’s neighbors in New England are considering such mandates. But the ACLU is factually correct when it states that no other state in the Northeast requires photo ID. That’s why our judges (whose IDs, incidentally, we did not request) voted to rate the ACLU claim True. (To comment or offer your own ruling, visit us on Facebook.)

pomt-02807	"Firearms homicides are down about 40 percent" since Texas passed concealed-gun permit law.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/nov/27/jerry-patterson/texas-firearm-homicide-rate-down-least-one-third-1/	An online campaign video from Texas Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson, one of the Republican hopefuls in the 2014 lieutenant governor race, touts his record on defending Second Amendment rights. "I stood alone in passing the Texas concealed-handgun law over the doomsday predictions of blood in the streets, ‘Wild Wild West’ and shootouts at every four-way stop," Patterson says, "and of course none of that happened. Matter of fact, firearms homicides are down about 40 percent." As a state senator from Pasadena, Patterson wrote the 1995 legislation that allowed eligible Texans to get licenses to carry concealed handguns, which was approved overwhelmingly after much debate by a Senate vote of 23-7 and a House vote of 101-46. In news stories from the 1995 regular legislative session, Austin Democratic Rep. Sherri Greenberg predicted gunplay in hospital emergency rooms and Dallas lawmakers said frustrated drivers would shoot each other in traffic. A March 16, 1995, Houston Chronicle news story quoted then-Sen. Greg Luna, D-San Antonio, as saying, "It is going to be a much more dangerous and deadly society we have imposed on ourselves in Texas." Did firearms murders subsequently decrease by 40 percent? By phone, Patterson told us he used national data on firearms homicides rates per 100,000 people since 1993 because he didn’t have state statistics. Nationwide figures were still relevant, he said, "because over the last 20 years, dozens of states have added concealed-handgun (licensing) laws that didn’t have them before." Patterson campaign spokesman Chris Elam emailed us web links to reports published in May 2013 from the Pew Research Center and the U.S. Bureau of Justics Statistics showing that in recent years, the rate of firearms homicides nationwide had fallen by 49 percent from a historic peak in 1993. But the Texas law took effect in 1996. Wouldn’t that year be the logical starting point for judging changes in deaths by firearms? Defending his claim, Patterson told us by phone that he used 1993 as a starting point because that was the year when lawmakers initially advanced his proposal, which Gov. Ann Richards vetoed. During this fact-check, he said, he "recognized the flaw in me saying 1993 when it actually didn’t come into effect until 1 January 1996, but I think the message," that murders did not spike, "is still accurate." Next, we looked for data on Texas gun murders since 1996. From the CDC, we found reports online covering 1996-2010, drawn from death certificate information reported by medical professionals and coroners, and we got 1996-2012 data from the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reports, most recently updated Sept. 16, 2013, with information on murders and other crimes known to law enforcement agencies. By the CDC tally, the rate of firearms homicides in Texas 1996-2010 fell 32.2 percent. Calculating with the FBI data for 1996-2012, the rate fell 42 percent. The U.S. and Texas declines in gun homicides are part of a larger trend -- U.S. violent crimes overall began falling significantly in the 1990s. Crime experts have advanced reasons including a decrease in crack cocaine use, economic factors, tougher police strategies and the aging of the baby-boom generation. Patterson said he does not claim that concealed-handgun laws reduce crime -- rather, he said, he is stating such statutes don’t increase crime, "in spite of the protestations to the contrary." Our ruling Patterson said firearms homicides decreased 40 percent since Texas passed a law permitting licensed residents to carry concealed guns. That claim was staked to changes nationally and a timeframe unreasonably starting before the law took effect. Still, Patterson’s figure is close to correct. Data for Texas show declines of either 32 percent or 42 percent since the state law took effect. We are not concluding that the measure authored by Patterson explains the decrease, which occurred nationally for multiple reasons. We rate this statement, which needed clarification, as Mostly True.

pomt-07443	If we had the same staffing ratio (of officers to residents) as Seattle, we'd have 300 more officers in our department."	true	/oregon/statements/2011/apr/21/michael-reese/chief-reese-says-if-portland-were-seattle-bureau-w/	Well, if you’re done comparing our farmers markets, bikeways and standards of living, Portland Police Chief Mike Reese has identified another battle in the ongoing Portland-Seattle War: The police-to-resident ratio. Yep. In a recent appearance at the City Club of Portland, Reese noted that if Portland "had the same staffing ratio as Seattle, we'd have 300 more officers in our department." Could we really be falling that far behind? Could our bike paths really be so superior or produce so much fresher but our police force so much smaller? Naturally, we had to know. We called up the Seattle Police Department and asked just how many officers our sister city to the north has. As of February 1, 2011, they had 1,338 sworn officers. That number includes everybody from patrol officers to detectives to assistant police chiefs. According to the 2010 census, the city of Seattle is home to some 608,660 residents. Divide the number of residents by the number of officers and you get about one officer for every 455 residents. To see how many officers Portland would need to have the same ratio you just need to take our population -- 583,776, according to the 2010 census -- and divide it by 455. Do that, and you get 1,283. So, how many officers does Portland actually have? Well, according to bureau spokesman Sgt. Pete Simpson, we have 981 sworn officers in all -- about 300 fewer than we’d need to hit Seattle’s ratio. Reese is right. We have about 25 percent fewer officers than we would need to match Seattle’s ratio. That percent difference holds up when you consider just the number of patrol officers, too. (Seattle has some 550 patrol officers -- one for every 1,106 residents -- to Portland’s 392 -- one for every 1,490 residents.) But before we pronounce this a case closed, let’s consider one other variable: The Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metro-area population is some 3,400,000* strong while the Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro metro-area population is roughly a third smaller at 2,200,000. The reason that has anything to do with Seattle police staffing is this: Seattle’s day-time population -- the number of folks coming in for work and entertainment -- gives the city’s population even more of an edge over Portland’s. Day-time population estimates for the 2010 Census haven’t been published just yet, but if we take a look back at the estimates from the 2000 Census they show Seattle’s population growing by more than 28 percent during the day, while Portland grew by 23 percent during the day. If we keep those ratios, Seattle’s population reaches 781,519 and Portland’s jumps to 718,097. Rerun the numbers and Seattle has one sworn officer for every 584 "day-time" residents. In order to match that ratio, Portland would need 1,229 officers. We’re 248 officers short this time around. We just can’t win. At least, as Reese noted during the same speech, our crime rate is down to levels not seen since 1967. Still, why are we lagging behind? Well, there are a number of variables here, but, perhaps most importantly, Seattle’s property-related revenue stream puts our own to shame. All told, Portland has an assessed property value of nearly $45 billion. (The actual market value for Portland is about double the assessed value according to the Tax Supervising and Conservation Commission, but Measure 5 and related laws keep the taxable value depressed.) Meanwhile, Seattle has an assessed property value of $123 billion -- nearly three times as much as we have to work with. Portland draws about 40 percent of its budget from property taxes. Whatever the case, it seems Reese is on to something here. If you take the population of each city, we’re short about 300 officers if we want to match Seattle’s resident-to-officer ratio. Even if you control for the number of people in the surrounding metro area, we seem to be lagging pretty considerably. We rate this claim True. *CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misstated the population of the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue metro-area population. The 2010 Census estimates the population to be more than 3,400,000.	None	Michael Reese	None	None	None	2011-04-21T06:00:00	2011-04-15	['None']

pomt-02331	"There are over 100 pipelines between the United States and Canada right now."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2014/mar/26/jeb-bush/while-talking-about-keystone-xl-pipeline-jeb-bush-/	Former Gov. Jeb Bush says the Keystone XL Pipeline is a "no-brainer." Bush took a question on the pipeline after a speech to the business and civic group Broward Workshop. AutoNation CEO Mike Jackson asked him this: "Just as a symbol -- as a symbol -- would you have approved something like the Keystone Pipeline or would you have studied it for eight years?" Bush responded: "I read something that was quite interesting. There are over 100 pipelines between the United States and Canada right now. Give me a break. What are we arguing about here?" We’re not going to weigh in on the pros and cons of expanding the pipeline but we can fact-check whether there are already 100 pipelines between the United States and Canada. Keystone Pipeline Keystone XL is a proposed pipeline that would carry 830,000 barrels per day of diluted oil sands from Western Canada to Nebraska and then to refineries on the Gulf Coast. Earlier in March, the U.S. State Department concluded the public comment period about the project. After six years of contentious debate between environmentalists and pipeline supporters, the decision now lies with President Barack Obama. We sent Bush’s claim to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which referred us to an October 2013 Congressional Research Service report. The report stated that CRS "has identified over 100 operating or proposed oil, natural gas, and electric transmission facilities crossing the U.S.-Mexico or U.S.-Canada border." A Bush spokesperson later referred us to this report as well. Bush had said there were over "100 pipelines between the United States and Canada right now," but the CRS report refers to operating and proposed facilities crossing the border with Canada or Mexico. With help from FERC and the Pipeline Safety Trust, a safety watchdog group, we counted the pipelines in the tables of the report and found 29 natural gas pipelines crossing the U.S.-Canada border and about 17 oil pipelines crossing the U.S.-Canada border. Philippe Reicher, a spokesman for the Canadian Energy Pipeline Association, told PolitiFact that the National Energy Board, which regulates pipelines crossing the border between Canada and the United States, has indicated that they have approximately 80 pipelines crossing the border. "That would include oil, gas, water, etc.," he wrote in an email. "In terms of large transmission pipeline systems similar to the proposed Keystone XL, we are probably looking between 18 and 22." Lorne Stockman, research director at Oil Change International, a group that opposes Keystone, pointed to a map from the Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers, which shows all the existing and proposed liquids pipelines crossing the border. "Some of these carry products rather than crude, and only a handful currently carry tar sands crude," Stockman told PolitiFact. "Looks quite busy on this map, but I think we can all agree that 100 is a little overstated." Our ruling Bush said, "There are over 100 pipelines between the United States and Canada right now." Bush has a point that there are a number of major oil and gas pipelines that already cross the U.S.-Canada border. But his number is significantly off. A 2013 Congressional Research Service report referred to 100 pipelines, but that included operating or proposed oil, natural gas, and electric transmission lines, and it counted pipelines crossing both the U.S.-Mexico border and the U.S.-Canada border. If we only count operating pipelines that cross the Canadian border, we count 29 natural gas pipelines and 17 oil pipelines, for a total of 46. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-02521	"Right now, we only keep 50 percent of Georgia Tech's graduates."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2014/feb/11/kasim-reed/mayor-working-keep-more-tech-grads/	Before Snowjam turned into a verbal snowball fight between Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed and some news outlets, Reed planned to spend most of his time Jan. 31 with the Atlanta Press Club talking about his initiatives for 2014. Reed did address some goals for the year, such as keeping more young, smart people in the city. One statistic the mayor cited about the percentage of Georgia Tech students who stay after graduation piqued our curiosity. "Right now, we only keep 50 percent of Georgia Tech’s graduates," Reed said. Is this correct? Carlos Campos, a spokesman for the mayor, said Reed based his comments on information from the 128-year-old college located in Midtown Atlanta. Campos specified that the mayor was referring to the percentage of Tech graduates who remain not just in Atlanta, but the entire state of Georgia. College graduates, statistics show, typically earn higher salaries, so elected officials want to keep them around. Reed told the audience he’s planning an effort to raise upward of $150 million to fund high-tech startup firms in the city. The mayor said those companies are needed to keep more college grads in Atlanta and away from Silicon Valley. Reed said he’s working with local business leaders on the retainment effort and set a long-term goal of keeping at least 75 percent of Tech graduates here. Reed is not the first person to raise concerns about a brain drain. Some Michigan educators and elected officials talked about the need to keep more college graduates in that state. A first-of-its-kind survey of all 2007 Michigan public university graduates, conducted by Michigan Future Inc., revealed that half of grads left the state within a year, The Detroit News reported. The percentage of Michigan State University graduates who left the state doubled between 2001 and 2009, from 24 percent to 49 percent, the newspaper reported, citing statistics from the school. Nationally, there’s little research on the topic. A 2007-08 federal survey found 69 percent of college graduates were living in the state where they earned their degree one year after graduation. Georgia Tech spokeswoman Laura Diamond gave us some data from surveys done in 2012 and 2013 about its graduates. Over those two years, 52 percent of Tech undergraduates remained in the state. The total increases to 55 percent once you include those who attended graduate school. The 2012 survey polled 2,619 students who were scheduled to graduate with bachelor’s or master’s degrees that year with questions about employment prospects and future plans. About 55 percent of the students completed the entire survey. Georgia Tech has about 21,500 undergraduate and graduate students. The report contains job placement rates and salary offers in 34 majors for bachelor’s students. Seventy percent of those graduates found jobs, and the median salary was just above $63,000 and a median bonus of $5,000. For graduate students, the job placement rate was nearly 72 percent, and the median salary was $78,000 with a median bonus of $10,000. Reed said in his remarks to the Atlanta Press Club that one-half of Georgia Tech graduates stay in Georgia. He based his statement on data from Georgia Tech. The school’s surveys are pretty close to the mayor’s statement. There’s not much data out there on this subject. Georgia Tech’s surveys showed the percentage of graduates who stayed in the state were slightly higher than what the mayor said at the luncheon. Still, Reed appears to be on the right track with his comments, based on the limited information available. Our rating: Mostly True.

pomt-08294	Says "Scott Walker wants to ban common forms of birth control, including the pill."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/01/tom-barrett/tom-barrett-says-scott-walker-wants-ban-pill-and-o/	Democrat Tom Barrett is using the last days of the Wisconsin governor’s race to paint Republican rival Scott Walker as a radical conservative, with abortion and women’s reproductive rights the centerpiece of his argument. Barrett first criticized Walker’s no-exceptions stance against legal abortions, a statement we rated True. In a new TV ad, Barrett repeats that claim and then adds this one: "It turns out there's a lot we didn't know about Scott Walker," a narrator says as an image of a birth-control pill case dominates the screen. "Scott Walker wants to ban common forms of birth control, including the pill." We rated as Barely True a claim by Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin that Walker "tried to pass a law to allow pharmacists to block women's access to birth control." That claim centered on a bill that would let pharmacists refuse to dispense contraceptives on moral grounds. Barrett’s new claim goes much further. An outright ban on birth control? As evidence, the Barrett campaign points to an endorsement Walker received by the group Pro-Life Wisconsin (running mate Rebecca Kleefisch was endorsed, too) and a questionnaire he filled out before receiving it. There was little surprise when Walker won the endorsement of Wisconsin Right to Life, the state’s largest anti-abortion group. But the smaller, more staunchly conservative Pro-Life Wisconsin says it has not endorsed a gubernatorial candidate for years. It insists that candidates, to get the endorsement, perfectly line up with its views as expressed on a survey. Walker campaign spokeswoman Jill Bader said the survey, which Walker scored 100 percent on, does not include any birth control questions. That’s not quite true. It includes one that asks the pharmacist question and one that asks if candidates would block minors from receiving taxpayer-funded contraceptives. Walker answered yes to both. Barrett’s campaign, though, points to the first question on the survey: "Would you sign legislation that declares that a preborn child has an inalienable right to life from the moment of fertilization forward?" Some background: The question refers to "personhood" rights, a growing national movement in some pro-life circles to use state laws or state constitutions to bestow full citizenship rights and protections to the unborn. Pro-Life Wisconsin and related groups in other states oppose all forms of artificial birth control, They hope that "personhood" rights will bring a ban on all abortions -- and a ban on the pill, the group’s legislative director Matt Sande told PolitiFact Wisconsin. Other anti-abortion groups have focused on a more direct route: The U.S. Supreme Court, which in 1973 held that a woman's decision to have an abortion is a private choice that is protected by the U.S. Constitution. That Roe vs. Wade decision still defines the issue. Pro-Life Wisconsin’s definition of pregnancy as starting at fertilization differs from the worldwide mainstream view that it begins when a fertilized egg implants in the uterus, said Raj Narayan, Medical College of Wisconsin physician and associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology. Birth control pills work, when used properly, by preventing ovulation, not by preventing implantation of a fertilized egg, he said. In theory, birth control pills could prevent implantation, but it is unprovable scientifically, Narayan said. In the view of Pro-Life Wisconsin, there are cases -- even if a very small percentage -- where a fertilized egg (already a full citizen, under the theoretical legislation) is prevented by the pill from attaching to the womb. That, they say, constitutes an abortion. In contrast, Wisconsin Right to Life views the idea that the pill causes abortions as "speculation," according to executive director Barbara Lyons. The view is disputed, too, by the mainstream medical community, as Narayan noted. What’s important for our evaluation, though, is the political realm. Did Walker know about -- and agree with -- the group’s views on birth control as causing abortion? For the 2010 election, candidates were given survey instructions and a memo entitled "Hormonal Birth Control and its Abortion Causing Effect," according to Sande. That memo clearly lays out the group’s view that "any artificial action that works to destroy a human embryo is abortifacient in nature." It lumps "most if not all birth control drugs and devices" into that category. Sande downplays the chances Pro-Life Wisconsin will succeed in its anti birth-control agenda because it believes society is not ready for it. But a birth control ban is the group’s aim. Its mechanism to get there is "personhood" legislation -- Question 1 on the candidate survey. Since 2006, the group has been laying the groundwork for its proposed constitutional amendment. Elsewhere, such efforts are further along. Colorado voters will consider a "personhood" amendment in the Nov. 2, 2010 election. We wanted to ask Walker to clarify his view on the topic. The campaign did not make him available. In an e-mail, Bader said: "Scott is pro-life. He believes that government has no role in whether adults choose to use birth control or not. This was Scott’s view of that question on the survey." She noted -- as do we -- no direct question on a birth control ban was asked. Barrett’s side countered that the implications of the question were made clear. Said spokesman Phil Walzak: "They want to currry favor and get that 100% rating, but when they are called on it they hedge." Where does the group asking the survey question come down? Sande, of Pro-Life Wisconsin, agreed Walker signed onto the concept based on his answer, but said he thought it would be unfair to draw the conclusion Walker supports a particular "personhood" initiative. After all, no proposed language was given. And the birth-control ban is not part of the group’s immediate legislative agenda. Now it’s our turn. The Barrett campaign makes a strong claim against Walker, saying he supports a ban on commonly used contraceptives. It bases its statement on a survey by Pro-Life Wisconsin that did not ask that question directly. Rather, Barrett -- and the group -- say it is embedded in a question about a potential legislation on "personhood," that is giving full human rights at the moment of fertilization. In viewing the pill as abortion, not just birth control, there is no question the group is out of step with medicine -- and the larger group, Wisconsin Right to Life. Barrett argues by supporting the question in the survey, a candidate signs on to this view as well. Walker’s campaign disputes this. Walker did, however, did get the group’s memo which clearly outlined its views and goals. Did he read it? He should have if he is answering the group’s questions. Ultimately, we don’t know -- and neither does the Barrett campaign, which leaves out important details in its hard-line statement. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-05254	Says Amanda Fritz "manages less than 5 percent of city operations."	true	/oregon/statements/2012/may/31/mary-nolan/how-much-city-government-does-amanda-fritz-manage-/	Amanda Fritz and Mary Nolan have another five months of campaigning to look forward to after neither was able to get 50 percent of the vote in the first round of elections earlier this month. That means we can probably expect more debates like the one that happened at the City Club of Portland in late March. Back then, Mary Nolan closed up the debate by going after Fritz one last time with a pretty damning summation of her four years as a council member: "By her own count, Amanda has initiated only 3 percent of City Council action items while she's been there. She manages less than 5 percent of city operations -- whether you measure it by number of employees or by operating budget." Both are interesting points. For now, we’re looking at how much of the city Fritz really manages. Five percent seemed low to us -- even with five council members divvying up the work. Under Portland’s form of government, the mayor assigns commissioners to manage certain offices and bureaus. There are about 20 larger offices and other smaller ones. Sometimes the assignments are a reflection of skill -- sometimes they’re a reflection of politics. Currently, Fritz oversees the Bureau of Emergency Communications, the Office of Healthy Working Rivers, the Office of Equity and Human Rights and the Office of Neighborhood Involvement. She also has a budget and employee count specific to her own office. When we checked the number of employees budgeted for those offices, we got a total of 208 full-time equivalent positions. The bulk of that comes from Emergency Communications, which has 145 spots. All told, the city of Portland has a little under 5,800 FTE positions. If you divide 208 by that, you get about 3.6 percent. Just to offer a little bit of perspective here, Mayor Sam Adams oversees about half the city’s employees. Randy Leonard, the mayor’s closest political ally, comes in second with about 23 percent, then there’s Nick Fish with about 9 percent and Dan Saltzman with 13 percent. When we looked at the budgets, we found much the same. For the current budget cycle, Fritz’s bureaus have a combined budget of just over $28 million. That’s 1 percent of all the cash that flows in and out of the city, which has a net budget of $2.8 billion. And it’s just over 1.6 percent of the $1.7 billion bureau expenditures. After we had all the numbers straightened out, we called Nolan’s campaign to make sure we were on the same page. We were. Our next call was to Amanda Fritz. "That's probably true -- I haven’t run the numbers myself," she said. But "the amount of work is not related to the number of employees or the budget of the bureau." She also pointed out that she previously oversaw the city’s Cable Communications and Franchise Office, which was the second highest revenue generator for the city during the recession. What’s more, Fritz has been in charge of creating two new offices (Equity and Health Working Rivers) -- something that she said is particularly time intensive. "Establishing a new bureau is a lot more difficult than taking over a bureau," she said. Finally, she noted that the office of Neighborhood Involvement may have just 39 budgeted positions, but it works with a network of thousands of volunteers. The context -- and the fact that assignments are ultimately up to the mayor -- may take some of the bite out of Nolan’s remark but it doesn’t make it wrong. The numbers back Nolan up; if you look at budgets or staffing, Fritz manages less than 5 percent of city operations. We rate this claim True.

On the news shows, medical experts stressed that the right of parents to choose whether their children vaccinate should not trump the risk that unvaccinated people pose to public health. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Tom Frieden said on ABC’s This Week that "study after study" has shown there are no long-term hazards with vaccines even though pockets of the population are unwilling to get them. ABC News’ chief health and medical editor Dr. Richard Besser lamented how there was once a time where the only children who wouldn’t get vaccinated had immunity issues. "It used to be that the only children at school who weren't vaccinated were those who had true medical contraindications. They may have an immune problem and couldn't get vaccinated," Besser said. "Now there are 19 states that allow personal belief exemptions. And I think that that is wrong." There are two parts to Besser’s statement worth considering. One is that 19 states permit parents to exempt their children from vaccinations because of their personal beliefs. The other is that there was a time when the only children who weren’t vaccinated had true medical conditions. The 19 states Documenting the state-by-state situation is a simple task, so we’ll handle that first. Information compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures, among other sources, backs up Besser’s point. While there are laws in every state that spell out vaccination requirements for children entering public school, it is easier to avoid them in some states over others. Every state except for Mississippi and West Virginia provides an exemption for religious reasons. Mississippi’s tough vaccination laws result in high immunization rates in its school children. And as Besser said, 19 states also have exemptions for philosophical, personal reasons. They are Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, Idaho, Louisiana, Maine, Michigan, Minnesota, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Washington and Wisconsin. Missouri also has an exemption that applies only to daycare, preschool and nursery school. Experts attribute the growth of personal belief exemption laws to pressure from anti-vaccine organizations on policymakers. They use as one benchmark the year 1998, when a study since condemned by peers and retracted by The Lancet, connected the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine with "leaky gut" and maybe autism. Another popular year is 1982, when NBC ran the story "Vaccine Roulette," which raised concern about the pertussis vaccine. Historian Elena Conis, author of Vaccine Nation, traces the origins of the movement back to the 1960s and '70s, at a time when people were arguing for tighter environmental regulations, additional women's rights and broader consumer protections. In California, a state well-known for its vaccine resistance, more than 17,200 children enrolled in kindergarten with exemptions from vaccinations based on either religious or personal reasons in the 2013-14 school year, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. (There is no difference in the CDC reporting for personal or religious reasons.) That was the most of any state by far. California lawmakers tried to tighten up the exemption for personal reasons in 2014 so that instead of just signing a piece of paper, they had to first show they met with a physician who described the risks of going without vaccinations. A Los Angeles Times analysis found an overall decline in the state’s rate of vaccine waivers, dropping from 3.1 percent in 2013 to 2.5 percent in 2014 -- the first drop in a dozen years. Data-crunching by the Washington Post found that the rate of parents applying for personal belief exemptions was strikingly high in Disneyland’s Orange County, the southern coast up to San Luis Obispo, and parts of the northern edge of the state. Vaccine opposition was lower in less-affluent parts of the state, Los Angeles, San Francisco and the Silicon Valley. "It used to be that the kids that were not vaccinated were from poor families," said Catherine Troisi, an infectious disease epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center. "Now we’re seeing the opposite. These are educated parents who are choosing not to vaccinate their kids." Looking back on vaccine exemptions So Besser’s correct on the number of states now offering personal exemptions. But his claim that that there was a time when the only children who weren’t vaccinated had true medical conditions doesn’t ring as true. The debate about the effectiveness and dangers of vaccination has been raging for at least 50 years. As part of that debate, there have always been exemptions beyond those for medical reasons. A 1969 report entitled "State laws on compulsory immunization in the United States," which is available through the U.S. National Library of Medicine, does an excellent job of laying out the issue. In 1969, author Charles L. Jackson reported that only 17 states required measles shots, for instance. And that in most every state, religious exemptions were written into the vaccination laws. Five states, Jackson said, went even further. Missouri, Rhode Island, Michigan, Ohio and Illinois had what Jackson called "voluntary compulsory vaccination." "Each state has provisions in the statute for exempting children if a parent objects in writing to such requirements for any reason," Jackson wrote. So 45 years ago, less than half the states required a measles vaccine, and only 26 states required any type of vaccine, according to Jackson. That changed, of course, over time, and more states began requiring measles vaccines. But they also included exemptions for religious reasons. What’s the net effect? Vaccinations increased dramatically in the 1970s as new laws came on the books. Joseph A. Califano, the United States Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare from 1977-79, helped lead a push that saw vaccination rates rise from 60 percent to over 90 percent. By the early 1980s, more than 95 percent of children were completely immunized by the time they entered school. That number has dipped slightly in recent years. According to the CDC, 92 percent of children 19-35 months old received the measles-mumps-rubella vaccine in 2013, the most recent year available and the highest percentage since 2008. Federal health officials were content with the national immunization levels but voiced concerns about late first doses, a rise in measles cases not seen since 2000, and slacking coverage in some states. We were not able to connect with Besser to explain his claim by our deadline. Our ruling Besser said, "It used to be that the only children at school who weren't vaccinated were those who had true medical" conditions, but "now there are 19 states that allow personal belief exemptions." Besser, a pediatrician, is right about the number of states that allow exemptions to state vaccination laws for personal beliefs. But his history lesson about vaccination laws of yesteryear is not as accurate. States have consistently provided religious exemptions alongside medical exemptions, and five predominantly Midwestern states allowed parents to seek exemptions for any reason even in the 1960s. His claim is partially accurate, so we rate the claim Half True. Clarification: This post has been updated to better reflect how Elena Conis said the modern anti-vaccine movement began.

pomt-12192	Republicans have " won a thousand seats since Obamacare."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jul/27/sean-duffy/duffy-track-claim-1000-seat-pickup-gop-obamacare/	In discussing Republican efforts to implement President Donald Trump’s agenda, U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy (R-WI) blamed the U.S. Senate’s filibuster rule for preventing Trump’s agenda from being passed into law. "Get rid of the filibuster rule’’ Duffy said July 17, 2017 on Fox News Channel’s "Fox & Friends" show. "(Then) you only need 51 votes." Then, the congressman went further: "We’ve won a thousand seats since Obamacare," he said. "The American people want us to accomplish this agenda, and we’re not getting it done because of stupid Senate rules." Duffy also made the 1,000-seat assertion during an appearance on "Varney & Co." the same day on the Fox Business Network. "We’ve won a historical election," Duffy said. "We have a thousand seats we’ve won since Obamacare." Has the GOP really picked up 1,000 seats since the Affordable Care Act was enacted in 2010? Digging into the numbers Let’s start at the state level, where most of the positions in question lie. According to Ballotpedia: The Encyclopedia of American Politics, the Republican Party held more seats in 82 of 99 state legislative chambers (82.3 percent) in January 2017 than it did in January 2009. The website says: "During President Barack Obama's two terms in office, Democrats experienced a net loss of 968 state legislative seats, the largest net loss of state legislative seats in this category since World War II. The second-largest loss occurred following Dwight D. Eisenhower’s two terms in office, when Republicans were handed a net loss of 843 state legislative seats." An accompanying chart lists the five largest losses in state legislative seats for Democrats during Obama’s two terms: Arkansas state Senate (18 seats), West Virginia state Senate (16 seats lost), Arkansas House of Representatives (46 seats), West Virginia House of Representatives (43 seats) and Oklahoma state Senate (16 seats.) There were other losses. According to an article on FoxNews.com, "Democratic U.S. Senate seats fell from 55 to 46. Their share of the House plummeted from 256 seats to 194. … Democratic governerships also became a rarity during this eight-year period, slipping from 28 to 16." After the election of Obama, there was much talk of a new era -- that a coalition of young, minority and female voters would usher in gains for the Democrats for decades. That did not happen. "The defeats have all but wiped out a generation of young Democrats, leaving the party with limited power in statehouses and a thin bench to challenge an ascendant GOP majority eager to undo many of the president’s policies," according to a Dec. 24, 2016 Associated Press article. "After this year’s elections, Democrats hold the governor’s office and both legislative chambers in just five coastal states: Oregon, California, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware," the article said. "Republicans have the trifecta in 25, giving them control of a broad swath of the middle of the country." Duffy’s communications director, Mark Bednar, pointed us to an article in the January/February 2017 edition of Politico magazine titled "Democrats in the Wilderness," which maintains Democrats are facing a crisis in coming years. The article, written by Edward-Isaac Dovere, says the party’s situation is "the result of years of complacency, ignoring the withering of the grass roots and the state parties, sitting by as Republicans racked up local win after local win." Matt Bennett, a co-founder and vice president of public affairs of the Third Way, an organization that describes itself as "a strategy center for progressives," confirmed the figure. "Yes, it’s true at the state legislative level," he said. "Dems have lost about 1,000 seats." While Duffy did not directly blame Obamacare for the loss of every seat, he presented it as the primary reason for the Republican gains and Democrat declines. But every race is different, and many other factors come into play -- from newly drawn districts to the performance by individual candidates and a host of issues. So, he oversteps a bit in framing it entirely around Obamacare. Our rating Duffy said "We’ve won a thousand seats since Obamacare." There are many reasons for the decline of Democrats beyond dissatisfaction with Obamacare, including frustration over Washington gridlock, voters’ fears over budget deficits, national security, immigration, tax reform, the global economy, wages and jobs. Therefore, Obamacare is not the sole reason for the GOP seat gains, but one of many. But the "thousand seats" figure Duffy cites is accurate. We rate Duffy’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-03994	Says Austin trains are "full" at rush hour and "packed" for special events.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/feb/08/lee-leffingwell/lee-leffingwell-says-austin-trains-are-full-rush-h/	Mayor Lee Leffingwell said he’s newly determined to place urban rail before Austin voters by the time his term ends in fall 2014. "We all know that people will ride rail," Leffingwell said in his State of the City speech Feb. 5, 2013. "Capital Metro’s Red Line trains are full not only during morning and evening rush hours but packed for big events like F1 and South By" (Southwest). The mayor and other Austin leaders support a transportation plan that includes an electric-powered urban rail project with an estimated price tag of $1.3 billion for the first 16 miles or so. Leffingwell campaigned in 2009 calling for a rail election in 2010 but pushed the vote to 2011, then 2012, before pulling his support for a November 2012 vote. Diesel-powered commuter trains operated by Capital Metro, the city’s transit agency, have run since 2010 on the Red Line that Leffingwell cited, which covers a 32-mile route between Leander and downtown Austin, with several stops along the way. And how full or packed are the trains these days? Overall, ridership has tripled since 2010, according to Austin American-Statesman coverage, particularly after the March 2012 addition of Friday night and Saturday trains. A Feb. 3, 2013, Statesman transportation column said that in its early months, the service had 800 to 900 boardings per day, which rose to 2,500 per day in October and November 2012. Usage spiked, the story said, during the music portion of the South by Southwest music, film and interactive conferences in March 2011 and 2012 and Austin’s first Formula 1 auto race, Nov. 17, 2012. Capital Metro spokeswoman Erica Macioge told us the mayor’s statement was correct and emailed us ridership data and charts for weekdays, SXSW and F1, plus a month-by-month overview illustrating ridership growth that showed sharp spikes for SXSW 2011 and 2012: Each train, Macioge said, has 108 seats; standing room brings capacity to 200. Capital Metro considers a train full if all seats are taken, she said. On March 17, 2012 -- the Saturday that fell during the music portion of SXSW -- Capital Metro provided 48 train runs, for a total seated capacity of 5,184. There were 7,316 boardings that day, Macioge said, giving an average of 152 people on each train trip. For Nov. 17, 2012 -- the day of the F1 race -- Capital Metro made 47 train runs, providing a total 5,076 seats. Boardings that day added up to 6,210, meaning each train carried on average 132 passengers. How about rush hour? And what is rush hour, anyway? The Texas Department of Transportation doesn’t have an official definition, spokeswoman Kelli Reyna told us by phone, but when planning and timing roadwork, it uses 7-9 a.m. and 4-6 p.m. as average guidelines for Austin. Monday through Friday, Macioge said, Capital Metro runs six trips south to downtown Austin in the morning and six trips north to Leander in the evening. The agency’s statistician, she said, suggested looking at October 2012 for a "typical" month, and supplied that data. Five of the six morning trips averaged more than 108 passengers; the last run averaged only 91. All but the first trip also either arrived or departed during rush hour; the earliest began and ended before 7 a.m. The five morning rush-hour trips averaged 155 passengers in October 2012 -- above the seating capacity of 108, edging toward the standing-room capacity of 200. Weekday evenings, five of Capital Metro’s six northbound train trips depart or arrive between 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. The first averaged 88 riders in October 2012, but the rest were all above the seating capacity. Average number of passengers: 155, just like the morning rush. (In a world filled with mismatched statistics, we were relieved to see Capital Metro evidently takes the same number of commuters home as the number that shipped out in the morning.) Our ruling Leffingwell said Capital Metro’s trains are "full" during rush hour and "packed" for events such as SXSW and the F1 race. Capital Metro considers a train full if all 108 seats are occupied, but would a typical commuter agree? After the seats are full, 92 additional passengers can ride standing up (and pay the same fares to do so). If you’re a rider who needs to get to work, there’s a big difference between a train you can board and a train that’s so packed you have to wait for the next one. At the peak of the special events Leffingwell named in 2012, about 48 more people could have ridden the average SXSW Saturday train and another 68 could have boarded an average F1 train. It’s a tighter squeeze at rush hour: With average ridership at 155, the trains tend to have all seats full and so many standing riders that only about 45 more can squish aboard. Seats might all be occupied, but there’s almost always still room on the trains for more passengers. We rate the mayor’s claim as Mostly True.

pomt-09045	"We’re No. 1 in child hunger."	true	/texas/statements/2010/jul/03/carol-morgan/morgan-says-were-no-1-child-hunger/	Carol Morgan, the Democrat facing Republican John Frullo for a Texas House seat representing Lubbock, says Texas often beats out other states, not always for the better. "We’re a state of contrasts right now," she said June 25 to the Non-Urban Caucus at the Texas Democratic Paty’s state convention. "We are (rated) No. 1 in business by every business magazine, and I (am) steadfastly committed to maintaining that. But you know, we’re No. 1 in child hunger." How Texas ranks, in categories great and not-so-great, is often campaign fuel. We’ve noted previously that Texas is No. 1 in wind power, and among the lowest-ranking states for high school graduation rates and mental health care. Texas has the nation’s top share of minimum-wage workers and is also home to the most Fortune 500 companies. Scoping Morgan’s statement, we came across a Republican rendition of the same concern. Texas Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples, urging mayors to participate in a summer program providing meals to needy children, said in June 2009: "Texas ranks first in the nation in children who are food insecure." According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, "food insecurity" means that at some point in a year, someone in a household went hungry because the household couldn’t afford food. JC Dwyer, state policy director for the Texas Food Bank Network, told us: "It doesn’t mean everyone’s going hungry every night. It doesn’t mean ‘starving.’" Morgan sent us a write-up on the website of KXAS, the NBC TV affiliate in Dallas-Fort Worth, which says "Texas leads the nation in child hunger." She also pointed us to the Texas Hunger Initiative website, which says "Texas has the highest food insecurity rate among children in the nation." The initiative, based at Baylor University, develops strategies to end hunger across the state. Neither of Morgan’s cited websites explains what it means to be No. 1 in child hunger. Dwyer pointed us to data on food insecurity collected by the federal government. Every year since 1995, the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey has collected data on food insecurity which the USDA uses to produce a report on its prevalence. The bureau estimates the rate of food insecurity in households by weighing responses to 18 questions including yes-no queries such as "In the last 12 months did you or other adults in your household ever not eat for a whole day because there wasn’t enough money for food?" Other questions require participants to say how true a statement is, such as "The children were not eating enough because we just couldn’t afford enough food." About 44,000 households answered the 2008 survey. The USDA Economic Research Service, which analyzes the responses and weights them appropriately to reach conclusions for each state and the nation, concluding that at some time that year 17.1 million — 14.6 percent — of U.S. households were food insecure. About 49 million people lived in food-insecure households, including 16.7 million children. Looking at combined census data from 2006 through 2008, USDA reported in November that the estimated rate of food insecurity ranged from 6.9 percent in North Dakota to 17.4 percent in Mississippi. Texas had the second-highest rate of food insecurity at 16.3 percent. But what about focusing on hungry children, as Morgan does? An earlier USDA report focused on food-insecure households where children were living. Looking at data from 2001 through 2007, the report found 21.5 percent of Texas households with children sustained food insecurity — placing the state first nationally. Neighboring New Mexico had the next most food-insecure households with children, at 21 percent, while New Hampshire had the lowest rate, with 10.1 percent of households with children facing hunger. In May 2009, Feeding America, a nonprofit national network of more than 200 food banks, had explored a related angle. The network, tapping data from the census bureau and USDA for 2005 through 2007, estimated the share of children facing hunger in each state. Its conclusion: 22.1 percent of Texas children lived in food-insecure households. The Texas rate was followed by that of Tennessee (20.5 percent), South Carolina and Arizona (20.2), and Missouri and Louisiana (20). The lowest rate? North Dakota at 10.9 percent. Texas did not have the greatest number of children facing hunger. California, the most populous state, had about 1.6 million food-insecure children. Texas had the second most with about 1.47 million. Since Morgan made her child-hunger claim, Feeding America has released a new study using census bureau and USDA data from 2006 through 2008. It found that Arkansas had the nation’s highest rate of children facing hunger, at 24.4 percent. Texas was a close second, with 24.3 percent of its children in food-insecure households. Our sense: It’s most reasonable to stack up the states based on their rates of children in hunger, rather than raw numbers. Based on its rate, Texas was No. 1 in child hunger from 2005 through 2007. It placed a close second to Arkansas in the latest study, but that wasn’t public when Morgan spoke. We rate her convention statement True.

pomt-05778	"Florida ranks 45th" in the nation for tuition.	true	/florida/statements/2012/feb/27/denise-grimsley/florida-ranks-45th-nation-tuition-costs-denise-gri/	After the budget committee in the Florida House recommended an 8 percent tuition increase last month, parents, students and politicians alike cried foul because the state university system has raised tuition for the past six years. Even Gov. Rick Scott, who signed a budget last year with a tuition increase with nary a peep, said, "I don't believe in tuition hikes." The problem with getting upset about those higher tuition bills, said House budget panel chair Rep. Denise Grimsley, R-Sebring, is that Floridians aren't really paying all that much for college as it is because Florida’s tuition rates are already among the lowest in the nation. "The cost of postsecondary education in Florida is almost the lowest in the nation at an average of $5,531 (Florida ranks 45th), which is 32 percent lower than the national average of $8,200," Grimsley told the Tampa Bay Times. "The increase is equal to $8.27 per credit hour, which equates to $248.10 for a full 30 credit hours per year. Allowing tuition increases helps keeps Florida nationally competitive." This oft-cited ranking of 45th is a very popular argument among proponents of the increase, in Tallahassee and across the state's 11 public universities. PolitiFact wondered, since this ranking is quoted so often, is it accurate? The source of the national rankings is the College Board’s 2011 Trends in College Pricing report. The annual report is produced by the nonprofit organization, which also owns the SAT, and is comprised of data from surveys of almost 4,000 postsecondary institutions nationwide and historical data from the National Center for Education Statistics and the U.S. Department of Education. In this case, we're talking about the average price paid by a full-time student for one year of undergraduate enrollment. (It does not include room and board.) For the 2011-12 academic year, this amounted to an average of $5,626, the survey says. This is an 11.8 percent increase from the previous year, when the average was $5,034. The discrepancy between Grimsley's numbers and the final reported $5,626 is a difference between weighted and unweighted data, said College Board analyst Jennifer Ma. The simple average across tuitions is $5,531, but the board uses a formula to create totals that better reflect full-time enrollment, she said. Last year, the Legislature increased tuition 8 percent, and the state university system followed up with another 7 percent hike under a program known as tuition differential. Universities are allowed to raise tuition beyond any legislative base tuition hike as long as the total increase does not exceed 15 percent each year. They’re allowed to keep going up until reaching the national average, which currently stands at $8,244. (Last year’s 15 percent increase differs from the 11.8 percent listed in the Trends in College Pricing report because the report includes fees as well as tuition.) As any parent with a checkbook can see, Florida's average tuition is cheaper than $8,244. It's also cheaper than the state with the highest average tuition in the country, an honor that belongs to New Hampshire, which stands at $13,507. The last school on the list is Wyoming, which charges an average of $4,125. In addition to Wyoming, the other states costing less than Florida are West Virginia, New Mexico, Alaska, Utah and Louisiana. If your eyes haven't glazed over from so many numbers, the important part is that of all 50 states and the District of Columbia, Florida does indeed rank 45th, although if we want to get technical, which PolitiFact always does, Florida is ranked 44th among the 50 states when you exclude D.C. (which comes in at No. 31 on the list with an even $7,000). In case you were wondering, the wide variance among state tuition costs comes down to taxpayer-funded support for postsecondary education. In states with very high average tuition, tax coffers contribute very little to public colleges and universities. Florida's tax contribution to tuition costs has dropped significantly in recent years; tuition used to pay about 25 percent of the cost of college, with state support picking up 75 percent of the bill. That ratio has moved closer to a 50-50 model. Ralph Wilcox, provost at the University of South Florida and chairman of the Council of Academic Vice Presidents for the state university system, prefers to compare Florida to other states with high-ranked public research universities recognized by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, using data from the U.S Department of Education. In that scenario, Florida ranks dead last for tuition costs. The average among those 40 states now tops $9,200. Grimsley's office defends continued increases in order to bring Florida schools in line with other research universities and to fund new initiatives. The rise in prices would also help schools recruit highly qualified faculty and researchers, she reasons. Our ruling For this fact-check, we're not looking at the case for or against college tuition increases. Instead, we wanted to see if Florida actually came in 45th in the nation for tuition costs, because we've heard that number cited so often. Using the most comprehensive survey of postsecondary education available, Florida does indeed rank 45th if you count the District of Columbia; otherwise, the state ranks 44th. The only states that have lower tuition than we do are West Virginia, New Mexico, Alaska, Utah, Louisiana and Wyoming. We rate this claim True.

pomt-06595	Says Texas’ unemployment rate has doubled on Rick Perry’s watch.	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/sep/23/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-spokesperson-says-texas-unemployment-d/	The Sept. 22, 2011, New York Times has Republican hopefuls Rick Perry and Mitt Romney trading jabs on their states’ unemployment histories with a Romney spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, saying Perry's "own state’s unemployment rate has doubled on his watch." By three measures, this Romney charge is on the mark. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Texas’ unemployment rate was 4.2 percent in December 2000, the month Perry became governor. It was 8.4 percent in July 2011 and 8.5 percent a month later. That August rate was the highest Texas rate since November 1986, when Texas hit its worst unemployment rate: 9.3 percent. Texas’ workforce also has increased steadily in recent decades; the state had 1.8 million more workers as of 2011 than it did in 2000. From another vantage point, some 434,000 workers were unemployed in 2000, 1.04 million in August 2011. That is, there was a 17.5 percent increase in the workforce in the decade-plus, but a 138.6 percent increase in the raw number of people without jobs. But Texas unemployment didn’t steadily increase in Perry’s first 10 years as governor. Based on the bureau’s figures, the state’s jobless rate from late 2000 through August 2011 hit lows in 2000-01 and again in 2007, before rapidly climbing through 2009. (Click here to view a chart of Texas’ jobless rate using bureau numbers from 2000 to 2011.) There was a big increase in national unemployment rates after 2007, too, as the economy worsened. A fall 2010 Dallas Federal Reserve Bank analysis said that Texas’ unemployment tracked the U.S. rate closely beginning in January 2007, though the state’s rate was lower by an average of 1 percentage point. Does that mean Perry drove, or substantially influenced, the Texas changes? We checked a similar statement last year. Examining a political action committee's claim that Perry "had overseen the highest Texas unemployment in 22 years," we said the 22-year claim was accurate, but Perry wasn’t personally to blame: Half True. Generally, experts agreed, governors have little to do with statewide job losses or gains that take place during their terms. Paul Brace, a political science professor at Rice University, said: "Overall unemployment wasn't (Perry's) fault, but our relatively good performance also has little to do with what he did." That made sense then — and it does now. Texas unemployment, lately at its highest level in more than two decades, doubled while Perry was governor, as Romney says. But it’s wrong to conclude this was Perry’s fault, as the Romney camp does in saying "on his watch." We rate the statement as Half True.

pomt-13911	"You can’t get on an airplane, but more than 2,000 people on that list have been able to buy a gun."	mostly false	/california/statements/2016/jun/24/john-garamendi/gun-claim-california-congressman-doesnt-fly/	During the chaos of a sit-in protest by Democrats on the House floor this week, California Rep. John Garamendi, D-Fairfield, delivered an impassioned, unscripted plea to tighten America’s gun laws. The rare and sometimes raucous demonstration came in the wake of the deadly Orlando nightclub shooting. Garamendi urged a vote on the proposed ‘No fly, no buy’ legislation to ban individuals on the FBI’s "no fly" list from legally purchasing guns. That list is a subset of the FBI’s much larger terrorist watch list. Estimates place about 10,000 Americans on the terrorist watch list and a small fraction on the no fly list. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of individuals from other countries are estimated to be on the comprehensive list. During his speech, Garamendi made a claim about people tied to terrorism buying guns in the U.S. "You can’t get on an airplane, but more than 2,000 people on that list have been able to buy a gun. This is not only crazy; it is downright dangerous," Garamendi told his colleagues on June 22, 2016. Rep. Garamendi makes the claim we fact-checked at the 4:10 minute mark in this video. With his airplane reference, Garamendi appears to be referring to the no fly list. We decided to check whether 2,000 people on that smaller tally have successfully purchased guns in the U.S. Sorting out the facts A U.S. Government Accountability Office analysis of FBI data shows nearly 2,500 successful applications for firearms by individuals on the terrorist watch list over the past decade. Garamendi’s spokesman pointed us to this GAO analysis. We fact-checked a similar statement in December by California Rep. Mike Thompson, D-St. Helena. After the San Bernardino shooting, he said, "Since 2004, more than 2,000 suspected terrorists have legally purchased weapons in the United States." We rated Thompson’s claim Mostly True, relying on a similar GAO analysis. We noted, however, that an audit showed many people still on the list are no longer suspected of having ties to terrorism, bringing into question the term "suspected terrorists." The GAO analysis does not say how many people on the smaller no fly list applied for firearms. The office has said in the past it was not able to share that information because the Transportation Security Administration "considers the no-fly list numbers sensitive information," according to a December fact check by the Washington Post. It’s safe to assume, however, that there have been far fewer guns purchased by people on the smaller no fly list than the larger one. We asked Garamendi’s spokesman to further clarify the congressman’s comments, but we have not yet heard back. Our ruling Rep. John Garamendi said this week "You can’t get on an airplane, but more than 2,000 people on that list have been able to buy a gun." He appears to be talking about the TSA’s ‘no fly’ list. Garamendi connected the right number with the wrong register. His claim has a wisp of truth in that people on the larger terrorist watch list, including the much smaller no fly list, have made more than 2,000 successful firearm purchases over the past decade. But it strains reason, and seems mathematically impossible, that most of those purchases came from people on the no fly list. We rate Garamendi’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-12777	"The sanctions that we put on (Russia) for the Crimea annexation and meddling in Ukraine ... have absolutely crushed the ruble by 50 percent. And GDP from 2014 to 2016 is 50 percent down in Russia, as well."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2017/feb/21/anthony-tata/how-have-sanctions-impacted-russias-economy/	Since President Donald Trump took office, the Russian military has patrolled the U.S. East Coast with a spy ship, buzzed an American warship with a fighter jet in the Black Sea, and defied an arms control treaty by deploying a new cruise missile. These sorts of military exercises aren’t far out of the ordinary, but they have drawn more attention than usual amid heightened concern about Trump’s ties to Russia. Russian President Vladimir Putin is testing Trump’s response, just as any country would when its adversary gets a new leader, said CNN national security commentator Anthony Tata, a former Army brigadier general and novelist. Another explanation, Tata said, is Putin is trying to divert attention from Russia’s struggling economy. "Putin is our enemy, there’s no question about that, and his country is imploding," Tata said on CNN Feb. 19. "The sanctions that we put on them for the Crimea annexation and meddling in Ukraine, so they could get more natural resources down there … have absolutely crushed the ruble by 50 percent. And GDP from 2014 to 2016 is 50 percent down in Russia, as well." Speculation abounds regarding whether Trump might roll back sanctions against Russia or soften the U.S. position on Russia’s intervention in Ukraine, so we were curious about Tata’s claim that the sanctions have damaged the Russian economy. Tata has the general trend right — Russia’s economy is struggling, no question — but his numbers are slightly off. Additionally, experts said sanctions may have impacted the Russian economy, but not nearly as much as the drop in oil prices worldwide. Numbers are close Tata claims 50 percent drops for both Russia’s currency and gross domestic product since 2014, when Russia annexed Crimea, a region of Ukraine. Former President Barack Obama's administration first launched sanctions against Russia in response in March 2014. The European Union soon followed with its own sanctions. Separately, Obama imposed additional sanctions in late 2016, after U.S. intelligence agencies determined Russian actors interfered in the U.S. presidential election. Starting with Russia’s currency, the ruble has lost significant value since the 2014 sanctions were put in place. In February 2014, one ruble was worth about 2.8 cents. Then the value dropped steeply over the next couple years, reaching a low point of about 1.2 cents per ruble in January 2016. That’s an approximately 57 percent drop. However, despite the fact that the sanctions remain in place, the ruble has steadily creeped up over the past year, reaching a value of 1.7 cents per ruble as of Feb. 21, 2017. That’s about 40 percent less than the value before the sanctions went into effect. Russia’s GDP has also fallen over the past couple years. Tata specifically mentioned 2014-16. Russia’s GDP was $2.053 trillion (in U.S. dollars) in 2014, according to the World Bank, dropping to $1.331 trillion in 2015 — a drop of about 35 percent. Adjusted for inflation, however, the drop was more like 3.7 percent because of the struggling ruble. Russia’s 2016 GDP is not yet available, but the Russian government has reported very little change from 2015. Effect of the sanctions The U.S. sanctions against Russia targeted specific individuals, firms and sectors close to Putin. For example, they froze U.S.-held assets that belong to some major Russian companies and banks. Experts had mixed opinions about the extent of the sanctions’ impact on Russia’s economy compared with other factors, notably falling oil prices. Declining oil prices worldwide since 2012 are the primary reason for Russia’s economic woes given the country’s dependence on oil revenue and exports, said Susanne Wengle, a University of Notre Dame professor who studies Russia’s political economy. The Russian government’s revenue is tied to oil prices, so a struggling oil industry significantly affects both the private and public sector, Wengle said. In its long-term budget projections, Russia assumed oil prices above $100 per barrel, but in 2016, prices sometimes dropped below $30. If the sanctions weren’t in place, "the Russian economy would likely have struggled just as much," she said. Beyond oil, Russia strained its budget by intervening in Crimea and depleting its reserves during the global financial crisis in 2008-09, said Sarah Wilson Sokhey, a University of Colorado, Boulder, professor who studies Russian politics and its economy. Although Sokhey doesn’t think the sanctions have had a huge impact on the economy as a whole, she said certain individuals who do international business or who import certain products, especially foods, have taken a hit. For example, Russia banned importing European cheeses as a counter-sanction, so local cheesemakers had to make their own brie instead of getting it from France. "It’s not a trivial thing," Sokhey said of the sanctions. "The Russian government would like to get rid of them, but it’s not something that is seriously hurting them or leading to widespread discontent." Mitchell Orenstein, a University of Pennsylvania professor and expert on the political economy in Eastern Europe, said he believes sanctions have significantly impacted the Russian economy by massively limiting foreign investment in Russia. The sanctions exacerbate the oil crisis by limiting Russian access to technology and capital. "Sanctions are certainly a big part of the economic decline in Russia, which explains why President Putin has made it such a high priority to get rid of sanctions," Orenstein said. "It makes it much less attractive for companies to do business in or with Russia." The International Monetary Fund has said international sanctions and the oil price drop were "dual shocks" to the Russian economy. The organization estimated that all sanctions against Russia for its activity in Ukraine, as well as Russia’s own counter-sanctions, could reduce inflation-adjusted GDP by up to 1.5 percent. For a more thorough rundown of economic analyses regarding the impact of sanctions on Russia, see this Feb. 17, 2017, report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. In an email, Tata told PolitiFact that he did not mean sanctions are the only cause of Russia’s economic problems. Rather, he was making a broader point that Putin is trying to shift eyes away from his country’s economic issues. "Of course, there are other factors, but Putin despises the West in part because of the sanctions," he said. Our ruling Tata said, "The sanctions that we put on (Russia) for the Crimea annexation and meddling in Ukraine ... have absolutely crushed the ruble by 50 percent. And GDP from 2014 to 2016 is 50 percent down in Russia, as well." Russia’s ruble fell more than 50 percent in the year following the start of sanctions in 2014, but it started to regain value in 2016. There are no GDP figures yet for Russia in 2016, but from 2014 to 2015, it fell by about 35 percent. It seems a drop in oil prices are the main driver of Russia’s problems. But sanctions play at least some role — though it’s hard to evaluate exactly how much given the country’s oil crisis. Tata is right that Russia’s economy has struggled in recent years, though his numbers are a little off. More critically, sanctions are only part of the reason for Russia's economic troubles.

pomt-02494	"The Republican leadership in the House has refused to address the issues that matter the most to Rhode Island, such as passing a jobs bill."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2014/feb/16/jonathan-boucher/top-rhode-island-democrat-says-republicans-us-hous/	In this era of high unemployment, it's always about jobs. The issue came up again Jan. 31 when Jonathan Boucher, executive director of the Rhode Island Democratic Party, published a commentary in The Providence Journal attacking the argument by Republican Ian Prior that the state needs Republicans in its congressional delegation, now all Democratic. Boucher argued that the idea of "replacing our delegation with a bunch of Republican freshmen," which wasn't exactly Prior's argument, "is completely absurd." "The House Republicans’ failure and inability to govern caused the first government shutdown in 16 years. The Republican leadership in the House has refused to address the issues that matter the most to Rhode Island, such as passing a jobs bill, extending unemployment benefits, raising the minimum wage, and passing comprehensive immigration reform." In that list of alleged GOP failures, one stood out to a reader, who emailed us a list of jobs bills that, he said, the Republican-controlled House has, in fact, passed. We were intrigued and decided to see whether Boucher's jobs claim was correct. The list has lots of bills with the word "jobs" in the title, but that doesn't mean the proposals would actually create jobs. In addition, Republicans and Democrats tend to have different views on what constitutes a "jobs bill." For Democrats, that can mean legislation expanding or creating a government training program. For Republicans, that can mean bills shrinking government or eliminating regulations to help businesses. We decided to use a technique employed by PolitiFact National when it looked at a claim made on Facebook in 2011 that congressional Republicans have introduced dozens of bills on social issues and other topics, but "zero on job creation," a claim that earned a Pants on Fire. We went to Congress.gov, run by the Library of Congress. It lists the topics that a bill covers. We looked for topics related to employment and job creation. It's not a perfect gauge, but it's a nonpartisan guide. We also reviewed summaries of the bills and committee reports looking for references to jobs and employment. For example, the SKILLS Act (H.R. 803), intended to streamline work-force development programs, touches on 52 topics from "tobacco use" to "sex offenses." But it also has provisions that deal with "labor and employment," "unemployment," "temporary and part-time employment," "vocational education" and "youth employment and child labor." It passed the House on March 15, 2013. The "Veterans Economic Opportunity Act of 2013" (H.R. 2481) deals with veterans education, employment and rehabilitation. It passed the House on a voice vote on Oct. 28, 2013. And the "Global Investment in American Jobs Act of 2013" (H.R. 2052) is intended to get the feds to come up with a plan for increasing "U.S. global competitiveness without weakening labor, consumer, financial, or environmental protections." It passed the House in a bipartisan vote on Sept. 9, 2013. Some jobs bills were designed to create jobs by encouraging more energy production and distribution, such as proposals to expand offshore oil drilling or push the controversial Keystone XL pipeline, which gives some environmentalists heartburn. Others on the list from our GOP reader seemed to have little to do with directly promoting employment, and Congress.gov doesn't list them in any employment-related categories. When we emailed the list of "jobs" legislation to Boucher, he took issue with some of the bills, saying they weren’t really about jobs. Boucher also argued that his statement is true because none of the Republican jobs-related legislation had been enacted. "When I wrote 'passing a jobs bill,' I was clearly referring to a bill that has passed into law," he said in an email statement. "A bill can’t create a single job if it’s not actually passed into law." But that's not what he said in his commentary. He said, "The Republican leadership in the House has refused to address the issues that matter the most to Rhode Island, such as passing a jobs bill." The House, regardless of which party is in control, cannot unilaterally enact laws. Approval by the Senate and (in most cases) the president are also required. The bottom line: The House, under the current Republican leadership, has passed bills with the goal of encouraging employment. Whether one thinks that the bills will do more harm than good is a matter for debate, and beyond the scope of this fact check. Boucher's statement is wrong, enough for a ruling of False. But because he's making a ridiculous defense to justify it, we rate it Pants on Fire! (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, email us at politifact@providencejournal.com.

pomt-10663	"I saw my father march with Martin Luther King."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/28/mitt-romney/george-romney-and-mlk-marched-but-not-together/	Mitt Romney has said several times that he saw his father George Romney march with the civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. But the Romney campaign was forced to admit recently that Romney meant "saw" in the figurative sense after the Boston Phoenix , a weekly newspaper, looked into the claim. Romney said it was a figure of speech and that he meant he was aware of his father marching with King. (For the curious, the Merriam-Webster Collegiate dictionary also defines "see" as "to form a mental picture of," "to perceive the meaning or importance of," and "to be aware of.") Three newspapers have tried and failed to find evidence of the two men marching together. The Boston Phoenix first checked Romney's statement and concluded it was false. Subsequent examinations by the Detroit Free Press and the Boston Globe found no news stories linking the two men to the same event. We at Politifact.com reviewed the New York Times archives and found several mentions of Romney's support for King and several articles discussing marches that each participated in separately, but never a mention of the two marching together. The elder Romney was then the Republican governor of Michigan, which has a significant African-American population. King, of course, was the most celebrated civil rights leader of his day. It seems unlikely that the Times would have missed covering a march where the two appeared together. The Globe interviewed Susan Englander, associate director of the Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University, who said, "I researched this question, and indeed it is untrue that George Romney marched with Martin Luther King." We spoke with Englander on Dec. 28, 2007, and she said she stood by that statement and does not expect evidence to turn up to contradict it. The Romney campaign has pointed to a line in a history book ("The Republican Establishment: The Present And Future Of The G.O.P., 1967," by Stephen Hess and David Broder, p. 107) that says the elder Romney and King marched in Grosse Pointe. Two witnesses also told Politico, a political news web site, that they remembered the men marching together almost 45 years ago in Grosse Pointe. But newspaper accounts from the time and historians contradict these assertions. There is no other support for the contention that the men were in Grosse Pointe together. But it's also clear that George Romney, who served as governor from 1963 to 1969 and died in 1995, supported King's goals at a time when few politicians did. When King visited Detroit and led a rally of 125,000 people in 1963, Romney issued a proclamation and sent personal representatives. (The Times report noted that Romney was Mormon and did not make public appearances on Sundays.) Two years later, Romney led a march of 10,000 people in Detroit to protest events in Selma, Ala. (King wasn't there.) When King died in 1968, George Romney attended the funeral. "Romney, as a member of the liberal wing of the Republican party, was stalwart civil rights supporter," Englander said. "He consistently supported integration." Given the elder Romney's notable support for King's politics, we can understand how people might believe, many years later, that they did march together. And it's arguably a minor point: You could call it a coincidence of history that they never attended the same event at the same time. Mitt Romney, who would have been 16 in 1963, said recently, "I think the thing that's relevant is that my dad was a champion in the civil rights movement, that he aligned himself with Martin Luther King." That part is true. Nevertheless, Mitt Romney's statement that he saw his father march with Martin Luther King remains problematic at best. If he'd stopped at saying his father was a champion of the civil rights movement, he would have been on solid ground. Balancing the lack of evidence that the two men marched together against the elder Romney's well-documented support of Martin Luther King, we rate Romney's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-03109	"Every engine manufacturer in the United States is now in the state of Texas."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/20/rick-perry/rick-perry-every-engine-maker-texas/	At a time when everyone wishes the country were producing jobs faster than it has been, Texas Gov. Rick Perry is happy to talk about the track record in his state. "Thirty percent of all the jobs created in America were created in the state of Texas in the last ten years," Perry said on CNN’s Crossfire. Perry listed some of the firms located in Texas. "Companies like Facebook, eBay, Apple -- which is soon to be one of the largest employers in the city of Austin -- Caterpillar," Perry said. "Every engine manufacturer in the United States is now in the state of Texas." That last part caught our ear. They say that everything is bigger in Texas, and the claim that every engine maker in the country now has an operation there seemed worth checking. We called Perry’s office for the evidence behind that statement, and they said he was referring only to Caterpillar. In 2008, the heavy equipment manufacturer announced plans to consolidate the engine work it had been doing in Illinois and South Carolina to a facility in Seguin, Texas. However, Perry's comments on Crossfire were about every engine maker in the country. The Texas Department of Economic Development and Tourism produced a report on the automotive industry in the state. From that we counted three engine makers, Caterpillar, AER Manufacturing, and Toshiba. A fourth one, Hilite, makes engine components in Carrollton, Texas. The U.S. Census Bureau has a survey of County Business Patterns for 2011 that includes tallies of the number of corporations in various industry categories. There are three industry codes that apply to the manufacture of engines for gasoline, diesel and aircraft engines. These codes cover the manufacture of engine parts and engines as a whole, so using them is a bit imprecise. Still, for firms with 20 or more employees, we found 386 nationwide. The figure for Texas is 17. That strongly suggests that there are many more engine makers in the country than there are in Texas. We also looked at firms that belong to the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association and looked at where some of the larger companies had operations. Briggs and Stratton is a top engine maker with plants in Wisconsin, Missouri, Alabama, Georgia and Kentucky. But none in Texas. The story for John Deere is similar. John Deere makes its engines in Waterloo, Iowa. As far as Texas goes, it has a parts distribution center in Dallas. We did find that General Motors has a large presence in Arlington, Texas, although that is an assembly plant where parts made someplace else are put together. General Motors builds its engines in many states including Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee. But not Texas. The jet engine company Pratt and Whitney has several facilities in Texas thanks to its work with military aircraft and the Air Force base in San Antonio, but those plants focus on maintenance and repair, not manufacturing. For engine assembly, Pratt and Whitney has plants in West Virginia and several locations in Canada. Our ruling Perry said every engine manufacturer is now in the state of Texas. Using a broad definition from the Census Bureau, we counted 17 firms in Texas that are involved with building engines. However, in that broad line of work , the total number of firms nationwide is well over 350. A sampling of some of the larger engine makers in the United States revealed some notable absences from Texas. We rate the statement False.

pomt-00352	Says a Josh Hawley lawsuit "would take away important prescription drug coverage for seniors through Medicare and end all of the consumer protections under the ACA."	true	/missouri/statements/2018/sep/13/claire-mccaskill/mccaskills-right-hawleys-lawsuit-would-end-afforda/	A major talking point in Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill's re-election campaign has been a pending lawsuit by her opponent, state Attorney General Josh Hawley, to repeal parts of former President Barack Obama's health care law — the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. "Josh Hawley decided to use your taxpayer dollars to file a lawsuit that would take away important prescription drug coverage for seniors through Medicare and end all of the consumer protections under the ACA," she wrote in an op-edfor the Springfield News-Leader on Aug. 23. We're wary of words so absolute as "all." We wanted to know whether McCaskill was overstating the effects of Hawley's lawsuit. Hawley's lawsuit A 2012 lawsuit to repeal the health care act failed at the Supreme Court because the law had a tax included in its pre-existing conditions mandate as a penalty for not maintaining health coverage. The Supreme Court found that Congress had the power to tax given to them under the Constitution. With the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, passed in 2017, Congress left the mandate in place but reduced the tax to zero. The lawsuit Hawley signed on to, alongside 17 other Republican attorneys general and two GOP governors, argues that "once the heart of the ACA — the individual mandate — is declared unconstitutional, the remainder of the ACA must also fall," and asks a judge to order an injunction on all Affordable Care Act activity, essentially repealing the entire thing. The results depend on whether the states in the lawsuit can prove that the mandate is unconstitutional and that the rest of the health care law is so tied up with the mandate that it should go, too. If the lawsuit can prove either or both, insurance companies can go back to pre-Affordable Care Act standards of determining health coverage with pre-existing conditions. Pre-existing conditions "Sen. McCaskill is correct," said Nicholas Bagley, law professor at the University of Michigan Law School. "The states that brought the Texas lawsuit have asked the court to invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act — lock, stock and barrel." No consumer protections in the individual health market stipulated under the act would remain because the whole law would be gone. However, consumer protections listed under Medicare and Medicaid would still exist as they are social insurance programs, which means federal or state governments are required by law to guarantee health care to those who fit certain requirements such as old age, unemployment or disabilities. As consumers, those who qualify can't be denied service or have their eligibility or benefits restricted unless Congress were to pass new legislation redefining what is considered a medical necessity. Drug coverage for the elderly Before the health care act, many Medicare recipients dealt with a "doughnut hole" in their drug coverage. This meant that once a person's spending reached a certain amount, a coverage gap began where they were responsible for 100 percent of the cost for future drugs. The act shrunk that percentage. For example, in 2018, if someone spent over $3,750 on prescription drugs, he or she would then pay up to 35 percent for covered prescriptions. Starting in 2019, Medicare enrollees will pay just 25 percent of the cost for name-brand prescriptions after reaching the coverage gap. The senior prescription drug coverage would not be completely repealed with the health care act, as it was the result of former President George W. Bush's Medicare Modernization Act in 2003. Only the monetary limit some Medicare recipients experience could widen. Our ruling McCaskill said that Josh Hawley's lawsuit "would take away important prescription drug coverage for seniors through Medicare and end all of the consumer protections under the ACA." McCaskill's claims about the lawsuit have a ring of truth — Hawley's lawsuit would repeal the entire health care act and hence all of its consumer protections, including those for the doughnut hole. The Republican Congress has not passed any substitute health care plan to replace the act, so it is unclear if Hawley and his fellow Republican attorneys general would have a new system in place with consumer protections like those under the Affordable Care Act. We rate McCaskill's claims True.	None	Claire McCaskill	None	None	None	2018-09-13T12:41:15	2018-08-23	['Medicare_(United_States)']
pomt-10309	"We could save all the oil that they're talking about getting off drilling, if everybody was just inflating their tires and getting regular tune-ups."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/05/barack-obama/not-overinflated-though-it-sounds-like-it/	UPDATED. This item has been updated, but our ruling didn't change. See below. Sen. Barack Obama injected a startling claim into the debate on energy, asserting in a Missouri town hall meeting that the country could save more gas from inflating its tires and tuning up its cars than would be gained from drilling more off its coasts. "There are things that you can do individually, though, to save energy," Obama said in the July 30, 2008, appearance. "Making sure your tires are properly inflated — simple thing. But we could save all the oil that they're talking about getting off drilling, if everybody was just inflating their tires, and getting regular tune-ups. You could actually save just as much." Sen. John McCain and his allies — who advocate lifting the federal moratorium that bans drilling in some areas of the Outer Continental Shelf off the U.S. coasts — immediately mocked Obama for the claim. The McCain campaign even offered to send "Obama Energy Plan" tire gauges to anyone who sent in a donation of $25 or more. The McCain campaign's assumption seemed to be that Obama's claim was utterly implausible. And, we admit, it kind of sounds that way. But is it? Under-inflated tires — to say nothing of poorly tuned cars — are actually a serious problem, as government agencies, industry groups, conservationists and outside experts have been saying for years. (The Obama campaign even cited a number of instances when prominent McCain supporters echoed the call for more public awareness about tire inflation.) "A lot of people are driving around on severely under-inflated tires," said Robert Sinclair, Jr., a spokesman for the American Automobile Association. "Try riding a bicycle with under-inflated tires. It's hard for the human engine to push it ahead. Pump it up, it seems like you're gliding on air." The same thing happens with a car. Under-inflated tires can lower gas mileage by .4 percent for every 1 pounds-per-square-inch drop in tire pressure, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. The best estimate available, by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, is that at least a quarter of drivers are cruising around on under-inflated tires. In April, the Rubber Manufacturers Association, the Auto Club, the California Highway Patrol and Yokohama Tire Company used those statistics, along with Department of Transportation and Automobile Association of America data, to extrapolate that 2.8-billion gallons of gas are lost every year due to under-inflation of tires. That's an estimate, to be sure, and not one from a published, peer-reviewed study. But remember, Obama said we "could" save all the oil available from offshore drilling in the protected areas — not we "would" — so if the claim is merely plausible he's on solid ground. So how much oil is available offshore? According to the latest assessment from the Minerals Management Service, the mean estimate of undiscovered technically recoverable crude oil in the Outer Continental Shelf areas that are currently under moratorium is about 18-billion barrels (see here .) But it couldn't all be extracted immediately. The agency estimates that if the moratorium were lifted production could start by 2017, and by 2030, oil companies could be producing 2.4-million barrels of oil instead of 2.2-million. That's 200,000 more barrels per day. After refining, a barrel of oil can produce up to 19.5 gallons of gasoline, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. So that's 3.9-million more gallons of gasoline per day, or 1.4-billion gallons of gasoline per year. And remember, an estimated 2.8-billion gallons of gas are lost annually due to under-inflated tires. And we didn't even talk about tune-ups. (Repairing a car that is noticeably out of tune or has failed an emissions test improves gas mileage by 4 percent on average, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Fixing a more serious problem, such as a bad oxygen sensor, can improve mileage by up to 40 percent, the agency says.) All of the numbers in this analysis are estimates, we should emphasize. Oil industry experts told us estimates of the amount of oil offshore and how fast it could be extracted vary widely, and the Energy Information Administration's number is fairly optimistic. Likewise, it's highly unlikely any public awareness effort could change behavior enough to save 2.8-billion gallons of gasoline per day. For these reasons, we ruled this claim to be True. Update: After we published this item, McCain spokesman Michael Goldfarb called to dispute it, citing a Government Accountability Office letter of Feb. 9, 2007 that says tire inflation wastes 1.2 billion gallons of gasoline instead of the 2.8 billion estimate we used. The letter says: "The Department of Energy's designated economist on this issue indicated that, of the 130 billion gallons of fuel that the Transportation Research Board estimated were used in passenger cars and light trucks in 2005, about 1.2 billion gallons were wasted as a result of driving on under-inflated tires." That estimate falls just under the estimated 1.4 billion gallons a year from increased offshore drilling. But that doesn't persuade us to change our ruling, for three reasons. First, 1.2 billion gallons in possible savings from proper tire inflation is still in the ballpark of the 1.4 billion gallons from drilling. Given that all of these numbers are estimates, it's hard to say the difference between these two numbers constitutes a falsehood. Second, it would take years of work to start producing 1.4 billion gallons of gasoline from oil pumped offshore -- the Energy Information Administration estimate contemplates production beginning in 2017. And the oil reserves would not be bottomless. Conceivably, the savings from tire-pressure correction could begin immediately and last indefinitely, thus easily overcoming the marginal difference in the estimates provided by the McCain campaign. And finally, none of this takes into account the impact of tune-ups, which Obama mentioned as part of his claim. If Department of Energy estimates of 4 percent mileage improvement for better-tuned cars are true, that alone would push the total savings above the estimated drilling yield. Goldfarb also pointed out that barrels of oil, in addition to yielding 19.5 gallons of gasoline, yield other products as well, such as jet fuel, lubricants and feed stocks. Point taken, but Obama's statement was made within the context of the current drilling debate, which has been about increasing the supply of domestic oil to ease the strain on the U.S. transportation sector. In the end, estimates are all we have to work with here. Estimates of oil production, estimates of gasoline savings. For our purposes in evaluating Obama's claim, all the available evidence shows that he's on solid ground in saying that better car and tire maintenance would save as much gasoline as drilling would generate. We appreciate McCain's campaign pointing out a GAO source we'd missed in our original research, but it's not at odds with our original ruling, True.

pomt-03237	According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 71.2 percent of Hispanic registered voters in Texas and over 86 percent of African American registered voters participated in the 2012 elections.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2013/aug/16/john-cornyn/cornyn-echoes-survey-latino-african-american-voter/	Declaring Texas does not discriminate, Republican U.S. Sen. John Cornyn charged Eric Holder, the U.S. attorney general, with partisan reasons for vowing to restore mandatory federal oversight of voting-related changes in the state. In July 2013, Holder said the Department of Justice would sue to give the federal government a renewed watch-dog role over Texas. Holder spoke after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a provision of the Voting Rights Act that for decades had required Texas and other jurisdictions to win federal pre-approval before implementing changes related to voting. Cornyn, who seeks re-election in 2014, said in an opinion column posted online Aug. 8, 2013 by the Austin American-Statesman that minority voter turnout in Texas is already healthy. "According to a Census Bureau report, 68.2 percent of registered Hispanic voters in Texas went to the polls in the 2000 general election," Cornyn said. "By 2012, with an additional 747,000 Hispanic Texans on the electoral roll, the rate had risen to 71.2 percent. Meanwhile, the rate for African-American Texans rose to over 86 percent in the same period – the highest among all racial groups tracked in the Census Bureau report." An Austin Democratic activist, Burnt Orange Report blogger Katherine Haenschen, expressed skepticism of those 2012 percentages in a blog post--and on Twitter, she asked us to look into them. It's no cinch to break down who voted in Texas in 2012. The state does not track voters by ethnicity and 2012 voter exit polls in the state were not extensive enough to generate estimates for how many Latinos and African Americans cast ballots. Government's post-election survey By email, Cornyn spokeswoman Jessica Sandlin pointed out "The Diversifying Electorate—Voting Rates by Race and Hispanic Origin in 2012 (and Other Recent Elections)," a May 2013 census bureau report on turnout in presidential elections from 1996 through 2012 based on the bureau’s supplemental Current Population Survey undertaken after each of those elections. Nationally, the report said, voting rates for blacks were higher in 2012 than in recent presidential elections, the "result of a steady increase in black voting rates since 1996. Voting rates also increased among Hispanics and Asians across some of the elections," the report said, "although these gains were not nearly as consistent as for blacks." A May 8, 2013, bureau press release led us to detailed charts including one indicating that according to the survey, nearly 1.9 million of more than 2.6 million registered Hispanic voters in Texas, 71.3 percent, turned out in 2012. Also, more than 1.3 million of more than 1.5 million registered African American voters, 86.2 percent, turned out, according to the chart. (Nearly 7 million of more than 8.7 million white registered Texas voters, or 80 percent, turned out, according to the chart, while 220,000 of the state’s 305,000 Asian registered voters, or 72 percent, voted.) These percentages, like Cornyn’s statement, do not represent many citizens eligible to vote who could have voted if they had registered. The survey separately indicates that some 39 percent of the state’s voting-age Hispanic citizens and 63 percent of such African American citizens cast ballots. Over-count? Also, experts have warned that the bureau’s post-election surveys over-estimate turnout. Antonio Gonzalez, president of the Los Angeles-based William C. Velasquez Institute, which focuses on improving the level of Latino political and economic participation, previously told us by telephone there is no perfect way to pinpoint the makeup of any electorate. Gonzalez said then that he respects the bureau’s post-election surveys though they include inflated responses. "It’s the government asking if you’ve voted or registered to vote," Gonzalez said by way of an example. "So there’s an (unquantified) exaggeration factor." More recently, Dallas lawyer Michael Li, a redistricting expert who has helped Democrats, said in a May 11, 2013, blog post that the bureau’s estimates "tend to overstate actual turnout because people don’t like saying they didn’t vote, especially with something as important as a presidential election." Too, some voters fudge when asked if they registered to vote, he wrote. By email, Li pointed us to a May 15, 2013, "Fact Tank" post by the Pew Research Center stating the bureau’s post-election surveys are "considered the best source of information on the demographics of the nation’s electorate." Then again, the center said, the latest survey over-reported total 2012 voters nationally by about 4 million and, it said, African American voters were overcounted, especially in states with the greatest share of blacks in their electorates. "Might this be because non-voting blacks were more eager than non-voting whites to tell survey takers that they voted for the first ever African-American president?" the center wrote. "While there’s no way of knowing for sure, the data are suggestive." The center said that its analysis did not disprove the bureau’s African American turnout finding. "Nor does it negate the long-term turnout trends, which show that black turnout has been rising since 1996," the center said. "It may, however, merit an asterisk alongside the claim that blacks turned out at a higher rate than whites in 2012." In Texas, the bureau survey indicates, more than 8.6 million voters cast ballots. But the Texas Secretary of State says nearly 8 million ballots were cast for president. All told, according to the agency, 59 percent of nearly 13.7 million registered voters cast ballots, compared to 60 percent of 13.6 million registered voters in 2008. In 2008, voter exit polls in Texas indicated that 63 percent of the November voters were white; 20 percent were Latino; 13 percent African American and 2 percent were Asian. Li wrote that the 2012 bureau survey indicates 59 percent of the state’s 2012 voters were Anglo; 22 percent were Hispanic, 16 percent were African American and more than 2 percent were Asian. State voting records, Li wrote, suggest a greater share of Anglo voters and fewer Latino and African American voters. The bureau’s May 2013 report acknowledged the likelihood of discrepancies between its estimates and state voter counts. Ballots sometimes get invalidated during counting and some voters skip voting for president, so their votes would not be rolled into state voter counts, the bureau said. Also, it said, some survey respondents say they voted when they did not, their purpose being to "appear to behave in a socially desirable way." Sandlin said by email that the bureau survey remains the "best option" for gauging Texas voter participation by race. Democratic analysis of voting records There is at least one other way to estimate participation. Li said in his blog post that state records revealing who voted suggest that about half the state’s Latino registered voters and 68 percent of African American registered voters cast ballots. From the same records, he wrote, it looks like Anglos and African Americans turned out in greater relative force than Hispanics. However, Li noted, the records indicate African American turnout trailed Anglo turnout, contrary to the bureau survey results. Also, Li wrote, while the bureau survey indicates Hispanic turnout in Texas trailed Anglo turnout by about 12 percentage points, the voting records suggest Latino turnout lagged by nearly double that. Broadly, he wrote, the number of registered Texas voters "has been relatively flat for the better part of a decade despite burgeoning Hispanic and African-American growth during that same period -- both in total and citizen voting age populations," an indication that minority turnout remains a challenge. Li told us that he relied on Democratic database consultant James Van Sickle of Dallas to reach his characterizations of voters by ethnicity. By telephone, Van Sickle said he drew on various sources to reach conclusions including census data, consumer spending information, voters’ last names and where they live. Seeking more perspective, we emailed pollsters and partisan activists about Cornyn’s claim. Democratic pollster Jeff Smith of Austin replied that his sense is the state’s voter rolls show that 47 percent of Hispanic registered voters turned out compared to 65 percent of African Americans and 61 percent of all Texas voters. He said he identified Hispanic voters based on matching surnames to a file of Hispanic surnames derived from the U.S. Census, also using maiden names when applicable. Black voters were basically identified by another firm, he said. Lynda Tran, a consultant to Battleground Texas, a pro-Democratic group focused on building voter registration and turnout in the state, called Cornyn’s figures accurate, though she said by email that according to the 2012 survey results, Texas ranked 25th in its percentages of Latino citizens who voted and registered Latinos who voted out of 29 states with enough Latino residents to be tabulated by the bureau. Tran said Texas ranked 25th in registered African Americans who voted out of 33 tallied states. Our ruling Cornyn said that according to the census bureau, 71.2 percent of Hispanic registered voters in Texas and over 86 percent of African American registered voters participated in the 2012 elections. This echoes a result from the bureau’s quadrennial post-election survey, though it doesn't account for another result indicating that far fewer Latino and African American voting-age Texans voted--and the survey also tends to overestimate participation. Separately, Democratic analyses of voting records suggest that no more than half of Hispanic registered voters and 68 percent of African American registered voters went to the polls.

pomt-05112	Says "TriMet's own analysis shows that YouthPass does not actually add to the transit agency's costs."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2012/jun/27/sam-adams/does-trimet-itself-say-free-rides-high-school-stud/	The TriMet Board recently adopted a budget that does not include free transit passes for Portland high school students. This week, Portland Mayor Sam Adams shot back with a ginormous fee increase on TriMet benches and shelters so he can provide the free passes. The YouthPass program is a big deal to Adams, who says transit access is critical to keeping teenagers in school and connected. In a statement released Tuesday, the mayor argued that providing passes for roughly 13,000 Portland Public Schools high school students doesn’t add to the transit agency’s operating costs. "In fact, TriMet's own analysis shows that YouthPass does not actually add to the transit agency's costs. No new buses, MAX trips, additional routes or drivers are needed to accommodate YouthPass riders," he said. TriMet’s own analysis showed that? This we had to check. PolitiFact Oregon contacted Caryn Brooks, the mayor’s spokeswoman. She turned up an Oct. 25, 2011 memo from an ECONorthwest economist to Claire Potter, TriMet’s director of financial analysis. The memo, commissioned by TriMet, explains the economic impact to the transit agency should it provide the passes without state support. Some quick background: Portland Public Schools has long provided free transit passes for low-income students. The concept was expanded under Adams in fall 2009 to include all PPS students. The state of Oregon paid for most of the $3.4 million program through a business energy tax credit; Portland Public Schools paid $800,000 of that. The arrangement ended in December 2011, at which point the City of Portland, Portland Public Schools and TriMet cobbled a plan to keep it running through the school year. Here’s the part of the ECONorthwest report that the mayor highlights: "The provision of free passes to PPS students likely did not affect TriMet's operating costs in a significant way. Discontinuing the provision of free passes is unlikely to result in operating cost savings." In other words: The report states the agency saves no money if it stops providing free rides. Adams is correct about that. But the analysis also shows that TriMet loses out on a potential $1.9 million in fare money from students in 2012-13. And that’s based on a monthly pass price tag of $27, wrote TriMet spokeswoman Mary Fetsch in an email. The price is scheduled to increase to $30 a month in September. The "additional cost is not what TriMet is concerned about -- it is the foregone passenger revenue, in the range of $2 million," Fetsch said. She’s right that the analysis is about the potential hit to TriMet’s revenue stream. And Adams knows that, because he’s proposed an 8000 percent increase in shelter and bench fees to squeeze $2 million out of TriMet, which he would then use to reimburse TriMet for the cost of the student passes. The mayor’s statement is accurate. But we think it needs additional information. Providing free student passes will not add to TriMet’s operating costs in the form of more drivers or bus routes, but it will deprive the transit agency of revenue once provided by other public agencies. The statement is accurate but needs extra information. We rate his statement Mostly True.	None	Sam Adams	None	None	None	2012-06-27T17:55:27	2012-06-26	['None']

pomt-03330	"The U.S. Postal Service doesn’t run on your tax dollars. It’s funded solely by stamps and postage."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2013/jul/24/american-postal-workers-union/postal-service-claim-not-fully-target/	There’s been a lot of conversation lately about proposed cuts to the U.S. Postal Service, particularly the idea of ending Saturday delivery. PolitiFact Georgia reader Wallace Cooper said he was skeptical about a specific claim in a recent television ad about the taxpayer cost of delivering the mail and asked us to do some fact-checking. "Members of the American Postal Workers Union handle more than 165 billion letters and packages a year. That’s about 34 million pounds every day. Ever wonder what this costs you as a taxpayer? Millions? Tens of millions? Hundreds of millions?" a voice says in the 30-second ad. The answer: "Not a single cent." Deliveries are solely funded by stamps and postage, the voice says. The ad was put together by the American Postal Workers Union. The union writes on its website that the ad was created to combat "detrimental legislation." The Postal Service boasts that nothing will keep its mail carriers from their appointed rounds. We at PolitiFact Georgia share a similar intrepid ethic regarding getting to the bottom of a claim. So what did we find? The Postal Service says on the facts page of its website that it does not receive tax dollars for its operations, but some context is necessary here. First, let’s look at its current situation. Before 1971, the Postal Service received annual appropriations from the federal government. Since then, it has operated independently, with revenues generated through the sales of postage stamps and services. But Congress does give the Postal Service $100 million a year to compensate the agency for revenue loss by providing, at congressional direction, free mailing privileges to blind people and overseas voters, a congressional report noted. The $100 million is less than 1 percent of the Postal Service’s annual budget. In 2012, the Postal Service pulled in about $65 billion in revenue, it says on its website. That’s $10 billion less than what collected in 2008, the year the Great Recession took hold. By some reports, the Postal Service is losing $25 million a day. The volume of mail the Postal Service handles has declined by nearly 27 percent since 2008, as Americans rely more on email communications instead of letters. The Postal Service’s debt rose from nothing to $10.2 billion between federal fiscal years 2005 and 2009, according to a congressional report. The federal fiscal year begins Oct. 1 and concludes Sept. 30. Another congressional report found Postal Service operating costs may be the largest reason for its financial troubles. In 2006, Congress passed legislation requiring the Postal Service to pre-fund its future retirees’ health benefits at a cost of approximately $5.6 billion per year. The Postal Service has cut expenses through a hiring freeze, offering early retirement to longtime employees and closing some district offices. It’s also increased revenue in recent years through several increases in the price of a postage stamp. In 2009, the Postal Service began borrowing money from the U.S. Treasury Department to deal with its troubles. Some news accounts report the service reached its borrowing limit of $15 billion in September 2012. Sally Davidow, a spokeswoman for the union, said the Postal Service had to borrow the money to offset the health benefit changes. She argued that health benefits are not part of the Postal Service’s operating expenses. "(The Postal Service) is required to pay that money back," Davidow added. "Borrowing money is different than relying on taxpayers." Davidow argued in the union’s defense that the Postal Service has $46 billion in its retiree health benefits fund, but the federal government won’t let the agency borrow from it. The Postal Service wrote in a November 2012 press release that it had a record fiscal year deficit of nearly $16 billion. The agency attributed about 70 percent of that net loss to the health care requirement.

pomt-02324	Says Sen. Mitch McConnell is "the No. 1 recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/27/alison-lundergan-grimes/does-mitch-mcconnell-receive-more-money-lobbyists-/	Republicans are hopeful they can win enough Senate seats in November to take control of the chamber, which puts Sen. Mitch McConnell in the driver’s seat to become majority leader next year. But first, the Kentucky Republican needs to get through a tough re-election campaign. Both Republican primary challenger Matt Bevin and Kentucky Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes, the presumptive Democratic nominee, have sought to paint McConnell as a Washington insider after three decades in the Senate. Along those lines, in an email to her supporters on March 17, 2014, Lundergan Grimes claimed that McConnell is "the No. 1 recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle." There’s going to be a lot of mudslinging in this race and a lot of claims about who is raising money from whom and where. We thought we would start by checking whether McConnell is getting more contributions from lobbyists than anyone in Congress. Campaigns and candidates use "lobbyists" like a dirty word, but you may be asking, "what exactly is a lobbyist?" Glad you asked. Lobbyists are people who are hired to persuade members of Congress on a particular issue. They are brought in by many different industries, from private companies like Microsoft or ExxonMobil, to associations representing local governments, to nonprofits focused on hot-button legislation. Some organizations have in-house lobbyists, and others hire large firms that lobby Congress on a variety of topics. We first checked in with the Lundergan Grimes campaign to see where they got their numbers. They linked us to a report by Open Secrets, a nonpartisan campaign finance watchdog website run by the Center for Responsive Politics. The report, titled "Sincere or Strategic, Lobbyists Give Big," looked at trends in donations from federally registered lobbyists. If a company or organization spends a certain amount of money lobbying Congress, they’re required to register with the federal government. Open Secrets checks this database against the campaign finance disclosure reports that candidates file. Open Secrets found that the 25 lobbyists who have contributed the most money to campaigns this cycle have already donated $1.9 million. Contributions are not party exclusive; five of those 25 gave strictly to Republicans, 11 gave to Democrats and a handful gave to both. Open Secrets also released a list of the members of Congress who have received the most donations from lobbyists during the campaign cycle (since the start of 2013). With $281,301 in contributions from lobbyists, McConnell topped the list, followed closely by House Speaker John Boehner at $278,380. McConnell has also received another $50,000 from family members of lobbyists. Here’s the top 10: Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) $281,301 Rep. John Boehner (R-Ohio) $278,380 Sen. Mark Pryor (D-Ark.) $221,450 Sen. Mark Udall (D-Colo.) $204,400 Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas) $194,300 Sen. Mark Begich (D-Alaska) $160,300 Sen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) $129,433 Sen. Kay Hagan (D-N.C.) $123,733 Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) $121,750 Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) $121,486 As you can see, it’s a hodgepodge of Democrats and Republicans rounding out the list, but the two most powerful Republicans in Congress lead the way, by quite a bit. This list doesn’t count the Massachusetts special election race in 2013 to replace Secretary of State John Kerry, won by Democrat Ed Markey. Markey raised about $306,000 from lobbyists between that special election and his 2014 re-election race, so he technically leads the cycle. A spokeswoman for Open Secrets said that when Lundergan Grimes made her statement, the organization had not yet updated their website with Markey’s contributions. Markey's situation, though, is a quirky anomaly, because he was in the unusual position of running twice in one campaign cycle. McConnell isn’t just the top congressional recipient of donations from lobbyists. According to his Open Secrets profile, he has also received more money than any other lawmaker since 2013 from a number of industries. He’s No. 1 in campaign donations from people who work in the fields of — deep breath here — agriculture services, air transportation, auto dealers and manufacturers, building materials, business associations, coal mining, commercial banks, commercial TV and radio stations, electric utilities, food and beverage, food stores, general contractors, health services, home builders, insurance, medical devices and supplies, mining, mortgage bankers and brokers, pharmaceutical and health products, railroads, retirees, steel production and trucking. When he last ran for re-election in 2008, McConnell, who was minority leader at the time, topped the list in two industries, coal mining and tobacco. He was fourth in contributions from lobbyists. It’s worth noting that in 2010 when Majority Leader Harry Reid was up for re-election, he benefited most from lobbyist contributions as well. With $947,000 in donations from lobbyists, Reid received nearly $300,000 more from lobbyists than the next closest lawmaker. So it’s not uncommon for party leaders to receive significant financial backing during their re-election fights. For her part, Lundergan Grimes has received $54,699 from lobbyists, 51st among candidates running in 2014. Our ruling Lundergan Grimes said McConnell is "the No. 1 recipient of contributions from lobbyists this cycle." Based on the analysis from Open Secrets, McConnell tops the chart for 2014. That’s probably a perk of his party position more than anything. As noted, Speaker Boehner is right behind him and Reid was the No. 1 recipient during his 2010 campaign. But that doesn’t change the accuracy of the claim. We rate it True.	None	Alison Lundergan Grimes	None	None	None	2014-03-27T17:45:31	2014-03-27	['Mitch_McConnell']

pomt-03704	"Well over 90 percent of felony cases, all over the nation, are committed by defendants who grew up in father-absent households."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/apr/18/john-duncan/rep-john-duncan-jr-says-90-percent-felons-grew-fat/	A reader recently sent us a letter he received from his congressman, Rep. John Duncan Jr., R-Tenn., asking us to check a surprising claim. "Well over 90 percent of felony cases, all over the nation, are committed by defendants who grew up in father-absent households," Duncan wrote. Patrick Newton, a spokesman for Duncan, said the letter was based on the congressman's "knowledge obtained from nearly eight years as a criminal court judge dealing with mostly felony cases." The spokesman went on to say that on Duncan’s first day as a criminal court judge in Knoxville, Tenn., chief probation counselor Gary Tullock told him it was actually 98 percent, a figure Duncan lowered slightly in his letter. "Mr. Duncan then went on to preside over 10,000 cases in nearly eight years," the spokesman said. "In each case, he was given a report or information on the defendant’s background. Congressman Duncan says in well more than 90 percent of cases, the defendant was described as being from either a ‘fatherless home’ or a ‘broken home.’ He found Mr. Tullock’s comment to be true through his own experience as a judge, and he fully stands by his remark." We should point out, however, that Tullock’s claim is based on data roughly 35 years old, while Duncan’s observations from his tenure as a judge are now a quarter-century old. That is inconsistent with Duncan’s use of the present-tense "are committed" in the constituent letter. In addition, even if these numbers were true for Knoxville, the statistics wouldn’t reflect conditions "all over the nation," as Duncan said in the letter. And of course, PolitiFact always prefers to deal in hard data. So we took a look at the available research. The few studies that address this question aren’t a perfect match to Duncan’s wording, because the data we have often addresses individuals who are in jail or prison, rather than people who are facing a "felony case." Still, the data is close enough for us to make an educated assessment. First, we looked at data from the Survey of Inmates in Local Jails, a sample of 7,000 inmates by the U.S. Justice Department. In 1996, almost 40 percent of the sampled inmates had lived with both parents, with just over 60 percent of inmates saying they grew up with only one parent, with grandparents or in another arrangement. The numbers were similar in 2002 -- 44 percent growing up with both parents and 56 percent growing up in other situations. These numbers suggest that there’s a strong link between growing up in a non-two-parent household and becoming an inmate, but at rates well below the 90 percent Duncan cited. Second, we looked at data from the Justice Department’s Survey of Inmates in State and Federal Correctional Facilities. The 2004 survey asked inmates who were parents themselves about what kind of family arrangements they had while while growing up. In state prisons, 43 percent of the inmates said they grew up with both parents, while 57 percent said they grew up in other arrangements. The data was similar for federal prisons -- 45 percent with both parents and 55 percent in other arrangements. Once again, this suggests rates lower than 90 percent Finally, we looked at a study co-authored by Cynthia C. Harper of the University of California at San Francisco and Sara McLanahan, a professor at Princeton University’s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs who has authored a wide range of studies about disadvantaged Americans. They found that once you control for other factors, such as family income, a child growing up in a mother-only household was almost twice as likely as a child growing up in a mother-father household to end up incarcerated. That would put the percentage somewhere around 60 percent, which is broadly in line with the other studies. Sixty percent is a significant number, but it is not as great as the 90 percent figure Duncan cited. When we contacted McLanahan, she said she was skeptical that the 90 percent figure was accurate. "I cannot think of any data that would give this information," she said. Dewey Cornell, a clinical psychologist and professor of education at the University of Virginia, said that even if Duncan’s statistic were true, "it would be misleading and incomplete," because it does not address how many people grew up in father-absent households and did not commit felonies. "We could point out that 99 percent of felony offenders drank milk as a child, too, but it is easy to see the fallacy here because we have no preconceptions about milk the way we do about father absence," he said. "Father absence is surely an important concern, but it is only one of a number of risk factors for felony criminal behavior." Our ruling The data we found supports Duncan’s impression that growing up in a fatherless home is one of the factors that contributes to eventual incarceration. But the quantitative research does not show the near-certain link between felonies and fatherlessness that Duncan portrays. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-14363	"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day. Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/mar/21/joe-pitts/rep-joe-pitts-says-120-americans-die-daily-overdos/	In a recent Medium post, Rep. Joe Pitts, R-Pa., lamented the toll of addiction in his state and across the country. "According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day," Pitts wrote. "Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms." We wondered whether those numbers were accurate, so we took a closer look. The CDC calculates overdose deaths from prescription drugs separately from overdose deaths from illicit drugs. To get the full number, you have to add both categories together. In 2014, there were 25,760 deaths from prescription-drug overdoses. That same year, there were 17,465 deaths from illicit drugs, including heroin and cocaine. The agency does not track overdoses from every illicit drug, so this accounting may understate the full number. Still, it provides a baseline. And if you add together the overdose deaths from prescription and illicit drugs, the sum is 43,225 overdose deaths. Then, if you divide that by 365 days, it works out to more than 118 overdose deaths a day, or just shy of the 120-per-day figure that Pitts cited. That’s close enough for us. We should note that the category of total overdoses includes accidental deaths, homicides, suicides and deaths of undetermined intent. So how do the number of deaths from drug overdoses compare with the number of deaths from firearms? According to CDC, there were 33,599 deaths caused by firearms in 2014. That includes homicides, suicides, legal interventions, accidents and cases of undetermined intentions. So in 2014, there were indeed more overdose deaths (43,225) than there were deaths from firearms (33,599), making Pitts’ second claim correct. Our ruling Pitts said that "according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), about 120 Americans on average die from a drug overdose every day. Overall, drug overdose deaths now outnumber deaths from firearms." Pitts is very close on the first part, and he’s correct on the second. So we rate his statement True.

pomt-14919	"We have record numbers of people living in poverty."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/nov/01/carly-fiorina/fiorina-defends-her-gop-debate-remarks-claims-us-h/	Carly Fiorina said on Fox News Sunday that she "misspoke" when she used a striking but inaccurate statistic about women and unemployment during the third GOP debate. Nonetheless, Fiorina suggested the real culprit is the "liberal media." Numerous fact-checkers, including PolitiFact, debunked Fiorina’s claim that "92 percent of the jobs lost during Barack Obama’s first term belonged to women." To FIorina, that’s quibbling with details to bury the larger truths. "This is what the liberal media tries to do. Let us discredit the messenger so that we ignore the truth of the message," she said Nov. 1. "Here’s the truth of the message: Women are harmed by this administration’s policies. Record numbers of women have lost jobs, are living in poverty, or are living in extreme poverty." Progressive policies, Fiorina continued, have been bad for everyone, regardless of gender: "We have record numbers of people who are no longer working or who have quit looking for work. We have record numbers of people on food stamps. We have record numbers of people living in poverty. Those are the facts. That is the truth." We wanted to check out her claim that there are more people living in poverty now than ever before. What the numbers say Looking at data from the Census Bureau, Fiorina’s right that the number of people living in poverty (46.7 million in 2014) is the highest since the census began keeping track in 1959. However, the poverty rate — the measure typically used — is nowhere near historical highs. There are 8 more million people living in poverty now than in 1959, but the overall population of the United States also grew by 141 million people (from 177 million in 1959 to 318 million in 2014). So the poverty rate actually decreased from 22.4 percent in 1959 to 14.8 percent in 2014. "Most economists would agree that standards of living have increased substantially since 1959, and poverty, especially elderly poverty, was more severe in 1959 than today," said John Iceland, a professor of sociology and demography at Pennsylvania State University and author of Poverty in America. Here’s a graph from a Census Bureau report published in September of 2015 that illustrates this point: All the experts we spoke to cautioned against using raw numbers when making comparisons. Instead, analysts typically use rates to correct for the growing population of the nation. "If we use absolute values and not rates, then the following statements are both true: There are more people who are poor than ever today. But GDP is much higher today than it ever was under a Republican president, so the Obama Administration economic policy is a smashing success," said Sheldon Danziger, the president of the nonpartisan Russell Sage Foundation, which funds research on poverty. If we use Fiorina’s preferred measure, we reached a record number of people living in poverty under the watch of every president starting with Richard Nixon, Danziger pointed out. Conversely, said George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair, the number of people not living in poverty has also increased. "No president in the last 40 years has been able to lower the number of people in poverty. Poverty rates fell most under the Bill Clinton Administration than any since Nixon," Danziger said. What’s more, given the economic impact of the recession, poverty is actually lower than expected, in part due to spending in the stimulus package, according to Austin Nichols, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan economic and social policy think tank. "So if Obama had any effect on poverty, it was to lower poverty, though presidents tend to have smaller impacts on broad economic trends than they would like to believe," he said. "In fact, when you use a broader definition of poverty that encompasses noncash aid, poverty hardly changed through the recession, which was a surprise to many who work on these issues." As for Fiorina’s claim that "record numbers of women ...are living in poverty," she’s again accurate that more women live in poverty today than ever (about 162,000 in 2014). But the overall rate has remained relatively unchanged. Here’s a chart using census data that illustrates that point: A Fiorina spokeswoman passed along two articles highlighting the increase in raw numbers and told PolitiFact that the increase should not be trivialized. Our ruling Fiorina said, "We have record numbers of people living in poverty today." In terms of raw numbers, Fiorina is correct that more people live in poverty today than ever in the 56 years the census has been keeping track. However, absolute value is an inappropriate measure for poverty analysis, experts said. If we use the right measure, poverty rate, we see that poverty has decreased significantly since 1959.

pomt-11596	"America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just one year. Isn’t it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road?"	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jan/30/donald-trump/does-it-take-10-years-get-permit-build-road-donald/	President Donald Trump in his State of the Union address repeated a long-standing complaint about how excessive bureaucratic red tape holds up the construction of federal projects. In championing a regulatory rollback, Trump noted that the regulatory burden has grown heavier with time. "America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just one year," he said. "Isn’t it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for the building of a simple road?" We decided to look at how long it took to build the Empire State building, and the length of the current permitting process. How long did it take to build the Empire State Building? A historical timeline from the Empire State Realty Trust states that construction began on March 17, 1930. The building was finished one year and 45 days later. So Trump is close in terms of the year-long timeline of construction he gave. However, we were unable to find how long the permitting process took, and the Empire State Realty Trust doesn’t offer any clues. It notes only that several parties formed Empire State, Inc. in 1929, and name Alfred E. Smith, a former governor of New York, to head the corporation. It’s unclear whether or when they applied for a permit. Can it take 10 years to get a permit approved? According to the lead infrastructure aide on the White House’s Council on Environmental Quality, the permitting process for how the government builds roads, bridges, rails and pipelines is now an average of under five years. The Wall Street Journal quoted Alexander Herrgott telling a Washington conference in January that he hopes the administration will "take permit delivery times from what is now an average of 4.7 years down to two years." That 4.7 year figure also appeared in a 2015 study by the law firm Arnold & Porter into the government permitting process. The firm found that the average length of an infrastructure project — from the beginning with a governmental environmental study until its completion — spanned 4.7 years. A 2014 Government Accountability Office study, citing third-party estimates, put the average at 4.6 years. However, a study commissioned by the Treasury Department under President Barack Obama found the average time to complete an environmental review was longer than 4.7 years in 2015 — and that duration has grown through recent decades. It cited studies conducted for the Federal Highway Administration, which found the time increased from 2.2 years in the 1970s, to 4.4 years in the 1980s, to 5.1 years in the 1995 to 2001 period, to 6.6 years in 2011. Yet another study, by a pro-deregulation group called Common Good, says infrastructure often takes 10 years to be approved. But according to the Wall Street Journal, "Outside experts say actual review times vary widely based on the scope of a project and other environmental factors." Among the timeframes described in various studies, Trump is picking the high end. It bears repeating that his own White House aide to the Council on Environmental Quality said the average was 4.7 years. The White House also did not provide an example of a "minor permit" for a "simple road" taking 10 years. Our ruling Trump said, "America is a nation of builders. We built the Empire State Building in just one year. Isn’t it a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a minor permit approved for a simple road?" The Empire State Building was constructed in one year and 45 days — which means that part of Trump’s claim was pretty close. Recent government studies say the permit approval time ranges from 4.6 to 6.6 years. The only study we found that claims a 10-year approval is common comes from a pro-deregulation group, which raises questions about its reliability. We rate this Half True.

pomt-00955	The current debate over authorizing military action against the Islamic State "would be the first time Congress would place limits on the commander-in-chief's ability to be commander-in-chief."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/feb/19/adam-kinzinger/republican-lawmaker-claims-congress-has-never-set-/	Months after the Islamic State emerged as a threat in the Middle East, President Barack Obama has asked Congress for authorization to use military force against the radical Islamist group. An administration proposal now before Congress would limit the use of force to three years. The legislation also says it is not authorizing the use of "armed forces in enduring offensive ground operations." In something of an odd-bedfellows pairing, some hawkish Republicans prefer giving the president even wider leeway to go after the Islamic State, sometimes called ISIS or ISIL. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, R-Ill., is among those who say Congress should ease restrictions from the proposal, known as an authorization for the use of military force. "This would be the first time Congress would place limits on the commander-in-chief's ability to be commander-in-chief," Kinzinger said on the Feb. 15, 2015, edition of ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos. "We don't own his limited strategy. The president has to make that decision, which is why I think he needs the broad power to do what the commander-in-chief does." Republicans wanting to give Obama more power? That caught us by surprise. So we took a closer look at Kinzinger’s statement. Congress, the presidency and war: A brief history Military historians we spoke with took umbrage with Kinzinger’s statement, noting a longstanding tension between the legislative and the executive branches over military powers. In fact, the conflict goes back as far as the Founding Fathers. In the Constitution, Congress was granted the power to declare war and raise and maintain an army and a navy. At the same time, the president was deemed commander-in-chief. Those two roles have competed for centuries. The issue prompted a 1800 Supreme Court case, Bas vs. Tingy, in which the court distinguished between a declared war — a status that the court ruled grants sweeping powers to the president — and military action authorized by other legislative methods. Essentially, the decision said that "in a declared war, the president's actions are unrestricted, except as restricted by the laws of war," said Anthony Arend, professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University. By contrast, "in a war declared by other statutory means, Congress can set limits." The last time Congress declared war was World War II. Since then, military operations have been conducted through authorizations for the use of military force (and, in some instances, without congressional approval). Congress used those opportunities to impose limits on how the president could use force. For example, the 1983 resolution that provided authority for President Ronald Reagan to send American troops to participate in a multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon set a time limit of 18 months. Then, in 1991, Congress authorized the use military force to oust Iraqi forces from Kuwait. But the agreement stipulated that President George H.W. Bush first had to show congressional leaders that he had used "all appropriate diplomatic and other peaceful means to obtain compliance by Iraq with the United Nations Security Council." And congressional intervention into the president’s powers as commander-in-chief doesn’t begin or end with authorizations. Other types of legislation have played a role as well. In the 1930s, the Neutrality Acts limited President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s ability to aid allied nations fighting in World War II. In 1973, Congress passed a law to block any future military operations Southeast Asia unless Congress approved them, essentially ending the United States’ engagement in the Vietnam War. Later, Congress rebuked President Gerald Ford’s request for military aid to Vietnam. The most significant and lasting Vietnam-era congressional response came in 1973, when Congress overrode President Richard Nixon’s veto of the War Powers Resolution. The act required presidents to notify Congress within 48 hours of sending troops into harm's way and mandated authorization from Congress if military force is to be used beyond 60 days. The Supreme Court has never weighed in on the constitutionality of the War Powers Resolution, but every president since it passed "has taken the position that it is an unconstitutional infringement by Congress on the president’s authority as commander in chief," the Congressional Research Service has written. Despite this, presidents have tended to abide by key aspects of the law for pragmatic reasons, hoping to appease Congress and present a united front before utilizing military force. Finally, Congress can use (and has used) the power of the purse to restrict the president’s use of military force. For example, in 1993, Congress prohibited funding for a continuous presence of U.S. forces in Somalia. Kinzinger’s response When we took this to Kinzinger’s office, spokeswoman Catherine Gatewood said the congressman "was talking in the context of fighting terrorism and radical jihadism. In the current war, Congress has never taken a position to limit the president’s ability to fight terrorism, so to do so in his fight against ISIS would be a change in policy." The far more general nature of the statement suggests to us that this is an after-the-fact reinterpretation of his words. But even if we take it at face value, it’s not clear to us that Kinzinger is accurate. He has a point that the 2001 joint resolution that authorized the use of force against al-Qaida was quite broad. In fact, it didn’t even name al-Qaida as the target, but rather gave the president the power to use force against "nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on Sept. 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons." That’s pretty open-ended. Still, even that resolution restricted the efforts to terrorist groups or countries directly or tangentially involved in the planning and execution of the 9/11 attacks. This limitation has at least forced debates on whether Obama needs authorization to continue military action in Syria against the Islamic State. "It is a bit of a stretch to say (the 2001 authorization) covered ISIS, but you could make a case for that," said Richard Stoll, an expert on international conflict at Rice University. "It is better if we’re going to use military force to say, ‘I, as president, may have the power to do this, but it is better if Congress approves it, because it tells the world we stand together.’ " And it is not as though Congress has been absent from the debate on anti-terrorism strategy. For example, President George W. Bush in 2006 signed legislation passed by Congress to outlaw use of torture against terrorism suspects who were sent to Guantanamo Bay. "A lot of the action, when you think about congressional checks on war powers, happens behind closed doors," said William Howell, an American politics professor at the University of Chicago and author of While Dangers Gather: Congressional Checks on Presidential War Powers. "There are things Obama and Bush might very well like to do that neither of them followed up on, assuming Congress would intervene and make life difficult for them. When you think about Congress as a player on debates on war, it’s not just resolutions and legislation; a lot of this stuff is anticipatory." Our ruling Kinzinger said that the authorization for use of military force now pending in Congress would represent "the first time Congress would place limits on the commander-in-chief's ability to be commander-in-chief." A plain reading of that statement finds it problematic. Time and time again, Congress has intervened to rein in presidents from taking certain types of actions or continuing combat longer than lawmakers want. To do this, Congress simply has to use the power it is granted in the Constitution, authority that has been affirmed and reaffirmed by courts for centuries. Even the narrower interpretation of the statement that Kinzinger’s office stands by — that it only refers to the war on terrorism — doesn’t hold up. We rate the statement False.

pomt-03942	"There are more people killed with baseball bats and hammers than are killed with guns."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2013/feb/20/paul-broun/congressman-uses-wrong-words-gun-claim/	Some gun control critics are using a similar talking point in the national debate over this issue. PolitiFact Georgia spotted two recent claims on the topic that show the importance of being precise when making an argument on an issue. One speaker got it right. The other person made a more general statement on guns and got it wrong. Our odyssey began when an interesting comment by a state senator started making the rounds at the Georgia Capitol and on Twitter. "There's more murders with hammers last year than...shotguns and pistols and AK-47s," said state Sen. Bill Jackson, a Republican from Appling. Two days after Jackson’s statement, U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, a Republican from Athens, was quoted by Slate.com on the same topic. "There are more people killed with baseball bats and hammers than are killed with guns," said Broun, who believes in limited government and is running for the U.S. Senate in 2014. We quickly discovered our partners at other PolitiFact operations have examined similar claims before. Here’s what they found: In January, some Facebook posts began to circulate that were critical of the White House’s proposal to restrict the availability of some weapons. "Facts gun control advocates don’t want you to know. According to the FBI, in 2011, 1,694 were murdered with knives, 726 with hands or feet, 496 with clubs or hammers, 323 with rifles of any type. But Obama wants to ban semi-automatic rifles?" it read. The FBI figures also showed that 356 people were killed with shotguns. PolitiFact reviewed 2011 FBI data on the types of weapons used to commit murders. The numbers posted on Facebook nearly matched the FBI data. The Facebook post of how many people were killed with hands or feet was two below the FBI total of 728. A few weeks later, our partners at PolitiFact Texas examined a similar claim from that state’s attorney general, Greg Abbott. "FBI: More people killed with hammers & clubs each year than rifles," Abbott said in a Twitter post. He supplied a link to a Jan. 3, 2013, Fox News commentary piece that originated on the conservative website Breitbart.com and referred to FBI murder statistics from 2005 through 2011. PolitiFact Texas noted Abbott used selective data to base his claim. That said, PolitiFact Texas noted, it is correct that FBI data indicates that in 2011, more people were killed with "clubs and hammers" than with any type of rifle. They rated his claim True. Our efforts to reach Broun were unsuccessful. Broun’s statement is not as specific as Jackson, whose claim we rated True, and the others. FBI data shows that 6,220 Americans were murdered by handguns in 2011. That’s more than 12 times the number of people killed with clubs or hammers, not including how many people were killed by other types of guns. Broun’s claim that there are more people killed with baseball bats and hammers than are killed with guns was less specific. Broun’s general use of "guns" by its nature includes handguns. That makes his statement way off. FBI statistics show that 8,583 people were killed with all guns in 2011 -- most of them (6,220) with handguns. Broun is a congressman who has inserted himself directly into the heated gun debate. And he’s now running for the U.S. Senate. His high-profile run for higher office means that more of his statements will end up in the glare of the spotlight. And some of them could combust. Our rating for Broun: Pants on Fire.

pomt-09019	"Florida’s high school graduation rate falls well below the national average."	true	/florida/statements/2010/jul/08/alex-sink/alex-sink-says-floridas-grad-rates-are-low/	Like any good Democrat, gubernatorial hopeful Alex Sink has a habit of highlighting the state's mediocre public education record. Voters need look no further than her campaign website, where she laments student achievement records. "Florida’s high school graduation rate falls well below the national average," reads her campaign website. "That’s unacceptable, especially as we work to build a new and stronger Florida economy." The campaign did not respond to a request for Sink's source, but we found plenty of information that shows Florida is far from the head of the class when it comes to graduation rates. The National Center for Education Statistics puts the national average graduation rate at 73.9 percent based on the class of 2006-2007 in a 2010 report. It determined Florida, with a rate of 65 percent, was among 11 states and the District of Columbia with graduation rates below 70 percent. In fact, Florida fell below the national average every year from 2001 to 2007. The report only counted traditional diplomas. Diplomas Count 2010, another respected education report, also puts Florida's graduation rate below the national average for every school year from 2005 through 2007, the most recent years available. For example, the graduation rate for Florida's class of 2007 was 62.1 percent. The national rate was 68.8 percent. Only nine other states and the District of Columbia also scored below 65 percent. Diplomas Count reached its results counting only students receiving standard high school diplomas. Recipients of General Educational Development diplomas, certificates of attendance and other nondiploma credentials were treated as nongraduates. We found only one source that somewhat countered Sink's claim, and it's an interesting one -- the Florida Department of Education. Spokesman Cheryl Etters said national reports are not the most credible source of information because each ranking and state may use different "graduate" definitions. For example, Florida counts students who obtain a GED in two of its graduation counts. But Diplomas Count 2010 and other education research groups do not. In all, the state calculates three graduation rates: The regular rate counts all diploma recipients as graduates, including standard and special diplomas and all GEDs. For the 2006-2007 school year the rate was 72.4. The No Child Left Behind graduation rate considers only standard diplomas and GEDs awarded to high school students. It excludes certificates of attendance and GEDs awarded to adult students. That rate was 69.8 in 2007. The National Governors Association rate counts standard diplomas and certificates of attendance, but not GEDs. That rate was 70.3 in 2007. We decided to compare these numbers to the national graduation rates we had for that school year, even though it wouldn't be an exact comparison. Florida's figures all fell below the National Center for Education Statistics 2007 national graduation rate of 73.9 percent, thus backing Sink's claim. Florida's numbers were higher than the national graduation rate of 68.8 percent published in Diplomas Count 2010, but that's most likely because Diplomas Count has a more narrow "graduate" definition. In short, multiple calculations determined Florida's graduation rate falls below the national average. As for the "well below," part of Sink's claim, both the National Center for Education Statistics and Diplomas Count put Florida among the bottom third of all the states. And, while Florida's most recent graduation rates show improvement -- during the 2008-2009 school year, the regular graduation rate rose to 78.6, the No Child Left Behind graduation rate rose to 76.2, and the National Governors Association rate climbed to 76.3 -- national groups have yet to evaluate the latest data, so we can't determine whether Florida has finally surpassed the average national graduation rate. Based on what we know and the latest data, we say Sink passed the test. We give this a True.	None	Alex Sink	None	None	None	2010-07-08T19:33:39	2010-07-08	['None']

pomt-07519	Said Planned Parenthood’s early objective was to "help kill black babies before they came into the world."	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2011/apr/08/herman-cain/cain-claims-planned-parenthood-founded-planned-gen/	This presidential election season, Georgia’s homegrown prospect Herman Cain is talking about race. Cain, a black, conservative Republican, recently said the media is "scared that a real black man may run against Barack Obama." And there’s this one about pro-abortion rights group Planned Parenthood: "When Margaret Sanger - check my history - started Planned Parenthood, the objective was to put these centers in primarily black communities so they could help kill black babies before they came into the world," Cain said during a talk in Washington, D.C., at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative group. "It's planned genocide," Cain added. He wants the U.S. Congress to yank funding for Planned Parenthood, which receives about $75 million a year to provide non-abortion health services. Was Planned Parenthood founded to help kill unborn black babies? Cain asked his audience to check his history. So, we did. First, a disclaimer. Cain, who has launched a presidential exploratory committee, was a talk show host on AM 750 and now 95.5 FM WSB, which, like The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, is part of Cox Media Group. Cain has more political heft than your average talking head. The former CEO of Godfather Pizza beat a six-term U.S. congressman to finish second in Georgia’s 2004 U.S. Senate Republican primary. The Morehouse grad has eight honorary doctorate degrees and has authored four books, and he serves on several corporate boards. Now some history. Planned Parenthood founder Margaret Sanger is credited with making birth control legal and widely available. Born 1879, Sanger, who was white, blamed her mother’s death on her frequent pregnancies. At the time, speaking about birth control could lead to arrest. She thought that if women could legally control the number of children they bore, their health and economic conditions would improve. We consulted with scholarship, Cain’s camp, anti-abortion groups, Sanger’s biographer, and multiple experts on Cain’s claim. The supposed evidence that Sanger supported black genocide is a loose collection of her most objectionable statements, her ties to the disgraced eugenics movement, and her work on what was called the Negro Project. That effort, started in 1939, brought birth control services (but not abortion) to black communities in the South. These facts don’t come close to supporting Cain’s claim. Eugenics was once a wildly popular theory that the human race can be improved through better breeding and genetics. It drew together backers as diverse as President Theodore Roosevelt and black intellectual W.E.B. DuBois. At its best, the U.S. movement pushed for better prenatal care. At its worst, it enabled forced sterilization laws and let claims that blacks and immigrants were inferior to masquerade as science. Sanger welcomed some of the movement’s more notorious leaders onto the board of a predecessor to Planned Parenthood. She also endorsed paying pensions to women of low intelligence who agreed to be sterilized. But we found no evidence that Sanger advocated - privately or publicly - for anything even resembling the "genocide" of blacks, or that she thought blacks are genetically inferior. Every academic PolitiFact Georgia consulted said that Cain’s claim is wrong. "I have never run into any serious academic reference of Sanger or others wanting to ‘kill black babies,’" Indiana University professor Ruth Engs, a eugenics movement expert, told PolitiFact Georgia in an e-mail. What’s worse, Cain got his facts mixed up. Sanger’s first birth control clinic opened in 1916 in the Brownsville neighborhood of Brooklyn, N.Y., which was mostly Irish and Jewish. When she did open a Harlem clinic in the early 1930s, about half of its patients were white. Members of the black establishment, including DuBois and black newspaper the Amsterdam News, supported it. This was hardly the pro-genocide camp. None of these centers performed abortions. Those who think Sanger wanted black genocide cite the Negro Project. But even their strongest evidence, a passage from a letter she wrote advocating that organizers recruit black ministers for the project, does not come close to proving a genocidal plot. Sanger wrote that "We don’t want word to go out that we want to exterminate the Negro population and the minister is the man who can straighten out that idea if it ever occurs." But her correspondence shows this sentence advocates for black doctors and ministers to play leadership roles in the Negro Project to avoid misunderstandings. Lynchings and Jim Crow laws gave blacks good reason to be wary of attempts to limit the number of children they bore. In Harlem, she hired a black doctor and social worker to quell those fears. The facts of the Negro Project suggest nothing more genocidal than a public health project. Black leaders DuBois and Mary McLeod Bethune, founder of the National Council of Negro Women, and the pastor of the influential black Abyssinian Baptist Church were members of its advisory council. First lady Eleanor Roosevelt was supportive. For Sanger to launch a genocidal plot behind their backs and leave no true evidence in her numerous writings would require powers just shy of witchcraft. Really, calling the Negro Project a genocidal plot defies common sense. Why would Sanger try to destroy a race of people by giving them access to the very thing she thought could make life better? Planned Parenthood’s early objective was not to "help kill black babies before they came into the world." Sanger failed to rise above the ethnic and racial paternalism of her time, but that’s a far cry from being genocidal. Cain’s claim is a ridiculous, cynical play of the race card.

Forty percent of Americans pay no income taxes at all."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/dec/13/fred-thompson/thompsons-tax-numbers-add-up/	Fred Thompson, in arguing that the tax cuts of the Bush administration should be renewed, said that 5 percent of Americans pay over half the income taxes in this country, and that 40 percent of Americans pay no income taxes at all. Both figures are true. The top 5 percent of all payers do pay more than half the income tax. They pay about 59.2 percent of all individual income tax, according to an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan institute run jointly by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. Thompson also said that 40 percent of Americans pay no income tax. This claim is supported by the Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan tax research group that promotes transparency in the tax code and economic growth. There's a small caveat to the 40 percent number — it includes nonfilers, typically taxpayers who don't have to file returns because their incomes are too low. It's logical to assume that most nonfilers don't pay income taxes, but it's possible that some did if they had income taxes withheld by an employer. This is probably a very small number, because people with low incomes have an economic incentive to file a return and get a refund. The U.S. income tax system is progressive, which means that rates increase as income increases. Given that structure, it makes sense that people with higher incomes pay more taxes, and people with low incomes might pay no tax at all. Thompson's numbers are on the money, and we rate them True.

pomt-00846	Says Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu "didn't change his position" on a two-state solution.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/mar/22/ron-dermer/israeli-ambassador-tells-us-audience-netanyahu-did/	Sunday shows fixed their spotlight on newly re-elected Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, whose campaign-season remarks shutting down a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict inflamed tensions with the White House. Now Netanyahu and his delegates are saying the comments were misunderstood. The international uproar started when Netanyahu said a Palestinian state would not happen during his tenure if he won re-election to a fourth term, which widely sounded like a departure from his previously stated support for a two-state solution. After Netanyahu’s Likud Party won enough seats to maintain coalition control of the government, Netanyahu tried to temper his position in interviews with American journalists, but President Barack Obama said he is taking Netanyahu "at his word" when Netanyahu said a two-state solution "wouldn’t happen during his prime ministership." Israel’s ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer, appeared on NBC’s Meet the Press on Sunday to defend the Israeli leader. Host Chuck Todd asked, "So the president is wrong that he takes the prime minister at his word at what he said before the election?" "He didn't say what the president and others seem to suggest that he's saying," Dermer said. "And he was very clear about it in his interview with Andrea Mitchell. He didn't change his position. He didn't run around giving interviews saying he's now against the Palestinian state." Dermer’s claim seems contrary to widespread analysis of Netanyahu’s record, so we wanted to find out if Netanyahu’s position had changed. What has Netanyahu said Netanyahu is on track to be the longest-serving prime minister in Israel’s statehood, elected to a fourth term in office with last week’s close election. Netanyahu had already miffed the Obama administration by accepting an invitation from congressional Republicans to denounce a possible Iranian nuclear deal in a Washington address. The water between them turned even hotter after a video interview published the day before Israel's March 17 general election on NRG, a right-leaning Israeli news website. Netanyahu said in Hebrew, according to a New York Times translation: "I think that anyone who is going to establish a Palestinian state today and evacuate lands is giving attack grounds to the radical Islam against the state of Israel. This is the genuine reality that has been created here in the past few years. Those who do not understand that bury their heads in the sand. The left-wing parties do it, bury their heads in the sand, time and again." The reporter asked, "But if you are the prime minister, a Palestinian state will not arise?" "Indeed," Netanyahu said. He went on: "An international initiative will be presented to us, to return to 1967 borders, to divide Jerusalem. Those are real things. It is going to happen. We need to form a strong, firm national government, headed by Likud (his party), to push those pressures away." Reports from the New York Times, Washington Post and others cast these comments as a departure from his 2009 speech at Bar-Ilan University, when Netanyahu endorsed a two-state solution -- with caveats -- to the conflict. Secretary of State John Kerry had been working on peace talks, of which the agreement of two states is the desired result, but those fell through last year. For supporters of a Palestinian state, Netanyahu’s present-day comments saying the two-state solution would not happen affirmed fears that he was never serious about pursuing that. But was it a true reversal? The backtracking Victory in hand, Netanyahu sought to clarify his comments about his support for a two-state solution in interviews with American media. On MSNBC, he told Andrea Mitchell, "I haven’t changed my policy. I never retracted my speech at Bar-Ilan University six years ago calling for a demilitarized Palestinian state that recognizes the Jewish state. What has changed is the reality. "Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian leader, refuses to recognize the Jewish state, has made a pact with Hamas that calls for the destruction of the Jewish state, and every territory that is vacated today in the Middle East is taken up by Islamist forces, so we want that to change so we can realize a vision of real, sustained peace," he said. His rhetoric had been consistent in the closing weeks of the election, as a Likud Party press release, according to the Post, quoted Netanyahu as saying "there will be no withdrawals and no concessions" because evacuated territory would fall to radical Iran-supported terror groups. A similar newsletter distributed by a Likud leader said Netanyahu had dismissed his Bar-Ilan speech as "null and void," according to this New York Times timeline of Netanyahu’s position on this issue. But when the party followed up by saying the support voiced at Bar-Ilan was "irrelevant," his office countered he had "never stated such a thing." Netanyahu doubled down that he did not change his position in an interview with NPR Morning Edition host Steve Inskeep, who pointed out that the comments were awkward because presidents before Obama had also pressed for the two-state solution. Inskeep asked if it was still Netanyahu’s position to be against a Palestinian state. "What I said was that under the present circumstances, today, it is unachievable," he said, citing the Palestinian Authority’s government with Hamas. "I said that the conditions have to change." Expert analysis What to make of Netanyahu’s words -- is he a flip-flopper or being taken out of context? Ultimately, it’s hard to know his true position. Jonathan Schanzer, Foundation for Defense of Democracies vice president for research and author of books on the conflict, offered several notes of context. First, and perhaps most importantly, Netanyahu’s support for the two-state solution has always been tepid, Schanzer said. In his first term that started in 1997, he opposed Palestinian statehood. The switch came at the university speech in 2009, and he reaffirmed in October 2014 his support for "a vision of peace of two states for two peoples based on mutual recognition and rock solid security arrangements on the ground" during a visit with Obama at the White House. For him to say now, unequivocally, that there would be no Palestinian state during his time in office may seem to indicate that he is against it on principle, Schanzer said, "but he didn’t say there would never be a two-state solution." To Schanzer, that is a fine distinction. Netanyahu always seemed reluctant to be part of the peace talks brokered by the United States, but he showed up anyway, Schanzer said. For him to acknowledge how poorly the talks have gone, and how unlikely they are to improve given the dwindling tenures of all leaders involved, "is actually a moment of honesty," he said. Still, the potentially candid assessment had convenient timing, as Netanyahu spent his final days of campaigning trying to consolidate Israel’s right-wing voters, who have several political party options unlike the United States. It was also in the election’s final days when Netanyahu warned in a video that Arab-Israelis were voting "in droves" and could threaten conservative rule, which critics saw as steeped in race-mongering. "The point is to say this was certainly done in the heat of the campaign," Schanzer said. "But I also believe that this does not discount the idea of a two-state solution moving forward permanently." Our ruling Dermer pushed back against widespread reports that Netanyahu changed his position on a two-state solution for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict during the general elections. Dermer said, "He didn't change his position. He didn't run around giving interviews saying he's now against the Palestinian state." His position on this issue is much more complicated than Dermer lets on. Netanyahu has been all over the place. While he originally opposed Palestinian statehood, he has voiced support for a two-state peacemaking strategy as recently as October. Fast forward to this month: Netanyahu told a reporter for a right-leaning website that a Palestinian state wouldn’t happen under his watch. While he didn’t literally say he was "against the Palestinian state," his comments certainly signalled he would not be working toward that anytime soon." He has since clarified his position again, to say he supports the prospect of a Palestinian state, with caveats. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-04881	"Under Obama’s plan (for welfare), you wouldn’t have to work and wouldn’t have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/07/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obamas-plan-abandons-tenet/	Forget, for a moment, tax cuts and the fiscal cliff. Mitt Romney wants to talk about welfare. A Romney ad opens with a picture of President Bill Clinton signing the 1996 landmark welfare reform act, which shifted the program from indefinite government assistance to one based on steering people toward employment and self-reliance. The words "unprecedented success" flash on the screen. Clinton and a bipartisan Congress, a narrator says, "helped end welfare as we know it by requiring work for welfare." A leather-gloved laborer wipes sweat from his forehead. "But on July 12," the ad continues, "President Obama quietly announced a plan to gut welfare reform by dropping work requirements. Under Obama’s plan, you wouldn’t have to work and wouldn’t have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check, and ‘welfare to work’ goes back to being plain old welfare." The July 12 announcement, made by the the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, or HHS, allows states to try different ways of meeting the work requirements of the federal law. Does it really mean "they just send you your welfare check"? We decided to look further. The HHS memo Since 1996, welfare has been administered through block grants to states through a program called Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. TANF, as it’s called, limits how long families can get aid and requires recipients to eventually go to work. It also includes stringent reporting requirements for states to show they are successfully moving people off welfare and and into the workforce. A memo from George Sheldon, the acting assistant secretary at HHS, said the department wanted to give states more flexibility in meeting those requirements. The memo notifies states "of the Secretary’s willingness to exercise her waiver authority ... to allow states to test alternative and innovative strategies, policies, and procedures that are designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families." The memo outlined, using the jargon of a federal bureaucracy, the kinds of waivers that would be considered. It suggested projects that "improve collaboration with the workforce and/or post-secondary education systems" and "demonstrate strategies for more effectively serving individuals with disabilities," to give two examples. What does all that mean? "If you can do a better job connecting people to work, we would consider waiving certain parts of the performance measures and use alternate measures," is how Liz Schott, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, translated the memo’s point. (The center supports the plan.) Schott, who studies welfare policy, said TANF sets guidelines for what activities may count toward meeting the law’s work requirements: jobs, job training, internships or school, to name a few. Beyond that, it puts restrictions on how many hours a welfare client may spend at school, or how many consecutive months they can attend before that activity no longer counts toward the work requirement. The result: "States are running less-effective programs than they might be, because they are so driven by performance measurement as it’s set forth in the federal law," Schott said. The waivers, then, would allow for flexibility. For example, someone with a special-needs child might require different work arrangements than are currently allowed. Or a person who needs to improve his or her English skills might need more time to take classes. "It’s really about the underlying program," Schott said. "The real starting place is: What’s the most effective program to get this person to work?" Romney’s assertion In a memo released along with the ad, the Romney campaign says the change "undermines the very premise of welfare reform. It is an insult to Americans on welfare who are looking for an opportunity to build better lives for themselves. And it is a kick in the gut to the millions of hard-working middle-class taxpayers struggling in today’s economy, working more for less but always preferring self-sufficiency to a government handout." Obama, it says, "hopes states will consider approaches that remove work participation rate requirements all together." The HHS letter contains no such language. In several places, it says only proposals from states that "improve employment outcomes" will be considered. It’s important to note, however, that the waivers would not just be a change on paper. Schott said it’s possible that waivers will allow states to get credit under the work requirement for things that don’t count currently. That possibility has critics of the proposal up in arms. Robert Rector, a welfare expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said it could ultimately allow "state bureaucrats" to count activities that aren't really work. We should point out that those concerns are at odds with the policy's stated goal of encouraging employment. The Romney campaign also contends that HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius is not legally allowed to waive the existing work requirements. Rector argues that the part of the law allowing waivers does not cover TANF work provisions. "Critically, this section, as well as most other TANF requirements, is deliberately not listed... its provisions cannot be waived," Rector wrote in a July 12 column in the National Review. We think that’s a noteworthy point, but it’s one that a court will have to settle. Our ruling Romney’s ad says, "Under Obama’s plan (for welfare), you wouldn’t have to work and wouldn’t have to train for a job. They just send you your welfare check." That's a drastic distortion of the planned changes to Temporary Assistance to Needy Families. By granting waivers to states, the Obama administration is seeking to make welfare-to-work efforts more successful, not end them. What’s more, the waivers would apply to individually evaluated pilot programs -- HHS is not proposing a blanket, national change to welfare law. The ad tries to connect the dots to reach this zinger: "They just send you your welfare check." The HHS memo in no way advocates that practice. In fact, it says the new policy is "designed to improve employment outcomes for needy families." The ad’s claim is not accurate, and it inflames old resentments about able-bodied adults sitting around collecting public assistance. Pants on Fire!

pomt-09843	76 percent of Americans want a public health care option.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/20/progressive-change-campaign-committee/groups-claim-overwhelming-support-public-option/	A Web site called "We Want the Public Option" includes this headline at the top of the home page: "76% of Americans Say We Want the Public Option." The Web site also includes a video that has no voice-over, just a list of signatures supporting a public option in the health care reform plan, plus a smattering of statistics about reform. The signatures were collected by the two liberal groups — Democracy for America and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee — that paid for the ad. The ad aired for the first time on July 23, 2009, in Washington, D.C., and Montana. It's no longer on the air, but the video remains prominent on the Web site. The video opens with this claim: "76% of Americans support President Obama's public health insurance option." That number seemed high to us, especially in the light of recent polls, so we decided to check it. The statistic comes from a poll conducted June 12-15 by NBC News and the Wall Street Journal that asked, "In any health care proposal, how important do you feel it is to give people a choice of both a public plan administered by the federal government and a private plan for their health insurance — extremely important, quite important, not that important, or not at all important?" About 41 percent of respondents said it was extremely important, and about 35 percent said it was quite important. Add those numbers together, and you get 76 percent. But in the health care debate, June was a long time ago. Since that poll was published, rowdy town hall meetings and a barrage of criticism have made Americans more skeptical of health care reform. The public option has become less popular as well; several surveys done since that first NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll indicate declining support for a public plan. Here are just a few examples: • The Kaiser Family Foundation , a health care think tank, polled 1,205 people July 7-14 and found that 59 percent of people questioned would favor "a government-administered public health insurance option similar to Medicare to compete with private health insurance plans" and that 36 percent would oppose the idea. • A second NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll done July 24-27 asked 1,011 people whether they "would favor or oppose creating a public health care plan administered by the federal government that would compete directly with private health insurance companies." Forty-six percent said they would favor the plan while 44 percent said they opposed the idea. The two news organizations asked the same question to 805 people between Aug. 15-17 and found that 43 percent favor a public option and 47 percent who oppose it. Both statistics fall within the three-point margin of error of the July poll. • A New York Times/CBS poll of 1,050 people between July 24-28 asked whether they would "favor or oppose the government offering everyone a government administered health insurance plan — something like the Medicare coverage that people 65 and older get — that would compete with private health insurance plans." Around 66 percent favored the idea and 27 percent opposed it. • From July 27-Aug. 3, Quinnipiac University asked 2,409 voters whether they "support or oppose giving people the option of being covered by a government health insurance plan that would compete with private plans." Around 62 percent were in support and 32 percent were opposed. That's down from a July 1 Qunnipiac survey in which 69 percent supported the public option and 26 percent opposed it. House Democratic leaders and the group Health Care for America Now, which is supporting the Democratic plan, say the July and August NBC/ Wall Street Journal polls are misleading because they changed the framing of the question. Instead of asking if the choice of a public plan was important, they simply asked whether respondents were in favor of a public plan. "These polls are not comparable," the group wrote in it blog. "The first poll (June) accurately framed the question — should people be able to choose a public health insurance option. The second poll (July and August) pushed them towards an answer by leaving out the essential question of choice and asking a yes or no question." Regardless, these numbers are all over the map, and the only thing we can say with certainty is that they are each well below the 76 percent figure cited by Democracy for America and the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. We also wondered whether the two groups accurately characterized the original NBC/ Wall Street Journal poll in the first place, and we got a mixed response. "It's fine to add those two numbers together," said Karlyn Bowman, resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. "But [respondents] were responding to a question about choice, not necessarily the idea of a public plan," she said. Democratic pollster Mark Mellman, president of the Mellman Group, said that the ad does a "fair reading of the question. Basically, you have 76 percent in favor of a choice." Humphrey Taylor, chairman the Harris Poll, Harris Interactive, agrees that the group characterized the two-month-old poll results correctly, but that "it's a mistake to say that large numbers of people support the public plan, because they don't understand what it would do," Taylor said, noting that "most people don't have an opinion until they are asked." Language often skews opinion polls, Taylor said. When it comes to the public plan, supporters often call it the "public option" while opponents call it a "government-run plan," so the Harris Poll tried to bridge that gap during a survey of 2,276 people between July 9-13. Respondents were asked whether they supported a "public, or government-sponsored, health plan," and the group found that 52 percent were in favor while 30 percent opposed the idea. That brings us back to the ad's original claim that 76 percent favor the public plan. That's a classic case of cherry-picking where they have found the highest number possible. They've also relied on a poll with wording that might lead people to think they were being asked if they favor choice in picking their health plan rather than whether they support a government-run option. Most of the other polls show support, but not nearly the landslide as the June poll. What's more, they continue to display the ad on their Web site even though the poll is sorely out of date and eclipsed by more recent and more precisely worded surveys. By most accounts, there's slightly more support for the public plan than there is opposition, but that support has dwindled throughout the summer. As a result, we give the Progressive Change Campaign Committee a False.	None	Progressive Change Campaign Committee	None	None	None	2009-08-20T15:22:40	2009-08-19	['United_States']
pomt-07669	"Any child born prematurely, according to the president, in his own words, can be killed."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/mar/10/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-said-obama-said-any-child-born-prema/	It may seem early to some voters, but a few Republicans candidates for the 2012 presidential race are already on the trail in Iowa, the first caucus state. One is Rick Santorum, a former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania. Santorum recently spoke at a forum hosted by the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition, emphasizing that conservatives need to remain committed to social values, even though many expect the economy to be the most pressing issue of the election cycle. Opposition to abortion is particularly important, he said. "Any child born prematurely, according to the president, in his own words, can be killed," Santorum said, according to a column by Dana Milbank in the Washington Post. That’s a strong charge, so we decided to check it out. We turned to video from the forum to get Santorum’s complete comments. Part of his comments touched on the Born-Alive Infants Protection Act, a federal law he sponsored in the Senate. "It said that if a child was born out of a, quote, botched abortion, then that child is entitled to medical protection, entitled to treatment," Santorum said. Several states decided to copy the law. Santorum noted that Barack Obama, then an Illinois state legislator, opposed the state version of the law in Illinois. Obama "stood up and said that he opposed this bill because it would impinge on a woman’s rights under Roe v. Wade, and said, in fact, that any child prior to nine months of gestation would be able to be killed, otherwise it would impinge on Roe v. Wade," Santorum said. (See Santorum’s comments on C-SPAN.) "Any child born prematurely, according to the president, in his own words, can be killed," Santorum said. "Now who’s the extremist in the abortion debate?" We researched Obama’s position on "born alive" legislation extensively during the presidential campaign. Obama favors abortion rights generally, and he opposed the state version of Illinois’ "born alive" measure as a state senator. But he never said that premature children, even those who survived an abortion, could be killed. 'Born Alive' in Illinois When Obama was a state senator, abortion opponents proposed "born alive" legislation in 2001, 2002 and 2003. The proposals’ intent was to require doctors to provide immediate life-saving care to any infant that survived an intended abortion. The legislation, which included multiple bills, specified that an infant surviving a planned abortion is "born alive" and "shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law." The bills' supporters said it gave added emphasis to laws already on the books, deterring the death of abortion survivors from neglect. (One of the bills' strongest supporters was a nurse who said she had witnessed infants left to die in dirty utility rooms.) Abortion-rights proponents, on the other hand, said the legislation was a back-door attempt to stop legal abortions. Illinois already had a law on its books from 1975 that said if a doctor suspected an abortion was scheduled for a viable fetus — meaning able to survive outside of the mother's body — then the child must receive medical care if it survives the abortion. The new laws didn't distinguish between viable and nonviable, meaning that an infant of any age that survived an abortion should receive care. Obama, along with other Democrats in the Illinois legislature, opposed the "born alive" laws every time they came up. Over the years, Obama offered several reasons he opposed the legislation. Back in 2001, legislative transcripts show that Obama questioned part of the "born alive" legislation package because he said it would be struck down by the courts for giving legal status to fetuses. In 2002, Obama discussed a different aspect of the legislation, which required a second doctor be present at abortions. Obama said he thought that legislation was intended to make abortion more difficult to obtain, not to provide better care for the "born alive." There is no record of his remarks in 2003 because the bill never made it out of committee, and the committee proceedings were not recorded. The 'neutrality' clause debated The federal legislation (the law Santorum sponsored in the Senate) became law in 2002. The federal legislation included a so-called "neutrality clause," which said the law would not change the legal status or legal rights of anyone prior to being "born alive." Abortion rights advocates said the clause was necessary to make sure the bill would not affect current abortion laws. Obama said as far back as 2004 that he would have supported the federal bill and that he would have supported the Illinois versions if they had included a similar neutrality clause. The laws the full Illinois Senate voted on in 2001 and 2002 did not have such a clause, but 2003 is a different story. The National Right to Life Committee said during the 2008 campaign that the Illinois bill of 2003 did have a neutrality clause. The committee said Obama subsequently misrepresented the bill. Obama responded to that charge in an August 2008 interview. "I hate to say that people are lying, but here's a situation where folks are lying," Obama said. "I have said repeatedly that I would have been completely in, fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported, which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion." Back in 2008, we requested documentation from the Illinois State Archives about the 2003 bill and found that it did have a neutrality clause, as the National Right to Life Committee said. (The clause was added at the committee level, and those records are not available online. But we have posted the documents we received via fax from the State Archives here). But there is an important caveat to add here: We don't know what the discussion was at the 2003 committee meeting because the proceedings weren't recorded, but it seems likely that the federal neutrality clause was not considered sufficient at the state level, because the 2005 Illinois law that eventually passed included a more extensive neutrality clause than the federal legislation. To read more about the differences between the neutrality clauses, read our previous detailed fact-check here. Obama’s comments With Santorum reviving the issue of "born alive" legislation, we went back again to check the transcripts from the Illinois legislature. Obama did say he opposed the bill because it wouldn’t pass constitutional muster under Roe v. Wade. But he never said that "any child prior to nine months of gestation would be able to be killed" or that "any child born prematurely … can be killed," as Santorum said. In fact, Obama said in 2001 that there were "a number of members who are typically in favor of a woman’s right to choose an abortion (who) were actually sympathetic to some of the concerns" raised by supporters of the legislation. In 2002, Obama said that he thought Illinois already had laws sufficient to ensure that children that survived abortion received care. The proposed law would have required two doctors instead of one in the case of a live birth to ensure that care would be provided. "If these are children who are being born alive, I, at least, have confidence that a doctor who is in the room is going to make sure that they’re looked after," Obama said then. At no time did Obama say that children born prematurely can be legally killed. We contacted Santorum’s political action committee, America’s Foundation, for comment. Spokeswoman Virginia Davis said that Obama’s votes against the state measure showed he supported killing children who were born alive. "By his statements and votes, (fully documented by the lead advocate of this legislation in Illinois and at the federal level), and as verified by Factcheck.org, then-state Senator Barack Obama several times voiced opposition to, and voted against legislation that, protected a child scheduled to be aborted -- and was born alive -- from being killed," David said via e-mail. We should note that the Factcheck.org report noted Obama’s positions on the Illinois measures but reiterated his support for the federal legislation. "Whether opposing ‘born alive’ legislation is the same as supporting ‘infanticide,’ however, is entirely a matter of interpretation," the report noted. Our ruling To reiterate what’s not in dispute: Obama opposed "born alive" legislation in Illinois and gave several reasons for opposing the proposals. But at no time did he make the argument that infants who survived botched abortions should be killed. Santorum may feel that abortion is tantamount to infanticide, but that does not give him the license to put words in Obama's mouth that he never uttered. Santorum said, "Any child born prematurely, according to the president, in his own words, can be killed." Obama didn’t say that. In fact, he said that abortion should be legal, but that children that are born should receive medical care. Obama never said that any child born prematurely can be killed or anything like that. Santorum crosses a line with his rhetoric in distinguishing the difference between his position and Obama’s. We rate Santorum’s statement Pants on Fire.

pomt-09361	"As a state rep, I was considered the fourth-most conservative in the Legislature.”	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/apr/01/rick-green/green-says-he-was-fouth-most-conservative-texas-ho/	Rick Green of Dripping Springs, in an April 13 Republican primary runoff for a seat on the Texas Supreme Court, told a Montgomery County group that voters don’t have to guess his judicial philosophy -- they can look at his legislative voting record. Green served two terms in the Texas House from 1999 to 2003; he lost his seat in 2002 to Democrat Patrick Rose. According to a video of his Jan. 14 Montgomery County remarks posted on his campaign Web site, Green encouraged listeners to check his House history, saying: "As a state rep, I was considered the fourth-most conservative in the Legislature.” Is that so? To support his claim, Green's campaign pointed us to the 1999 Texas Conservative Report, a publication of the Free Enterprise PAC, an advocate for limited government and "traditional values." It has since become the Heritage Alliance PAC. The 1999 report tracks dozens of votes made by every legislator in that year's regular session. To evaluate House members, a panel chose 64 votes on "economic, social, governmental and education issues" that the group said “showed signs of a liberal or conservative philosophy.” Lawmakers were graded based on the number of times they voted with the conservative position. Green and two other members of the 150-member House voted the group's preferred way 88 percent of the time; only three members leaned the group's way more often. (The average score was 43 percent.) By that measure, Green shared the “fourth-most conservative” honors with GOP Reps. John Davis of Houston and Charlie Howard of Sugar Land. Senators were rated separately, leaving Green's statement open to interpretation whether he was claiming to be the fourth-most conservative in the whole Legislature (which would be an overstatement) or just the House (which was accurate). The report lists 28 criteria that define how positions were identified as conservative, including if legislation made government more efficient, strengthened the family's importance as the foundation of the nation, reduced the overall tax burden or protected a citizen's ability to make a living. In summarizing its ratings, the group highlighted 12 votes on topics ranging from property taxes to abortion to standardized testing. One vote was on a bill that would have expanded the state's hate crimes law by, among other things, enhancing criminal penalties and specifying which groups would be protected against bias crimes, including those targeted because of their "race, color, disability, religion, national origin or ancestry, age, status as a pregnant person, gender, or sexual preference." The Free Enterprise PAC said "nay" was the conservative vote in this case because the measure would have given "special rights to an individual or group" and did not support "traditional Judeo/Christian moral values." Green was in the minority in voting no. That bill eventually failed, though a hate crimes measure later passed into law during the 2001 legislative session. Green also received a thumbs-up from the group for voting against a bill requiring people younger than 18 to wear a bicycle helmet when riding on public roads or paths. That measure did not become law. All in all, Green was one of 32 House members the group designated a Leader of Excellence in 1999. Not noted by Green in Montgomery County: Based on some of his votes in the 2001 legislative session -- Green's last -- he slipped in the group's conservative rankings. Not that Green became a liberal. The group's 2001 report states that Green took its favored position 65 percent of the time, compared to a House average of 34 percent. He tied with three others as the 11th-most conservative House member. Thirty members sided more often with the group's preferred positions. Green, who served on Heritage Alliance's board of directors from March through November 2009, was not designated a Leader of Excellence by the group in 2001 because he sided with it in less than 70 percent of the rated votes. As before, the group's 2001 report spotlights 12 votes, which covered topics ranging from the death penalty to the minimum wage to mental illness. The votes included two that the group penalized Green for, both voice votes, in which passage is determined by choruses of "ayes" and "nays" on the House floor. The first was on a proposal to mandate that health insurance policies in Texas cover anorexia and bulimia as serious mental illnesses, and the second was on a bill requiring the state attorney general's office to use gender-neutral terminology in publications. Neither became law. For both, the group's preferred position was to oppose them. When we asked Heritage Alliance President Richard Ford how the group was able to tell tell whether a legislator had voted yes or no in those instances, he said he could not recall how those votes were treated because the report was done so long ago. We have a hunch why the group marked Green as voting the wrong way on the two bills. After a voice vote is held, individual members may request that their vote be separately recorded as for or against. It appears that Free Enterprise gave conservative credit only to the lawmakers who did that on those two measures, and Green was not one of them, according to the House Journal. His wife, Kara Green, the campaign's treasurer, said her husband did not support either measure. Summing up: Green accurately recaps his conservative ranking — albeit by a single group, the Free Enterprise PAC, during his first of two terms. He omits the fact that he was not considered fourth-most conservative in his second term, according to the group. We rate his statement as Half True.

pomt-08087	Says that in his first 17 months as president, the United States doubled its world-leading $500 million a year commitment to fighting global AIDS.	true	/texas/statements/2010/dec/16/george-w-bush/president-bush-says-united-states-doubled-its-comm/	President George W. Bush devotes a chapter of his memoir, Decision Points, to his interest in stopping AIDS abroad. "When I took office, the United States was spending a little over $500 million a year to fight global AIDS," Bush writes. "That was more than any other country. Yet it was paltry compared with the scope of the pandemic." In May 2001, he writes, he endorsed the creation of a Global Fund to Fight HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, making an initial U.S. pledge of $200 million, an amount increased to $500 million by early 2002. And in June 2002, he writes, he announced the International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative. "In 17 months," Bush said, "we had doubled America's commitment to fighting global AIDS." By the time Bush completed his second term, in early 2009, such annual U.S. spending exceeded $5 billion, according to a breakdown posted online in February 2010 by the Kaiser Family Foundation. But we wanted the back story. We started from an October 2009 PolitiFact inquiry, per a statement by U2's Bono, who credited Bush with tripling U.S. spending against AIDS in Africa. In 2008, the United States accounted for more than half (51.3 percent) of all the the global AIDs relief disbursed by governments around the world, according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation and UNAIDS. When adjusted for the relative size of the countries' economies, the United States ranked fourth highest, considerably higher than most European countries. The only ones that spent more proportionately were the Netherlands, United Kingdom and Bono's homeland, Ireland. Kaiser spokesman Craig Palosky passed along a June 2004 report, "Analysis of aid in support of HIV/AIDS control, 2000-2002," whose authors include a program run by the United Nations. A table in the report shows the United States donated the most money to the AIDS fight in 2000, accounting for $329 million in such funding. The United Kingdom ranked a distant second, at $117 million. In 2003, Bush initiated a $15 billion plan to address global AIDS relief, mostly for countries in Africa where the AIDS epidemic is staggering. And then in 2008, Congress — Democrats and Republicans alike — more than tripled the HIV/AIDS relief budget to $48 billion over five years. We asked Eric Lief, a former senior advisor with the U.N. Joint Program on HIV/AIDS, to analyze Bush's statement about funding. (Lief now works for the Henry L. Stimson Center, a non-partisan public policy institute.) Via e-mail, he said: "The Bush administration showed real leadership on global HIV/AIDS. U.S. funding grew exponentially during the eight Bush years. But global funding is still far short of anything close to global need." For particulars, Lief pointed us to a December 2006 Congressional Research Service report, "Trends in U.S. Global AIDS Spending: FY2000-FY2007." In fiscal 2000, the year before Bush was sworn in as president, annual U.S. spending on global HIV/AIDS assistance and to combat TB and malaria totaled $236.1 million, the report says. It totaled $564.5 million in fiscal 2001 and a little more than $1 billion in fiscal 2002. Subtracting out what Lief told us was the share of funding focused on battling TB and malaria, we estimated AIDS-specific funding at $518 million for fiscal 2001 and $930 million the year after--amounting to an increase of about 80 percent. Finally, we heard back from David Drake, a representative of Bush's publisher, the Crown Publishing Group, after asking him for evidence behind Bush's statement. Drake said in an e-mail that by the end of June 2002, Bush had committed $500 million to the Global Fund and another $500 million to the International Mother and Child HIV Prevention Initiative. A former Bush adviser, Jay Lekfowitz, writes in a January 2009 article in Commentary magazine that the initiative was intended to increase the availability of preventive care, including drug treatments, and to devise delivery systems that would reach pregnant women and newborn children in two Caribbean nations and eight African ones (with four to be added later). Drake said Bush announced the second $500 million on June 19, 2002, just before the end of his 17th month as president. He was sworn in Jan. 20, 2001. We rate Bush's statement True.	None	George W.

pomt-01392	Says President Barack Obama’s recent New York fundraising trip "cost between $25 million and $50 million."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2014/oct/14/donald-trump/trump-obama-fundraising-trip-cost-25-50-million/	With President Barack Obama’s low approval ratings already weighing down Democrats in the mid-term elections, his Republican critics like nothing better than giving voters more reasons to think less of him. Accordingly, billionaire and occasional presidential aspirant Donald Trump called out Obama for the cost of his recent New York fundraising trip. "He raises a million dollars and it costs between $25 million and $50 million, and they close up the entire city of New York," Trump said Oct. 13 on Fox News’ Fox and Friends. We reached out to Trump to learn where he got his numbers and didn’t hear back. But we wondered, would a one-day New York trip cost between "$25 million and $50 million"? The president made a one-day trip between Washington and New York on Oct. 7. According to the White House schedule, from take-off at Andrews Air Force Base to return took a bit over nine hours. In New York and Connecticut, Obama attended two events for the Democratic National Committee and one for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. Obama traveled to John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York via Air Force One, which is the call sign for one of two 747 jets specially equipped with communications gear so the president is always able to respond in an emergency. According to a 2012 report from the Congressional Research Service, the policy arm of Congress, the hourly cost of Air Force One is $179,750. On domestic trips, a cargo aircraft and a backup aircraft normally accompany Air Force One. For the purposes of Trump’s calculation, that would put the total cost of the air travel between $360,000 and $1.6 million, assuming a range of two and nine hours of usage time for Air Force One. Note: Under the rules of presidential travel, when the purpose of a trip is political, not official, the president’s political organization reimburses the government. For airfare, the price is based on the cost of a commercial ticket for the president and all those who accompany him. In this case, the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee would be on the hook. In addition to the aircraft, there would have been a Secret Service cost, but those figures are classified. There also would be security costs for the New York Police Department. To get a fuller picture of what the cost of presidential travel is, we have to go back to 1999 for a more comprehensive accounting. That year, the Government Accountability Office, Congress’s auditing division, looked at the price tag for three foreign trips taken by President Bill Clinton. Again, these numbers don’t include the Secret Service expenses, or the pre-trip planning. But they do include pretty much everything else. (We adjusted the 1998 dollars to account for inflation.) Trip Total days Daily cost (2014 dollars) Africa - six nations 12 $5.1 million/day Chile 5 $3 million/day China 9 $3 million/day Foreign travel requires much more staff and equipment than the one-day jaunt Obama made to New York City. In Africa, for example, the Marines sent a helicopter squadron. The Air Force deployed five additional planes and ran refueling missions. The Chilean trip pulled in about 600 staffers from a variety of agencies. There were hotels and meals to pay for. While we can’t know all the details of Obama’s New York jaunt, there is no evidence that it approached the complexity of either of the lower cost trips in the GAO report. And if those trips halfway around the world came in at about $3 million per day (in today’s dollars), it is extremely likely that a back-and-forth to New York would cost less. Much less. Bottom line: Presidential travel is expensive, but Trump’s estimate of Obama’s fundraising trip to New York is wildly high, based on everything we know. Our ruling Trump said Obama’s recent New York fundraising trip cost between $25 million and $50 million. Trump provided no evidence, likely because all the available information points to a total that would be way, way lower than $25 million, let alone $50 million. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-05421	Says "Austin has the lowest property tax rate by far of the five major cities in Texas."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/may/01/lee-leffingwell/lee-leffingwell-says-austin-has-lowest-property-ta/	Two days before city staffers discussed raising Austin’s property tax levy, Mayor Lee Leffingwell touted the city’s rate in a televised debate. Facing off against mayoral opponents Brigid Shea and Clay Dafoe in an April 16, 2012, forum on KXAN-TV, Channel 36, Leffingwell said, "The City of Austin has the lowest property tax rate by far of the five major cities in Texas, including Fort Worth, Houston, Dallas and San Antonio." Does that add up? By email, Leffingwell campaign consultant Mark Littlefield and city spokesman Reyne Telles told us that Leffingwell used data from a chart prepared by city staff for its annual five-year financial forecast. Littlefield sent us that chart plus a second one showing estimated tax bills in each city. Ed Van Eenoo, Austin’s city budget officer, told us by email that his office created the charts with 2011 tax rates, home values and sales price information from county appraisal districts and the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University. We checked the numbers with the districts and center, and found Austin’s property tax rate was the lowest, considerably, of Texas’ five biggest cities, as Leffingwell said. The full list: Fort Worth, 85.5 cents per $100 of appraised value; Dallas, 79.7 cents; Houston, 63.875 cents; San Antonio, 56.5569 cents, Austin, 48.11 cents. But tax rates are only part of the equation when it comes to figuring out how hard a homeowner’s pocketbook gets hit. Here, in fact, is the equation, from Austin’s budget office: Take your house’s dollar value; subtract any homestead or other exemptions; divide by 100; then multiply by the tax rate -- with the tax rate expressed in dollars; for example, 0.4811 rather than "48.11 cents." We calculated how much typical homeowners had to pay in 2011 using two different measures: average appraised values from each county tax appraisal districts, and median sales price from the center, which gets data from real estate professionals across the state. Although exemptions affect many tax bills, we excluded them here because they vary with each homeowner and each city, county and taxing jurisdiction. In 2011, Austin had both the highest median sale price and the highest average appraised value among the five cities. But because of the city’s low tax rate, Austin’s tax bill (excluding exemptions) on an average-value home was second-highest, and its tax bill on a median sales-price home came in fourth. Calculated using 2011 median sales price and 2011 city tax rate, Dallas had the highest bill -- $1,262 on a $158,400 house -- followed by Houston’s $982 on a $153,700 house, Fort Worth’s $946 bill on a $110,600 house, Austin’s $918 on a $190,900 house and San Antonio’s $856 on a $151,300 house. Using the same tax rates and 2011’s average appraised values, Dallas was first again, with a $1,441 bill on a $180,847 house, followed by Austin’s $1,224 bill on a $254,328 house, Houston’s $1,057 on a $165,535 house, Fort Worth’s $968 on a $113,247 house and San Antonio’s $725 on a $128,151 house. Median home sale price, 2011 2011 city tax bill using median sale price Average appraised home value, 2011 2011 city tax bill using average appraised value 1. Austin, $190,900 1. Dallas, $1,262 1. Austin, $254,328 1. Dallas, $1,441 2. Dallas, $158,400 2. Houston, $982 2. Dallas, $180,847 2. Austin, $1,224 3. Houston, $153,700 3. Fort Worth, $946 3. Houston, $165,535 3. Houston, $1,057 4. San Antonio, $151,300 4. Austin, $918 4. San Antonio, $128,151 4. Fort Worth, $968 5. Fort Worth, $110,600 5. San Antonio, $856 5. Fort Worth, $113,247 5. San Antonio, $725 Because averages can be skewed by a few very high or low values, taking the median value offers a way to dampen the effect of those extremes. Medians represent a "middle" value -- median sales price would be the dollar amount at which half a city's homes sold for more and half sold for less. The city's tax bill chart used median sales prices, except for Austin, where the median appraised home value was available, and factored in homestead exemptions. Reckoned that way, Austin’s tax bill again came out second-highest. Of course, cities are only one of the entities taking a chomp out of your property taxes. Depending on where your house is, county government, school districts, community colleges and possibly many others get a bite. The Austin owner of a $190,900 home in 2011, for example, paid $2,371 to the Austin school district; $927 to Travis County; $181 to Austin Community College; and $151 to Central Health (Travis County’s healthcare district) on top of the $918 city tax bill. Also, Austinites recently learned that 2013 might bring an increase in the city’s rate. The Austin American-Statesman reported April 18 that the owner of a median-value home would pay $33 more under a tax rate of 49.95 cents per $100 of property -- the rate city staffers said Austin would need to cover its costs next year. Leffingwell responded to the news with a statement that he would look for ways to cut spending rather than raise the property tax rate. That 49.95-cent rate for 2012 is still lower than the other cities’ 2011 rates, but it’s too early to know what all the 2012 rates -- and home values -- will be. Our ruling Leffingwell’s right on the rates. Austin had the lowest 2011 city property tax rate among Texas’ five biggest cities. Yet rates alone are not the only, or even best, indicator of how much residents have been socked by property taxes. Comparing each city’s average-value home in 2011, for instance, Austin would have extracted the second-highest tax payment. Without this context, Leffingwell’s rate comparison misrepresents this pocketbook issue. His claim rates Half True.

pomt-05900	In just a few decades, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, other mandatory spending programs, and paying interest due on the debt will eclipse our entire budget.	true	/oregon/statements/2012/feb/03/kurt-schrader/will-entitlement-programs-and-debt-swamp-federal-r/	Members of Congress and politicians like to use dramatic language to describe the nation’s fiscal problems. Federal spending, they say, is like "a runaway train." The GOP’s front-runner for president, Mitt Romney, famously said, "We’re inches away from no longer having a free economy." The rhetoric on the nation’s deficit is similar. "A government that loses its sovereignty to its bondholders cannot long guarantee its people’s prosperity – or secure their freedom," the budget written last year by House Republicans said. Oregon Rep. Kurt Schrader, a Democrat, is a bit more restrained, though his prediction is equally grim. "In just a few decades, Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, other mandatory spending programs, and paying interest due on the debt will eclipse our entire budget,’’ he says on his congressional website. "There will be NO money left for defense, Pell Grants, support for K-12 education, police and firefighters, economic development, transportation infrastructure, and everything else which creates and sustains a country for our children," he says in words meant to envision a fiscal nuclear winter. It is grim and dark to be sure. But is it true? To answer it, we have to narrow the discussion. Schrader’s assertion that there will be "NO money left" for popular programs dealing with education, public safety and infrastructure is impossible to answer because Congress has broad discretion for appropriating dollars to those activities -- or raising taxes to pay for them. And even amid desperate fiscal meltdowns Congress has excelled at finding ways to pay for popular programs. So let’s examine the first part of Schrader’s claim - that in a relatively short time, the cost of the big entitlement programs - Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid - and interest payments on the national debt will "eclipse our entire budget." If you take the statement at its literal meaning, it is false. Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and interest are always part of the annual budget. Just like rent or mortgage, groceries and credit card debt are always part of a household budget. The spending can never eclipse the budget because the items are always contained within the total budget. Schrader’s staff says the language is imprecise but the meaning isn’t - that entitlements and debt will swamp federal revenues in the near future. It’s one of those, "It’s not what we say, it’s what we mean" moments. Taken that way there is a lot of data to support the idea. In fact, independent budget analysts using federal data say Schrader is being generous. According to budget simulations run by the Government Accountability Office, the total cost of Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and debt service would exceed total revenues in 2026 for the first time in history. The fiscal year 2012 budget released last year by the Republican-controlled House Budget Committee said this: "In 1970, these major entitlements consumed about 20 percent of the budget – a number that has grown to over 40 percent today. Unless action is taken to reform these programs, they will continue to crowd out all other national priorities until they break the federal budget." Other government reports look at individual pieces. But together they reach the same conclusion. The Congressional Budget Office, for example, noted similar concerns in a long-term outlook released in June. The federal debt is growing, reaching 62 percent of gross domestic product at the end of 2010. The non-partisan budget office noted similar growth trends for Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security, concluding "the total amount of benefits scheduled to be paid under current law will grow faster than the economy." The numbers are clear as are the trends. With the explosive growth in entitlements and the government’s need to borrow more to keep pace, there is little doubt that the lines will cross soon on the graph of revenues versus spending. The only question is when. To rule, we need to decide first if the distinction between "the budget" that Schrader referred to and total revenues, which includes the debt and all the entitlement programs, is a difference that matters. We think that, while his language could have been more precise, the average person would understand what he was talking about. Context matters in PolitiFact rulings, and in context, his remarks make his meaning clear. On the math, Schrader’s estimate of "a few decades" is very reasonable, under present circumstances. For that reason we rate this claim: True.	None	Kurt Schrader	None	None	None	2012-02-03T16:13:50	2012-02-02	['Medicare_(United_States)', 'Social_Security_(United_States)']

pomt-11534	Says he is "one of America's leading consumer lawyers."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/feb/15/tim-burns/tim-burns-who-mostly-represents-businesses-suing-i/	Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Tim Burns, a Democrat outspoken about his liberal political views, describes himself as the grandson of Mississippi sharecroppers who is running for "people who struggle." In his first TV ad, released Feb. 6, 2018, the Madison attorney portrays himself in a similar vein when the narrator says: Meet Tim Burns. He grew up without much and became one of America’s leading consumer lawyers. But if you’re picturing an attorney who mainly represents individuals,that’s not Burns. Burns, who faces left-leaning Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet and conservative Sauk County Circuit Court Judge Michael Screnock in the Feb. 20, 2018 primary, has represented individuals in some class-action lawsuits. But his specialty is representing big businesses, not consumers, that sue their insurance companies. And leaving aside the claim in his TV ad, Burns has often described himself as having major business clients, not as a consumer lawyer. Overview of Burns’ legal background A Milwaukee Journal Sentinel review of Burns’ legal background found: He has a law practice that focuses on suing insurers. His clients have included a mining company that couldn’t get an insurance payout when a Colorado quarry collapsed in a landslide and all mining ceased; and Stryker Corp., a Michigan manufacturer suing its insurer because the insurer denied coverage for injury claims filed by people who alleged the company’s "Uni-knee" knee replacement product was defective and caused injuries. Burns told the Journal Sentinel about representing Stryker: "I wasn’t representing the client against the little guy. I was representing the client against the big insurance company. … What I’m trying to do is to get the insurance company to pay for the problem because insurance companies have promised to pay for problems." But, to be clear, in that case Burns was not representing an individual suing a hip replacement manufacturer. Rather, he was representing the manufacturer in a lawsuit, with the manufacturer trying to get its insurance company to pay individuals for claims about injuries caused by its products. That’s in contrast to consumer attorneys such as Milwaukee lemon law lawyer Vince Megna, who built his career by suing car dealers and manufacturers, and ran for the Supreme Court in 2013. Burns’ evidence To back Burns’ claim about being a consumer lawyer, his campaign began its description of Burns’ legal work to us by saying he built a national practice representing policyholders, "otherwise known as insurance consumers." Burns himself told us: "I’m using a dictionary definition of consumer," in that businesses consume insurance. "I am 100 percent a consumer lawyer," he said. But the usual understanding of a consumer -- particularly in the context of Burns’ campaigning as a fighter for ordinary people -- is an individual. The understanding is not that a business is a consumer simply because it buys insurance. Burns’ campaign also cited to us a page from the website of Perkins Coie; Burns is a partner in the Seattle-based law firm’s Madison office. That page says the firm’s insurance recovery attorneys (Burns is one) have helped shape "pro-policyholder law." But the page doesn’t mention consumers. In contrast, the firm touts having represented "leading companies in almost every industry, including Fortune 500 and Global 500 companies, as well as public sector policyholders." Burns’ campaign also cited a handful of cases in which Burns represented individuals. In a 2015 lawsuit, for example, he and other lawyers represented a New York man in a class-action lawsuit. The suit claimed MetLife was not setting aside the required reserves for the purpose of paying potential insurance claims and that MetLife should reimburse him and the other class members for premiums they paid. But by and large, Burns’s clients are not individuals, but businesses -- as he himself has stated on at least three occasions. Burns’ own statements 1. Answering candidate questions from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum, Burns emphasized his business clients when he wrote: I’ve built a national practice as one of America’s leading attorneys in standing up to massive insurance companies. I have been hired by major businesses in three dozen states and 10 foreign countries to handle their most sensitive insurance issues, but I’ve also represented regular working people in class actions seeking to hold insurance companies accountable for financial fraud …. In the current field of candidates and on the current Supreme Court, I have the most experience working with American businesses by far. I’ve been hired by the many of the top manufacturing, banking, and investment companies in the world or their boards of directors to advise them on their most sensitive issues concerning liability and insurance. 2. His campaign website also touts major clients, saying: Tim is one of America's leading attorneys in standing up to large insurance companies. Tim has been hired by major clients in three dozen states and ten foreign countries to handle their most sensitive issues. 3. The profile Burns put on the business networking site LinkedIn says: Tim Burns is a member of the Insurance Recovery Practice group at Perkins Coie LLP. The Insurance Recovery Practice group has more than thirty lawyers who devote their practice to representing corporate policyholders in insurance coverage matters. And Burns’s profile on his law firm’s website also cites business: Tim is favorably ranked in the 2006 (Illinois), 2007 (recommended in "Insurance" nationally), and 2008 to 2016 (Band 2 - nationally) editions of Chambers USA: America's Leading Lawyers for Business. The picture is clear. Our rating Burns says he is "one of America's leading consumer lawyers." The bulk of his legal work is not representing individual consumers, but rather large businesses that are suing their insurers. We rate Burns’ statement False.

pomt-05273	Says he "restored prayer and the pledge in our schools."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/may/25/jeff-wentworth/jeff-wentworth-says-he-restored-prayer-and-pledge-/	In a TV ad, Republican state Sen. Jeff Wentworth’s campaign shows a woman assuring a friend in a coffee shop that Wentworth, who seeks re-election, is "a solid conservative." She lists Wentworth accomplishments, including that "he restored prayer and the pledge in our schools." We were curious about that claim, in part because voluntary student prayer has been protected, though a landmark 1962 U.S. Supreme Court decision barred school-organized prayer which it called a violation of the First Amendment. In a telephone interview, Wentworth said his ad is based on his 2003 proposal, passed into law, giving students a regular opportunity to pray and requiring that they recite the U.S. pledge of allegiance and the pledge to the Texas flag. The approved proposal requires students to recite the U.S. and Texas pledges of allegiance once each school day, to be followed by a one-minute moment of silence in which "each student may, as the student chooses, reflect, pray, meditate or engage in any other silent activity that is not likely to interfere with or distract another student." The law also says that during the quiet time, school employees are to "ensure that each of those students remains silent and does not act in a manner that is likely to interfere with or distract another student." With a written request from a parent or guardian, the law says, a student can be excused from saying the pledges. There is no opt-out for the minute of silence. Wentworth’s proposal made mandatory a moment of silence that had been optional under a 1995 law. That law did not explicitly mention prayer as something students could do during that time. But lawmakers in 1995 also added a section to the Texas Education Code stating: "A public school student has an absolute right to individually, voluntarily, and silently pray or meditate in school in a manner that does not disrupt the instructional or other activities of the school." So, the measure authored by Wentworth resulted in students having daily minutes of silence, permitting prayer, and in their reciting the pledges. But were both practices "restored," as his ad says? Certainly, Wentworth told us, in that his proposal was intended to restore customs he had appreciated growing up in San Antonio. The 1962 court decision ended school prayer as he’d known it, he said, though no court decisions limited students from saying the pledges. Still, he said, constituents had come to him concerned their children were not saying the pledges; practices varied from school district to school district and school to school. "I decided it needed to be uniform and required across the state," he said. We failed to pin how many schools were holding minutes of silence or already had students reciting either pledge before Wentworth acted. News accounts suggest, though, that the U.S. pledge was being recited in multiple schools and minutes of silence were occasionally observed. An April 15, 2003, Houston Chronicle news article said the Houston school district and most area districts such as Fort Bend and Clear Creek allowed principals to determine whether students recited the pledge and observed a minute of silence. The story also said: ** Students in all Pearland district schools recited the pledge to the Texas and U.S. flags daily. ** All 44 schools in the Conroe district daily recited the pledge (though the story did not specify which pledge). ** Most schools in the Katy district recited the pledge (also unspecified) and observed a minute of silence. On April 24, 2003, the Chronicle reported that most schools in the Cypress-Fairbanks, Klein, Magnolia, Spring and Tomball districts reserved a time for students to recite the U.S. pledge. None observed a minute of silence on a regular basis. A May 8, 2003 Chronicle news story quoted Diane Jackson, the Spring Branch school district executive administrator for government engagement, policy and administration, saying that most of the district’s 45 schools already had students say the U.S. pledge, while some also observed a moment of silence. An Aug. 4, 2003, El Paso Times news article reported that students in most El Paso County schools said the pledge of allegiance daily before the requirement was passed. Most did not observe a moment of silence, the story said. A September 2, 2003, Dallas Morning News article said that in the area’s schools, many students had recited the pledge of allegiance for years, but the mandated moment of silence would be a change. The story quoted Rep. Dan Branch, R-Dallas and a House sponsor of the Wentworth measure, saying that the previous year, about half the elementary school students in Dallas County had regularly said the pledge, though hardly any students said the Texas pledge. Debbie Ratcliffe, spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency, told us that the agency was not aware of any data collected on the pre-2003 prevalence of pledge recitations, though she believes it was common for students to say at least the U.S. pledge. Joy Baskin, director of legal services for the Texas Association of School Boards, told us in a telephone interview that she did not know of research on earlier practices, but said she thinks it was widespread for boards to require students to recite the U.S. pledge every day. Wentworth said during the 2003 legislative session that the minute-of-silence requirement was not a move to bring organized prayer back into the classroom. "The goal is to instill loyalty and patriotism in public school students, and give them the opportunity to have 60 seconds of quiet at the beginning of the school day" Wentworth was quoted as saying in an April 9, 2003, Dallas Morning News news article. The story also quoted Wentworth as saying: "It is not school prayer. The language of the bill is very clear about that. … It would not allow audible prayer." Sen. Juan Hinojosa, D-McAllen, objected during Senate debate of the bill, according to an April 10, 2003, San Antonio Express-News news article, and said: "What you're doing is mandating prayer in schools." The story says Wentworth disagreed, pointing to language in the legislation statingl that students could use the minute to reflect, pray, meditate or engage in any other silent activity that's not distracting. "This bill does not mandate prayer in public schools," Wentworth said, according to the article. "Of course it does," Hinojosa said. "Of course it doesn't," Wentworth said. Wentworth told us that he that he made those comments to prevent his measure -- modeled on a Virginia law that passed court muster -- from potentially being construed as a violation of the 1962 Supreme Court ruling, not because he believed it did not allow students to pray. "We’re talking about a very fine legal line," he said. The Texas law survived a 2006 court challenge by a Dallas-area couple with three children attending school in the Carrollton-Farmers Branch district. In a lawsuit, the family said the required moment of silence violated the Establishment Clause of the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment — "Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion." A Sept. 22, 2008, Austin American-Statesman news article, quoted David Croft, the father, as saying: "It's clear if you watch the video and read the transcripts of the legislative debates that the main purpose of this law is to create school-sponsored silent prayer, and that with a wink and a nod they're just sort of calling it a moment of silence." A 1985 U.S. Supreme Court ruling allowed moments of silence in public schools so long as the practice is motivated by a secular purpose, the Statesman article says. In January 2008, the Statesman story says, U.S. District Judge Barbara Lynn found a nonreligious purpose for the quiet time, though she said that she had to hunt for it. "The Texas Legislature was less than clear in articulating the secular purpose of the Texas moment of silence law," Lynn ruled, according to the article. Still, the article says, Lynn was reassured by legislative debate indicating the silent time was meant to make schools "more reflective and more reverent," prepare students for the "seriousness of the day" and create "a common moment of preparation, deliberation and meditation." In 2009, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans upheld the lower court’s decision, saying the moment-of-silence law had a secular purpose. In our interview, we asked Wentworth if it’s an overstatement to say he personally restored prayer and the pledge. He replied that while he was the author of the law and led the charge, many members were involved. "All of this is a team sport," he said. "Legislation is not passed by any one member of the House or the Senate." For perspective on the impact of the Texas law on students’ right to pray, we contacted Charles Haynes, a senior scholar at the First Amendment Center in Washington. Haynes said by telephone: "Of course, state and school-sponsored prayer remain unconstitutional. (Wentworth) couldn’t possibly be restoring state-sponsored prayer. And students’ freedom to pray has never been illegal; they are free to pray alone or in groups as long as they don’t disrupt or interfere with rights of others." Our ruling Wentworth authored a measure mandating a daily chance for students to pray, though school-led or organized prayers like the ones of his youth remain unconstitutional. Also, Texas lawmakers affirmed the right of students to pray or meditate on their own nearly a decade earlier. Aside from requiring students to be quiet for a minute, the Wentworth-originated law resulted in students reciting the pledge, as his ad says, though it seems like that had was already occurring in some schools. Finally, Wentworth did not personally achieve the touted changes, though he was a key advocate. We rate his claim Half True.	None	Jeff Wentworth	None	None	None	2012-05-25T17:25:56	2012-05-09	['None']
pomt-03430	Says he can be on the ballot for Congress while serving time in jail.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/25/stephen-nodine/can-convicted-felon-run-congress-jail/	By day, Stephen Nodine works at a law office in Bay Minette, Ala. By night, he is an inmate at the Baldwin County Jail where he is serving a two-year sentence for perjury. This would be of little interest except Nodine says he might want to run for Congress and represent Alabama’s 1st Congressional District. Nodine notified the media of his interest last week, and in an email to PolitiFact, he said, "I can run, but it seems some party leaders don't want me to." Nodine is right that Republican officials in Alabama have not embraced his candidacy -- more on that in a bit. But we thought we should take a moment and ask, is Nodine correct when he says he can run for office? Nodine is not the first man behind bars to seek the chance to serve the public while serving time. In 2002, former Rep. James Traficant, I-Ohio, took 15 percent of the vote even though he had just started an eight-year sentence for bribery, racketeering and other crimes. Going farther back in history, Matthew Lyon was successful in 1798. He had been convicted of libel, ran for Congress from prison and won. The Constitution lists three conditions one must meet to be a candidate for the House of Representatives -- you must be at least 25 years old, have been a citizen for at least seven years and live in the state you hope to represent. These are all that are required, and states may not add to them, for example, by prohibiting a felon from running for office. According to a 2002 Congressional Research Service report, these conditions "are fixed and may not be supplemented by Congress nor by any State unilaterally." States have more leeway when it comes to setting rules for who may hold state level office, but they have none at the federal level. The Supreme Court, in a case involving term limits, made it clear that states may not interfere. In U.S. Term Limits, Inc. vs. Thornton, the court struck down an amendment to the Arkansas constitution that limited those elected to Congress to three terms in the House and two in the Senate. The court explained in its decision that not only states but even Congress itself could not "impose additional qualifications (that) would violate that ‘fundamental principle of our representative democracy . . . that the people should choose whom they please to govern them,’" according to an analysis in the Brigham Young University Law Review. So when Nodine says he can run, he’s right. But getting his name on the ballot is a different matter. The Republican primary hurdle Nodine is no stranger to politics. He was a county commissioner in Mobile County. His emailed announcement of his interest in running came with photos of him and President George W. Bush and Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. Nodine’s fall from grace came in 2010 when he was indicted in connection with the death of a long-time mistress. In a deal with prosecutors, Nodine pleaded guilty to felony perjury, and a charge of criminally negligent homicide was dropped. He now says he had a moral failing but was "wrongfully accused." (Read an overview of the case from the Mobile Press-Register.) Nodine is an ardent Republican and should he run, he plans to compete in the GOP primary in a special election to fill the seat of Rep. Jo Bonner, R- Ala., who will resign in mid August. Nodine isn't slated for release until more than a year after that. But the Alabama Republican Party chairman, Bill Armistead, vowed that Nodine won’t get very far. "I can tell you that as chair, I see no circumstances where I would support a convicted felon being a candidate for the Republican Party," Armistead said. The state GOP has its own rules for qualifying candidates. To run as a Republican, a person must affirm, "I have not been convicted of a felony under the laws of the United States or of another state." Nodine unambiguously falls short. "This would be stopped at the time of an attempt to qualify," Armistead said. Armistead said he’s confident that the party has the right to determine who may participate in its own primary. He said when Democrats tried to run as Republicans, party leaders blocked them with no challenge. On the other hand, he said he’s never faced this exact situation before. The issue is whether a state party could exclude a person who would otherwise pass muster by federal standards. We asked a few experts in election law for their opinions, and while their views vary, Nodine clearly has his work cut out for him Richard Winger, the editor of Ballot Access News, said Nodine might well prevail should the court find that the party plays a vital role in the electoral process. "I just re-read U.S. Term Limits vs. Thornton," Winger said, "I now feel confident that the Alabama Republican Party can't exclude the candidate. The U.S. Supreme Court said that indirect attempts (to exclude) are just as unlawful as direct attempts." But Winger said Nodine can expect a fight. "There is no real clarity in the law, because obviously parties can ban candidates from their primary ballot for Congress if the candidates aren't members of the party. It's possible the Alabama state courts would let the party exclude the person, but if the person appeals to federal court I believe he will win." David Schultz, a law professor at Hamline University, said this is an area of contested law. "There is a big debate over how far parties can go in terms of governing internal affairs," Schultz said. "Could they pick their own dates for conventions, how they select their officers? Yes. But once it gets to primaries run by the state and to general elections, then the choices parties make are subject to more regulation." Schultz’s summary on whether the Alabama GOP has the legal right to block Nodine? "This is a cool issue -- right at the edge of the law." But Justin Levitt, professor at Loyola Law School, has more discouraging news for Nodine. "Nodine is right that federal law protects his right to run," Levitt said, "But it doesn't likely protect his right to run as a Republican, or even to run for the right to run as a Republican standard-bearer." So long as parties don’t discriminate in ways banned by the Constitution -- on the basis of race or religion for example -- then they can do much as they please, Levitt said. To be clear, this dispute centers on the primary, not the general election. For a general election, there are two ways to get on the ballot -- as the nominee of a party or by getting enough Alabama voters to sign a petition. Nothing would prevent Nodine from running as an independent in a general election; nothing except the need to gather the signatures of 5,938 voters who live in the 1st Congressional District, the minimum number required under Alabama law. A final irony The Constitution might affirm Nodine’s right to run for office, but it grants states broad authority over deciding who may vote. Alabama law disenfranchises anyone who is behind bars, on probation or on parole. Nodine is definitely still in jail. This leads to the potentially paradoxical situation that should he get on the ballot, he wouldn’t be able to vote for himself. Interestingly, his inability to vote also further hamstrings any plans for a primary bid. The Alabama GOP requires that a candidate declare that "I am not subject to disqualification from registering and voting." Our ruling Nodine claimed that he "can run" for office. As a legal matter, he is correct. The Constitution enshrines the idea that the people get to decide who shall represent them, and the only limits are age, citizenship and residency. In terms of federal law, Nodine can indeed run. His desire to run as a Republican puts him in murkier waters. Political parties enjoy a certain independence. The opinions of the legal experts we reached ranged from thumbs up to thumbs down on Nodine’s chances in court. But even on the more optimistic end, the court battles would be decided long after the election Nodine cares about is over. In the broadest sense, Nodine has the legal right to run for office from jail, but significant barriers lie between that right and his name appearing on the ballot. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-11603	"No private business was conducted on public property. That issue is a contract dispute."	false	/illinois/statements/2018/jan/29/bruce-rauner/how-hands-has-rauner-been-his-investments/	Details contained in a lawsuit brought against Gov. Bruce Rauner by a former business associate have called into further question the governor’s insistence that he no longer plays a role in his business investments. Appearing before the Chicago Tribune’s editorial board Monday, Rauner was asked to address an account from former associate Harreld "Kip" Kirkpatrick III describing how the two discussed the business investment on which Kirkpatrick’s case centers. "No private business was conducted on public property," Rauner told the Tribune during a mini-debate with his rival in the March Republican primary, state Rep. Jeanne Ives of Wheaton. "That issue is a contract dispute, contract dispute. It’s not an investment decision. A contract dispute that stemmed from before I was governor." Pressed on whether he spoke with Kirkpatrick at all about that dispute, the governor doubled down: "I was not doing private business on state property," he said. "It’s not an investment decision, it’s not about making investments. Not about assets." Kirkpatrick’s lawsuit was filed last October under court seal, an unusual move that kept its allegations hidden from public view. At the time, Rauner told reporters he had nothing to do with the lawsuit because he had signed "blind trust commitments" before taking office that ceded control of his investments to a New York investment house. We fact-checked that claim at the time, rating it Half True. Despite the name Rauner used, he hadn’t really set up a blind trust that would have prevented him from managing his money. Rauner instead signed a power of attorney in which the governor retained the authority to handle his investments along with the New York firm. But the issue flared again in recent days after a Cook County judge removed the lawsuit seal, revealing that Kirkpatrick claimed he and Rauner were fighting over how to divvy up a $67.5 million settlement pot involving a separate legal dispute tied to an investment both had stakes in. In the lawsuit, Kirkpatrick claimed he met twice with Rauner in 2015 to discuss their differences, including once on the back porch of the governor’s mansion in Springfield. So if Kirkpatrick’s version of events is correct, how then can Rauner claim he has been hands-off with his investments? We decided to take a closer look. A matter of (blind) trust The particulars of the investment spat between Rauner and Kirkpatrick are only peripheral to the credibility questions raised by Rauner’s actions. What is central is an action taken by Rauner just days before he assumed office in 2015 aimed at easing public concerns that his vast wealth might conflict with his actions as governor. Back then, Rauner, a multimillionaire private equity investor, announced that he had entered into "blind trust commitments" in which he authorized a New York investment house to handle his financial affairs. The move came against the backdrop of his refusal to release detailed tax records that could clearly show how his money was handled. The name Rauner gave that instrument was somewhat misleading. He did not enter into a blind trust, which would have required him to cede control over his investments to a third party. Instead, what Rauner did was sign a power of attorney in which Rauner retained the authority to manage his investments along with the New York firm. When Kirkpatrick filed his lawsuit in October, Rauner invoked his blind trust commitments to suggest the legal action, including the sealing of the court file, was not his doing and he knew little about it. We rated that Half True because the power of attorney he signed did not preclude him from involvement and, with the file sealed, there was no way to check his claim. But when the file was unsealed recently, pieces of Rauner’s story began to unravel. For instance, Rauner insisted in October that he was not behind the push to keep the case allegations sealed and out of view. But filings from Kirkpatrick’s lawyers contradict that claim. They contend that the governor invoked a confidentiality provision in a business agreement with Kirkpatrick to request that the complaint be filed under seal. What’s more, a report by The Associated Press confirmed one part of the allegations leveled by Kirkpatrick: Rauner’s state-paid scheduler had arranged a meeting between the governor and Kirkpatrick on May 11, 2015, at the executive mansion in Springfield. Rauner spokeswoman Rachel Bold did not respond directly when we reached out to the governor’s office last week to clarify whether he still denied speaking with Kirkpatrick or whether he simply disputed Kirkpatrick’s account of their meeting. "This is a contract dispute that stems from before Governor Rauner took office," she wrote in an email. "The governor is seeking to enforce the terms of that contract. Court filings dispute Mr. Kirkpatrick’s allegations, including his characterizations of any conversations." Bold added that the governor "is not involved in day-to-day investment decisions." She responded almost word-for-word again Monday when we reached out for clarification following Rauner’s remarks at the Tribune. Our ruling Rauner said, "No private business was conducted on public property." At its core, the question raised by the lawsuit against Rauner is simple to address. He has claimed from his first days as governor that he would have no involvement in managing an investment portfolio worth hundreds of millions of dollars to avoid any appearance of a conflict of interest. Kirkpatrick’s lawsuit contends Rauner violated that pledge. In defending himself, Rauner has appeared evasive and is now attempting to parse the difference between personal involvement with an investment and personal involvement with a contract dispute stemming from an investment. It is a distinction without a difference. Rauner is being disingenuous and obtuse, and we rate his statement as False.	None	Bruce Rauner	None	None	None	2018-01-29T19:00:00	2018-01-29	['None']
pomt-00553	Says Scott Walker runs a state government that bans "employees from talking about climate change."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/16/forecast-facts/group-says-scott-walker-bans-employees-talking-abo/	If a website from a progressive group is to be believed, state workers in Wisconsin cannot even say the words "climate change." So the scottaway.com website, developed by an operation called Forecast the Facts, allows readers to click a red button on the screen and get alternative words to use, like "weather roulette" and "extended Popsicle season." One tongue-in-cheek offering: "In the U.S., FREE OUTDOOR HEATING is predicted to cause more heat waves, flooding, wildfires, sea level rise and drought." Forecast the Facts, a project of the progressive Citizen Engagement Laboratory, says it developed the website in response to government denial of climate change. "Governors Rick Scott (FL) and Scott Walker (WI) both run state governments that ban employees from talking about climate change," the group said on the site. Scott’s administration is reported to have an unofficial policy banning employees at the Florida Department of Environmental Protection, and other agencies, from using "climate change" or "global warming" in official communications. But we are interested here in Wisconsin and Walker, who is a top GOP presidential contender. Are state government employees in Wisconsin banned from talking about climate change? The genesis of the claim In April, we rated True a claim by the group NextGen Climate that Tia Nelson, executive secretary of the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands, was prohibited from talking about global warming while on state time. The board manages state lands and a trust that funds school libraries and makes loans to school districts. The board employs 10 full-time staff members. On April 7, the board voted 2-1 to approve a resolution that banned its staff from "engaging in global warming or climate change work while on BCPL time." The resolution grew out of concerns that Nelson had spent time advocating for climate change policies as part of her role as co-chair of Gov. Jim Doyle’s now disbanded task force on global warming. The board is to vote Tuesday June 16, 2015, on a measure that would change the ban from "engaging in global warming or climate change work" to engaging in "policy advocacy" on the board’s time. About the board But Walker is not on the board. Its members, as defined by the state constitution, are three other statewide elected officials -- Attorney General Brad Schimel and state Treasurer Matt Adamczyk, both Republicans, and Secretary of State Doug LaFollette, a Democrat. Thus, the board is not even part of the executive branch. Its 10 employees represent about .0003 percent of the state’s about 30,000 total employees. Cullen Werwie, communications director for the state Department of Administration, said no cabinet agency under Walker had such a ban. And we could not find any such evidence either. On the flip side, we did find examples of government engaging in conversation about climate change -- such as on the Department of Natural Resources’ web page, which talks about climate change and the Great Lakes, and the Department of Transportation documents related to its long-term transportation plan. A search for the terms "climate change" or "global warming" on wisconsin.gov sites yielded more than 1,000 results. A tenuous connection When we asked Forecast the Facts for back up to its claim, it sent an audio recording of the Board of Commissioners of Public Lands meeting and vote. But that board, of course, is separate from Walker. And the group’s claim was broader, referring generally to state government employees, not just those in one department. Brant Olson, the campaign director for the group, could not name any other part of state government with such as ban in place. Instead, the group cited a quote from Laurel Patrick, the governor’s spokeswoman, in a New York Times article about the board’s ban: "Generally, Governor Walker does not think it is unreasonable to enact policies requiring board staff to focus on board-related activities." Olson said the quote showed the climate change ban was "clearly a decision he endorses." While we were reporting this item, though, the group swapped in some new words. The language on the web site was changed to read: "Governors Rick Scott (FL) and Scott Walker (WI) both support state agencies that reportedly ban employees from talking about climate change." Even that could be outdated if the public lands board passes the measure to amend its rule. Our rating Forecast the Facts said Walker runs a state government that bans "employees from talking about climate change." But the group could only name one obscure agency, outside of the governor's jurisdiction, that has such a rule in place. The rule was aimed at barring its workers from doing climate-change work while on state time. And that rule is poised to be amended. Meanwhile, we found plenty of examples where state agencies were discussing climate change. We rate the claim False.	None	Forecast the Facts	None	None	None	2015-06-16T05:00:00	2015-06-02	['None']

pomt-14800	"The world food demand is going to double sometime between now and 2070."	true	/missouri/statements/2015/nov/30/roy-blunt/sen-roy-blunt-right-about-future-demand-food/	U.S. Sen. Roy Blunt, a Missouri Republican, attended the 2015 Missouri State Fair on Aug. 20 in Sedalia and won the support of agricultural associations, while opposing government regulations on agriculture. Surrounded by agricultural organization leaders, Blunt opposed the EPA’s proposed Clean Power Plan. "The world food demand is going to double sometime between now and 2070. Nobody is better prepared to take advantage of that than we are, unless we let the regulators get in the way," Blunt said. We thought his estimation of the growth in demand sounded like an extreme claim and wanted to see the research. World food demand David Tilman is an author of the article "Global food demand and the sustainable intensification of agriculture," and regents professor of ecology at the University of Minnesota. He’s conducted research focused on global food consumption and its effects. "The senator is correct," Tilman said, "Globally, increasing incomes and population mean that we likely will need to double the global production of crops within the next 40 to 50 years" Projections from the United Nations, Food and Agriculture Organization, the University of Minnesota and many other researchers have found that world food demand, or the amount in which food production must increase, will double by sometime between 2050 and 2070. Why the growth? Global population is going to grow to almost 9.6 billion by 2050, and more than half of this is expected to occur in Sub-Saharan Africa, where one-quarter of the population is undernourished. Globally, income and urbanization has been growing rapidly for the past five decades, and with that comes increased demand for food and a change in diets. Global gross domestic production is projected to continue to grow at about 2.9 percent every year, with the most drastic changes occurring in developing countries. Researchers, including Tilman, have found that calorie and protein consumption is directly related to per capita GDP. In 2000, the richest countries were consuming 256 percent more calories and 430 percent more protein than the world's poorest nations. So as global GDP grows, as does population, so will the demand for world food. Also a steady increase in global income often leads to a change in diet. China’s long-growing increase in meat consumption, for example, is a result of increased income and is a trend observed throughout other developing nations. Population and diet change alone will cause a 69 percent increase in calorie demand by 2050, researchers say. Our ruling Blunt said, "The world food demand is going to double sometime between now and 2070." The scientific community agrees. We rate this claim to be True.

pomt-04683	Says House Republicans "tried to change the definition of rape."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/06/gwen-moore/gop-house-members-tried-redefine-rape-democratic-r/	U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin was among women members of the House who made brief speeches Sept. 4, 2012, at the Democratic National Convention. Moore said she is working to end violence against women, then blasted her Republican colleagues, declaring: "No victim of domestic violence or bullying -- man or woman -- should feel unprotected in America. Yet when Democrats acted to strengthen the Violence Against Women Act, Republicans in the House moved to weaken it. In other legislation, they have even tried to change the definition of rape." Let’s hit the pause button. Did House Republicans try to redefine what constitutes rape and, as the claim suggests, thus affect what would put a perpetrator in prison? Definition evolves We'll begin by noting that the definition of rape has not been constant. The "legal definition of rape has evolved over centuries, and clearly, we’re not done fighting over it," Stanford University historian Estelle Freedman wrote in The Washington Post a couple of weeks before Moore’s speech. She noted that in the 1980s, for example, states began to outlaw marital rape. In October 2011, PolitiFact National rated as Half True a claim by Vice President Joe Biden that murder and rape in Flint, Mich., increased after the police force in that city was reduced. Our colleagues noted that the FBI’s definition of rape -- "the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will" -- was particularly limited when compared to the definition of other law enforcement agencies, in that it excluded male victims and other types of sexual assaults. Three months later, U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder announced the FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting definition of rape was being revised to be more inclusive and to better reflect state codes. Noting that the previous definition of rape had been in place since 1927, he said the new definition is: "The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim." Moore’s claim To back Moore’s claim, Moore spokeswoman Nicole Williams cited two pieces of legislation relating to federal funding for abortions. So, although Moore’s statement was broad -- House Republicans "tried to change the definition of rape" -- what she cites as evidence is much narrower, having to do with how rape is defined when federal money is used to pay for abortions. 1. No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act Williams cited an August 2012 article in Mother Jones, a liberal magazine, on legislation regarding federal funding of abortions in cases of rape. The article said the bill was co-sponsored by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Republican Mitt Romney’s vice-presidential running mate, and GOP U.S. Rep. Todd Akin of Missouri. (Akin, a U.S. Senate candidate, was denounced for saying in August 2012 that pregnancies are rare in cases of "legitimate rape." He apologized but resisted calls to drop out of the race.) Ryan and Akin were among the co-sponsors of the legislation, which would have limited federal funding of abortions to victims of "forcible" rape and certain other circumstances, PolitiFact New Jersey found in rating a claim by New Jersey Democratic Party chairman John Wisniewski as True. PolitiFact New Jersey found that the legislation, sponsored by Rep. Chris Smith, R-New Jersey, was first introduced in July 2010. With Democrats controlling the House, the bill didn't move forward. In January 2011, after Republicans won a majority in the House, Smith reintroduced the legislation. Ryan and Akin -- along with 225 other mostly Republican House members -- again co-sponsored it. The Boston Globe reported that the bill narrowed an exemption to the Hyde Amendment, which allows federal dollars to be used for abortions in cases of rape and incest. Smith’s bill would have limited the incest exemption to minors and covered only victims of "forcible rape." House Republicans never defined what constituted "forcible rape" and what did not, the Globe said, but the term "forcible rape" ignited an outcry among various critics, who said the phrase would exclude victims rapes involving drugs and victims of statutory rape. Statutory rape occurs when an individual, regardless of age, has consensual sexual relations with an individual not old enough to legally consent. Smith dropped the forcible rape term from the bill. The revised bill passed the House, but the Democrat-controlled Senate never voted on it. When Ryan was asked by Fox News in August 2012 about why he sought the forcible rape language, he said the bills were aimed at stopping taxpayer funding of abortion and that "forcible rape" was "stock language" used in various bills. He said he agreed with it being removed from the legislation he supported, but didn’t elaborate on what he meant by stock language. Among those coming to Ryan’s defense was The Weekly Standard, a conservative magazine. It noted, as other media have, that the intent of the word forcible was to prevent taxpayer-funding of abortions in the case of statutory rape, such as when a 16-year-old and a 19-year-old have consensual sex. PolitiFact Texas reached a similar conclusion in September 2012 when it rated as Half True a claim by a pro-Democratic political action committee that Ryan, Akin and Texas House Republicans backed a bill to distinguish between rape and forcible rape. According to the text of the 2010 and 2011 bills and numerous news stories, our colleagues said, "the main purpose of the legislation was not redefining rape but limiting the use of federal funds to pay for abortion." 2. Protect Life Act Moore’s spokeswoman also cited the Protect Life Act, saying it also would have restricted to forcible rape the exceptions for when federal funding can be used for abortions. The January 2011 bill, which passed the House but didn’t become law, would have amended President Barack Obama’s health care reform law to prevent federal payment to health plans that include abortion coverage, according to PolitiFact National. Our rating Moore said House Republicans "tried to change the definition of rape." Her statement contains an element of truth, in that GOP members sought to change when federal money for abortions could be used in cases of rape, by using the term "forcible rape." But the claim ignores critical facts that would give a different impression -- the House Republicans’ effort was not to change the definition of rape, per se, but rather to restrict the use of federal funds in abortions. We rate Moore’s statement Mostly False.	None	Gwen Moore	None	None	None	2012-09-06T14:32:44	2012-09-04	['None']

pomt-13648	Through the Clinton Foundation, "the Clintons are now worth in excess of $100 million."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/07/america-rising-now/pro-trump-super-pac-ad-wrong-clinton-wealth/	A super PAC backing Donald Trump, Rebuilding America Now, released a new ad attacking Hillary Clinton. It’s running in the battleground states of Ohio, North Carolina and Florida, and it hits both Hillary and Bill Clinton on their personal finances. The ad, which PAC chairman and Florida Gov. Rick Scott unveiled on NBC’s Meet the Press, opens with a clip of Hillary Clinton saying that when she and Bill left the White House, they were dead broke (a claim we rated Mostly False). As the logo of the Clinton Foundation appears on the screen, the narration begins. "A foundation was created, and money started to roll. Speeches, connections and donations. Misogynistic regimes, Wall Street insiders, corrupt dictators. They all had one thing in common: Their check cleared. The Clintons are now worth in excess of $100 million." Anyone watching the ad would get the sense that somehow through the Clinton Foundation, the Clintons amassed a net worth of over $100 million in about 15 years. That’s misleading, for a few reasons. Let’s start with the $100 million-plus in net worth. We reached out to the super PAC, through its website and with an email to one of the Republican strategists behind it, to get its sources and did not hear back. The ad itself points to something published in Fortune on Feb. 2, 2015. We couldn’t find a matching article. We did find a later article from September 2015 in Fortune that estimated Hillary Clinton’s net worth at about $30 million. In October 2015, Forbes wrote, "After layering years of disclosures on top of annual tax returns, Forbes estimates their combined net worth at $45 million." The most current estimate comes from Hillary Clinton’s federal financial disclosure filing, something she had to provide as a presidential candidate. That form states explicitly that the assets of both the candidate and his or her spouse must be included. The values are reported in ranges. On the low end, the Clintons reported assets of $11.3 million. On the high end, they might have as much as $52.7 million. The couple listed no liabilities. Kathleen Clark, a specialist in government ethics law at Washington University in St. Louis, said the only significant item those forms don’t include is real estate. "You don’t need to report the value of the home you live in," Clark said. "And that goes for a second home, too. So long as you don’t rent it out for income." The Clinton’s own two homes, one in New York and one in Washington, D.C. Together they are worth about $9 million. When we add it up, the highest amount we could find is about $62 million. The Clintons have done very well. Between multi-million dollar book contracts and speaking fees of $225,000 or more, they have earned an estimated $230 million in the 15 years since they left the White House. But income is not wealth. As high as those earnings are, that still doesn’t bring them close to the $100 million mark, much less take them beyond it. We found several articles that said Bill Clinton has a net worth of $80 million, but none said how they got that number. By law, his assets must also be disclosed on his wife’s federal filing. The ad’s claim about the role of the Clinton Foundation is suggestive but unclear. The foundation has grown rapidly, raising over $2 billion to fight AIDS, reduce hunger and poverty, and rein in climate change. It has received millions from several Middle Eastern kingdoms, mega-wealthy businessmen and major corporations. The ad doesn’t say how that money translates into cash for the Clintons. In point of fact, according to the foundation’s tax filings and its website, none of the Clintons are paid by the foundation. Our ruling The super PAC Rebuilding America Now, a pro-Trump entity, said that the Clintons built a net worth of over $100 million after creating the Clinton Foundation. While some unsourced articles have used that number, official documents and the assessments of other, more rigorous reports show a net worth between $11 million and about $53 million. Even after accounting for the value of their two homes, the highest figure we found was $62 million. There is no evidence that money given to the Clinton Foundation has made its way into the Clintons’ pockets. The Clintons have become wealthy since its creation, but the ad hints darkly at shady dealings without proof. The statement twists a grain of truth to paint a misleading picture. We rate this statement Mostly False. Editor's note: After we published, the Super PAC Rebuildng America Now sent us their supporting material on wealthy donors to the Clinton Foundation, speaking fees, and a corrected link to an article citing the Clintons' net worth.

pomt-04366	"Now remember, property taxes went up 70 percent in the 10 years before I became governor."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/oct/22/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-property-taxes-jumped-70-perce/	Whether on the national stage or back home in New Jersey, Gov. Chris Christie often peppers the crowd with statistics while describing the fiscal woes of New Jersey before he took office. Among his arsenal of numbers is the rate of increase in the state’s property tax bills. At an Oct. 16 town hall meeting in West Milford, Christie unsheathed that figure as he said his reforms are constraining property taxes. "We're announcing $116 million dollars today in additional savings to local governments statewide. Here's why. The savings are possible because of the reforms we put in place: 2 percent cap on property taxes. The property tax rates are starting to come in from across the state. They came in from Burlington County the other day, 1.7 percent increase countywide in property taxes. The cap's working," he said. "Now remember, property taxes went up 70 percent in the 10 years before I became governor. So you’re having [a] 7 percent a year average." Did New Jersey’s property taxes -- the nation’s highest -- jump by 70 percent in a decade? Homeowners may not be surprised to learn that the increase was actually slightly more. Though, when property tax rebates are factored in, the increase is roughly 50 percent. Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said in an e-mail that the governor’s statement is "unequivocally true and a glaring illustration of the uncontrolled rise in property taxes in the decade before we arrived in Trenton -- caused by unrestrained spending and overgenerous benefits and the expansion of government at the local and state level." The average property tax bill in New Jersey was roughly $4,240 in 1999, according to data from the state Department of Community Affairs. By 2009 -- the year before Christie took office -- the average property tax bill had climbed to about $7,280. That’s a more than 71 percent increase. But there’s also another chapter to the story of New Jersey’s property taxes: rebates. In previous fact-checks, experts told us reductions in property tax rebate programs could be viewed as tax hikes, since they’re intended to reduce the property tax burden of homeowners. In 1999, when the NJ Saver program was started under former Gov. Christie Whitman the average rebate check mailed to homeowners was $111. By 2009, the average rebate was $1,037. When you deduct those rebates from the average property tax bill, the increase over the decade before Christie took office is less than 70 percent. In 1999, homeowners paid an average of about $4,130 in property taxes, with the rebate. In 2009, that figure jumped to roughly $6,240, an increase of more than 51 percent. It’s worth noting Christie stopped delivering checks for property tax relief during his first year in office and changed the program so the rebates came as a credit deducted off property tax bills. In 2011, the average property tax bill was $7,759. With the credit, the average bill was $7,519. Our ruling Christie said: "property taxes went up 70 percent in the 10 years before I became governor." In the decade before Christie took office, the average property tax bill climbed more than 70 percent, from roughly $4,240 to about $7,280. But when property tax rebates are taken into account, the increase is less, jumping roughly 50 percent in a decade. Either way, Christie is on point that property taxes increased significantly from 1999 to 2009. We rate this statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-14929	"Most Americans are now getting their news from Facebook."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2015/oct/29/rebecca-kleefisch/most-people-get-their-news-facebook-gop-wisconsin-/	Republican Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch was asked at a Marquette University Law School forum why polls indicate that most Wisconsin residents think the state is headed in the wrong direction. Kleefisch told the audience Oct. 21, 2015 that she thought the polls reflected Wisconsinites’ concerns about where the nation is headed. Then she suggested that some of the good economic news in the state isn’t getting enough attention -- and made an interesting claim about Facebook, saying: "One of the things that we don’t hear a lot about is the fact that wages are actually up four and a half percent year over year here in Wisconsin. I haven’t read that article. I read it in my briefing binder; we hear our cabinet secretaries talk about it. But it’s not one of those things that’s on Facebook every day. Most Americans are now getting their news from Facebook. We need to be talking about the things that matter to our neighbors." When we asked Kleefisch about the Facebook claim, she said "should have qualified and sourced" what she stated. She said she was actually relying on a poll about where millennials get their news about politics and government, not where all Americans get their news generally. But let’s investigate this a little, looking at some scientific polls. The polls The poll Kleefisch said she relied on was reported in June 2015 by the nonpartisan Pew Research Center. That survey, done in March and April of 2014, found that most millennials -- 61 percent -- reported getting news about politics and government from Facebook in the previous week. Millennials were born from 1981 to 1996, and were between the ages of 18 and 33 at the time. We found some other polling, however, that surveyed for all Americans and for news generally, not just news about politics and government. Those polls do not show that most Americans get news from Facebook. 1. A March 2015 Pew poll found that 41 percent of American adults get news from Facebook. Pew emphasized to us that that does not suggest that Facebook is the main source of news for that group. 2. A poll done for the American Press Institute in January and February 2014 asked respondents if they had found news in the previous week from a list of various sources that were read to them. When asked if they got news directly from news organizations, such as a newspaper or TV newscast, websites or news wires, 88 percent said yes. Only 44 percent said they had gotten news in the past week from social media, through platforms such as Twitter or Facebook. 3. Gallup in June 2013 used an open-ended question to ask respondents to identify their main source of news. Some 55 percent of the respondents said TV; that was the most popular answer. Only 21 percent said the Internet as their main news source, including 2 percent who identified Facebook, Twitter or other social media. Nine percent said the print version of newspapers. Tom Rosenstiel, executive director of the American Press Institute, told us there are two points to keep in mind: Overall, most Americans get their news from many sources, even if TV still is the most common, and people use different sources for different types of news. "We seek it out and we bump into it and, actually, no one place dominates," he said. Facebook is not a source of news -- since it distributes rather than produces news -- but it is likely the top pathway to news for people under age 35. Our rating Kleefisch said at a public forum: "Most Americans are now getting their news from Facebook." The lieutenant governor told us she misspoke and should have qualified her statement to make it about millennials -- Americans roughly between the ages of 18 and 33. One poll found that 61 percent of them reported getting political news on Facebook in the previous week. But in terms of Americans overall getting news of all types, not just political news, we found no polls indicating that a majority get news from Facebook. We rate Kleefisch’s statement False. More on polling U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, D-Wis., said "60 percent of all Americans do not want to see Planned Parenthood defunded." True. GOP presidential candidate Ben Carson said the number of people who "believe in socialism ... is increasing." Half True. Conservative commentator Karl Rove said that at this point in 2012, "Rick Perry was ahead at 29.9 percent, and we had seven more leads before it finally settled on Mitt Romney." Mostly True.

pomt-04433	"Tennessee students now cover about 67 percent of the cost of their education at public universities, and some 60 percent at community colleges."	true	/tennessee/statements/2012/oct/13/john-g-morgan/official-says-students-not-state-paying-most-colle/	It’s well known that college tuition, at both public and private schools, has risen rapidly over the past several years. The steep increases have occurred across the nation, and Tennessee’s public institutions are no different, largely as a result of declining state appropriations But when John Morgan, chancellor of the Tennessee Board of Regents, told a U.S. Senate committeethat Tennessee students now pay 67 percent of the costs of their educations at the state’s universities and 60 percent at community colleges, we were curious. When many parents of today’s students were public college students themselves two, three or four decades ago, the ratio was the reverse: state appropriations comprised up to 70 percent of the costs, and students and their parents picked up the rest. Did the burden shift that much? In a word, yes. Morgan was precisely on mark with his testimony, as expected from a higher education administrator who spent 10 years as state comptroller, state government’s chief auditor and financial watchdog. The latest figures available from the Tennessee Higher Education Commission, for the 2011-12 school year, show that student tuition and fees comprised 67 percent of the sum of revenue that state universities receive from state appropriations and from tuition and fees, and 60 percent at the community colleges. TheTHEC Fact Bookfor 2011-12, which is full of interesting information about public higher education in Tennessee, is available for review onTHEC’s website. It’s important to note that those figures do NOT include what students pay for meal plans, residence halls and books and supplies – expenses that are not subsidized by taxpayers and which can be triple the costs of tuition at public schools. When those costs are included, students and parents are paying far more than two-thirds of the total costs of attending public institutions. But Morgan was discussing only tuition and mandatory fees. Students’ share of the costs has been steadily rising while the state’s share has been declining. Through the mid-1980s, the state paid about 70 percent of what its public colleges and universities cost on a per-student basis. But that share has been decreasing ever since, through both Democratic and Republican control of the state Capitol. By 2000, the state share had declined to 57 percent at its universities and 68 percent at its community colleges. By the 2011-12 school year, the state share was down to about one-third at the universities and to 40 percent at the community colleges. The tipping point when Tennessee students began paying more of the costs than taxpayers occurred in 2003 at the four-year schools and in 2009 at the two-year campuses, THEC says. When contacted for this article, Morgan said that "even with the rise in tuition over the last five years or so, on a per full-time equivalent basis, our institutions have less money to spend than they did five or so years ago," at least through last year. "State reductions, along with a rise in enrollments, have forced us to become more efficient in a way," Morgan said. He added:"Whatever the case, I believe we are at a point where we can’t raise tuition much beyond general-inflation increases without impacting enrollment. We may already be seeing that effect this year: enrollment is down on average across our system although historically enrollments rise during recessions and flatten out or decline somewhat during recoveries. From a public policy standpoint, if Tennessee’s future is dependent on increasing education attainment, we are going to have to find a way to make it affordable. I’m hopeful that is a conversation we have as a state this year." Gov. Bill Haslam is focusing on higher education this year, although much of his work thus far has been on ensuring that public institutions produce graduates with skills to enter the state’s workforce. So far at least, about his only talk of affordability has been a promise to try to increase state funding and efficiencies on public campuses, which would reduce the pressures to raise tuition. It will be interesting to see how much influence Morgan, who has spent most of his career helping inform the public policy of the state, will have on that discussion. Our ruling Parents of aspiring college students who remember the days when tuition covered just one-third the per-student costs at state colleges and universities may be shocked to learn that, at least in Tennessee, students now pay 67 percent of the costs of their education through tuition and fees. That’s the point that one of Tennessee’s top higher education officials told a Senate committee, and the research backs him up. We rule this statement True.	None	John G.

pomt-14831	"8 Syrians caught at Texas border in Laredo."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2015/nov/20/greg-abbott/greg-abbott-claims-syrians-caught-mexico-border-re/	Gov. Greg Abbott, at the forefront of a push-back by more than half the nation's governors against the U.S. admitting Syrian refugees, declared that fresh apprehensions at the Texas-Mexico border illuminate his concerns. In a Nov. 18, 2015, Twitter post, the Texas Republican said: "THIS is why Texas is vigilant about Syrian refugees." His tweet pointed to a headline on a story posted that night by the conservative Breitbart.com: "8 Syrians caught at Texas border in Laredo." Refugees from Syria -- where four years of civil war has displaced millions of people, according to the United Nations -- have been a hot topic of late. On Nov. 16, 2015, Abbott was among what proved to be 31 of the nation's governors declaring refusals to admit Syrian refugees to their states, for fear militants would mix in. That followed unsubstantiated reports that Syrians were involved in the Paris massacre that killed more than 130 people in Paris Nov. 13, 2015. Such reports were based on the discovery of a Syrian passport near the body of an attacker, which The Washington Post reported Nov. 17, 2015 was not authentic. Worth noting too, Republican officials in Texas have occasionally expressed concern that ISIS -- the terrorist militia waging war in Syria and Iraq -- could send members over the Texas border to attack the United States. When we checked, those fears were based on false assertions, like that ISIS was operating a base in Mexico, Border Patrol caught ISIS members, or that Muslim prayer rugs were found on the Texas border. But the morning after Abbott weighed in, the Republican chairman of the U.S. House Homeland Security Committee, Rep. Mike McCaul of Texas, took to TV to say there was no need for worry. Still, we wondered: Could it be that Syrian insurgents were snagged at the Rio Grande? Abbott’s source Abbott spokesman John Wittman declined to comment when asked about how the governor reached his conclusion or if the governor believed the described Syrians posed a security threat. Wittman also didn’t say if Abbott had relied on sources aside from the Breitbart story he noted in his tweet. Breitbart’s story, headlined "Exclusive--Confirmed: 8 Syrians caught at Texas border in Laredo," cited two individuals described as federal agents but not identified in the story who reportedly advised that "eight Syrian illegal aliens attempted to enter Texas from Mexico in the Laredo sector" on Monday, Nov. 16, 2015, two days before Abbott posted his tweet. The story further quoted Hector Garza, a Border Patrol agent and president of a South Texas chapter of the National Border Patrol Council, the union representing Border Patrol personnel. According to the post, Garza said agents in the Laredo area were "concerned" because they had "heard about Syrians being apprehended in the area from other federal agents," although he also said he couldn’t confirm that Syrians had lately been apprehended. By email Nov. 20, 2015, Garza told us he couldn't comment because he was on patrol. In an email, Brandon Darby, editor of Breitbart Texas and the lead reporter on the story, said his sources used the word "caught" because they said the Syrians "only acknowledged being Syrian after they were called out." Darby also noted that "caught" has a "plethora of acceptable definitions," which he supplied via email, though he declined to specify which he had intended to convey. Federal narrative We asked key federal agencies for their takes on the reported detentions. In an emailed statement responding to our query, the Department of Homeland Security, the umbrella agency for Border Patrol, said two Syrian families presented themselves at the Laredo port of entry and were taken into custody for further processing. "Please emphasize that they PRESENTED themselves," the statement said. We also touched base with the Texas Department of Public Safety, which previously doused speculation about terrorists crossing the border in October 2014. Spokesman Tom Vinger, by email, referred us to the Border Patrol. Meantime, Rick Pauza, a Border Patrol spokesman at the Laredo point of entry, said by phone the eight Syrians described in the Breitbart report "identified themselves truthfully" and did not evade agents. Darby, informed of this response, told us by email, "CBP, unfortunately, has a history of being deceptive with the public." He also pointed out a June 2014 article he authored for Breitbart titled "Customs and Border Protection agency caught lying to public." The morning after Abbott posted his tweet, McCaul discussed reports of the Syrians in Laredo on MSNBC’s Andrea Mitchell Reports. "It was a Syrian refugee family that went to the Laredo port of entry in my state and basically turned themselves in for political asylum," McCaul said, meaning they were seeking shelter from imminent harm in their home country. "They were not infiltrating to conduct terrorist operations." Appropriate border crossing procedures If Syrians were looking for asylum, was walking to the border a reasonable way to do it? Mana Yegani, a Houston immigration lawyer, told us by phone that one way of seeking asylum is to appear at a port of entry. "This is very common," Yegani said. "That’s the way you seek refuge. You cross the border and walk to a border patrol agent." Typically, she said, after asylum-seekers present themselves to agents, they are sent to detention centers and interviewed by federal asylum officers, who evaluate their cases for admittance to the United States. The process usually takes three to six months, she said. The website for U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services directs asylum seekers on how to proceed. "STEP ONE: Arrive in the U.S.," it says. We asked Homeland Security if any Syrians had sought asylum in the U.S. before. A spokesperson pointed us to fiscal year 2013 data--the most recent available--which showed that 811 Syrians were granted asylum during that period, up from 364 in 2012 and 60 in 2011, the year the Syrian civil war began. In all, 3.2 percent of the 25,199 asylum-seekers welcomed by the United States were Syrian in 2013. It’s rare for a Syrian to cross the border lacking required papers, other statistics suggest. According to a September 2014 report by Homeland Security, 72 of the 662,483 "aliens apprehended" by the government in the fiscal year through September 2013 were Syrian citizens--up from 57 the year before, down from 114 two years earlier. In the fiscal year through September 2014, U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement reported removing nine Syrians from the U.S.--compared to, say, nearly 177,000 people from Mexico and more than 120,000 individuals from Central America. Possible factors So there might not be many Syrians approaching Laredo. We wondered why Syrians would try to enter that way regardless. Joshua Landis, president of the Syrian Studies Association and director of the Center for Middle East Studies, said by phone there was no reason to be surprised by Syrian asylum seekers. "The amount of destruction in their country is just stupefying," he said. A four-year-long civil war between government forces and various rebel groups, including ISIS, has intensified in recent months with bombing campaigns by the United States, Russia, Jordan, France, Saudi Arabia and others, leaving much of the country in shambles. According to an Oct. 27, 2015, report by the United Nations, the conflict has left 13.5 million people, including 6 million children, in need of protection and aid. Landis said half the homes in Syria had been destroyed, while 30 percent of schools remain operational and electricity and clean water are scarce commodities. Our ruling Abbott tweeted that Syrians were "caught" by federal agents at the border in Laredo which, he said, explains why "Texas is vigilant about Syrian refugees." His implication was that the potential terrorists were trying to infiltrate Texas, giving fuel to his decision to tell the federal government the state intended not to accept Syrian refugees. Eight Syrians were taken into custody at the port of Laredo, we confirmed. But Homeland Security officials said the Syrians had turned themselves in to a Border Patrol agent, seeking asylum. So, Abbott's statement has an element of truth -- Syrians landed in U.S. custody -- but it leaves an incorrect implication of how and why they got there. We rate the claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

pomt-10362	McCain tells of a fellow Vietnam POW who was beaten for fashioning an American flag that became an inspirational symbol to fellow POWs.	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/02/chain-email/fellow-pow-backs-up-mccains-story/	A chain e-mail making the rounds recounts a moving anecdote Sen. John McCain has related about a fellow Vietnam prisoner of war who was severely beaten by guards for fashioning a makeshift American flag that became an inspirational symbol to fellow POWs. The e-mail message encourages those who receive the e-mail to "pass this on... and on... and on!" And it leaves little doubt about its political intent, as it closes with the line, "oh...and then you have this clown, who refuses to place his hand on his heart and say the pledge. ..." This is an obvious, and misguided, swipe at Sen. Barack Obama, who has frequently been attacked in chain e-mails for allegedly refusing to place his hand on his heart when saying the Pledge of Allegiance. We at PolitiFact already debunked that myth. But here we will check the accuracy of McCain's POW anecdote, which was forwarded to us by several PolitiFact readers. Here's how the chain e-mail reads, in part: "One of the men who moved into my (POW) room was a young man named Mike Christian. ... Mike got himself a bamboo needle. Over a period of a couple of months, he created an American flag and sewed on the inside of his shirt. "Every afternoon, before we had a bowl of soup, we would hang Mike's shirt on the wall of the cell and say the Pledge of Allegiance. "I know the Pledge of Allegiance may not seem the most important part of our day now, but I can assure you that in that stark cell it was indeed the most important and meaningful event. "One day the Vietnamese searched our cell, as they did periodically, and discovered Mike's shirt with the flag sewn inside, and removed it. "That evening they returned, opened the door of the cell, and for the benefit of all of us, beat Mike Christian severely for the next couple of hours. Then, they opened the door of the cell and threw him in. We cleaned him up as well as we could. "The cell in which we lived had a concrete slab in the middle on which we slept. Four naked light bulbs hung in each corner of the room. "As I said, we tried to clean up Mike as well as we could. After the excitement died down, I looked in the corner of the room, and sitting there beneath that dim light bulb with a piece of red cloth, another shirt and his bamboo needle, was my friend, Mike Christian. He was sitting there with his eyes almost shut from the beating he had received, making another American flag. He was not making the flag because it made Mike Christian feel better. He was making that flag because he knew how important it was to us to be able to pledge our allegiance to our flag and country. "So the next time you say the Pledge of Allegiance, you must never forget the sacrifice and courage that thousands of Americans have made to build our nation and promote freedom around the world. You must remember our duty, our honor, and our country." McCain relates this same anecdote in his book, Faith of My Fathers, in nearly identical fashion. And the story is backed up by another POW, Leo K. Thorsness, albeit with a couple small differences in detail. Thorsness was an Air Force fighter pilot who was shot down on his 93rd mission and spent six years as a prisoner of war in Hanoi. When people ask if he lived with McCain at the Hanoi Hilton, Thorsness likes to correct: "John lived with me. I got there first." Thorsness, who was awarded the Medal of Honor for valor in the Vietnam War, recalled to PolitiFact "the day when Mike Christian found this slimy old rag, an old dirty handkerchief" while in the yard outside the cell. Thorsness said Christian spent days cleaning up the handkerchief, and used blue ink and ground up red roof tiles for color. Then, he took threads from his blanket and sewed on stars with a bamboo needle. It took a good bit of imagination to make out that it was an American flag, Thorsness said, "but we all knew what it was." When Christian finished the flag and showed it to his fellow POWs, Thorsness said, "I think every one of us snapped to attention." It was a tough group of men, he said, and yet there were very few dry eyes. Sometimes, he said, it was hung up on a cell wall and men would salute it and say the Pledge of Allegiance. "To everyone there, it was very meaningful," he said. Christian knew full well that he would eventually be caught and punished, Thorsness said. Christian hid the makeshift flag in an extra sleeve of his pajamas. But it was discovered by the guards and confiscated during a surprise inspection. That night, the guards came for Christian, Thorsness said, and "they beat him mercilessly through most of the night. They beat the hell out of him. But Mike was one tough guy." And soon after, Thorsness said, Christian was back at it again making another flag. "Anyone who witnessed that was moved," Thorsness said. "It made a lasting impression." Christian died in a Virginia home fire in 1983. Thorsness was later elected to the state Senate in Washington in 1988. During a flag amendment debate, Thorsness spoke publicly for the first time about Mike Christian's flag. "Every other senator turned their heads and looked at me," Thorsness said. The story was later published in 1992 in Reader's Digest. Several details in Thorsness' account differ from McCain's recollection, such as whether the handkerchief was a rag found in the prison yard or, as McCain tells it, part of a care package allowed in by the guards. But the stories are substantially the same. We rule McCain's story True.	None	Chain email	None	None	None	2008-07-02T00:00:00	2008-05-18	['United_States', 'Prisoner_of_war', 'John_McCain']

pomt-02560	"The extra point is almost automatic. … (The NFL) had five missed extra points this year out of 1,200 some odd" attempts.	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/jan/31/roger-goodell/nfls-goodell-extra-point-almost-automatic/	An NFL.com host recently derided the extra point as the "penny" play of professional football. The smaller but surer choice of a team’s post-touchdown scoring options, it’s just kind of there. Some think it serves little purpose than being the perfect opportunity to run for the fridge or restroom. What’s an NFL exec to do to keep the game spicy and folks glued to their seats? One idea is to spike the extra point. "The extra point is almost automatic," NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said in a recent interview on NFL.com. "I believe we had five missed extra points this year out of 1,200 some odd (attempts). So it's a very small fraction of the play, and you want to add excitement with every play." Goodell mentioned a proposal that would replace the kicked PAT (point after touchdown) and award teams an automatic seven points for a touchdown instead. Then, a coach could gamble by going for an extra point with a run or pass play in the end zone. If they make it, they score eight. If they miss, their score goes back down to six. We are sports-, politics- and stats-loving nerds here at PunditFact, not game-callers, so we’ll conceal our two-cents on the proposal. The reason for it, though, left us intrigued. In honor of the Super Bowl, we wanted to know if Goodell was right about the rarity of missed extra points. Stats are widely available from places like ESPN and the NFL. In this case, they confirm Goodell’s point that the extra-point attempt is mostly a one-point gimme, with just five misses in 1,267 attempts in the 2013 regular season. Of the five missed attempts, four were blocked. Sept. 22: The Green Bay Packers blocked Cincinnati Bengals kicker Mike Nugent’s extra-point attempt in the fourth quarter. Cincinnati won anyway, 34-30. Sept. 22: The Pittsburgh Steelers stuffed a fourth-quarter attempt by Chicago Bears kicker Robbie Gould. The missed PAT was NBD for the Bears, who won 40-23. Nov. 3: Minnesota Vikings kicker Blair Walsh missed his third try for an extra point late in a close game against the Dallas Cowboys. The Vikings lost 27-23. Dec. 8: The Detroit Lions lost to the Philadelphia Eagles 34-20 in a matchup marred by heavy snow. The snow was so intense that Lions kicker David Akers missed his only attempt of the day. He slipped and fell, bringing to mind Charlie Brown, as the Eagles blocked his try. (GIF!) Dec. 22: Jacksonville Jaguars kicker Josh Scobee got a PAT blocked by the Tennessee Titans just before halftime. The Jaguars went on to lose 20-16. The missed PATs by the Jaguars and Vikings could have potentially made a difference in the outcome of the game. Instead of having to shoot for a touchdown to win, those teams could have fought for field-goal range and tried to tie up the game by closing the margin to three points. The league-wide record for missed extra points in 2013 was a low in recent years, down from six misses in 2012, seven in 2011 and 11 in 2010. The latter year was particularly memorable, with the Washington Redskins botching the snap on a PAT attempt that would have tied the game against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers with just seconds to play. And even though it’s comical or crushing depending on your allegiance, let’s relive the notorious wide-right extra point by the New Orleans Saints in 2003. The Saints had the chance to tie up the game against the Jaguars after a near-miraculous touchdown of three lateral passes and no time left on the clock. But nope. Our ruling Let’s sum up our findings: Is the point-after touchdown attempt an almost pre-determined outcome that propels kickers to the top of scoring charts? Yes. More pertinently, did Goodell have his stats straight? Also yes. In football terms, Goodell’s claim is up and it’s GOOD! At PunditFact, we call that True.

pomt-06040	Tampa is "the strip club capital of the world."	false	/florida/statements/2012/jan/13/ellyn-bogdanoff/tampa-strip-club-capital-world/	Fill in the blank: Tampa is known around the world for ______. Is it professional sports teams? Bern's Steak House? Busch Gardens? Kind of feels like we’re dancing around something. Wait, that's it -- strip clubs! Tampa's reputation as a mecca for lusty dance came up in discussion of another vice this week -- gambling. State Sen. Ellyn Bogdanoff, a Fort Lauderdale Republican, wanted to thwart claims that new destination resort casinos she supports would tarnish Florida’s family-friendly rep. "People do not go to South Beach to see Mickey Mouse. They just don't," she said at the end of debate on her gambling bill Monday. "They go there for different reasons. We have the strip club capital of the world in Tampa. I hate to say it out loud, but we do. We have not ruined our family-friendly image." We've heard the same claim about Tampa for years. Maybe visitors remember the clubs because a few are on major roads. On Dale Mabry Highway just north of 275, the Mons Venus boasts "the Most Beautiful Women in the World!" Across the street, 2001 Odyssey's space ship building hovers over the surroundings. Rep. Janet Cruz, D-Tampa, said she doesn't think the title is a fair assessment. "I think that we are more lenient in some of what we allow," she said, "but I'm not sure we are the capital." A bit of evidence-based fact-checking seemed in order. We started by turning to local officials in Tampa, asking how many strip clubs are in the city. Adult stores and clubs -- or places showing "specified anatomical areas" -- must receive special permits for adult use, and pay a business tax, officials said. But the city could not pull a list of clubs of "special cabarets" within its limits, citing computer limitations. The city provided a list of businesses that have paid a business tax for "special cabarets," but there were only five businesses listed. That's not a complete picture of the city's strip clubs. Tampa Police didn't have a count either. We then turned to the business world for an answer, finding Clearwater-based E.D. Publications, a national magazine for the adult entertainment industry. (The "E.D." stands for Exotic Dancer.) The group publishes nationwide guides to night clubs, directories of industry vendors and rosters of touring entertainers. Associate publisher Dave Manack didn't hesitate when asked if Tampa is the strip club capital of the world. "No," he said. "Not even close. Tampa might not even make the Top 20. For anyone in the industry who knows, it’s really not a top market for strip clubs." Cities like New York, Las Vegas or Miami would have much more of a claim on the title, he said. According to the magazine's count, Tampa has 20 night clubs, and the entire Tampa Bay area has 30. Meanwhile, Miami has 30 in the city and 50 in the Miami/Fort Lauderdale corridor. (City of Miami officials did not return calls.) New York City has 45, not including Long Island or New Jersey. Las Vegas has 40 clubs. (We actually tallied 34 licensed nude and topless clubs in the Las Vegas region from local officials there, so counting clubs is not an exact science.) Manack ticked off several strikes against Tampa's claim to the title: Tampa doesn't have as many clubs as larger cities, and high-end national chains like Rick's Cabaret and the Spearmint Rhino have taken a pass on Tampa. The city's clubs are spread out, and because it has no tight-knit cluster to form a party circuit, it has trouble marketing itself as a destination for bachelor parties and conventioneers. Pinellas County shares some of the blame, too, he said. Local rules make it difficult to open high-end clubs near the beaches where dancers can significantly disrobe. "Literally, you could see more at the beach. It does hurt the clubs there," he said. A spokeswoman with another industry group, the Association of Club Executives, also discounted Tampa's place in the strip club world. "Manhattan has many more clubs than the Tampa area," said spokeswoman Angelina Spencer. "And if you’re going to talk about the true strip club capital of the world, it would be Las Vegas." Her association, a political and legal advocacy group for club owners based in Washington, keeps a census that includes 3,829 clubs nationwide, but it will not release numbers by locality. If Tampa isn't the strip club capital of the world, we wondered if perhaps it might be No. 1 on a per capita basis. That metric would account for Tampa being a smaller city than New York or Miami. But a 2006 economic development study from the Tampa Bay Partnership found the city was merely No. 3 for strip clubs on a per capita basis, ranking behind Las Vegas, and -- even more deflating -- Cincinnati. Tampa strip club king Joe Redner told us the title was actually bestowed on the city by opponents of strip clubs who were trying to stop clubs from opening. "It's a misnomer," he said. "That’s what people said when they wanted to get rid of the strip clubs. That's what they labeled us." One opponent is David Caton, executive director of the Florida Family Association. He said that when he looked into the issue six or seven years ago, Tampa had more strip clubs than any other city in the country. His count included businesses that show full nudity and nude modeling shops. But that's at odds with what the 2006 study found. Still, there is a reason Tampa is known nationally for strip clubs, said Manack of E.D. Publications, and that's Joe Redner. "He is one of the most well-known figures in the history of the adult nightclub industry," Manack said. "He's known as a crusader for personal freedom and freedom of speech, and he’s never been afraid of a fight." Bogdanoff told us the strip club capital title was something she heard and read. "It seemed to me that it was pretty well understood," she said. Our ruling Look, we won't lie: We were kind of hoping this claim might be Pants on Fire, if for no other reason than the potential play on words. Hot Pants on Fire! Pants(less) on Fire! Pants off Fire. But we're not quite there, in large part because we were unable to find precise strip club data for Tampa. That said, while people might say Tampa is the strip club capital of the world, the evidence is bare. Experts say Tampa isn't even the strip club capital of Florida. We rate the statement False.

pomt-05968	There are 86 languages spoken at Miami Dade College.	true	/florida/statements/2012/jan/24/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-miami-dade-college-students-speak-86/	Newt Gingrich and Mitt Romney are trying to woo Spanish-speaking voters despite taking stances that have alienated some Hispanics. One of the debate moderators pounced on that hypocrisy at the Jan. 23, 2012, debate in Tampa. Here’s how Beth Reinhard of the National Journal (and a former Miami Herald politics writer) posed her question: "All of you favor making English the official language of the United States, which could mean that ballots and other government documents would not be available in Spanish. But, Speaker Gingrich, you’re sending out press releases in Spanish; Governor Romney, you’re advertising in Spanish. Why is it okay for you to court voters in Spanish, but not okay for the government to serve them in Spanish? Speaker Gingrich?" "Well, first of all, you immediately jump down to a very important language, but not the only language," Gingrich answered. "The challenge of the United States is simple. There are 86 languages in Miami Dade College, 86. There are over 200 languages spoken in Chicago. Now, how do you unify the country? What is the common bond that enables people to be both citizens and to rise commercially and have a better life and a greater opportunity?" To unify the country, Gingrich said, "I think it is essential to have a central language that we expect people to learn and to be able to communicate with each other in." Reinhard: "So to be clear, you would only have ballots in English?" Gingrich: "I would have ballots in English. And I think you could have programs where virtually everybody would be able to read the ballots." We couldn’t resist checking Gingrich’s detail that "there are 86 languages in Miami Dade College." Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond told us in an email that Gingrich was referring to the number of languages spoken by students. First, a word about Miami Dade College. The school calls itself the "largest and most diverse college in the nation." Its website states that it enrolls more minorities than any other college or university in the country, including the most Hispanics. Miami Dade College spokesman Juan Mendieta told us that the 174,000 students speak 85 languages in addition to English, for a total of 86 languages for the 2010-11 year. Those students come from 181 countries. Both numbers are based on what students reported during the admissions process, he said. "It could be potentially more languages -- these are the languages students said they speak," Mendieta said. Mendieta said: "It’s basically representing every one of the four corners of the earth. At graduation we parade across the stage the flags representing the study body. … The last flag on stage, which brings down the house, is the American flag." The college reported in 2010 that English was the native language of half the students, Spanish was the native language of 43 percent, and Creole/French was the third-most common. Among the less common: Assamese (a language spoken in India), Breton (a Celtic language spoken in parts of France) and Wolof (an African language). The 86 languages spoken by students at Miami Dade College were also cited in a proposed 2010 U.S. Senate resolution congratulating Miami Dade College on its 50th anniversary. The college’s diversity and size make it a common stop in recent years for presidents and presidential candidates from both parties. The college was expecting a visit from Romney on Jan. 25, 2012, and a group of students were planning to attend an event with Gingrich at the Univision studio on Jan. 25, said Mendieta. Gingrich said, "There are 86 languages in Miami Dade College, 86." We found that in this case Gingrich has a good memory for detail.

pomt-01706	Uncompensated care has "gone down by 30 percent just in the first few months" of Medicaid expansion in the states that adopted it.	true	/virginia/statements/2014/aug/10/george-barker/sen-george-barker-says-uncompensated-care-has-fall/	Virginia Democrats believe they have found evidence showing states that expand their Medicaid rolls are better off than those that reject expansion. Sen. George Barker, D-Fairfax, told those gathered for an expansion rally in Woodbridge that hospitals in Medicaid expansion states have fewer patients who can’t pay. "Those states who have adopted Medicaid expansion, and half of the states have -- what they have seen just in the first few months of this calendar year, 2014 – is a reduction in uncompensated care," he said. "That means people who show up at the hospital, show up at the emergency department, are uninsured and can’t pay anything – charity care that’s provided by the hospital – that’s gone down by 30 percent just in the first few months." This seems to be an important point for their case, so we wondered about the origin of the figure. First, let’s remember how we got here. The Affordable Care Act -- also known as Obamacare -- gives states the option of expanding Medicaid eligibility. Uncle Sam will pick up the entire tab for new enrollees during the next two years, that slowly declines to 90 percent with state’s picking up the remaining cost.Virginia has estimated that as many as 400,000 state residents could join Medicaid’s rolls. The Republican-controlled House of Delegates refused to broaden the program, saying the federal government can’t be trusted to pay its promised share. That led to a months-long stalemate between the House and the Democratic-controlled Senate on the state’s two-year budget. Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, who earned a Promise Broken by signing a budget that did not include expansion, is exploring whether he can broaden the program without the consent of the legislature. Uncompensated care is a key reason Virginia hospitals have pleaded with legislators to expand Medicaid. Across the country, uncompensated care totaled $45.9 billion in 2012, the most recent year for which data was available, according to the American Hospital Association. It was 6.1 percent of hospitals’ expenses that year. When we asked Barker about his claim, he sent us a link to an article from Governing magazine. The article cites a study from the Colorado Hospital Association that looked at 30 states, 15 with Medicaid expansion and 15 without. In the states with expansion, hospitals had charity care decreases from an average of $2.8 million per hospital in the first quarter of 2013 to $1.9 million per hospital in the first quarter of 2014, a 32 percent drop. And out-of-pocket charges decreased from 4.7 percent of all charges to 3.1 percent of all charges -- a 34 percent drop. Meanwhile, Medicaid charges surged from 15.3 percent to 18.8 percent, a 19 percent jump. While the survey covered a short period of time, the difference between hospitals in states with Medicaid expansion and those without was stark. States that balked at Medicaid expansion saw little change in their uncompensated care levels, the study found. Governing also linked to Arkansas Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe’s May 31 column in which he stated 42 hospitals in the state reported an average of 30 percent decline in uncompensated care. For emergency room visits, the hospitals had an average of 24 percent drop in uncompensated care. Beebe said the survey "was not comprehensive for every acute-care center in the state, but it’s a good snapshot of early progress." Tenet Health, a publicly traded company with 80 hospitals in 14 states, reported that its hospitals in four states that expanded Medicaid saw a 33 percent decline in uninsured and charity admissions in the first quarter this year. In the second quarter, which ended in June, the numbers improved even more. With hospitals in five states that expanded Medicaid, the company had a decline in uninsured and charity admissions of 54 percent. Meanwhile, Medicaid admissions increased 23 percent. We also found an Arizona Daily Star article reporting on a survey of hospitals in the state done by the Arizona Hospital and Healthcare Association. In the first four months of 2014, the association’s hospitals reported a 31 percent drop in uncompensated care expenses compared to the same period in 2013. So this seems to be a broader trend. This is how the law was intended to work, said Gayle Nelson, director of hospital community benefit program at The Hilltop Institute, part of University of Maryland, Baltimore County. "This was all part and parcel of the same anticipation that this would happen," she said. "The need for uncompensated care would reduce and the funds needed to address uncompensated care would also be reduced … This is good news. Of course, in those states where uncompensated care is reduced, that presumably leaves some resources freed up to be used in other ways." The Governing article said the trend was positive, but hospitals are hoping it’s enough to offset cuts called for in the Affordable Care Act. The biggest piece of this will be $39 billion in cuts to the Disproportionate Share Hospital program, which helps hospitals that serve the poor. In Virginia, this primarily means the University of Virginia and Virginia Commonwealth University hospitals. Our ruling Barker said hospitals in states with Medicaid expansion have already benefited from a 30 percent drop in uncompensated care. The evidence is based on the first three months after Medicaid expansion took effect and from a few sources. It’s early, but he accurately reported the results. The statement is True.

pomt-12015	North Carolina is home to "two rivers of the top five most polluted rivers" in the U.S.	false	/north-carolina/statements/2017/sep/20/billy-richardson/nc-democrat-says-states-rivers-are-among-top-5-mos/	It’s one thing to say a couple of North Carolina’s rivers — the Neuse and the Cape Fear — are in danger of becoming very polluted. A report from one reputable environmental advocacy group supports that, and other groups are worried too. It’s another thing to say what state Rep. William "Billy" Richardson said about the Cape Fear and Neuse Rivers on Aug. 31. Richardson, a Fayetteville Democrat, urged his fellow legislators to commit more funding to the state Department of Environmental Quality during a speech on the state House floor. "There are 250,000 rivers in this country," Richardson said. "Two rivers of the top five most polluted rivers are right here in North Carolina." He was referring to the Cape Fear and the Neuse. Are the Cape Fear and the Neuse among America’s top five most-polluted rivers? And where is this "most polluted rivers" list he alludes to? We’ll get to that. First, some background on why Richardson and others, including Gov. Roy Cooper, are so worried about the Cape Fear, in particular. This summer it came to light that the Chemours plant near Fayetteville may have improperly dumped a chemical called GenX into the Cape Fear, which provides drinking water for much of southeastern North Carolina. GenX is used to make Teflon, the nonstick substance that Chemours makes at its Fayetteville Works plant. The state is accusing the company and its predecessor, DuPont, of failing to inform regulators that they were releasing GenX into the river — and earlier this month the state sued Chemours over the discharges. Meanwhile, Cooper and other Democratic legislators want to allot more resources to DEQ so the department can research the spill’s effects. But they’re mad because the Republican-controlled legislature in June cut DEQ’s budget by $1.8 million over the next two years, and DEQ’s leader says the department doesn’t have the funds needed to deal with the Cape Fear chemical pollution long-term. Enter Richardson and his claim about North Carolina being home to two of the top five "most polluted" rivers in the country. The dangers of hog waste Richardson wasn't immediately available for comment. His assistant, Leigh Lawrence, said Richardson was referencing the 2017 edition of the American Rivers organization’s annual "America’s most endangered rivers" list. The list ranks the Cape Fear and Neuse together as the seventh most endangered rivers in America. On the phone, Lawrence acknowledged that Richardson might’ve misspoke but that he "cares deeply" about the environment, referencing a bill he filed earlier this year to try to protect part of the Cape Fear from regulation rollbacks. Richardson, for his part, later called PolitiFact to say that he once saw a list of America's most polluted rivers that supports his argument – but that he's had trouble finding it. Regardless of any lists or rankings, he said, the rivers have serious issues that need to be addressed. "My intention was not to mislead anyone," Richardson said. "Between the numerous articles that point to the troubles on the Neuse and Cape fear basin ... and then you throw in GenX, it’s clear we’ve got a huge issue that we’re not dealing with." Nonetheless, American Rivers told PolitiFact that their "most endangered" list shouldn’t be viewed as a "most polluted" list. In fact, the first page of the report says: "This report is not a list of the nation’s 'worst' or most polluted rivers, but rather it highlights rivers confronted by critical decisions that will determine their future." "The big difference between ’most polluted’ and ‘most endangered’ is that when we list a river as ‘most endangered’ it is because there is a decision that is coming up that depending on how that decision is made will have a major impact on the river," said Peter Raabe, the group’s conservation director for rivers of Southern Appalachia and the Carolinas. In this case, American Rivers is calling on state lawmakers to restore funding to a program that helps farmers move hog waste lagoons out of the floodplain. Hog waste lagoons are outdoor basins where farmers store hog waste. The group’s "most endangered" report doesn’t mention GenX, but is very concerned about hog waste getting into the rivers. The Neuse and Cape Fear River basins "have endured two 500-year floods from hurricanes in less than 20 years, during which dozens of animal waste lagoons within the 100-year floodplain were flooded or breached, discharging millions of gallons of raw animal waste directly into the rivers," the report says. Hurricane Matthew, specifically "partially submerged 10 industrial hog facilities with 39 barns, 26 large chicken-raising operations with 102 barns, and 14 open-air pits holding millions of gallons of liquid hog manure, releasing untreated waste directly into the rivers." The North Carolina Pork Council, for its part, told The Washington Post in October that reports of spills were exaggerated and that there’d been zero waste pits breached and just 11 flooded. Endangered vs. polluted Raabe, among other environmental experts PolitiFact spoke with, said it’s difficult to determine which rivers are the "most polluted" because there are different types of pollution that are all similarly bad. "There are so many things that ‘pollute’ our rivers — GenX, 1,4-Dioxane, untreated sewer water, heavy metals, algal growth, bacteria, wastewater from failing septic, too much water, too little water, spills from oil pipelines, spills from trucks on highways, etc.," Raabe said. "The Neuse and the Cape Fear Rivers have a lot of issues that need to be addressed but so do all the streams that have been impacted by human activity." Should residents be worried? City and county water treatment plants do a great job of testing for and eradicating many pollutants from the water, he said. "The problem is, that water is only treated for pollutants we know about. Chemicals like GenX and many other contaminants of emerging concern are not tested for," Raabe said. Other pollution rankings? So American Rivers doesn’t have a "most polluted" list. PolitiFact wondered if the federal government tracks which rivers are the most polluted. Turns out, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the federal government body that aims to protect human health and the environment) "does not rank waterbodies and we don't keep a list of the most polluted rivers," spokeswoman Enesta Jones said. Experts at other environmental groups that PolitiFact spoke with – including the Upper Neuse Riverkeeper, Environment America and the EPA – echoed Raabe in saying it’s difficult to determine which rivers are most polluted. Every two years, state governments are required to tell the EPA which of their local rivers are impaired. Davina Marraccini, an EPA public affairs specialist, warned the public against comparing reports. "Note that because of differences in state assessment methods, the information on the website should not be used to compare water quality conditions between states or to determine water quality trends," Marraccini wrote in an email. Through Google searches, PolitiFact couldn’t find a comprehensive, definitive list by a reputable organization that describes a North Carolina river as one of the "top five most polluted." Our ruling Richardson said that N.C. is home to two of the "top five" most-polluted rivers in the state. His assistant acknowledged that he might've misquoted the American Rivers "most endangered" list – but PolitiFact looked around to see if other data might support his claim. There’s evidence that the Neuse River and Cape Fear River, in particular, are threatened not only by waste from local farms but by a chemical that state regulators want to investigate. However, PolitiFact found no basis for Richardson’s claim that North Carolina rivers rank among the top five most polluted in the United States. We rate this claim false.

pomt-06311	George Allen's flat tax "plan would actually shrink revenues further than the Perry (flat tax) plan."	false	/virginia/statements/2011/nov/14/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-george-allen-flat-tax-plan-shrinks-/	Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Tim Kaine recently took aim at Republican rival George Allen’s support of a flat tax. In an Oct. 31 news release, Kaine’s campaign linked a statement by Allen to a flat tax proposal recently made by Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who is seeking the GOP presidential nomination. Perry’s plan would allow people to opt out of the current tax system and pay a flat 20 percent federal levy on their income. During a Fox News interview on Oct. 30, the governor did not dispute host Chris Wallace’s assertion that the flat tax proposal, by the estimates of Perry’s campaign, would reduce federal revenue by $4.7 trillion from 2014 to 2020. "I think Americans are ready for Washington, D.C., to quit spending money," Perry said. The next day, Kaine’s campaign put out a statement saying Allen supports a 17 percent flat tax -- lower than Perry’s 20 percent. "That means Allen’s plan would actually shrink revenues further than the Perry plan, forcing even harsher cuts to programs that Virginians depend on," the news release said. We wondered if Kaine was correct in saying Allen backs a flat tax plan that would cut revenues more than Perry’s proposal. Under the Texas governor’s plan, flat tax filers would receive a $12,500 exemption for each dependent and would not pay levies on capital gains and social security benefits. Perry’s proposal would preserve deductions on mortgage interest and charitable contributions, as well as state and local taxes, but phases them out for people with incomes of more than $500,000. He would also drop the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. Flat tax supporters say the lower levies would fuel economic expansion; critics say the plans would sap more revenues than can be made up by added growth. An analysis of Perry’s plan by economic consultants John Dunham and Associates, done at the behest of the Perry campaign, said it could drain about $5 trillion in federal revenues through 2020. What, exactly, is Allen proposing? We’re not sure, and Allen’s campaign isn’t providing many clues. Kaine, in the news release, based his contention that Allen backs a 17 percent flat tax on a statement Allen made during a June 14, 2011, news conference when he released his economic platform. Allen endorsed the concept of an optional flat tax. There are a lot of people who would actually like to say, "Alright, here is my income, multiply it by, say, .17, and file it on one page,’" he said. The Kaine campaign provided us with transcripts and tapes of two other appearances where Allen used the 17 percent flat tax example. In both cases, Allen used the word "say" before he uttered 17 percent, creating some hedge room. Dan Allen, an Allen policy adviser, said the candidate’s wording shows he was throwing out a hypothetical number. A variety of flat tax plans throughout the years have called for flat tax rates of 17 to 25 percent, Dan Allen said. The text of George Allen’s economic proposals, titled "The Blueprint for America’s Comeback," calls for a flat-tax alternative but offers no details. We asked Allen’s campaign for specifics -- such as what percentage of income should be subject to a flat tax and what deductions and exemptions should be allowed. But Dan Allen said the Republican has never settled on a single flat tax plan to support. "To say there’s one Allen plan is not accurate," said Dan Allen, who is not related to George Allen. He referred us to George Allen’s 2010 book, "What Washington can Learn from the World of Sports," in which the Republican said he’s supported a variety of flat tax proposals. One plan lauded in Allen’s book would establish an optional flat levy on combined federal payroll and income taxes, set at 25 percent of gross income. Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said he suspects that proposal would drain more revenue than Perry’s plan because it affects two levies. Perry’s proposal only applies to income tax, not payroll tax. Williams wrote earlier this month that Perry’s proposal "would dramatically reduce tax revenues," by a much as $1 trillion in 2015. But he told us he can’t definitively say whether Allen would cut off more government revenue than Perry because he doesn’t know the details of what Allen is proposing. Our ruling: Kaine says Allen’s flat tax "plan would actually shrink revenues further" than a flat tax proposal made by Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Kaine is correct is in saying Perry endorses a 20 percent flat tax on income, but stretches the truth when he says Allen has made a proposal that would set the rate lower. Allen, while endorsing the concept of an optional flat tax, has offered no plan of his own. The basis of Kaine’s charge are Allen’s statements that a flat tax rate could be set at "say, 17 percent." That’s hardly a plan or an endorsement of a flat tax rate, so there’s no substance to compare to Perry’s proposal. We don’t fault Kaine for demanding specificity from Allen. But Kaine goes too far when he tries to create a plan for Allen based on inconclusive statements. We rate Kaine’s claim False.	None	Tim Kaine	None	None	None	2011-11-14T20:00:00	2011-10-31	['None']

pomt-11772	"Saudi Arabia to Behead 6 School Girls for Being With Their Male Friends Without Parents or a Guardian"	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/nov/29/religionmindcom/fake-news-girls-saudi-arabia-will-be-beheaded-danc/	Don’t listen to the fake news that a group of girls in Saudi Arabia will be killed for dancing at a birthday party. "Saudi Arabia to Behead 6 School Girls for Being With Their Male Friends Without Parents or a Guardian," stated the headline on religionmind.com on Oct. 23. That’s not true. We found the story after Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. Religionmind.com is a fake news website about various religions. We attempted to contact someone at the website but did not get a reply. The "about" section of the website states that it tries to keep the content correct, "yet we make no representations or warranties of any kind, express or implied, about the completeness, accuracy, reliability, suitability ... ." Here’s what the fake news story said: Fathima Al Kwaini was celebrating her birthday at a friend’s house. Tipped off by an assistant of an Imam, police arrived to find the girls dancing with their friends including males. Police arrested the girls. The article then states that the girls were detained for more than a year and that a male-only Sharia panel concluded that they need to be "executed in accordance with the Sharia law." A photo in the article does not back up the narrative. It appears to be the same as a photo by Reuters/Pajhwok News Agency on Aug. 31, 2015, showing an Afghan judge hitting a 22-year-old woman with a whip in front of a crowd in Ghor province, Afghanistan. The article attributed some of the information to "HRW" without explaining what the acronym stands for. We thought it might have been a reference to Human Rights Watch, an organization that tracks human rights abuses across the globe. A researcher at Human Rights Watch, Adam Coogle, told PolitiFact that the story is a fabrication. "Gender mixing in Saudi Arabia can lead to criminal penalties but never the death penalty," he said. So far in 2017 there have been 133 executions in Saudi Arabia, nearly all for murder or drug smuggling. "In terms of executions of children, unfortunately Saudi Arabia is one of the only countries in the world that continues to sentence child offenders to death, and some have eventually been executed, but I’ve never seen an execution of anyone who is under 18 at the time of the execution," he said. In the case of this headline, there is no evidence that these girls were beheaded for being with their male friends. We rate this Pants on Fire.

pomt-14725	"Only nine" coalition nations with the U.S. "are truly actively involved" in fighting the Islamic State.	mostly true	/virginia/statements/2015/dec/22/rob-wittman/rob-wittman-mostly-right-about-few-nations-fightin/	Although dozens of nations have pledged to fight the Islamic State, few actually have joined the U.S. in taking military steps against the group, says U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman, R-1st. During a recent interview on C-SPAN, Wittman said the U.S. could use some help in the air campaign against the Islamic State. "Of the 65 coalition partners, only nine are truly actively involved in these efforts," he said. "This will not be successful if we don’t have those coalition partners involved." We wondered if Wittman is correct that only nine nations have joined the U.S. in taking military action against the Islamic State. Farahn Morgan, Wittman’s spokeswoman, said the congressman got the figure from a Nov. 30 article in The Washington Times. Morgan pointed to a comment in the article from Anthony Cordesman, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, who criticized the White House approach to the air campaign and said, "This is a ‘65-country coalition’ of which only about nine are doing something." The U.S. State Department does indeed count 65 countries as members of a broad coalition aimed at eliminating the Islamic State threat. The department says those nations are participating in different ways: providing military support, stopping the Islamic State’s financing, impeding the flow of foreign fighters into the area, dealing with humanitarian crises, and exposing the "true nature" of the militant group. A Nov. 18 report from the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan fact-finding arm of Congress, offers examples of non-military contributions. They include Switzerland’s $9 million of aid to Iraq -- where the Islamic State is present -- and Japan’s $6 million of aid to help refugees in northern Iraq. The military component of the coalition is Operation Inherent Resolve, and 22 nations have pledged to take part in it, according to CRS. About two-thirds of those countries have provided military personnel to help train local forces to battle the Islamic State. A smaller group of a dozen countries have provided aircraft to take part in airstrikes against Islamic State targets in Syria and Iraq since the military campaign started in August 2014, according to the Department of Defense. Those countries are Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Jordan, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. As of Dec. 9, the U.S.-led coalition had conducted 8,783 airstrikes, according to the Pentagon. The U.S. conducted 6,846 of those attacks, or about four-fifths of them. It’s difficult to get an exact read on the current number of allies still active in the campaign for a couple of reasons. Participation in the military campaign ebbs and flows depending on each nation’s interests, the Congressional Research Service noted in its report. For example, Belgium stopped its airstrikes at the end of June due to budget constraints. Incoming Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced in October that his government would withdraw its combat aircraft, but it’s unclear if that has happened yet, the research service said. Airwars.org, a non-profit that tracks the air war in Iraq and Syria, reported in October that Denmark recalled the seven F-16s it used against the Islamic State, although they may return. The New York Times reported on Nov. 7 that some Arab countries in the coalition, including Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have shifted most of their aircraft away battling the Islamic State and instead focused them on the fight against a rebel uprising in Yemen. Allied officials told the newspaper that the United Arab Emirates hadn’t carried out strikes in Syria since March and Jordan hadn’t done so since August. Qatar flies patrols over Syria, but "its role has been modest," The Times said. Wittman hardly is the first to complain the U.S. isn’t getting enough coalition support in battling the Islamic State. Our colleagues at PolitiFact National recently examined a similar claim by Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and rated it Mostly True. David Weinberg, a senior fellow at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, told PolitiFact that of the dozen allies the Pentagon says actually have conducted airstrikes, "some of those are only symbolic or largely out of date." Weinberg said the countries with the best case for taking a "serious" role in the air campaign, outside of the U.S., are France, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands and Australia. Chris Woods, the director of Airwars.org, said some coalition members are providing auxiliary assistance to the campaign even if they are not taking part in airstrikes. Italy, for example, provides aircraft for in-air refueling, and Germany has said it will provide six Tornado fighter jets for aerial reconnaissance. Michael O’Hanlon, co-director of the Center for 21st Century Security and Intelligence at the Brookings Institution, told us that the figure Wittman uses to tally the number of allies taking part in military action against the Islamic State sounds correct. "I don’t have concrete data, but I’d say that the number nine is roughly correct if one is talking about military action," O’Hanlon wrote in an email. Our ruling Wittman, in arguing the U.S. isn’t getting enough help in the heavy lifting against the Islamic State, said just nine of our international coalition partners are "truly actively involved" in military efforts against the militant group. The figure is credible based on government data and media reports. Thirteen nations have taken part in airstrikes against the group during the past year, according to the Pentagon. There are indications that perhaps half of the countries have suspended their roles against the Islamic State, although they may resume in the future. The lack of transparency from some coalition governments makes it impossible define a precise number at any given time. Also, we should note that some countries are contributing to the military campaign in ways other than airstrikes - such as providing aircraft for refueling, reconnaissance and military personnel to train local forces. With those clarifications, we rate Wittman’s statement Mostly True.	None	Rob Wittman	None	None	None	2015-12-22T08:13:07	2015-12-09	['United_States']
pomt-07486	President Obama has "stopped using the phrase 'war on terror.' "	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/13/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-says-obama-has-stopped-using-phrase-w/	In his book Courage to Stand, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, a potential GOP presidential candidate, said President Barack Obama "needs to do a more forceful job of reminding people about the threat of global terrorism." And that needs to start with calling it by its real name, Pawlenty wrote. "Sadly, President Obama will not call this effort what it is," Pawlenty wrote. "He has stopped using the phrase 'war on terror.' His administration never makes pointed references -- or any references -- to the real problem: radical Islamic terrorism. Apparently that isn't politically correct. The fact is, radical Islamic terrorism exists. Pointing that out doesn't condemn all Muslims. But there is an element of Islam that is radical and that has terrorist intentions. We need to call it what it is. We need to confront it, and we need to defeat it." This isn't the first time Obama has been accused of ducking the phrase "war on terror" or for not attaching the words Islamic or Muslim when talking about violent extremists. Back in November 2009, we checked into a similar claim from Fox News' Sean Hannity that "Barack Obama won't even use the term 'war on terrorism.' " Back then, we did a word search of Obama's public statements and could not find that Obama has used the phrase "war on terrorism" as president, though he said it numerous times as a candidate. Early in his presidency, Obama used the phrase "war on terror," but only a couple of times. And it's true that Obama made a conscious and deliberate decision early in his presidency to avoid the phrase "war on terror" in favor of more precise language. Obama explained his reasoning in several interviews. During a Jan. 27, 2009, interview with Obama, Hisham Melhem of Arabic-language television news station al-Aribiya noted that Obama seemed to eschew President George W. Bush's phrase "war on terror" and "frame it in a different way, specifically against one group called al-Qaida and their collaborators." Said Obama: "I think that you're making a very important point. And that is that the language we use matters. And what we need to understand is, is that there are extremist organizations -- whether Muslim or any other faith in the past -- that will use faith as a justification for violence. We cannot paint with a broad brush a faith as a consequence of the violence that is done in that faith's name. "And so you will, I think, see our administration be very clear in distinguishing between organizations like al-Qaida -- that espouse violence, espouse terror and act on it -- and people who may disagree with my administration and certain actions, or may have a particular viewpoint in terms of how their countries should develop. We can have legitimate disagreements but still be respectful. I cannot respect terrorist organizations that would kill innocent civilians, and we will hunt them down. "But to the broader Muslim world what we are going to be offering is a hand of friendship." The issue was again raised in a Feb. 3, 2009, interview with CNN's Anderson Cooper: Cooper: "I've noticed you don't use the term 'war on terror.' I think I read an article that you've only used it once since inauguration. Is that conscious? Is there something about that term you find objectionable or not useful?" Obama: "Well, you know, I think it is very important for us to recognize that we have a battle or a war against some terrorist organizations. But that those organizations aren't representative of a broader Arab community, Muslim community. ... You know, words matter in this situation because one of the ways we're going to win this struggle is through the battle of hearts and minds." Cooper: "So that's not a term you're going to be using much in the future?" Obama: "You know, what I want to do is make sure that I'm constantly talking about al-Qaida and other affiliated organizations because we, I believe, can win over moderate Muslims to recognize that that kind of destruction and nihilism ultimately leads to a dead end, and that we should be working together to make sure that everybody has got a better life. Based on those facts, we rated Hannity's claim True. But when former Vice president Dick Cheney took the meme a step further and alleged that Obama will not "admit we're at war," we rated Cheney's claim Pants in Fire. Here, Pawlenty's claim is closer to Hannity's. So first we checked Obama's public statements since our previous fact-check to see if he has stuck to this line and avoided the phrase "war on terror" or anything like "radical Islamic terrorism." And he has. In May 2010, John Brennan, assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism, addressed the topic in some detail: "The president’s strategy is absolutely clear about the threat we face," Brennan said in an address at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. "Our enemy is not 'terrorism' because terrorism is but a tactic. Our enemy is not 'terror' because terror is a state of mind, and as Americans we refuse to live in fear. Nor do we describe our enemy as 'jihadists' or 'Islamists' because jihad is a holy struggle, a legitimate tenant of Islam, meaning to purify oneself or one’s community, and there is nothing holy or legitimate or Islamic about murdering innocent men, women and children. "Indeed, characterizing our adversaries this way would actually be counterproductive. It would play into the false perception that they are religious leaders defending a holy cause, when in fact they are nothing more than murderers, including the murder of thousands upon thousands of Muslims." "Moreover," Brennan said, "describing our enemy in religious terms would lend credence to the lie—propagated by al-Qaida and its affiliates to justify terrorism—that the United States is somehow at war against Islam. The reality, of course, is that we never have been and will never be at war with Islam. After all, Islam, like so many faiths, is part of America. "Instead, the president’s strategy is clear and precise. Our enemy is al-Qaida and its terrorist affiliates. For it was al-Qaida who attacked us so viciously on 9/11 and whose desire to attack the United States, our allies, and our partners remains undiminished. And it is its affiliates who have taken up al-Qaida’s call to arms against the United States in other parts of the world. "The president’s strategy is unequivocal with regard to our posture. The United States of America is at war. We are at war against al-Qaida and its terrorist affiliates. That is why the president is responsibly ending the war in Iraq, which had nothing to do with 9/11, and why he has refocused our efforts on Afghanistan, where al-Qaida continues to plot from the tribal regions along the border with Pakistan and inside of Pakistan." More recently, in remarks at the Adams Center, a nonprofit that runs community centers and mosques, on March 6, 2011, Denis McDonough, deputy national security adviser to the president, spoke about the strategy of the Obama administration's words. "President Obama recognizes that through our words and deeds we can either play into al-Qaida’s narrative and messaging, or we can challenge it and thereby undermine it," McDonough said. "We’re determined to undermine it." In his book, Pawlenty claims Obama has stopped using the phrase "war on terror" and his administration "never makes pointed references -- or any references -- to the real problem: radical Islamic terrorism." We found several instances in which Vice President Joe Biden has talked about "radical extremism" or "radical fundamentalism" and the need to aggressively confront "violent extremism and radical ideologies." But he never attaches the words "Islamic" to those phrases. And neither has Obama. As Obama and members of his administration have repeatedly explained, this is a very conscious decision to be more precise about the enemy, al-Qaida and other terrorist affiliates and not to feed into the al-Qaida message that America is somehow at war with Islam. You may agree or disagree with Obama's word choices, or with Pawlenty's, but Pawlenty is correct about Obama's deliberate decision not to use the phrases "war on terror" or "radical Islamic terrorism." We rate his statement True.	None	Tim Pawlenty	None	None	None	2011-04-13T13:39:57	2011-01-11	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-02973	"As a result of Obamacare, we are becoming something of a part-time employment country."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/22/maria-bartiromo/bartiromo-says-obamacare-turning-us-part-time-empl/	Among the many problems that critics of Obamacare like to highlight, one of the more common is that the health care law undermines jobs and the economy. This was Maria Bartiromo’s theme when she was on NBC’s Meet the Press. Bartiromo, anchor of CNBC’s Closing Bell, said the glitches that have beset the rollout of Obamacare are not the only issue. "Businesses have changed their plans as a result of Obamacare," Bartiromo said. "We are becoming something of a part-time employment country. We're seeing some groups moved off of health care from business because business is complaining that it's too expensive." If we boil that down, we have this claim to check: "As a result of Obamacare, we are becoming something of a part-time employment country." Our research finds Bartiromo’s claim flawed. Not because we don’t have a lot of part-timers. We do. But the overwhelming driver is a lackluster recovery, not Obamacare. And when you look at the past, the percentage of part-timers has been even higher than it is today. A closer look We contacted CNBC and they pointed us to a couple of articles on Bartiromo’s behalf. One from Red Alert Politics, a website affiliated with the Weekly Standard and Washington Examiner, gave examples of companies that have said they will shift or might shift to using more part-time help. They said they would do this to avoid the Obamacare rule that firms of 50 or more employees must offer health insurance to anyone working 30 hours or more. The list included White Castle, the hamburger chain, and Trig’s, a Wisconsin supermarket chain. (The rule, which was supposed to go into effect Jan. 1, 2014, has been delayed by one year.) Another item was an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal. The CEO of a company that owns several fast-food chains, among them Hardee’s, made the claim that the "numbers show" that Obamacare is affecting hiring. The proof? The job numbers that came right after the administration announced in early July a one-year delay of the requirement that all larger employers offer health insurance. "Full-time job creation rebounded and part-time employment subsided," the CEO, Andrew Puzder, wrote. "In July and August, the economy lost 20,000 part-time jobs and added 132,000 full-time jobs." But that's a historical trend that coincides with the American summer; not necessarily a statement on Obamacare. Between June and August, historically, part-time employment falls and full-time employment increases -- partly because better weather boosts seasonal work in the construction and tourism industries. Numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that between 2003 and 2007, the average drop in part-time work was -.28 percent from July to August, while the average rise in full-time employment was 0.2 percent. It’s also worth noting that the firms that have announced plans to reduce hours for part-timers tend to be in fast food and retail. These industries might have a special reason to keep an eye on the employer mandate in the Affordable Care Act. They tend to use part-timers more than other sectors of the economy. The average hours worked per week by non-supervisory staff in fast-food restaurants was 25.7 in 2012 and in retail, the figure was 31.6. But for financial services, it was 37.4, manufacturing was 40.7 and construction was 38.8. For fast-food and retail, increasing the use of part-time work could be a viable strategy. That doesn’t mean they represent the entire job market. It’s the economy A report from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco puts the current situation into context. The recession drove up the fraction of part-time workers from about 17 percent in 2007 to a peak of 19.7 percent in 2010. It has declined since then. As of the latest data, it stands at 19 percent. The study’s bottom line is that recessions drive up the fraction of the workforce who are in part-time jobs when they would rather be working full-time. The 1983 recession pushed the share of part-timers to 20.3 percent. That’s significantly higher than the peak for the 2008 recession. What’s different this time though is that the part-time employment rate has remained higher for many more months than in past recessions. The authors put the cause squarely at the feet of the overall economy. "The U.S. labor market has recovered only about three-fourths of the jobs lost during the recession and its aftermath, which leaves finding a full-time job still challenging for many workers," they said. "General labor market slack remains the key factor keeping part-time employment high." The report considers whether the Affordable Care Act could be shaping employers' hiring decisions, but concludes that other factors -- including long-standing IRS rules -- suggest the ACA has not made a significant change. "Before the law was passed, most large employers already faced IRS rules that prevented them from denying available health benefits to full-time workers. These rules gave employers an incentive to create part-time jobs to avoid rising health benefit costs." Our ruling Bartiromo said under Obamacare "we are becoming something of a part-time employment country." There is anectdotal evidence that some companies are or will reduce the hours of some employees. But those individual instances fail to make a case of moving to a "part-time employment country." Government numbers actually show that the fraction of part-timers in the workforce has declined since 2010 and in a longer historical perspective, the share of part-timers was less during this recession than in the downturn of 1983. The argument that the delay of the employer mandate boosted full-time hires is suspect. We see the same trend in previous years well before President Barack Obama was elected. An independent analysis suggests that the lack of full-time work is the most significant explanation for a persistently high share of part-time work in the labor force. We rate the claim False.

pomt-04167	Thanks to actions by the Milwaukee County Board on the 2013 budget, the amount of county taxes on the average home in the city of Milwaukee "would be a $19 decrease."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/dec/19/marina-dimitrijevic/Milwaukee-County-Board-chairwoman-touts-decrease-i/	When the Milwaukee County Board completed its work on the 2013 budget in November 2012, the property tax levy was about $4 million higher than it was for the current year. Supervisors overrode 22 of 24 budget vetoes from County Executive Chris Abele, thwarting his effort to create a budget that included no increase. The final 2013 budget tallied $1.3 billion, with $279.3 million coming from property taxes. That’s an increase of 1.4 percent. County Board Chairwoman Marina Dimitrijevic defended the board’s budget in a Nov. 14, 2012, interview on WTMJ-AM (620), noting the budget boosted public safety. But then she touted the tax levy increase as a decrease for City of Milwaukee taxpayers. Huh? Here’s how Dimitrijevic explained it: "If you live in the City of Milwaukee, the City of Milwaukee our largest municipality, the 1.4 percent that we increased taxes this year -- lower than inflation, like the city of Milwaukee, like Ozaukee County – in the city of Milwaukee on the average home, would be a $19 decrease. And I think that’s a small price to pay for enhanced public safety." With property tax bills landing in mailboxes, time for a refresher course on how this all works. County Board fiscal and budget analyst Steve Cady said the claim was based on City of Milwaukee property revaluations, which were set in spring 2012. These are done annually to keep up with changes in the housing market. The average Milwaukee house had an assessed value of about $106,000. The tax rate set in the county budget is about $5.25 per $1,000 of assessed value. That’s up 54 cents. (On the tax bill, the county tax rate is lumped together with the rate to support the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission, but that group’s portion of the bill is tiny.) How much you owe is determined by the value of your house. In the 2012 reassessment, the average home in the city fell from $122,793 to $106,000. That means even though the tax rate went up, the bill for the county share of taxes went down on that home by about $19. So in dollars and cents terms, Dimitrijevic is correct. But there’s a lot more to the story. Across the country the value of residential property got hammered in the real estate bust, and Milwaukee was no exception. Between the beginning of 2008 and 2012, total assessed residential property value in Milwaukee fell by about 30 percent, said assessment commissioner Mary Reavey. Of course, it depends on your neighborhood and condition of your home -- some losses could be much higher (or lower) than others. "Most people don’t cheer when their major asset goes down in value," noted Paula Hogan, a certified financial planner who operates her own firm in Glendale. But, in effect, that is what Dimitrijevic is suggesting Milwaukee property owners do. What about the reverse? Should homeowners want their house values and tax bill to increase? Not necessarily, said Michael Arnow, a certified financial planner with Menomonee Falls-based Sattell, Johnson, Appel Financial Advisory LLC. "A higher assessment is a double-edged sword," he said. "If your tax bill goes up, you pay more taxes. Who wants to pay more taxes? If the value of your home goes up and you are a retiree on a fixed income you can be priced out of your neighborhood." In the case of this year’s bills, property owners may be paying somewhat less in taxes but the long-term loss is more serious, experts said. For that average City of Milwaukee homeowner, the total tax bill for all taxing units this year would be $3,175, down about $107 from a year ago. That’s a small amount compared with the $16,000 in lost property value. Said Hogan: "If taxes are going down because the assessed value is going down, that’s not a good thing." Our rating Dimitrijevic said the average city of Milwaukee homeowner would pay $19 less in county property taxes next year. She is correct on the bottom-line number. But by highlighting it as a piece of good news, she is leaving out critical information that would give a different impression.

pomt-10059	"In Chicago, school is never canceled" because of winter weather.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/28/barack-obama/obama-says-chicago-schools-never-close-snow/	A veteran of many frosty winters in the Windy City, President Obama was incredulous to find out that classes at his daughters' new schools in Washington, D.C., had been canceled due to icy road conditions. "Can I make a comment that is unrelated to the economy very quickly?" Obama told reporters in a light moment at a gathering with business leaders on Jan. 28. "And it has to do with Washington. My children's school was canceled today. Because of, what? Some ice?" "As my children pointed out, in Chicago, school is never canceled," Obama said. "In fact, my 7-year-old pointed out that (during a winter storm) you'd go outside for recess. You wouldn't even stay indoors. So, I don't know. We're going to have to try to apply some flinty Chicago toughness." According to an AP report, Obama was asked if he meant the people of the national's capital are wimps, to which Obama responded: "I'm saying, when it comes to the weather, folks in Washington don't seem to be able to handle things." Chicago gets an average of about 3 feet of snow a year. Is it possible they don't need snow days? Turns out it's been 10 years. "The last time we had a snow day was on Jan. 4 and 5 of 1999," said Malon Edwards, spokesman for the Chicago Public Schools. That's when the Windy City got socked with 22 inches of snow, at the time the second-largest snowstorm in Chicago history. "We very rarely cancel for snow days." In mid January of this year, when temperatures dipped into negative numbers (sans wind chill), the school district told parents if they felt it was unsafe to send their kids to school that day, it'd be okay to keep them at home. But school stayed open. We should note that D.C. public schools weren't actually closed on Jan. 28. They opened two hours late. But Obama's daughters, Malia and Sasha, attend the private Sidwell Friends School, which canceled classes. Most school districts in the Washington suburbs also closed. Obama is right that snow days are amazingly rare in Chicago — there haven't been any in the last decade — but we'll cruelly ding him for saying "never." Mostly True.

pomt-12697	ShopRite will lose about 300 employees "voluntarily and through layoffs" due to the beverage tax.	half flip	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/mar/13/jeffrey-brown/did-shoprite-owner-say-philly-soda-tax-would-mean-/	Philadelphia soda distributors and supermarkets have said the beverage tax that went into effect Jan. 1 has caused significant decreases in beverage and total sales, forcing them to either drastically cut hours or lay off employees. Pepsi recently announced its plans to lay off up to 100 employees over three distribution plants within the city after experiencing a 40 percent dip in sales apparently from the new tax, and Canada Dry Delaware Valley also blamed recent months’ low sales for new layoffs. But the most significant reaction so far comes from Jeffrey Brown, owner of six ShopRite stores in Philadelphia and 10 in the Delaware Valley, who told Philly.com last month that he expected to lose about 300 employees "voluntarily and through layoffs" this spring. Two days after the article was published, though, on Fox 29, he ditched the part about layoffs and said he expects some attrition as his stores are forced to cut hours. "There will be some attrition, what happens when people don’t get enough hours, we’re unionized, so it goes by seniority, so when the new people, people that have been with us for like less than a year they get their hours cut. And when it gets cut beyond a certain point it’s not really worth their while to have the job and they start looking for other employment and the ones that don’t, we have to balance the numbers overtime," he told Fox 29. It wasn’t clear in that interview whether Brown had just forgotten to mention the layoffs he previously claimed were coming, or if he purposely steered in a different direction. But, in a follow up Philly.com article published Feb. 23, he referenced layoffs again, saying, "There’s no way of knowing the layoff number, but 280, 300 jobs will be gone one way or the other. If a person quits or goes on unemployment, or I lay them off, the jobs will be gone." The city has insisted businesses have been overreacting in their opposition to the tax, noting that the American Beverage Association last year spent over a million dollars in advertisements opposing Mayor Kenney’s plan to tax sugary beverages to pay for Philadelphia children to attend pre-K. Kenney's spokesperson, Lauren Hitt, noted, "Brown is part of the same industry that spent ten million dollars and made plenty of misleading claims trying to kill the tax last year." She also said via e-mail: "We feel that Philadelphians should be skeptical of any unverifiable numbers that Brown or any other members of the soda industry put out." Marc Stier, Director of the Pennsylvania Budget and Policy Center, is also skeptical of Brown's claim that there's been a 40 to 50 percent drop in ShopRite's beverage sales, and a 15 percent dip in overall sales. He said he doubts the drop in beverage sales could account for that high a level of overall losses, referencing Progressive Grocer's 2016 Annual Consumers Expenditure Study that shows soda makes up only four percent of nationwide grocery store sales. But John Stanton, a St. Joe’s professor who’s specialized in food marketing for decades, asserts that Brown's numbers make sense. He said it's unlikely shoppers will substitute their sugary beverages with healthier options. "I just think that’s kind of a ridiculous conclusion to draw," he said, "Now, is it possible that someone is going to say, ‘Let’s buy just two liters of coke?’ It’s not like they’re going to say, ‘Let’s buy fresh carrots with the money we’re going to save,' because the two liters of coke taxed are going to cost as much as the three liters of coke untaxed, so it’s not like they have a lot of extra money." He also says the beverage section is, in general, the most important section for a supermarket. Stores usually display soda and drink products in several areas throughout the store. Their sales tend to make up a large amount of total sales revenue. And, aside from the profit made when shoppers buy the product, supermarkets also make revenue through promotional allowances. That’s when a distributor (say, Pepsi) pays the store to display its product on an end cap, which is the small, outward facing section on the end of an isle. If shoppers at a supermarket start buying less Pepsi, Pepsi gives the supermarket less money in promotional allowances. So, by selling less of a product like Pepsi, the store not only loses sales revenue, but it sacrifices even more revenue from lost promotional allowances. Soda is generally a common product displayed on end caps and thus often contributes to a store's promotional revenue. "Supermarkets rely on these promotional payments," Stanton said. Karen Meleta, a spokesperson for Brown, emphasized that the stores aren't only selling less soda, but they're also selling less of other products the tax covers: some sugary syrups and dairy alternatives like cashew and almond milk. "If all people just stopped buying Coke and Pepsi, we probably would have been fine," she said. But, because of the variety of products now taxed, she said the ShopRite stores are losing thousands of customers to stores outside the city, where the same products are now less expensive. Kenney has insisted sales will rebound to normal levels in time, citing examples from tobacco and liquor taxes, but Stanton objects to that claim, too. He said shoppers are habitual. Once they create a routine, they tend to stick to it. "I have a feeling [Kenney's] not a very good food marketer," he said. And Meleta said though she doesn't know whether sales for beverages not included in the soda tax have increased, if they have, it hasn't leveled out the overall losses. This all explains how the tax may contribute to revenue loss, but what about the discrepancy between layoffs and attrition? Though Brown did mention the possibility of layoffs, Meleta said no employees have been laid off. However, there has been up to a 6,000 hour reduction, and up to 300 employees have since left voluntarily, she said. Stanton said this is a reasonable result of significant decreases in beverage sales. He explained supermarket budgets are driven by revenue. If revenue goes down, there’s very little supermarkets can do other than cut hours. Ultimately, it’s up to management to decide how to distribute hours, whether to decrease hours for a large number of employees or to let some people go in order to pay others a "livable wage." "To me, cutting people’s hours and letting people go, they’re the same thing," Stanton added. Our Ruling What we're judging here isn't the possibility of the beverage tax costing ShopRite stores 15 percent of their total sales or whether that necessitates substantially cutting hours. We're just checking to see if Brown has remained consistent in his explanation of how he is losing employees. Though Brown has distanced himself from his early use of the word "layoff," a Philly.com article from Feb. 23 directly quotes him using it. He never definitively said layoffs were going to happen, but he mentioned the possibility. And on Fox 29, he didn’t deny the possibility of layoffs, he just didn’t use that word. In both cases his explanation was ambiguous. However, when we reached out to Brown to clarify his statements, a spokeswoman for him, Karen Meleta, said he had not made any reference to possibly laying off employees, and that there have been no layoffs to date. So, even if the tax is responsible for reduced profits in Brown's supermarket, causing him to have to cut hours and lose employees, he has clearly been inconsistent in citing layoffs or attrition. We rate the claim a Half-Flip.	None	Jeffrey Brown	None	None	None	2017-03-13T11:00:00	2017-02-21	['None']

The headline on a Sept. 18, 2017, post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org read, "Breaking: Susan Rice arrested for criminal ‘unmasking’ of Trump officials." The post was flagged by Facebook users as part of the social media website’s efforts to combat fake news. The story said "federal officers" raided her office in Provo, Utah, to gather evidence, and Rice was escorted out in handcuffs. "Rice is expected to be charged with multiple felony counts of espionage and other high crimes, and will be lucky if she ever sees the outside of a prison cell again in her life," the post read. Rice isn’t under arrest, because the story is fake. Every story on TheLastLineOfDefense.org is fake. The site is the creation of a man named Christopher Blair, a liberal troll who has told PolitiFact that he created the fake news outlet in order to post absurd stories that would trick conservative readers. A note at the bottom of the website revealed that "everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction." Its About Us page carried a disclaimer that read, "We present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist." The site has been the source of dozens of claims that get reposted on other sites with no indication the articles are fake. The hook to the story is the real news that Rice had asked the National Security Agency to reveal the names of several senior Trump officials in intelligence reports about the presidential campaign and transition. Rice told U.S. House of Representatives investigators she did so to determine why Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the crown prince of of United Arab Emirates, had visited New York in December 2016, CNN reported. The prince met with former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner and former strategist Steve Bannon at Trump Tower. United Arab Emirates officials did not tell President Barack Obama’s administration the prince was visiting, which broke with diplomatic practice. The country later tried to set up back-channel communications between the Trump White House and Russia. Trump in April had accused Rice of possibly committing a crime by seeking the names of the Trump officials involved, but there’s no evidence that’s the case. In any event, the post about Rice’s arrest is a bogus report concocted by a prolific online troll. We rate the statement Pants On Fire!

pomt-14364	"North Carolina spends $855 less per student than it did before the Great Recession, and we have one of the lowest per pupil spending levels in the nation."	mostly true	/north-carolina/statements/2016/mar/21/roy-cooper/cooper-says-north-carolinas-education-spending-stu/	Attorney General Roy Cooper, who has won the Democratic nomination to challenge Republican Gov. Pat McCrory, unveiled his education plan March 8. Education is a large chunk of the state budget, and it’s a hot topic for both Republicans and Democrats. Cooper’s plan lays out eight basic goals, and it slams McCrory and the Republican-led General Assembly for cutting taxes rather than putting more money into public schools. The Great Recession began in December 2007 and forced states to slash budgets. North Carolina cut many areas, including K-12 education, and Cooper says funding still hasn’t bounced back. "North Carolina spends $855 less per student than it did before the Great Recession, and we have one of the lowest per pupil spending levels in the nation," Cooper’s plan reads. The question of whether higher per-pupil spending generates better academic results is another debate entirely. For now, we’ll just focus on the numbers. So does Cooper ace this math problem? Or will his former teachers want to dock him points for his statement? It turns out that like many claims about education funding, it’s complicated – especially the part about "$855 less." One of the country’s lowest spending levels First, the easy part. Does North Carolina spend less per student than most states? The National Education Association, a teacher’s union that has been tracking all sorts of public school funding data for 70 years, says yes. It reported North Carolina’s per-pupil spending was $8,615 in 2007 (compared with a national average of $9,663). It was $8,867 in 2008 (national average $10,259), and $8,632 in 2014 (national average $11,355). Those numbers show North Carolina has been falling further behind the national average. NEA’s 2015-16 report isn’t out yet, but in 2014-15 it ranked North Carolina 46th out of 51, counting all the states and Washington, D.C., in per-pupil expenditure. That backs up Cooper’s claim that "we have one of the lowest per pupil spending levels in the nation." A U.S. Census Bureau report on 2013 per-pupil funding also ranks North Carolina as one of the lowest states. However, the Census hasn’t released more up-to-date numbers. Face value versus inflation However, those NEA numbers show North Carolina’s per-pupil spending is actually higher than it was in 2007 and only slightly lower than in 2008, certainly not $855 lower. So what about Cooper’s claim that North Carolina spends $855 less per student than before the recession? First let’s define two terms: real dollars and nominal dollars. Nominal value refers to a number’s face value. Real value is the inflation-adjusted figure. Cooper appears at first glance to reference nominal dollars. In that case, he would be wrong. But even though he didn’t mention inflation, the numbers Cooper cited did account for it. And that’s important, because inflation has risen by about 10 percent since the recession began, according to the federal government’s CPI Inflation Calculator. For example, if you made $40,000 in 2008 and didn’t make at least $44,034.14 in 2015, you’re facing the same type of hurt that Cooper is talking about here – not a cut per se, but a loss of purchasing power nonetheless. Cooper’s campaign pointed us to the source of his claim, a report from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities that did find an inflation-adjusted drop of $855 per student since the recession. But that report was from October 2014 – about 17 months ago. There’s an updated report from this January which shows that in the past year, North Carolina has been moving closer to pre-recession numbers. In fact, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities said North Carolina’s increase from 2014 to 2015 was the fifth-largest in the country in terms of percent change. Other numbers and sources Unsatisfied with the report from 2014, we looked at some more recent numbers. It turns out that depending on whether you count total funding or just state funding, Cooper’s claim – though based on outdated numbers – is still right in the middle of the range. Using state numbers from the Department of Public Instruction and combined state, federal and local numbers from the National Education Association, we adjusted the 2008 numbers for inflation. Then we compared it with the most recent available data, which was 2015 for the state and 2014 for all sources combined. The combined per-pupil spending is down $1,118. State spending by itself is down $481. So Cooper’s claim of "$855 less" is right in the middle of that range. Our ruling Cooper is right that North Carolina is one of the states that spends the least per student. When citing the actual amount he used a report that, while not inaccurate, was outdated. And more context and transparency would’ve been helpful. But Cooper is still right in the general sense that North Carolina’s public schools have less purchasing power than before the recession, and that almost every other state spends more money on education per student than North Carolina. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Roy Cooper	None	None	None	2016-03-21T16:38:23	2016-03-08	['None']
pomt-01468	"We have a goal of 10 percent of [City of Providence] contracts going to women and minority businesses. In reality, less than 1 percent of contracts go to women and minority businesses."	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2014/oct/01/jorge-elorza/elorza-says-less-1-providence-contracts-go-women-m/	During a debate last month on Latino Public Radio with Michael Solomon, then his opponent for the Democratic nomination for Providence mayor, Jorge Elorza said that if elected he would do more to support minority- and women-owned businesses in Rhode Island’s capital. "We have a goal of 10 percent of city contracts going to women and minority businesses," he said, referring to a City of Providence initiative. "In reality, less than 1 percent of contracts go to women and minority businesses." Elorza’s statement came on Aug. 28, before he went on to beat Solomon in the Sept. 9 primary. He now faces independent Vincent A. "Buddy" Cianci Jr. and Republican Daniel Harrop in the November general election to succeed Angel Taveras as mayor. Elorza has made the awarding of city contracts an issue in his campaign. He first made a claim about the lack of contracts going to minorities and women in an April 16 post to his campaign website that announced his "Equity in Business Opportunity" proposal. In that statement, he said the figure stood at "approximately 1%." Has Providence really fallen so far short of its goal in awarding contracts to minorities and women? While we waited for Elorza’s campaign to provide the basis for the claim, we found the city ordinance from 1990 that set goals for minority and women contracts. The ordinance is actually more ambitious than what Elorza described. It has goals of 10 percent of contracts for minorities and 10 percent for women, or 20 percent total -- double the percentage Elorza cited. Charles Newton, of the Rhode Island Minority Business Enterprise, pointed this out to us. Taveras’s office confirmed it. The ordinance notes that in 1990 and in the two previous years, less than 1 percent of contracts went to such firms. (In the Providence Code of Ordinances, see Chapter 21, Article II, Section 21-52.) When John Taraborelli, a spokesman for Elorza, got back to us, he said Elorza’s statement about the low percentage of contracts awarded to minorities and women was based on a 2013 GoLocalProv story. That story reviewed minutes of all the meetings held by the Providence Board of Contract and Supply from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 2012. Of $185.8 million awarded in contracts in 2012, only $1.6 million -- less than 1 percent -- went to companies owned by minorities, according to the story. Taraborelli also said the campaign followed up with Brian Hull, Providence’s Director of municipal and intergovernmental affairs. Hull said the analysis of the 2012 numbers was accurate, according to Taraborelli. We spoke with Hull ourselves and he brought up several caveats when trying to analyze city contracts and also gave us more up-to-date figures. First, the caveats. Not all city contracts go before the Board of Contract and Supply. The board reviews and authorizes city purchases of $5,000 or more. Anything less than $5,000 is put out to bid by city departments, so those smaller contracts aren’t included in the records of the board. In addition, for businesses to be considered as owned by minorities or women they must be certified by the state. However, not all businesses that could qualify decide to go through the certification process, which can be lengthy, said Hull. If those non-certified firms get city contracts, they aren’t counted as owned by minorities or women. Now for the updated number. After Mayor Taveras took office in 2011, his administration formed a task force to bump up the number of contracts awarded to minority firms and studied innovative purchasing programs in other cities, including San Antonio, Texas and Bridgeport, Conn. The efforts resulted in an increase. For 2013, the share of contracts awarded by the Board of Contract and Supply to minority- or women-owned businesses stood at 2.3 percent of the $208 million in purchases that year, according to an analysis done by Hull’s office. That’s about triple the equivalent figure of 0.8 percent for 2012. To put the Providence number in perspective, we talked to Newton, the assistant administrator of the Rhode Island Minority Business Enterprise, the state agency that certifies minority businesses. The state has a requirement of 10 percent of all purchasing going to minority or women businesses. That share currently stands at between 4.5 and 5 percent, according to Newton. Our ruling Jorge Elorza said that Providence has a goal of awarding 10 percent of city contracts to businesses owned by minorities or women, but that in reality less than 1 percent of contracts go to such firms. Elorza got both parts of the claim wrong. The goal is actually 10 percent for minorities and 10 percent for women, for a total of 20 percent. And the latest figures show that, in 2013, 2.3 percent of city contracts went to minorities, more than double the outdated 2012 figure Elorza cited. The difference in the 2012 figure and the 2013 figure is large when the numbers are considered in relation to each other. However, even though there has been an increase, 2.3 percent is still well short of the 20-percent goal. Elorza’s larger point -- that the city needs to act aggressively if it wants to meet policy goals in how it awards contracts-- may be valid, but the numbers he uses to support that claim are way off. We rule his statement Mostly False. (If you have a claim you’d like PolitiFact Rhode Island to check, e-mail us at politifact@providencejournal.com. And follow us on Twitter: @politifactri.)

pomt-09196	Bill McCollum on the Arizona immigration law.	full flop	/florida/statements/2010/may/27/bill-mccollum/bill-mccollum-sends-mixed-signals-arizonas-immigra/	Arizona's controversial immigration law has proven problematic for Florida Republicans, who in large part appear wary of fully endorsing a proposal that's supported by a majority of Floridians but one that also could cost votes among Florida's Hispanic population. The tightrope-walking act is perhaps no more apparent than when it comes to Attorney General Bill McCollum, a Republican running for governor. McCollum's primary opponent , Rick Scott, unabashedly supports the law, which will require local law enforcement officials, once police stop a person, to verify the immigration status of those they reasonably suspect of being in the country illegally. The law is also supported by a 58 percent of Floridians, according to a May 2010 St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald/Bay News 9/Central Florida News 13 poll. We decided to rate McCollum's statements on the Arizona law using our Flip-O-Meter, which measures how consistent someone has been when taking a position on an issue. Before we get to that, though, we need to give you a quick history of how the Arizona law came to pass. The bill in question originally was signed into law on April 23, 2010, by Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer. An amended version of the bill -- one to lessen the prospects that racial profiling could occur -- passed and was signed into law on April 30. The new version of the law says: "A law enforcement official or agency of this state or a county, city, town or other political subdivision of this state may not consider race, color or national origin in implementing the requirements of this subsection except to the extent permitted by the United States or Arizona Constitution." The prior version had said that an official "may not solely consider race" in such circumstances. The change in the bill -- though its impact can be debated -- is important to note when discussing McCollum's position, since his first comments refer to the first version of the bill, while later comments refer to the second version. McCollum's first published comments about the Arizona law came on April 27, after the original bill had passed. He was asked whether he would like a Florida version of Arizona's law. "I think Arizona has its own unique problems," McCollum said. "I don't think Florida should enact laws like this -- quite that far out." Then in stories on May 13 and May 14 -- after the amended version of Arizona's law passed -- McCollum about-faced and said he would support a Florida version. "As state and local law enforcement officials in Arizona begin to implement the state's aggressive new border security law to crackdown on illegal immigration, I applaud Gov. Brewer and the Arizona Legislature for stepping up their enforcement efforts at a time when President Obama's administration has let states down," McCollum said. "I support Arizona's law as amended, and if the federal government fails to secure our borders and solve the problem of illegal immigration, I would support a similar law for Florida." And he also said: "Arizona leaders recently made needed changes that address concerns I had that the law could be abused and misused to perform racially profiled stops and arrests. I do not support any measure that would result in racial profiling or other unintended consequences for law-abiding American citizens.'' Then, on May 16, came another comment to a television reporter in Port St. Lucie. This time, McCollum said he didn't think an Arizona-style immigration law was needed in Florida. "I didn't change my position, but Arizona changed its law after they passed a law that was very bad (and) that had that the potential for racial profiling," McCollum said. He was then asked if it was realistic that a similar law might be passed in Florida. "We don't need that law in Florida," he said. "That's not what's going to happen here." McCollum's most recent comments were picked up on by the Scott campaign, which highlighted the quote in a television ad. McCollum called the original version of the Arizona immigration law far out, but then said he would support the amended law being adopted in Florida. Since there's a debate over how much difference the amendment ultimately will have in how the law is enforced, it's hard for us to properly measure whether McCollum's position shift in this instance is a complete flip-flop. But what does strike us are McCollum's comments on May 13 and May 16 -- both in reference to the amended version. On May 13, McCollum said he would support implementing the Arizona law in Florida. Then on May 16 he said Florida doesn't need that law. Which is it? McCollum spokeswoman Kristy Campbell said McCollum's position since the final version of the law passed has been consistent. She says McCollum supports the law Arizona passed, in large part because of failures at the federal level. However, McCollum thinks an Arizona-style law is not currently needed in Florida because of the state's unique issues dealing with immigration. But McCollum's statements to the media on May 13 and May 16 are just too different to us, and warrant a rating of Full-Flop.

pomt-04405	Says Barack Obama began his presidency "with an apology tour."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/17/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-began/	The notion that President Barack Obama started his presidency with an "apology tour" is a persistent and false Republican talking point that we have debunked a number of times. Mitt Romney is sticking to it. The Republican presidential nominee repeated it during his second debate against Obama at Hofstra University on Oct. 16, 2012, in response to an audience member’s question about the September 2012 Libya attack. "The president's policies throughout the Middle East began with an apology tour and pursue a strategy of leading from behind, and this strategy is unraveling before our very eyes," he said. We checked Romney’s "apology" attack when he used it at the Republican National Convention and in his 2010 book, No Apology: The Case for American Greatness. The tour, he wrote, is Obama’s way "of signaling to foreign countries and foreign leaders that their dislike for America is something he understands and that is, at least in part, understandable. There are anti-American fires burning all across the globe; President Obama's words are like kindling to them." "In his first nine months in office, President Obama has issued apologies and criticisms of America in speeches in France, England, Turkey, and Cairo; at the CIA headquarters in Langley, Virginia, the National Archives in Washington, D.C., and the United Nations in New York City. He has apologized for what he deems to be American arrogance, dismissiveness, and derision; for dictating solutions, for acting unilaterally, and for acting without regard for others; for treating other countries as mere proxies, for unjustly interfering in the internal affairs of other nations, and for feeding anti-Muslim sentiments; for committing torture, for dragging our feet on global warming and for selectively promoting democracy." An early apology tour? Romney labels seven separate Obama speeches as apologies in his book. (We've compiled those passages in a separate document.) We noticed Obama tended to acknowledge American mistakes or bad impressions, but he countered it with praise of American ideals and the need to come together. At a town hall meeting in France in 2009, for example, Obama encouraged Europe to work with the United States, and admitted that the United States "has shown arrogance and been dismissive, even derisive." But he immediately said that Europe has been guilty of a "casual" and "insidious" anti-Americanism. At a major address to the United Nations, Obama said, "I took office at a time when many around the world had come to view America with skepticism and distrust. Part of this was due to misperceptions and misinformation about my country. Part of this was due to opposition to specific policies, and a belief that on certain critical issues, America has acted unilaterally, without regard for the interests of others. And this has fed an almost reflexive anti-Americanism, which too often has served as an excuse for collective inaction." At a speech in Cairo on relations between the U.S. and the Islamic world, Obama got very close to regretting decades-old U.S. actions in Iran. But then he immediately countered with criticism of Iran. He suggested both countries simply "move forward." Throughout those speeches, Obama was most conciliatory when talking about torture and detention at the U.S. military installation at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Obama typically said the U.S. must always stay true to its ideals, and that's why he "unequivocally prohibited the use of torture by the United States, and I have ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed by early next year." Apologies or diplomacy? We asked several experts in 2010 if Obama had apologized. Here’s a recap of their thoughts (read more here): • Nile Gardiner, a foreign policy analyst with the the conservative Heritage Foundation, said Obama was definitely apologizing. He co-wrote an analysis on the topic: "Barack Obama's Top 10 Apologies: How the President Has Humiliated a Superpower." "Apologizing for your own country projects an image of weakness before both allies and enemies," Gardiner said. "It sends a very clear signal that the U.S. is to blame for some major developments on the world stage. This can be used to the advantage of those who wish to undermine American global leadership." • John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, studies presidential rhetoric and political language. He said Obama used conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing. "It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity," Murphy said. "Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology." • Lauren Bloom, an attorney and business consultant, wrote the book, The Art of the Apology, advising businesses and individuals on when to apologize and how to do it. She said Obama's words fell short of an apology, mostly because he didn't use the words "sorry" or "regret." "I think to make an effective apology, the words 'I'm sorry' or 'we're sorry' always have to be there," Bloom said. Obama's remarks were really non-apologies, and they're not good in business or personal relationships, Bloom said. The one area where they can be useful: international diplomacy. "Gov. Romney is trying to appeal to the inner John Wayne of his readers, and that has a certain emotional appeal," Bloom said. "For the rest of us, a level assessment of less-than-perfect human behavior is perfectly reasonable." • We spoke with Rhoda E. Howard-Hassmann, a professor who tracked international human rights issues via the website Political Apologies and Reparations. Many of the apologies in the database relate to genocide or slavery. "To say the United States will not torture is not an apology, it is a statement of intent," Howard-Hassman said. "A complete apology has to acknowledge something was wrong, accept responsibility, express sorrow or regret and promise not to repeat it." Obama's Cairo address in particular was a means of reaching out to the Islamic world, not an acknowledgement of wrongdoing, she said. "Whether he's apologizing or not, he's saying 'I respect your society and I respect your customs.' Maybe that's what Romney considers an apology, that gesture of respect," she said. "But a gesture of respect is not an apology." We should note that Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have offered two apologies to foreign leaders during the latter half of Obama’s term -- once to Afghanistan President Harmid Karzai for the accidental burnings of the Quran, the holy book of Islam, and another to Pakistan for the death of Pakistani troops, respectively. However, these 2012 and 2011 gestures do not fit Romney’s claim that Obama’s presidency "began with an apology tour." Our ruling Once again, Romney has accused Obama of beginning his presidency "with an apology tour." Our reviews of Obama’s 2009 foreign travels and speeches showed no such thing. While he criticized past U.S. actions, such as torture practices at Guantanamo, he did not offer one apology. It’s ridiculous to call Obama’s foreign visits and remarks "an apology tour."

pomt-12665	Says Airbnb "decreases real estate values and increases costs for workforce housing."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2017/mar/20/philip-levine/does-airbnb-decrease-housing-values-and-increase-w/	Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine went on a Facebook rant against Airbnb after a conservative publication criticized city officials for supporting fines against the short-term rental company. Airbnb posted the article by Sunshine State News on social media. Levine, a potential Democratic candidate for governor in 2018, fired back in the comments. Levine wrote that Miami Beach commissioners aren’t the only opponents of Airbnb, which allows property owners to rent out houses and apartments, or a bedroom, to visitors across the world. The city generally bans short-term rentals except in limited multi-family areas. He said officials in New York, San Francisco and Miami also don’t support Airbnb. Why? "Because it destroys neighborhoods, buildings, decreases real estate values and increases costs for workforce housing!!!!!" he wrote in a March 2 Facebook comment. We decided to tackle two of Levine’s attacks: that Airbnb decreases real estate values and increases costs for workforce housing. (By workforce housing, Levine was referring to homes for people who earn 60 to 120 percent of an area’s median income.) Airbnb does remove some units from the regular supply of rentals; however, it’s questionable about whether that can be defined as "workforce housing" since many units are in expensive areas. The evidence that Levine presented does not show that Airbnb decreases real estate values. Several factors influence housing costs, even in areas with Airbnb and where rents are rising. Jack McCabe, a South Florida real estate analyst, said it’s premature to make broad claims about the impact of Airbnb because it hasn’t been around for long and only represents a slice of the residential market. "It's still too soon to really have data for a long enough period of time to make these types of assumptions or assertions," he said. Some real estate experts said that Airbnb is the latest scapegoat for the lack of available affordable rentals — a problem that predated the home-sharing company. Levine’s evidence largely anecdotal Definitive, independent analysis about the impact of Airbnb is generally lacking. Most of the research we found focused on one city, or ones that were already plagued by housing crunches. For example, a San Francisco official said that "illegitimate rentals" took out 1,900 long-term housing units off the market, but it isn’t clear how many of those were affordable for people earning median incomes or less. Levine sent us multiple articles about the impact of Airbnb on housing — some of the articles were anecdotal, speculative or general news reports about Airbnb’s growth in Miami Beach. We will focus on the evidence he sent that included studies based on data. A 2015 study by the Los Angeles Alliance for a New Economy, an advocacy group for working families, concluded Airbnb was exacerbating the lack of affordable rental units in Los Angeles. The group also did a 2014 study that found rents were growing faster in Los Angeles neighborhoods with the highest Airbnb listing density. Roy Samaan, the author of the studies, told PolitiFact that he couldn’t definitively say that Airbnb was the cause of rents increasing. Several factors influence rental costs. There was a strong correlation, he said, between rising rents and increased Airbnb listings when the vacancy rate was really low. Since Airbnb doesn’t make its booking information fully public, it’s difficult to fully assess the impact. Another piece of evidence Levine cited stemmed from a report commissioned by affordable housing activists in New York City. It concluded that short-term rentals are reducing the vacancy rate, which causes increases in rental prices. The study zeroed in on a subset of about 8,000 Airbnb listings in New York City and concluded if those units were put back on the regular market, the vacancy rate would rise from the current 3.4-3.6 percent to 4 percent. Richard K. Green, a real estate professor at the University of Southern California, told PolitiFact those 8,000 units would be absorbed quickly in a rental market of more than 2.2 million units. "I am skeptical that the local vacancy rates would move as much as the authors of the New York study would suggest," he said. Airbnb fires back It did not come as a surprise when Airbnb argued through its own packet of articles and studies that its listings don’t hurt real estate values or supply. Again, we will focus on the citations based on data. A FiveThirtyEight analysis concluded that "Airbnb’s impact is probably still small in most cities," although it could grow. The statistics-based news website used Airbnb booking and revenue data to examine how many units Airbnb could be taking off the rental market nationwide. Stockton Williams, executive director of the Terwilliger Center for Housing at the Urban Land Institute, told FiveThirtyEight that the Airbnb units don’t add up to much as a percentage of total rental units in big cities in the United States. Other factors, such as the increasing demand for urban living, have played a much larger role in driving up prices in big cities, he said. "There is a considerable amount of anecdotal evidence that they may be occurring in a relatively small number of individual neighborhoods and properties — and therefore quite real to affected residents and owners," Williams told us. Murray Cox, owner of Inside Airbnb, a website that analyzes data about Airbnb listings, told Business Insider that Airbnb can’t entirely be blamed for housing issues in cities that were already expensive. Cox told PolitiFact the research reflects a mixed bag: Some homes have been removed from the housing supply, but the additional revenue for property owners can increase the property value for owners. Airbnb rentals that become "party houses" could reduce neighboring values, but Cox said he hadn’t seen detailed analysis about that. Additional real estate experts argued that short-term rentals, while displacing long-term renters, could increase cash flow for owners and therefore increase their property value. Green, the real estate professor at the University of Southern California, said that focusing on Airbnb doesn’t get to the heart of the matter — "that cities are making it more and more difficult to build housing." Our ruling Levine says Airbnb "decreases real estate values and increases costs for workforce housing." Some research and news articles have argued that Airbnb has decreased the rental supply and therefore is driving up prices, but it’s questionable whether all of those units can be described as "workforce housing" in already expensive areas with a lack of affordable housing. Levine did not point to evidence proving that Airbnb has decreased real estate values. It’s too soon to fully assess the impact of Airbnb on housing markets, and that’s difficult to do when it only represents a small fraction of the housing supply in any city or region.

pomt-14664	"One in every three women has an abortion during her lifetime."	half-true	/texas/statements/2016/jan/19/wendy-davis/flawed-wendy-davis-claim-1-3-women-has-had-abortio/	Former Fort Worth state Sen. Wendy Davis, the 2014 Democratic gubernatorial nominee, wants the Supreme Court to reverse the Texas law that critics say will make it harder for far-flung Texans to access abortions. Republicans who carried the changes into law said their goal was to improve women’s health by requiring abortion doctors to gain admitting privileges in a nearby hospital and requiring abortions to be performed in hospital-like settings. Abortion providers sued, arguing the regulations — impossible for many clinics to meet — were unnecessary because they offered no health benefits for a relatively low-risk procedure. Davis, joined by women with legislative experience who, like Davis, have revealed decisions to terminate pregnancies, said in the Jan. 4, 2016, brief that the law could affect women in need if it’s allowed to be enforced by leaving about 10 clinics operating in the state’s largest cities—down from more than 40 when House Bill 2 was signed into law in 2013. In the brief, the women say they’re "grateful that they were able to exercise their rights in nearby doctor’s offices and abortion clinics without the burdens of travel, delay and additional expense that would be imposed on Texas women if HB 2 were to remain in force." Generally, the brief says, false "stereotypes persist in society and in state legislatures regarding women who exercise their right to choose. The reality is that approximately one out of every three women in this country has had an abortion in her lifetime." The brief later says: "One in every three women has an abortion during her lifetime." A reader asked us to check that "lifetime" statement. Nationally in 2011, an estimated 1.1 million abortions were performed, down nearly 14 percent from 2008, according to a March 2014 article by the New York-based Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit that promotes reproductive health and abortion rights. The 2011 estimate broke out to 16.9 abortions for every 1,000 women aged 15-44, the researchers wrote. To our inquiry, Davis told us by email that Linda Goldstein, among lawyers who drafted the brief, had advised that, as footnoted in the brief, a 1998 Guttmacher study was the basis of the one-in-three statement. In a follow-up email, Davis said the 1998 study was a precursor to a more recent estimate, in a 2011 Guttmacher study, that one in three women will have an abortion by age 45. Separately, Michael New, a visiting associate professor at Florida’s Ave Maria University who has questioned the prevalence of abortions, responded to our inquiry by pointing out a September 2015 story by the FactChecker at The Washington Post that found flaws in a claim that one in three women will have an abortion "by the age of 45." The Post story explains the purpose of the 2011 Guttmacher report was to update older estimates that 43 percent of women of reproductive age would have an abortion by age 45. The abortion rate had declined over intervening years, the story notes, and researchers hypothesized that the proportion of women who will have an abortion during their lifetime also probably declined. The study used abortion rates (the number of abortions per 1,000 women) for subgroups of women (including age, socioeconomic status, race and ethnicity) who responded to the institute’s 2008 Abortion Patient Survey of nearly 9,500 women, the Post summed up. Next, researchers used survey data to find the first abortion rate for age subgroups, multiplied the rate by the number of years in each age group and added up the number of first-time abortions that had taken place by the time women were 45. This was called the "cumulative first abortion rate," through which they came up with the "lifetime incidence" of abortion, or the "one in three" figure, the Post reported. To grasp the basis of Davis’s claim, we turned first to the 1998 study footnoted in the brief and then the 2011 follow-up. 1998 study The December 1998 study, "Unintended Pregnancy in the United States," by Stanley K. Henshaw, then the institute’s deputy director of research, offers estimates for the incidence of abortions in 1994--more than 20 years ago. A Guttmacher summary says Henshaw drew on national surveys of women taken in 1982, 1988 and 1995 plus other data to estimate 1994 rates and percentages of unintended birth and pregnancy and the proportion of women who had experienced an unintended birth, an abortion or both. The study itself describes the cited National Surveys of Family Growth as a "periodic fertility survey" that collects detailed reproductive and contraceptive histories and related information from women of reproductive age. "Forty-eight percent of women aged 15-44 in 1994 had had at least one unplanned pregnancy sometime in their lives," Henshaw wrote, "28% had had one or more unplanned births, 30% had had one or more abortions and 11% had had both." Put another way, then, the study suggested that as of 1994, nearly one third of women of childbearing age had had an abortion. The likelihood of women having had an abortion varied by age. A chart indicates some 40 percent of women aged 30-34 in 1994 had had one or more abortions; at the low end, 7 percent of women aged 15-19 had had one or more abortions. SOURCE: Study, "Unintended Pregnancy in the United States," S.K. Henshaw, the Guttmacher Institute, December 1998 (accessed Jan. 12, 2016) The summary continues: "At 1994 rates, women can expect to have 1.42 unintended pregnancies by the time they are 45, and at 1992 rates, 43% of women will have had an abortion." The study says "14% of women can expect to have had an abortion before age 20, 37% by age 30 and 43% by age 45." 2011 study notes declining abortion rate Rebecca Wind, a Guttmacher spokeswoman, responded to our request for elaboration with an email stating: "The stat Wendy Davis cited was correct a few years ago; as abortion rates have declined, so have lifetime incidence rates." Wind guided us to the 2011 study, "Changes in Abortion Rates Between 2000 and 2008 and Lifetime Incidence of Abortion," which notes the U.S. "abortion rate has declined since 1992, and the proportion of women who will terminate a pregnancy in their lifetime has probably declined as well." The authors analyzed abortion rates from 2000 through 2008 and estimated the proportion of women of reproductive age "who will have an abortion by age 45." Women "aged 40 and older had" an abortion "rate of 300.9 per 1,000 women," the study says. "Put differently, an estimated 30.1% of women aged 15–44 in 2008 will have an abortion by age 45 if exposed to prevailing abortion rates throughout their reproductive lives," it says. "Similarly, an estimated 8.3% of U.S. women would have had an abortion by age 20 and 25.1% by age 30." Broadly, the study notes, the "proportion of women expected to have an abortion by age 45 declined substantially, from 43% in 1992 to 30% in 2008 and this pattern parallels the substantial decline in abortion rates during that time period. "Still, that almost one-third of women are anticipated to have an abortion by age 45 suggests that it is not an uncommon procedure," the study says. The study closes by saying that if "current" abortion rates hold, "almost one-third of American women will obtain an abortion in their lifetime." To our inquiry, Guttmacher scientist Rachel Jones told us by email that Davis’s statement referring to all women was incorrect "because it implied that a random sample of women in 2016 would find that 30% of them would have had an abortion. Our stat is the projected lifetime incidence of abortion among women in 2008 by the time they turn 45. (That is, lots of women currently aged 15-44 have not had abortions but many will before they exit their reproductive years.)" Jones added: "We know that the abortion rate has dropped substantially since 2008, but that doesn’t necessarily mean the lifetime incidence has. There also have to be concomitant changes in age-specific first-abortion rates." She said that until 2014 data is analyzed, likely in 2017, it’s only appropriate to say that given 2008 abortion rates, "an estimated 30% of women will have an abortion by age 45." Other analyses We heard back from a couple of activists opposed to abortion including New, who emphasized Guttmacher’s 2011 analysis was retrospective, drawing on 2008 abortion data, while there may continue to be fewer U.S. abortions year by year. "The abortion rate," New said by email, "has been falling consistently since the early 1980s and continues to fall," especially among teens and young adults, he emailed, which might mean, if trends continue, that women in general will be less likely to have an abortion. Chuck Donovan, president of the Charlotte Lozier Institute, the research arm of the Susan B. Anthony List, an organization dedicated to ending abortion, provided a statement by email noting that a physicist, William Johnston, has estimated that as of 2008, about 28 percent of U.S. women aged 15-64 had had abortions--up from 2.8 percent in 1973, the year the Supreme Court established a woman's constitutional right to end a pregnancy. Our ruling Davis said: "One in every three women has an abortion during her lifetime." That statement is a bit misleading in that it sounds like it is based on hard data showing one in three women have had abortions. Of late, the statistic is based on extrapolations of 2008 data analyzed by the Guttmacher Institute in an effort to estimate how many women will have an abortion during their reproductive years. Meantime, abortion rates have generally declined so it’s possible such estimates don’t reflect reality. We rate this claim, which is missing important qualifications, Half True.

pomt-03633	Metro on whether it could use bond money for restoration.	full flop	/oregon/statements/2013/may/04/metro/did-metro-flip-flop-whether-it-could-use-bond-mone/	The voters of Washington, Multnomah and Clackamas counties will decide May 21, 2013, whether to approve a 5-year operating levy for Metro, the regional government that oversees growth and also runs the Oregon Zoo. Measure 26-152 would raise approximately $10 million a year from an increase in property taxes, half of which would go toward restoration of natural areas. Metro officials say the measure is necessary because general obligation bond measures approved by voters in 1995 and in 2006 allowed the government to purchase land, but didn’t provide money to restore and maintain the new land. "Twice in two decades, Metro voters approved measures to acquire thousands of acres of natural areas throughout the tri-county region," reads the Voters’ Pamphlet summary of this spring’s Measure 26-152. "Past measures could not include money for maintenance and restoration." Which got PolitiFact Oregon thinking. We remembered how the 2006 measure was pitched to voters. The language of Measure 26-80, also in the Voters’ Pamphlet, was clear: "This measure directs Metro to buy and restore natural areas for the protection of water quality and preservation of fish and wildlife habitat ..." Metro officials wrote both statements in the Voters’ Pamphlet. Voters overwhelmingly approved the $227 million bond measure in 2006, probably thinking that the money would go toward both purchase and actual restoration, because that’s what supporters said they’d do. Did Metro use the promise of restoration to sell the 2006 measure? Why is it now saying that the 2006 money couldn’t be used for restoration? Has Metro flip-flopped on what the 2006 bond could and could not do? We shot off an email to Metro spokesman Jim Middaugh and started digging. For people who don’t follow the scintillating world of public finance, just know that government can sell general obligation bonds -- and take on debt -- to pay for capital projects and improvements. Governments do it all the time. Governments do not, however, tend to incur long-term debt for operational expenses, such as routine maintenance or payroll. That’s poor fiscal policy, and that is the distinction Metro is making with the different measures. So the first question for us is: Can money from bonds be used for restoration, despite what Metro now says? This description of general obligation debt -- found on the state Treasury website -- indicates that the answer is yes. "Under ORS 287A.050 - 287A.145 general obligation debt can be incurred for capital construction and improvements having an expected useful life of more than one year. This does not include maintenance and repair (the need for which could be reasonably anticipated), supplies, and equipment that are not intrinsic to a structure." PolitiFact Oregon can see how restoration of purchased property could count as an improvement lasting for more than year. And certainly, Metro officials saw it that way because they sold it that way. Still, Metro draws a distinction between restoration spending then and restoration spending now. Middaugh said that despite the state description, the agency has its own guidelines on how to spend bonded money. For example, Metro used bonded money for the initial "stabilization" part of restoration, defined as "one-time activities performed during the first two to five years after" land purchase. Mowing grass, killing weeds and removing trash is OK so long as the activities take place during this phase -- but afterward, those actions are considered maintenance. Why wasn’t this distinction called out in public materials? The description was too wonky, he said, so they went with the more conversational "restoration" and "protection." Half of the money from this operating levy would go toward operations and education, and the other half to continued restoration of natural areas. Out of curiosity, we asked if Metro had planned all along to come back to voters for more money. The answer was yes, and the proof is on page 9 of the resolution authorizing the 2006 measure, stating that Metro would only have enough money to manage new lands for a limited time. All we can say to these disclosures is that we wish Metro had been utterly transparent and upfront -- both about long-term funding plans and definitions -- with voters from the beginning. PolitiFact Oregon loves nature and we love good governance. We don’t want public bodies borrowing money recklessly, and we trust our elected officials to make that distinction. But here we have a government that sold an earlier measure as a way to buy and restore natural areas and that now says officials couldn’t use that money for restoration. Yet there is no legal prohibition on using bond proceeds for restoration. In fact, Metro has spent nearly $5 million to do so, even if staffers call it something else. The bottom line is that both statements come from the Voters' Pamphlet and both were written by Metro officials. And both statements can’t be right. Metro wants more money to further nurture its new natural areas. Metro wants money for boat ramps and better playgrounds that should improve use of visitor areas. We don’t fault the wishes. But we do fault Metro for saying one thing, then another, about whether restoration was part of the plan in 2006 and why more money is needed in 2013. This is a reversal of position by Oregon’s tri-county regional government. We rule this a Full Flop.	None	Metro	None	None	None	2013-05-04T03:00:00	2013-04-24	['None']
pomt-14289	Says Bernie Sanders "fundamentally changed the lives" of Immokalee farm workers in Florida for the better.	half-true	/florida/statements/2016/apr/05/bernie-sanders/did-bernie-sanders-fundamentally-improve-lives-tom/	Bernie Sanders says he successfully changed the lives of exploited tomato workers in Florida. In an ad for Sanders, which ran nationally on Univision, U.S. Rep. Raúl Grijalva, D-Ariz., praises Sanders for taking up the plight of Immokalee tomato workers. "He went and visited personally. Then he came back and convinced Ted Kennedy to hold some hearings, and it fundamentally changed the lives of those workers." There is no dispute that Sanders, a Vermont senator, was a passionate defender of the tomato workers from Central Florida in 2008. A coalition representing those workers successfully reached an agreement with the growers about two years later to improve pay and working conditions. But how much credit does Sanders get, and has the agreement "fundamentally changed" the workers’ lives? Sanders’ advocacy on behalf of Immokalee farm workers in 2008 In 2008, Sanders traveled to meet with the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, which represented thousands of tomato workers. "The conditions here are a disaster. People are being exploited ruthlessly," Sanders said. Since the coalition couldn’t reach an agreement with the Florida Tomato Growers Exchange directly, it negotiated with purchasers of tomatoes, asking them to pay a penny-per-pound increase. Yum Brands -- parent of Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC -- signed on in 2005, and McDonald’s in 2007, and more would later follow. Sanders, along with a few other senators, sent letters to food chains and grocery stores urging them to join the campaign, said Warren Gunnels, a spokesman for Sanders’ presidential campaign. Sanders also met with a representative of the growers’ exchange. On March 13, 2008, Sanders held a press conference on the U.S. Capitol grounds to support a nationwide petition drive on behalf of farm workers. He invited the coalition to testify before a Senate committee in April 2008. "In the United States of America, millions of workers are being forced into a race to the bottom," Sanders testified. "What we have in the tomato fields of Florida are workers who are living on the lowest rung of the ladder in that race to the bottom." About two and a half years after the hearing -- in November 2010 -- the coalition and the growers’ exchange reached an agreement. It included the penny-per-pound premium and other steps intended to improve working conditions, such as a system to resolve complaints about sexual abuse as well as a health and safety program. Those involved in the process say Sanders should get some credit for the publicity. The agreement "probably would have occurred anyway at some point, but we think it is fair to say that Sen. Sanders’ efforts accelerated the process," coalition spokesman Steve Hitov told PolitiFact Florida. Reggie Brown, a vice president with the growers’ exchange who met with Sanders in 2008, said, "I think he can be fairly given some credit for having had a role." Giev Kashkooli, political and legislative director at United Farm Workers of America, a group which endorsed Hillary Clinton, says that "it's likely that (Sanders') visit and subsequent work did bring attention to farm workers in Immokalee who deserved support." Impact of agreement There is evidence that the agreement between the coalition and the growers has led to some improvements for workers, but there are differences of opinion about the extent of those improvements. According to the coalition’s most recent annual report, since 2011 the agreement has resulted in nearly $20 million in premiums paid by buyers. Other gains include efforts to reduce sexual assault, the creation of health and safety committees, and resolution of more than 1,000 worker complaints. "The Fair Food Program has brought about unprecedented levels of compliance with human rights standards in the fields," said Laura Safer Espinoza, a retired New York Supreme Court justice who serves as the executive director of the Fair Food Standards Council, which monitors the agreement and audits the growers. The average bucket rate has increased from 40 cents before the agreement to 55 to 65 cents today. But we found no independent research about what that translates to on average per worker, although the coalition cites a range of $30 to $60 per week. Pay is variable due to changing crop conditions and other factors. Greg Schell, an attorney with the Migrant Farmworker Justice Project, has raised some criticisms of the program. He has sued fast food chains on behalf of pickers who he said didn’t get the premium. Since only some purchasers of Florida tomatoes have agreed to pay the premium, not all of the tomatoes a worker picks will include the premium. "The short answer is that the hearings changed nothing whatsoever in Immokalee," he said. "The hearings did provide a national forum for the Coalition of Immokalee Workers, which has for the past 20 years pressed for higher wages for the tomato workers. However, despite immense publicity for its efforts, the coalition’s efforts have resulted in very minimal wage increases to the workers." Schell sent us a pay stub of a worker showing the premium was only $1.21 one week while the coalition sent us a pay stub showing $101.06 for another worker. Both are extremes, says coalition attorney Steve Hitov. A reporter from the Naples Daily News described the tough lives of tomato workers in an article in March. She said "they earn $10 an hour, and that the salaries have changed only a few cents an hour in the past five years." Workers barely earn enough to support their families and live together in trailers. There is no dispute that picking tomatoes remains a tough job, but "there is no comparison between what existed before and what exists now," says Janice Fine, a labor professor at Rutgers, who has interviewed the workers and has met with the coalition and the growers. "In my interviews with farmworkers, they talk about a radical transformation in their work lives," she told PolitiFact Florida. Our ruling Sanders’ ad says he "fundamentally changed the lives" of Immokalee farm workers in Florida. Sanders helped give national publicity to the struggles of Immokalee tomato pickers in 2008. He visited with the workers, wrote letters to tomato purchasers urging them to join a program to pay workers more, met with a representative from the growers exchange and held a Senate hearing in 2008. About two years later, the workers reached an agreement with the growers. The coalition and the growers’ exchange both say Sanders should get some credit, although it’s likely that the agreement could have been reached without his efforts. Whether the agreement "fundamentally changed the lives" of the workers is difficult to quantify. The agreement included an increase for purchasers which goes toward pickers, but it’s unclear on average how many dollars more each picker earns per week as a result of it. There have been other successes in the agreement, including the resolution of worker complaints. We rate this statement Half True.

pomt-01959	"By 2006, the American people were overwhelmingly against the Iraq War."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/20/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-2006-americans-were-overwhelm/	In her recently published memoir Hard Choices, Hillary Clinton acknowledges that "she got it wrong" when she voted to authorize the Iraq War in 2003. As Iraq once again becomes a big news story, as Islamic militants take over large portions of the country’s north and threaten the capital in Baghdad, we thought it would be worth checking one of Clinton’s claims about the American public’s perceptions of the Iraq War. In the seventh chapter of her memoir, Clinton writes that, "by 2006, the American people were overwhelmingly against the Iraq war." Is that correct? We looked at polling data about the war between 2003 and 2006, archived at PollingReport.com. (Here are the ones that fit the criteria for this fact-check.) Initially, Americans felt favorably about the war. While the wording changes somewhat from poll to poll, the level of support for the war was usually at or above two-thirds in mid- March 2003, right before the war began. That month, support hit 70 percent in a Newsweek poll, 64 percent in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll, 65 percent in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll and 71 percent in an ABC News/Washington Post poll. In the first few weeks after the attack was launched, support levels went as high as 77 percent in CBS News and Los Angeles Times polls, 78 percent in an ABC News/Washington Post poll and 81 percent in a Fox News poll. However, as the war continued, support began to soften. Eventually, support turned negative in some polls. By mid-May 2004 -- a little over a year after the start of the war -- Time and CNN asked, "Do you approve or disapprove of the way George W. Bush is handling the situation in Iraq?" and found 44 percent approval and 51 percent disapproval. The numbers were similar when the pollsters asked, "In general, do you approve or disapprove of current military policy in Iraq?" Even the Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll -- which as late as June 2004 found support at 60 percent -- found by February 2005 that a plurality of respondents, 49 percent, said going to war was the "wrong thing" to have done, compared to 46 percent who said it was the "right thing." Disapproval of Bush’s handling of the war reached 58 percent in August 2005 in an Associated Press/Ipsos poll, and it remained roughly the same in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll in February 2006 and a CNN poll in May 2006. Finally, in the second half of 2006, opposition the war began to hit 2-to-1 margins over support for the war. In July 2006, when CBS and the New York Times asked, "Do you think the result of the war with Iraq was worth the loss of American life and other costs of attacking Iraq, or not?" 63 percent said it was not worth it, compared to just 30 percent who said it was worth it. Then, in November 2006, Time asked about approval of Bush’s handling of Iraq and found 65 percent disapproval and only 31 percent approval. Disapproval continued to rise slightly into 2007. AP found 68 percent disapproval of Bush’s handling of Iraq in January 2007, and CNN/Opinion Research Corporation found 69 percent. So the polling generally tracks with time timeline Clinton offered. The only question is whether disapproval rates in the low-to-mid 60 percent range qualifies as "overwhelming." We were a little skeptical, so we asked some polling experts. "That is an awfully subjective call," said Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette Law School Poll and co-founder of Pollster.com. "I’d be surprised if there were any consensus where that line falls." Mark Blumenthal, the senior polling editor of the Huffington Post and the founding editor of Pollster.com, said the use of "overwhelming" strikes him as subjective, and depends on the context. "What seems like an 'overwhelming' victory margin in a competitive electoral contest might not seem quite as 'overwhelming' in the context of attitudes about a particular policy issue," he said. "I’d guess I’d be OK with 2-to-1 for the former, but 3-to-1 or 4-to-1 for the latter." Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for Clinton, emailed us to say, "In public opinion, if you’re talking about 50-percent-plus opposition on an issue, I think most people would call that ‘overwhelming.’" Vietor added that "the 2006 elections, which went massively in the Democrats’ favor, were viewed as a response to the war." Our ruling Clinton said that, "by 2006, the American people were overwhelmingly against the Iraq war." Polling data shows that roughly 65 percent of the public opposed the war by the second half of 2006, but while that qualifies as strong opposition, the definition of "overwhelming" within the polling profession is more uncertain. On balance, we rate Clinton’s claim Mostly True. UPDATE, June 20, 2014, 11:45 am: This article has been updated to include a response from Clinton's staff received after the story was published.

pomt-08863	Because of violence spreading from Mexico, "you’ve got bullets hitting the city hall in El Paso. You’ve got bombs exploding in El Paso."	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/aug/05/rick-perry/perry-says-violence-mexico-reaching-el-paso-bullet/	Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who has called for President Barack Obama to dispatch more troops to the Texas-Mexico border, told a national TV audience last week that violence in Mexico has seeped into El Paso, across the Rio Grande from troubled Ciudad Juarez. "You’ve got bullets hitting the city hall in El Paso," Perry said in a July 28 interview with Greta Van Susteren of the Fox News Channel. "You’ve got bombs exploding in El Paso." Two days later, Perry spoke in a similar vein during a visit to Laredo. "When a car bomb goes off in El Paso ... we know there's a (security) problem," said Perry, according to KGNS-TV, a Laredo station. The threat of border spillover violence is a simmering topic. In June, for instance, PolitiFact Texas found Barely True U.S. Sen. John Cornyn's statement that spillover violence was "real and escalating." But bullets and bombs in El Paso? Indeed, bullets fired on the Mexico side of the border struck El Paso City Hall on June 29. According to the El Paso Police Department, one bullet traveled through a ninth-floor window and an interior wall before lodging in a picture frame. Stucco walls of the government building were struck by an additional six rounds, the police said. Nobody in El Paso was hurt. "Investigators believe that the rounds may be related to (a shooting incident) that occurred in Juarez," a police department press release said. "El Paso City Hall does not appear to be the specific target of these rounds." Darrel Petry, spokesman for the department, told us the Juarez incident involved an attack on Mexican federal agents. We asked Petry if, as Perry says, bombs are exploding in El Paso. Petry replied: "I am not aware of any bomb going off in El Paso." If that had happened, he said, "I think I would have put the press release out." Perry spokeswoman Katherine Cesinger, responding to our request for information, said in an e-mail that violence in northern Mexico has continued to escalate "and presents a clear and present threat to border communities." She noted that, in the interview with Van Susteren, Perry also mentioned the assassination of a Tamaulipas gubernatorial candidate this summer. Rodolfo Torre Cantu was shot and killed near the airport in that state's capital, Ciudad Victoria, about 200 miles from the Texas border city of Brownsville. As for bombs, Perry "also made reference to a car bomb that was detonated by cartel members a few weeks ago in Juarez just across from El Paso," Cesinger said. On July 15, a car bomb was set off in Ciudad Juarez's downtown, killing several people. The Associated Press quoted authorities saying the July 15 explosion was in retaliation for the arrest of a top leader of the La Linea gang, which works for the Juarez drug cartel. The bomb, which blew up a parked car, was described by the AP as bringing "a new dimension of terror" to the Mexican drug wars. The Washington Post reported: "The assailants drew police and medical workers to the scene by leaving a bound, wounded man in a police uniform near an intersection and then calling in a false report that an officer had been shot." The Post and other news outlets said the bomb was then set off by a cell-phone signal. The Juarez-based U.S. consulate's office closed July 30 "to review its security posture," according to a message posted online by the office. "American citizens are advised avoid the area around the Consulate General until it reopens." In March, a consulate employee and her husband were gunned down as they drove in their car about a block from the U.S.-Mexican border bridge on a major Juarez thoroughfare. All in all, Perry’s correct that bullets coming from across the border hit El Paso’s seat of city government. No bombs have exploded in El Paso, however, though one went off in Juarez.

pomt-12502	"All charter schools are not-for-profit."	half-true	/florida/statements/2017/apr/27/bob-cortes/are-all-florida-charter-schools-not-profit/	Florida lawmakers who support the expansion of charter schools have adopted a single talking point to explain how the schools are managed. Rep. Bob Cortes, R-Altamonte Springs, faced a series of questions from Rep. David Richardson, D-Miami Beach, after introducing HB 7101, one of several measures under consideration in the legislative session that would increase access to charter schools. Like public schools, charter schools receive state funds. The key difference is they are privately managed. Richardson was curious about the bill’s provision that specifies that a charter school operator may use assets of their charter school for K-12 educational purposes in "other schools." "These other schools, would they also have to be a not-for-profit or could they be a for-profit?" Richardson asked. Cortes said, "They would have to be a school within their own network. So part of the charter school system itself." "So does that mean the other schools would have to be a 501(c)(3)?" Richardson asked. "All charter schools are not-for-profit," Cortes said. Cortes’ bill passed in the House by an 81-39 vote. The same argument resurfaced in debate of "schools of hope" legislation that would create a $200 million fund to lure charter schools to under-performing districts. Rep. Manny Diaz Jr., R-Hialeah, said, "Under Florida state statute, a charter school is a non-profit organization, so there is no such thing in Florida as a for-profit charter school." The statements jumped out to us because there have been problems with charter schools being used to benefit people privately. Florida law technically requires charter schools to be nonprofits. But the system is largely run by for-profit companies, which Cortes' statement leaves out. Not-for-profit, or not? The charter-school solution was originally touted as a way to give families — particular those in low-income areas — another option for schooling. Critics say too many taxpayer dollars have been shifted to the private companies that run charter schools to the detriment of traditional public schools. So, are all charter schools in Florida not-for-profit? Technically speaking, a not-for-profit is a type of organization that does not earn profits for its owners. Cortes cited a provision of a Florida statute (1002.33 sec 12(i)) as evidence of this claim, which mandates that a charter must organize as, or be operated by, a nonprofit organization. The Florida Department of Education echoed Cortes’ evidence. Audrey Walden, the agency’s press secretary, said the defining document that sets the academic, financial and organizational performance benchmarks for a charter school is determined by the local school district and the nonprofit charter school board. The charter governing board can choose to enter into contracts with private entities to provide services and support. "But, ultimately, performance and accountability rests with the nonprofit governing board -- which, when it enters into a charter agreement with its local school district, is subject to the same Sunshine Laws and School Accountability System that pertains to all public schools in Florida," she said. More to the story Not all charter schools operate in the same way. And sometimes nonprofit charter governing boards enter into contract with for-profit companies. The management company does not manage the governing board, but rather it handles certain aspects of the operations of the school under a contract with the governing board. The Miami Herald’s examination of South Florida’s charter school industry found several instances of for-profit management companies controlling charter schools’ day-to-day operations. The Herald found examples of charter schools relinquishing total control of their staff and finances to for-profit management companies. In Miami-Dade County, the Life Skills Center paid 97 percent of its income to cover fees incurred by a management company. Then, the governing board of two affiliated schools tried to "eject" the management company’s managers. As a result, the management company withheld money from the school and threatened to press charges against people within the school from trying to get it back. The Herald also found that some owners of the management companies also control the land and buildings used by the charter school. Owners of Academica Corp., the state’s largest charter school management company based in South Miami, collected almost $19 million a year in lease payments on school properties. In other cases, it found that the school’s nonprofit board were full of people with ties to the for-profit management companies. This trend continues across the nation. ProPublica reported that several charter schools around the country funneled all of their revenue to a for-profit company hired for day-to-day operations including schools in New York and Ohio. A spokesman for the state's largest teachers union, the Florida Education Association, sent us a report that summarized the agency’s arguments against "schools of hope" legislation. The FEA isn’t completely against charter schools, but its website says, "While some charters adhere to the original idea, and have shown some success, many charters have become for-profit drivers for large corporations bent on taking over our public schools." Our ruling Cortes said that all charter schools are not-for-profit. A Florida provision requires charter schools to be operated or controlled by a nonprofit organization. This technical talking point omits that many nonprofit charter school boards enter in to contracts with for-profit companies. Some for-profit charter school management companies have drawn increasing scrutiny over the years for how they’ve controlled the school’s money.

pomt-11382	"The United States is 3rd in murders throughout the world. If you remove Chicago, Detroit, Washington, St. Louis and New Orleans, the United States is then 189th out of 193 countries in the entire world."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/mar/28/viral-image/united-states-third-murders-outlier-cities/	A viral meme shared on social media following the Parkland, Fla., shooting claimed the United States has the third-highest count of murders worldwide, a ranking that would drop dramatically if five major cities were excluded. The image has been circulating since at least 2015. We decided to take a closer look. Is the United States third in murders, and are a few outlier cities responsible? That’s false by any standard. The main study of intentional homicides is performed by the United Nations’ Office of Drug Control. The UN warns against cross-national comparisons because of the differences in legal definitions of intentional homicides and recording practices. Our count of the UN’s data placed the United States ninth in intentional homicides. We used the most up-to-date count for each country and territory, which included data anywhere from 2007 to 2015. As the country with the third-highest population size, however, experts told us the number of people killed is not a very useful metric. Controlling for population size, most criminologists use the per 100,000 metric. By that standard, we found the United States ranked 94th. When we counted only the countries for which the UN had 2015 data, the United States ranked 73rd. That’s still far from the top ten. Outlier cities The meme argues that a few outlier cities with stringent gun control legislation are responsible for the United States’ high homicide count. But that’s not true, either. Chicago, Detroit, Washington, St. Louis and New Orleans have homicide rates well above the national average, but that’s typical for large urban cities. While Detroit, St. Louis and New Orleans are consistently among the top five American cities by homicide rate, the cities with most per-capita murders vary from year to year. Neither Washington, D.C., nor Chicago make the top five. Chicago has a high number of homicides because of its population, but its homicide rate is middle of the road for large U.S. cities, according to Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at the University of Central Florida. Specific reasons for the cities’ high murder rates largely remain a mystery for criminologists, but all are cities with "high poverty levels, inequality, significant segregation, and an entrenched drug trade," Corzine said. Dropping them from the U.S. total has little substantive impact on the U.S. homicide rate or count. The cities cited in the meme accounted for 1,568 of 17,250, or 9.1 percent, of all homicides reported to the FBI in 2016, Tom Kovandzic, a criminologist at the University of Texas, Dallas, calculated for us. And without those cities, the homicide rate (per capita) would only decline by 7.73 percent, or from 5.34 to 4.93. When we applied those reductions to the UN data, the United States barely budged in its international standing. It moved down four spots in per capita murders and stayed the same in total murders. That’s inconsequential compared with the 186-spot jump the meme concocted. Gun control Gun control laws are mostly controlled by state legislatures. Washington, D.C., is the only listed city able to enact strict ordinances, while Chicago can do some things, according to Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association. We’ve previously rated the claim that Chicago has the strictest gun laws Pants on Fire. "The other lie in this claim is that all five of the named cities have stringent gun regulation. Louisiana, Michigan and Missouri would be very surprised to hear that!" said Philip Cook, a sociologist at Duke University. The states didn’t impress the Giffords Law Center, a pro-gun control group. Missouri ranked 48th, Louisiana 43rd, and Michigan 16th on a scale that gives higher rankings to restricted gun ownership and use. Our ruling The image said, "The United States is 3rd in murders throughout the world. If you remove Chicago, Detroit, Washington, St. Louis and New Orleans, the United States is then 189th out of 193 countries in the entire world." By no measure is the United States third in total homicides or homicide rates. Excluding the named cities from the count had little to no impact on the United States’ international standing. Three of the cities named in the meme are consistently the top cities for intentional homicides in the United States, but the other two are not. They are by no means outliers, either.

pomt-13229	"What the District of Columbia was trying to do (with its handgun ban) was to protect toddlers from guns."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/19/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-supreme-court-gun-decision-de/	Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton claimed that her opposition to the 2008 Supreme Court case of District of Columbia vs. Heller was due to a desire to protect toddlers from firearms. Clinton said in the third presidential debate that she supported an individual’s right to bear arms but disagreed with how the court interpreted the Second Amendment because it didn’t accept "reasonable regulations" on gun ownership. "What the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns," Clinton said. There’s been a lot of discussion over how Clinton views the Second Amendment, but we were curious if she was accurately describing the rationale behind the case. The Heller case itself was a challenge to the Firearms Control Regulations Act of 1975, a broad ordinance passed by the Washington, D.C., city council that largely banned residents from owning handguns, automatic weapons and the possession of unregistered firearms, as well as requiring firearms kept in a home to be "unloaded, disassembled, or bound by a trigger lock or similar device." The handgun ban and subsequent gun control measures were widely considered to be one of the stricter rules on firearm ownership throughout the United States, though members of the D.C. council at the time said it seemed like the right thing to do. "Handgun crimes were just getting out of sight," said Sterling Tucker, a D.C. Council chairman when the ban was enacted. "We had to isolate and contain the problem. We thought a handgun law would do that." Passed in the mid 1970s, the ordinance continued with several legal challenges until 2007, when a federal court invalidated the law. That decision was upheld in a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling that the handgun ban and "trigger lock" provisions of the ordinance violated the Second Amendment. Before the Supreme Court ruling, city leaders fought hard to keep the ban, saying that its continued implementation reduced the number of stolen firearms and guns used in other crimes. In their appeal to the Supreme Court, the city government filed a petition with the court specifically citing the dangers posed to children if the gun ban was lifted. "The smaller the weapon, the more likely a child can use it, and children as young as three years old are strong enough to fire today’s handguns," the petition stated (page 25). The same petition also addressed the history of the ban, saying that in 1976 that the Council determined existing law didn’t sufficiently address gun violence and specifically cited the "chilling regularity with which handguns were taking the lives of children." But protecting children isn’t the only reason cited by the 30-page petition filed by the city’s government — the city also addressed general violent crime trends and other legal arguments in asking the Supreme Court to hear the case. And the court’s decision in Heller went far beyond just overturning the city’s gun ban, as it broadly affirmed for the first time an individual right to private gun ownership. Clinton’s campaign referred us to a gun control group claiming that gun locks and child access prevention laws help prevent unintentional firearm deaths for young children. PolitiFact has previously looked into whether the city’s gun ban had any effect on violent crime, finding that violent crime levels varied year-to-year and that other social and demographic factors played a larger role than gun laws. Our ruling Clinton said her opposition to the 2008 Heller case was because "what the District of Columbia was trying to do was to protect toddlers from guns." City leaders did specifically cite the danger posed to children in trying to keep in place gun regulations, but the regulations were also a widespread ban on unregistered weapons, not just gun safety measures.

pomt-10333	"We now have a pro-American president in France, which shows if you live long enough, anything can happen in this world."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jul/23/john-mccain/you-didnt-actually-have-to-live-that-long/	Yes, it's a joke. But it's a favorite of Sen. John McCain's on the stump, and it includes a couple of serious claims worth checking. A recent iteration of the gag came during a McCain speech at the Maine Military Museum & Learning Center in South Portland, Maine, after a reference to how the French approach nuclear power. "And by the way, in case you missed it, we now have a pro-American president in France," McCain said July 21, 2008. "Which shows if you live long enough, anything can happen in this world. So — and we're grateful to him." It's a self-deprecating poke by McCain at his own age. But it's also a jab at France, and it rests on the twin assumptions that the country's new president, Nicolas Sarkozy, is pro-American, and that it is new or unusual for the president of France to feel that way. We know where McCain's coming from. There has long been in France, especially in the intellectual class, a resistance to American culture. They like their boulangeries, or bakeries, a lot more than the McDonald's we're exporting to them, for example. Sarkozy is different, in some respects. "He likes American culture more than any other former president of France," said Jean-Philippe Mathy, French studies professor at the University of Illinois and author of French Resistance: The French-American Culture Wars. "He's taking a lot of flak because he's kind of nouveau riche and he likes to wear expensive watches and things like that." He's got a little Hollywood in him. Just check out his wife . Sarkozy's open admiration for America has earned him the nickname "Sarko l'Amricain." That said, he's not quite as pro-American as McCain implies, nor are past French presidents as anti-American. Sarkozy is an ardent proponent of U.S.-style free-market capitalism — a philosophy that in Europe is called "liberalism" but resembles what we call conservatism. He is intent on dismantling portions of France's prodigious welfare state and social security system. But with respect to the most notable policy difference between France and the United States in recent years — the split over the decision to invade Iraq — Sarkozy is only somewhat different from his predecessor, Jacques Chirac. Chirac opposed the invasion before it took place, and in November 2004 said it had "made the world more dangerous." Sarkozy has accused Chirac of being "arrogant" for the manner in which he voiced his opposition, but Sarkozy did not support the war either, and has let it be known that he too would have declined to send troops to Iraq. In a speech at Columbia University in 2004, Sarkozy said France's opposition stemmed from its violent colonial history in Algeria and Vietnam. "Please don't be angry with us because we remember what happened to us," he said. "Is there ever a single country of the world, at any time of history, that was able to maintain itself in a sustained way in a country that was not its own, uniquely by force of arms? Never, not a single one, even the Chinese." That follows in a long tradition of French presidents who, while maintaining a close alliance with the United States, have resisted certain aspects of our foreign policy to varying degrees. Franois Mitterrand, a socialist who was president of France from 1981 to 1995, leaned toward the hostile end of that spectrum. On the other hand, his predecessor, Valry Giscard d'Estaing, a probusiness, center-right politician who was president from 1974 to 1981, was widely regarded as very friendly to the United States, experts said. Charles de Gaulle, president from 1959 to 1969, was famously resistant to American influence, and is probably the main source of the stereotype to which McCain was referring, according to Edward Berenson, director of the Institute of French Studies at New York University. He pulled France's troops out of NATO's command structure to signal independence from Washington in 1966, though ultimately he leaned sharply away from the Soviet Union and toward the United States in the Cold War. So yes, a strain of anti-Americanism runs through French foreign policy and culture, flaring up at times and mellowing out at others. But French presidents have long been pro-American in the most important sense, maintaining their alliance with the United States. And if it's France's objection to the invasion of Iraq that McCain's audience is concerned about, he's misleading them to suggest Sarkozy is very different. But Sarko is Amricain in some respects, so we find McCain's claim to be Half True.	None	John McCain	None	None	None	2008-07-23T00:00:00	2008-07-21	['France']
pomt-02442	"Federal government reneging" on Medicaid payments to Wisconsin caused about $240 million in extra costs in the 2013-’15 state budget.	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/feb/28/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-federal-government-reneged-medic/	One of Gov. Scott Walker’s explanations for rejecting a full expansion of Medicaid under the federal "Obamacare" health care law was this: The feds won’t be good for the money. And for more than a year, the Republican governor has cited a piece of recent state budget history as evidence. Most recently, Walker made his case to a national cable audience in a Fox News Sunday appearance on Feb. 23, 2014, telling interviewer Chris Wallace he doubted the federal law’s promise to cover 100 percent of the expansion for three years and no less than 90 percent thereafter starting in 2020. State taxpayers pick up the rest. "That commitment is not going to be there and taxpayers all across America will be on the hook," Walker said. "They are not going to be on the hook in Wisconsin." That’s a prediction, but it was followed by this piece of evidence stated as fact: "Even before the Medicaid expansion I had (provided) $600 million more to Medicaid. Almost 40 percent of that was to fill in the federal government reneging on commitments they've already made even before the Medicaid expansion." In other words, they’ll break their promise because they’ve done it before. With Walker’s decisions on Obamacare and Medicaid poised to become 2014 campaign issues let’s look at this one. Did "federal reneging" on Medicaid payments to Wisconsin pile approximately $240 million in extra costs onto the 2013-’15 state budget? How it works The biggest component of the broken promise, in Walker’s view, is a recent drop in the federal government’s share of what Wisconsin spends on Medicaid, which has covered children and parents with children under 19 in low-income households as well as people who are disabled or over 65 and impoverished." The federal share was 60.21 percent in 2010, but by 2014 fell to 59.06 and is projected to drop further, to 58.27 percent, for the 2015 fiscal year. That has raised costs to Wisconsin taxpayers, but there’s a major problem in Walker’s contention. The federal share -- known as the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage, or FMAP -- fluctuates annually and varies from state to state based on a formula dating to Medicaid’s inception in 1965. That formula is "designed so that the federal government pays a larger portion of Medicaid costs in states with lower per-capita incomes relative to the national average (and vice versa for states with higher per-capita incomes)," a Congressional Research Service paper noted in 2013. In other words, the standard federal share of Medicaid costs is not promised or guaranteed to hold steady; it must only stay between the statutory minimum of 50 percent and maximum of 83 percent. It has gone up notably in some recent years as well. In fact, Wisconsin saw its federal rate rise from 2009 to 2010, and also got a big additional bump to more than 70 percent for almost three years under the federal stimulus law and a subsequent legislative action -- both of which applied nationally. Another major cost increase Walker has cited to back up his claim in the last year relates to hikes in the cost of premiums, deductibles and copayments that Medicaid pays for so-called "dual eligibles" who qualify for Medicare and Medicaid. No reversal Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said these and other cost increases are evidence of reneging by Washington. But neither the fluctuations in federal help or the dual-eligible cost changes are due to any changes in federal Medicaid law or policy, according to the independent, nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau. It made this note in a November 2013 memo to state Rep. Jon Richards (D-Milwaukee). The federal cost-sharing formula has not been changed to reduce matching rates since President Reagan and Congress enacted a temporary reduction for 1982-1984, said Edwin Park, a health-policy expert at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. And the cost increases for "dual eligibles" are routine, reflecting rising health care costs, Park said. Finally, Walker cites new costs states will have to pick up under Obamacare. They are real, but two experts told us they do not represent a broken commitment. Conservative health economist Stephen Parente at the University of Minnesota shares Walker’s skepticism about future federal funding of the Medicaid expansion, especially given Obama’s pull-backs in putting the health-care law into full effect. And he said governors are rightly frustrated by swings in Medicaid payments from Washington. But Parente said it’s not accurate to call those swings "reneging." Jon Peacock, research director at the left-leaning Wisconsin Council on Children & Families, agreed. His view is Walker could have made the state less vulnerable to declines in federal help if he had taken the additional federal money available for the Medicaid expansion. "If we took advantage of the Medicaid expansion funds," Peacock told us, "we would get a much higher matching rate that is locked in (under the law.)" Our rating Explaining his rejection of federal money to fully expand Medicaid coverage, Walker said on Fox News Sunday that "federal government reneging" on Medicaid payments to Wisconsin caused more than $200 million in extra costs in the 2013-’15 state budget. But typical cost-sharing fluctuations, based mainly on a longstanding formula, explain the extra state burden -- not any reversal of course or pulling back on a commitment by Washington.

pomt-13502	"The Clinton Foundation gives less than 10 (percent in direct aid). In 2013, they raised 140 million bucks, gave $9 million to people in direct aid."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2016/sep/06/alex-castellanos/trump-surrogate-repeats-wrong-talking-point-clinto/	Surrogates for Donald Trump continue to make the argument that the Clinton Foundation is a "slush fund" for Bill and Hillary Clinton, and they keep repeating an inaccurate talking point. While discussing on Meet the Press why Trump has yet to release his tax returns, Republican strategist Alex Castellanos turned the tables, saying that the nonprofit bearing Clinton’s name doesn’t do much except enrich her family. "Because that idea that somehow the Clinton Foundation is this wonderful thing that helps people, most charities give 75 percent of their money in direct aid. The Clinton Foundation gives less than 10 (percent). In 2013, they raised 140 million bucks, gave 9 million to people in direct aid," Castellanos said. We’ve heard various versions of this claim (from former GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh and RNC chairman Reince Priebus). It’s misleading. Castellanos’ numbers don’t take into account the bulk of the foundation's work. The foundation does spend a lot of money on charity, not through grantmaking, but through its own programming. Tax returns show the Clinton Foundation raised just under $143 million and spent about $85 million, including $9 million in grants to other organizations. But that does not include all of the foundation's charitable work "Grantmaking is not part of its mission, and that creates confusion — since many people imagine that foundations are engaged in giving away money," writes David Callahan, editor of Inside Philanthropy. Despite its name, the Clinton Foundation is not actually a private foundation (like the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation or the Donald J. Trump Foundation) that solely gives to philanthropic causes. Rather, it’s a public charity, like United Way or the Salvation Army, that runs its own in-house projects and hires staff to carry out the work. Clinton Foundation programs include providing women in Peru with the tools and equipment to launch their own businesses, installing solar panels and grids in Haiti after the earthquake, helping farmers in Tanzania boost yields and turn a profit, and using market mechanisms to reduce the cost of HIV/AIDS medicine. All together, these programs cost $68 million in 2013 (page 10 of the foundation’s tax documents for that year), or about 80 percent of all of the foundation's expenses that year. In 2014, programs were 87 percent of the Clinton Foundation’s expenses, according to Charity Navigator, giving it a score of 10 out of 10 on that metric. Here’s a more detailed breakdown of the foundation’s 2013 expenses: In sum, Castellanos’ claim is "totally wrong," Callahan of Inside Philanthropy told PolitiFact. "The vast majority of the money raised goes to support program work in the field, as anyone can tell from looking at the Clinton Foundation’s annual finances." Castellanos did not respond to requests for comment. Our ruling Castellanos said, "The Clinton Foundation gives less than 10 (percent in direct aid). In 2013, they raised 140 million bucks, gave $9 million to people in direct aid." Castellanos is cherry-picking one line-item that doesn't include all of the foundation's spending on charity. While outside grantmaking made up about 10 percent of its expenses in 2013, the foundation spent about $68 million, or about 80 percent, on in-house charitable programs to help those in need.

pomt-06362	Says "the City of Portland alone has 84 public relation representatives on payroll which cost taxpayers over $6.2 million (a year)."	false	/oregon/statements/2011/nov/04/taxpayer-association-oregon/does-portland-really-have-84-pr-people-staff/	Nobody likes hearing about government waste -- especially not when lawmakers spend most of their time talking about which programs to cut. So, naturally, we read with interest the Taxpayer Association of Oregon's Fall 2011 "Government Waste Watch Report." We weren’t a paragraph in and already something had caught our attention. The report noted that "The City of Portland alone has 84 public relation representatives on payroll, which cost taxpayers over $6.2 million." The Oregonian had just published a story pegging the number of state employees working in communications at 125, or 220 if you include managers and people in design shops. Sure, Portland is the state’s largest city by far, but 84 for the city alone? The report cited the source for the number as a Willamette Week story from May. We did some googling and found the original article. Just a few paragraphs in and you get the salient info: "There are a lot of them (public relations employees) — 94 in the Portland area — and their paychecks add up to nearly $7 million a year … these public-relations people work for the City of Portland, Metro, Portland Public Schools, Multnomah County, the Port of Portland, Portland State University, TriMet and Oregon Health & Science University." Just a couple sentences further and the writer, James Pitkin, addresses Portland specifically: "The biggest PR team belongs to the City of Portland. It spends $2.1 million paying its 28 PR people." That’s sizable, but it’s hardly the 84 that the Taxpayer Association cited in its critique. Willamette Week also posted a list of the folks that they identified as being on the payroll in communications positions. We called Portland’s Bureau of Human Resources to see if we could confirm the names. The Bureau sent us a copy of a public records request dated July 14, 2011 that listed 25 employees. We reconciled the two lists and found that Willamette Week included the Portland Development Commission, bumping their figure of 28 employees. With the PDC, their salaries were closer to $2.1 million, not $6 million. We called the Taxpayer Association to see what was up. Jason Williams, the executive director, said the mistake was theirs. While typing up the newsletter, they confused the city’s figures with the Portland-area figures. Still, he said, even 28 public relations employees was too many. "Eighty-four is even too much even for the whole state. If government is doing its job, it doesn't need a press agent." The fact that Williams admitted their mistake gets the association some brownie points, but it doesn’t change the fact that they were misinforming the 10,000 people who receive their watch reports. And it doesn’t change our ruling. We give this claim a False. Return to OregonLive to comment on this statement and ruling.

pomt-03283	A Republican housing finance reform bill "would eliminate a person’s ability to obtain 15- and 30-year mortgages."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2013/aug/04/gwen-moore/gop-bill-would-put-traditional-home-mortgages-out-/	After the real estate market collapsed during the Great Depression, the federal government created entities to encourage families to buy houses and banks to make home loans. The Federal Housing Administration, founded in 1934, issues mortgage insurance to guarantee banks they will get their money back even if a homeowner doesn’t make payments. That made it easier for banks to approve mortgages for people who don’t have a lot of money or have mediocre credit. Fannie Mae and later Freddie Mac, two government-sponsored enterprises, were created to buy up, bundle and sell mortgages as mortgage-backed securities on the open market. That gave lenders more money to make home loans. But by 2008, Uncle Sam had to bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as the recession took hold. And several years later, FHA was also in financial straits. Those developments helped precipitate a move in July 2013 by Republican leaders of the House Financial Services Committee. They announced they would introduce the Protecting American Taxpayers and Homeowners Act (PATH), aiming at largely removing the government from the financing of home purchases. That prompted U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore, a member of the committee, to go on the attack. "This radical bill would push the dream of home ownership further and further out of reach for Wisconsin families. The so-called PATH Act is, in actuality, the PATH to Nowhere," the Wisconsin Democrat charged in a July 24, 2013 news release. The bill, Moore continued, "would eliminate a person’s ability to obtain 15- and 30-year mortgages – the cornerstone of our housing finance system." Let’s see if that’s so. Moore's evidence Moore spokeswoman Staci Cox told us that when Moore referred to "a person’s" ability to obtain a traditional fixed-rate mortgage, she meant the "average American." To back the statement, Cox highlighted testimony made to the House Financial Services Committee by Mark Zandi, chief economist for the Moody's Analytics economic research firm. He said the PATH bill would put 30-year fixed-rate mortgage loans "out of reach for most Americans." Without the government guarantees, mortgage rates would increase, adding $130 per month to the cost of a mortgage for the typical borrower, Zandi said. And while three-quarters of mortgage loans currently are fixed rate, that would drop to 20 percent to 25 percent, he said. Moore also cites opposition to aspects of the bill from several major players in housing. The National Association of Home Builders, for example, said the bill would "greatly limit homeownership" for "many qualified Americans"; and the Credit Union National Association said it feared the bill could not "ensure continuation of long-term fixed-rate mortgage products." So, Moore doesn’t have hard evidence that the PATH bill would eliminate the ability of a person to get a traditional mortgage; that remains to be seen. But experts say such mortgages could become unavailable or unaffordable for many people. GOP response The PATH bill, pushed by U.S. Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, would shut down Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in five years and limit the focus of the FHA's mortgage insurance to first-time home buyers with moderate incomes. Jeff Emerson, a staff member of the House Financial Services Committee, gave us a response to Moore's claim. Emerson cited a Washington Post editorial that rebutted the assertion that 30-year mortgages would go away. The editorial noted that 30-year fixed-rate loans known as jumbo mortgages "already exist without government help," saying: "Presumably private-sector innovation could create loan products, with 30-year terms or otherwise, appropriate for smaller borrowers as well." But current jumbo mortgages require a borrower to have a higher income, a good credit score and typically a 30 percent down payment, according to Realtor.com. Emerson also said PATH "is designed to create more opportunities for more choices, including the 30-year fixed rate loan. The market will respond to customer demand, as it always does." So, while there is no indication that traditional mortgages would cease to exist, neither of Emerson's points are evidence that they would remain as available as they are with today's government guarantees. Other evidence Other experts, while disagreeing on the overall impact of PATH on traditional fixed-rate mortgages, acknowledge that the elimination of government guarantees or subsidies inevitably means that the terms of such mortgages would change. Georgetown University law professor Adam Levitin, whose specialties include housing finance, agreed with Zandi. He testified to House Financial Services Committee that the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is "heavily a function of federal backing of the housing finance system" and that if PATH became law, "it would be difficult for most American families to obtain 30-year, fixed-rate mortgages." Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the conservative American Action Forum, and Mark Calabria, director of financial regulation studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, testified that affordable fixed-rate mortgages would still be offered, but they weren’t specific. Calabria noted the current availability of fixed-rate jumbo home mortgages, as well as fixed-rate auto loans. In a New York Times opinion column, University of Maryland public policy professor Phillip Swagel, who is also a scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, praised the PATH bill. But he acknowledged that without government guarantees, mortgage interest rates would rise, though "it is hard to know quite how much." He also stated the housing market "is in an upswing and affordability remains high, so it seems likely that the housing sector would continue to recover even with higher rates." Our rating Moore stated that a Republican bill to largely privatize the nation’s housing finance system "would eliminate a person’s ability to obtain 15- and 30-year mortgages." It's unknown how exactly the effects of the bill would play out. But there is reason to believe that without government guarantees, traditional home mortgages would become less available, less affordable, or both, for many Americans. Our definition of Half True is a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details. That fits for this one.

pomt-13258	Hillary Clinton said gun confiscation "would be worth considering."	mostly false	/virginia/statements/2016/oct/17/national-rifle-association/nra-weakly-claims-clinton-said-gun-confiscation-wo/	A National Rifle Association flier shows the jaws of a crane dumping hundreds of rifles into a landfill. "What did Hillary Clinton say when she was asked about gun confiscation in America?" it asks in capital letters. The flier answers the question with this Clinton quote: "I think it would be worth considering doing it on a national level, if that can be arranged." Next to the quote is a photo of a strident-looking Clinton speaking into a microphone. We examined whether Clinton really did say that U.S. gun confiscation is "worth considering." The flier was issued by the NRA’s lobbying arm, the Institute for Legislative Action. It says Clinton made the statement during a town hall campaign event in Keene, N.H., on Oct 16, 2015. She was asked whether she’d support a national gun buyback program similar to one Australia instituted in 1996 after a mass shooting in Tasmania left 35 dead. A month later, Australia banned semi-automatic and self-loading rifles as well as shotguns. The government offered a one-year grace period during which it would buy back the firearms at fair-market prices. After that, people possessing the weapons would subject to strict penalties. The buyback program resulted in more than 640,000 prohibited weapons being turned in - roughly one-fifth of all the guns then estimated to be in Australia. Now, let’s go back to the New Hampshire town hall meeting. A tape shows a man asked Clinton this question: "Australia managed to take away tens of thousands - millions - of handguns and in one year they were all gone. Can we do that and why? If we can’t, why not? (The questioner was wrong in saying the buyback pertained to handguns; it didn’t.) Clinton replied that several nations have tightened their gun laws after experiencing mass shootings. "In the Australian example, as I recall, that was a buyback program," she said. "The Australian government, as part of trying to clamp down on the availability of automatic weapons, offered a good price for buying hundreds of thousands of guns and then they basically clamped down going forward in terms of, you know, more of a background check, more of a permitting approach. "But they believed, and I think the evidence supports them, that by offering to buy back those guns they were able to, you know, curtail the supply and set a different standard for gun purchases in the future." "Now (U.S.) communities have done that; communities have done gun buyback programs. But I think it would be worth considering doing that on the national level if that could be arranged." Clinton mentioned "cash for clunkers," the nickname of a 2009 voluntary program in which the U.S. government briefly offered payments to people wishing to trade in old, gas-guzzling vehicles. "So I think that’s worth considering," Clinton said. "I don’t know enough details to tell you how we would do it or how it would work. But certainly, the Australian example is worth considering." The NRA and other pro-gun groups instantly seized on Clinton’s comment, saying the buyback program Clinton lauded is tantamount to a confiscation program, because it backed many gun owners into a corner: They either could sell their firearms to the government or risk prosecution for keeping them. It was, the NRA says, "an offer gun owners could not refuse." Three days after the New Hampshire event, the Clinton campaign said the candidate opposes gun confiscation and accused the NRA of distorting her comments. "Of course Hillary does not support national mandatory gun buyback programs, including those modeled after Australia's program," spokesman Josh Schwerin wrote to us in an email. "She was discussing voluntary buyback programs, which are drastically different than what occurred in Australia and are regularly run by cities across the America." We asked the NRA if it had any other evidence that it believes shows Clinton is open to gun confiscation. A spokeswoman for the gun group’s lobbying arm questioned whether that was "relevant" to our fact-check and didn’t provide an answer. Our ruling The NRA says that when Clinton was asked about gun confiscation, she said "I think it would be worth doing it on a national level, if that can be arranged." Clinton made that statement last year at a New Hampshire campaign stop, when she was asked a vague question about an Australian program that gave gun owners one year to sell certain firearms to the government before those weapons became illegal. She left the NRA some room. But the NRA stretches her words to an almost unrecognizable form. Clinton focused her comments on voluntary buyback programs similar to those some U.S. communities have instituted for guns and the federal "cash-for-clunkers" program. She was ambiguous about how a U.S. guns buyback program might be structured, saying "I don’t know enough details to tell you how we would do it or how it would work." And her campaign since has said she opposes gun confiscation. So there’s an element of truth to the NRA’s statement, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That makes it Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9e238568-ad07-4375-9b74-3a07ed468f3c	None	National Rifle Association	None	None	None	2016-10-17T00:02:00	2016-10-08	['None']
pomt-08987	Phoenix is the kidnapping capital "of the Western Hemisphere."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/jul/15/helen-glover/helen-glover-says-phoenix-kidnap-capital-western-h/	After Republican congressional candidate John Loughlin returned from a trip to Arizona to get a firsthand look at the illegal immigration problem there, he was a guest on WHJJ's Helen Glover show. Loughlin told the story of a couple who live in Casa Grande, near Phoenix, who told him that they had stopped going biking because they were afraid of being kidnapped. "Phoenix is now the kidnapping capital of America," Loughlin declared. Glover agreed, but then insisted that the distinction extended beyond the United States. "Exactly. Of the Western Hemisphere. Yes. It includes the Western Hemisphere," she said. If you listen to the program you can hear Loughlin hesitate, showing some uncertainty over Glover's emphatic statement. With good reason. PolitiFact Texas addressed this issue in detail on June 18 when it examined a claim that Phoenix "is now the No. 2 kidnapping capital of the world, right behind Mexico City." It looked at it again when John McCain repeated that claim. It appears to originate from a Feb. 11, 2009, report from ABC News, which has not responded to a request from PolitiFact to document its assertion. PolitiFact Texas made its own inquiries to determine how Phoenix ranks on a worldwide scale. They were unable to find any hard numbers to back up the claim. It's clear that Phoenix has a serious kidnapping problem, which the police say is mostly related to illegal border crossings and the drug trade. There were 358 cases reported to the police in 2008, 318 in 2009 and 105 between January and May of this year. To put those numbers in some context, Philadelphia, which is comparable in population, reported just 9 kidnappings in 2009 -- 309 fewer than Phoenix. There is no easy source for comparable figures from other U.S. cities; kidnapping numbers are not routinely listed on annual FBI crime reports. There is also no reliable source of kidnapping data from foreign countries. But experts from international private security firms said cities in several Western Hemisphere countries, including Mexico, Colombia and Guatemala, have more kidnappings than Phoenix. Glover took an apparently made up statistic and took it a step further from the facts, making Phoenix the hemisphere's worst for kidnapping.

pomt-09598	Health care reform: "Everything about it is going to raise costs, raise taxes and lower the quality of health care."	false	/texas/statements/2010/jan/20/kay-bailey-hutchison/hutchison-says-health-care-bill-will-raise-costs-t/	A day after Senate Democrats released their version of the health care reform bill on Nov. 18, U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, who's seeking the GOP nod for governor, debuted a TV ad attacking the legislation. "Everything about it is going to raise costs, raise taxes and lower the quality of health care," Hutchison says in the ad. Everything? This kind of sweeping claim is often hard to back up with evidence. Hutchinson said everything in the bills would raise costs, raise taxes and lower quality. So if we can find anything that lowers costs, lowers taxes or raises quality, that would undermine the accuracy of her claim. Hutchison's campaign told us the senator was criticizing all Democratic proposals. Her campaign sent us about 20 excerpts from documents seemingly supporting her claim, attributing most of it to to the Republican Policy Committee and the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, both in Washington. We don't dispute any of the projected costs and taxes her campaign sent us. But like many parties to the health care debate, Hutchison appears to have cherry-picked numbers to prop up the points she wants to make. Let's talk about tax increases first. Hutchison notes that the bill includes a "$149 billion tax increase on private health insurance plans." She fails to mention that the levy, known as the "Cadillac tax," is one measure the federal government expects to generate revenue by taxing high-priced insurance plans (not all private policies). That is, most people, about 75 percent, won't see an additional tax. Hutchison cites "$43 billion in new taxes and fines levied on individuals and businesses," an abbreviated interpretation of how much the CBO has projected the federal government will generate in penalty payments from people and businesses who choose not to enroll in an insurance plan. She doesn't note that those increases are among the measure's features intended to offset costs. And she also fails to note that a good chunk of taxpayers — those who make up to 400 percent of the poverty level — will get a tax credit from the government to buy health insurance. So those people won't get a tax increase and in fact get a material benefit from the plan. Next, we looked at projected costs. Hutchison's campaign pointed us to total projected federal health care expenditures: $234 billion, according to a report by Richard Foster, chief actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), the federal agency that administers Medicare, Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. Unnoted by Hutchison's camp: The $234 billion reflects how much national health care expenditures would increase by 2016 — including the cost of providing coverage for 33 million people who were previously uninsured — about 10 percent of the population, most of whom (we'll suppose) would see the new benefit as a boon. Also unnoted by Hutchison: The CBO projects that under the Senate's health care plan, most insured people would see their premiums drop slightly by 2016. The CBO also concluded that through 2019, the Senate approach would reduce the federal deficit by $130 billion and slow the rate of federal spending growth due to new taxes and provisions to reduce spending over time. Spending cuts have also been proposed to save money — Hutchison notes $120 billion from Medicare Advantage, among others. We learned that's what she's referring to when she says quality will suffer. Yet the Senate plan separately has features intended to enhance quality such as pilot programs rewarding doctors for improving patients' outcomes and aimed at curbing unnecessary medical tests. We looked too at the impact of the plan on American taxpayers. The bottom line, according to the CMS and CBO projections, is that most people's taxes would not increase and most people's premiums wouldn't either. Summing up, Hutchison is correct that the Senate plan is projected to increase costs — at the onset — and to add taxes. But she she overlooked CBO projections stating the plan would slow long-term federal spending thanks to its provisions designed to offset costs. Hutchison stretches too far by saying everything in the bill would raise taxes, drive up costs and conceivably diminish quality. As we've described, several parts of the bill are intended to lower costs, and most people won't see a tax increase. We rate her overreach False.

pomt-05460	In the past three years, "we've added enough new oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/apr/23/barack-obama/obama-says-new-miles-pipeline-could-stretch-around/	President Barack Obama kept up the drumbeat for his "all of the above" energy strategy with a speech in the White House Rose Garden. Addressing criticism that he has stood in the way of domestic production, in the April 17, 2012, speech Obama said the opposite is true. "There are politicians who say that if we just drilled more, then gas prices would come down right away. What they don’t say is that we have been drilling more. Under my administration, America is producing more oil than at any time in the last eight years. We’ve opened up new areas for exploration. We've quadrupled the number of operating rigs to a record high. We've added enough new oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth and then some," Obama said, with a nod to middle-school science class. We've been hearing a lot about oil production recently and have checked several statements from Obama and Republicans on the matter. Here, we decided to check something we haven't heard before -- that the United States has added enough oil and gas pipeline to circle the Earth since Obama took office. First, it's important to note that it's unusual for presidents to become involved in decisions about pipeline construction, which is largely driven by whether the oil and gas industry is willing to make the large investment, an expert told us. Obama rejected an expedited plan pushed by Republicans to build the Keystone XL pipeline, but he has also emphasized the importance of pipeline construction. He has said that domestic production exceeds current pipeline capacity and in March signed an executive order streamlining the permitting and construction process of a new crude oil pipeline to Gulf Coast refineries. For this item, we’re not addressing whether Obama deserves credit for the pipeline because of the limited role presidents have. But we can check whether that much pipeline has been added. To back up Obama's claim, the White House pointed us to statistics from the U.S. Department of Transportation Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, which regulates pipelines. The DOT figures were last updated in April 2012 with mileage figures through 2010. So they do not include pipeline that was added last year or this year. Here's a comparison of the mileage at the end of 2008 (right before Obama took office) and the end of 2010: Crude oil 2008: 50,963 miles 2010: 54,728 +3,765 Petroleum products 2008: 61,599 2010: 64,752 + 3,153 Natural gas transmission 2008: 303,182 2010: 304,691 + 1,509 Natural gas distribution 2008: 2,074,513 2010: 2,095,690 + 21,177 That adds up to 2,490,257 oil and gas pipeline miles in 2008, and 2,519,861 in 2010. So that's 29,604 additional miles of pipeline. According to NASA, the equatorial circumference of the Earth is 24,873.6 miles. Obama's comparison is accurate, and given that the latest figures only cover through 2010, the real, current figure is likely higher. We asked two experts if the year-to-year comparison of pipeline miles is a valid measure and if anything else should be considered. Jay Hakes, former director of the Energy Information Administration under President Bill Clinton, said the data are reliable and "as near as I can tell, the assertion is well documented and correct." Tadeusz Patzek, chair of the Department of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin, pointed out that many miles of those pipelines are "field/project gathering lines of small diameter and small throughput" -- not large transmission lines many of us think of. He's right. According to the DOT numbers, 21,177 miles of the new pipeline are listed as natural gas distribution lines. Still, such lines are "a necessary piece" of the whole system. Said Patzek: "Without the small stuff you’re not going to increase the flow rate through the large." Is 29,604 miles over three years a lot? For some perspective, we looked at the miles added during the last three years of George W. Bush's presidency. They tell a wholly different story: 63,243 new miles of small natural gas distrbution lines -- more than Obama's overall total. But crude oil? Just 756 miles. Petroleum products: 808 fewer miles in 2005 than in 2007. We're not suggesting Obama has done better than Bush in this regard. The comparison simply reinforces the point that oil and gas supply and demand, and the industry's response to it, results from decisions made far from the White House. Our ruling Obama said the U.S. has added enough pipeline in the last three years to circle the Earth "and then some." He is right about the mileage, though it includes not just large interstate transmission lines but also small pipes that collect gas from groups of wells and feed to the larger lines. But those pipelines are a link in the grid, and Obama didn't specify only large transmission pipeline. The statement is accurate. We rate it True.

pomt-10741	Edwards says if Congress won't pass universal health care, he'll tell Congress: "I'm going to use my power as president to take your health care away from you."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/07/john-edwards/prez-cant-snatch-congress-health-care/	A television ad shows John Edwards giving a campaign speech and vowing to fight for universal health care coverage. "When I'm president I'm going to say to members of Congress and members of my administration, including my cabinet: I'm glad that you have health care coverage and your family has health care coverage," Edwards says. "But if you don't pass universal health care by July of 2009 – in six months – I'm going to use my power as president to take your health care away from you." Cue the wild applause. The problem with this statement is that the president can't just "take away" health care from Congress. "Health care for Congress and the administration is passed by statute. The president can't repeal a law on his own," said Don Ritchie, associate historian of the Senate Historical Office. "Congress has the power of the purse and passes legislation. It's the president who's dependent on Congress to get legislation passed," he said. If we broaden our view from the 30-second ad, Edwards fleshed out his idea in a September 2007 speech he gave in Chicago. During that speech, he explained that his plan was to "submit legislation that ends health care coverage for the president, all members of Congress, and all senior political appointees in both branches of government on July 20th, 2009 -- unless we have passed universal health care reform." That's a more realistic scenario, and there's nothing to stop a president from submitting legislation if he can find a member to introduce it. But count us dubious on Congress voting away its own health care coverage. In the meantime, we find Edwards' lordly pronouncement in his TV ad to border on the absurd. As a former member of the U.S. senate, he should know better. For that reason, we give him the rare Pants on Fire ruling.

pomt-10635	"You've got a building in the Cayman Islands that supposedly houses 12,000 corporations. That's either the biggest building or the biggest tax scam on record."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/jan/09/barack-obama/yes-but-its-not-illegal/	Thousands of subsidiaries, many from U.S. corporations, have indeed set up shop — or more precisely, hung a nameplate — at the five-story Ugland House and other financial centers in the Cayman Islands. They include Coca-Cola, Procter & Gamble, General Motors, Intel, FedEx and Sprint. But while Sen. Barack Obama is right on the general point, calling the practice "the biggest tax scam on record" is questionable. From the quote itself, it's hard to tell if Obama is taking issue with the way companies use the Caymans as a tax shelter, or if he's objecting to the U.S. tax code that makes it possible. "There's nothing better than to beat up on a tax haven on a beach," said Douglas Shackelford, a professor at the University of North Carolina's business school. "It sounds crooked, but if one really thinks about the facts, I don't see the grounding." Weather isn't drawing the corporations, of course. The Caymans do not have a corporate income tax. The United States taxes corporate income at 35 percent, higher than most countries. As long as profits are not brought back to the United States, or "repatriated," no tax is due. Federal law allows the taxation of "passive income," meaning the interest earned on profits of those subsidiaries. But typically the companies reinvest the money elsewhere, Shackelford said. Obama is the co-sponsor of legislation that would crack down on offshore activities by corporations and individuals. The Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act would target an estimated $100-billion annually, including $30-billion from corporations. According to published financial reports, Coca-Cola alone saved $500-million in U.S. taxes in 2003 through foreign subsidiaries. Its Cayman company controls syrup-producing facilities in Ireland. The subsidiary pays taxes in Ireland at 12.5 percent, still far less than in the United States. So, Obama is right that thousands of corporations, and some do say more than 12,000, are in one building in the Caymans, but he goes too far when he implies it's an illegal scam. We rule his statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2008-01-09T00:00:00	2008-01-05	['Cayman_Islands']
pomt-14211	The Colorado caucus system for selecting Republican delegates is "rigged."	false	/colorado/statements/2016/apr/19/donald-trump/trump-calls-colorado-caucus-system-rigged-theres-n/	After Ted Cruz completed his sweep of all 34 delegates at the Colorado Republican convention, Donald Trump branded the state GOP’s caucus system "rigged" and "crooked." Trump told Fox & Friends that rank-and-file Colorado Republicans are "going absolutely crazy because they weren't given a vote, this was given by politicians. It's a crooked deal. ... It's a rigged system." Trump implied that he didn’t bother speaking to the Colorado convention because state "politicians" controlled the process and there’s "no voting." Fox News contributor Pete Hegseth asked Trump, "Isn't it just fair to say, These are the rules, Ted Cruz is organized, and you're just flat-out being out-organized?" Trump disagreed, saying, he has "out-organized" Cruz because "I have millions of more votes" and more delegates. Like many state caucuses, Colorado’s is a complex and arcane maze for newcomers to navigate. But was the Colorado system "rigged" and a "crooked deal" that deprived people of their vote, as Trump claimed? Confusing as they are, the rules for the caucus were changed in August 2015, two months after Trump entered the presidential race. And there’s no evidence the tweaks were made to disenfranchise Trump. Let’s dig deeper. Trump has performed better in states with primary elections, where his supporters can simply vote at their regular neighborhood polling place. But the Republican frontrunner’s campaign has struggled in state caucuses because it has lacked a strong ground game to shepherd voters through bewildering caucus gatherings that are rife with rules. When Trump said there was "no voting" at the Colorado caucuses, he was referring to an August 2015 decision by the state GOP's executive committee, which unanimously voted to abandon a presidential preference poll at this year’s precinct caucuses. The committee said it was reacting to the national party changing its rules to bind state delegates to the caucus winner — potentially leaving delegates tied to a candidate who later dropped out of the race. Yet, Trump is wrong in saying there was "no voting" at the caucuses. About 60,000 Republicans attended the state precinct caucuses. People voted at every level of the delegate selection process. The multistep Colorado GOP caucus process began March 1, when party members selected delegates at precinct caucuses. Those delegates moved on to higher-level gatherings before delegates for the Republican National Convention were selected at district assemblies and the April 9 state convention. Cruz, whose campaign had been building an organization in Colorado since January, was the only GOP presidential candidate to address the state convention. He grabbed all 34 delegates. Trump supporters, however, describe a problem-plagued process at the state convention. At a protest outside the Colorado Capitol building on Friday, April 15, about 200 Trump backers said their votes were "stolen." Some claimed they were misinformed and even lied to during the caucuses. The confusion continued at the state convention. Party organizers left about 30 delegates off the ballot and had to send out a correction sheet just before the convention vote. At least one Cruz delegate was entered twice on the ballot, replacing a Trump delegate, said Gabriel Schwartz, a Trump backer and state convention veteran. "Very obvious there was gross incompetence at the state (GOP) level," Schwartz told KMGH-TV. State GOP officials called the snafus a few "clerical errors" that didn’t impact the convention’s outcome. A Denver Post editorial said the Colorado Republican Party’s process for selecting presidential delegates "ranked among the least representative of all states." The editorial based its finding on the caucuses’ delegate-to-voter ratio — roughly 1 to 1,714 — and a national analysis by FiveThirtyEight.com. "In short, Colorado Republican leaders got what they wanted when they abandoned a presidential preference poll at the caucus. An extremely narrow base of activists and insiders chose the delegates in a process that ranked among the least representative and democratic in the country," the editorial said. However, the editorial still concluded, "Not that Donald Trump and his supporters have any ground for their complaints. As we've said before, they knew the rules." Even some Trump backers were disappointed by the campaign’s weak effort in Colorado. Trump delegate Larry Lindsey posted a YouTube that went viral of him fuming about being denied entrance to the state convention and burning his Republican party registration paper. Lindsey said he later learned that he was ineligible for the convention because he’d missed a county caucus vote. Yet, he said, someone told him the meeting was postponed. "The (Trump) organization here in Colorado was definitely lacking. I have to admit that, reluctantly," Lindsey told PolitiFact. University of Denver political scientist Peter Hanson said Cruz’s win in Colorado is a reminder that a good ground game matters. "Organization is key," Hanson told KMGH-TV. "It's one thing for a candidate to give a speech to a rally and think that their work is done. That's just not the way it works." U.S. Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who endorsed Sen. Marco Rubio, issued a sharp rebuttal to Trump’s criticism of the state caucus system. "Donald Trump, who has known the rules since last August, he decided not to show up. Elections are won by those who show up and Ted Cruz showed up," Gardner told Fox News. Our ruling Trump said the Colorado GOP’s caucus system is "rigged" and "crooked." There are plenty of problems with Colorado’s caucus system. The delegate selection process is dominated by party activists and insiders, and this year’s caucuses were hampered -- at best -- by confusion and technical glitches. But Trump is complaining about rules that were in place eight months ago, when the Republican presidential race was clogged with 17 candidates. There is no evidence the rules were designed to favor a specific candidate. His campaign took a pass on the Colorado caucuses, focusing instead on the delegate-rich New York primary, while Cruz ran an exhaustive ground game in the Centennial State.

pomt-03462	"Worldwide credit card transactions, the credit card fraud rate is 0.04 percent, compared to almost 8 percent, 9 percent, 10 percent of Medicare fraud."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jun/17/peter-roskam/rep-roskam-says-medicare-fraud-rate-8-10-percent/	Fraud by its very nature tries to hide from view. So when Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., talked about how big the problem is for the Medicare program, he gave himself some wiggle room. Roskam was talking to Fox News about a bill he has that would borrow tools used in the credit card industry to pare down the tens of billions of dollars that criminal gangs and unscrupulous operators pocket from the federal government’s health care program for the elderly. "Worldwide credit card transactions, the credit card fraud rate is 0.04 percent," Roskam told Fox News. "Compared to almost 8 percent, 9 percent, 10 percent of Medicare fraud." When PolitiFact checked the size of Medicare fraud five years ago, we quickly discovered that hard and fast numbers are hard to come by. In this fact-check, we’ll examine Roskam’s estimate of 8 to 10 percent and see what sources he relies on. Before we dive into Medicare fraud, a review of credit card studies shows that Roskam is pretty much on the mark when he speaks of a 0.04 percent rate. A 2010 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City gives a fraud rate of 0.05 percent for U.S. issued cards, both debit and credit. Roskam’s office pointed us to a trade publication, the Nilson Report, that cites an international rate of 0.04 percent rate. On Medicare, Roskam’s office cited a Government Accountability Office report, a watchdog website created by an executive order from President Barack Obama, and an article from the U.S. Administration on Aging. All three give us rates that range from 7.9 percent to 8.5 percent for the largest Medicare program, and up to 11 percent for a smaller program, Medicare Advantage. While the fraud rates fall into Roskam’s range, none of them is talking about fraud alone. Rather, they address the much broader category of improper payments. If a doctor orders too many tests, or provides a service but submits the wrong payment code, those come under the umbrella of improper payments. Out and out fraud is not as large as improper payments, but it can be egregious. The FBI recently charged 25 people in Miami for allegedly bribing Medicare beneficiaries and then using their account numbers to bill for services that were unnecessary or never provided. The government says the scheme netted the conspirators about $44 million. Malcolm Sparrow, professor of public management and a specialist in corruption control at Harvard’s Kennedy School, told us that fraud and improper payments are far from identical. "There is a serious problem with conflating these different types of overpayment," Sparrow said. "They are quite different in origin and require very different types of control mechanisms." When we raised this with Roskam’s office, his staff sent us several examples where Roskam has spoken collectively of fraud, waste and abuse. On Fox News, however, he spoke only of fraud. PolitiFact also found a study that restores a measure of credibility to Roskam’s estimate. Donald Berwick, a former head of the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS, the agency that runs Medicare, collaborated with an analyst at RAND to produce a landmark paper in 2012 in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association. That paper offers three estimates of fraud in the Medicare and Medicaid programs: a low of 3 percent, a medium of 6 percent and a high of 10 percent. CMS told us they have no official estimate of fraud but pointed us to this study, and they cited FBI figures that mirror the numbers in this paper. If it turns out that the high end of the range in the JAMA article is correct, then Roskam is in the right ballpark. Of course, nobody knows for sure because fraud is a crime, and criminals don’t advertise their work. Two caveats for policy makers The JAMA article doesn’t stop at Medicare and Medicaid. It also looks at fraud in the health care sector as a whole, both public and private. The fraud rates don’t change much when the private sector is included. For Sparrow at Harvard, this is no surprise. "The systems and structures they use for control are the same, across public, private, and not-for-profit programs," Sparrow said. "They all tend to share the same strengths and weaknesses, and are roughly equally vulnerable." Put another way, the nature of the American health care system lends itself to a certain level of fraud, and the Medicare program is no more and no less susceptible to this type of crime. Sparrow says this also suggests the comparison to the credit card industry might be less useful than might appear. In the first place, the transactions are much simpler. When a thief tries a scam with a credit card, the card holder tends to notice by the next bill. In general, this kind of fraud is more easily detected and tracked. But Sparrow says there’s a bigger difference. "The losses are borne by banks," he said. That creates a powerful incentive, in real time, to control the problem. In health care, the incentives are "more diffuse and ambiguous." Our ruling Roskam said the Medicare fraud rate is 8 to 10 percent. His office pointed us to various documents that analyzed the problem of improper payments, an issue that mixes fraud together with nominally legal activities such as referring patients for more tests than are necessary. This suggested Roskam was using an inflated estimate of fraud. However, a recent study tends, in the worst-case analysis, to support Roskam’s figures. Roskam’s comparison to credit cards overlooks many key differences between the structures of the health care and credit card industries, and it tends to obscure the systematic nature of fraud in health care, whether public or private. But Roskam is right that credit card fraud is a tiny percentage of all transactions. We rate the statement Mostly True.	None	Peter Roskam	None	None	None	2013-06-17T15:53:24	2013-06-12	['None']

The savings rate is now 6.2 percent."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/aug/02/george-will/george-will-says-personal-saving-rate-has-increase/	During the Aug. 1, 2010, roundtable on ABC's This Week, host Christiane Amanpour asked panelists about the current levels of slow growth in the United States economy. "Growth is happening," Amanpour said, "but at 2.4 percent, which is slower than most people wanted. I see you shaking your head in this debate. The Financial Times is basically saying that the deficit talk is a phony, rhetorical war and that actually stimulus has had some effect." She turned to George Will, the conservative columnist, who had been shaking his head. "Well, the recovery is now more than a year old, and we know two things about it," Will said. "It's unusually weak for a recovery after a severe downturn, and, B, starting weak, it's getting weaker, for two reasons. First of all, the stimulus is running out. ... Cash for Clunkers has come and gone. The homebuyer's tax credit for purchasing new -- particularly new homes, come and gone. Second, the growth so far has been largely driven by inventories, businesses rebuilding their inventories in anticipation of the consumer -- 70 percent of business activity in a normal time -- coming back to the malls. The trouble is, the consumer in his native perversity has begun to save. The savings rate is now 6.2 percent. So what you have is what I think Keynes called the paradox of thrift. ... It's a virtue until it isn't a virtue." We thought it would be worthwhile to check whether the savings rate has in fact risen to 6.2 percent during the recession. Checking the number itself was easy. We looked to the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis, which tracks the personal saving rate, which it defines as the percentage of personal disposable income that is saved. The data shows that during the second quarter of 2010, the personal saving rate was about 6.2 percent, just as Will had said. Will is also right to suggest that the rate has risen. The current rate is the second highest it has been in any quarter since at least 2004, which is the earliest data BEA offers on the chart we found. Prior to the start of the recession in 2008, the saving rate was typically below 4 percent, and much of the time it was below 2 percent. In other words, consumers today are hoarding significantly more of their income than they were during the go-go days of high real estate values, easy credit and a steadily growing economy. So Will is right on the facts. But we were also intrigued about whether the higher savings rate has hampered the nation's economic recovery, as he suggests. Let's begin by explaining the "paradox of thrift" that Will cited. The major tenet is that when people save a lot of money, rather than spend it, they help their own bottom lines -- but that if everyone follows that approach, then everybody loses. According to the theory, the money saved doesn't get injected into the economy, where it would boost production and profits and help create jobs. In other words, a higher personal savings rate, like the one Will is talking about, can actually hurt the economy even as it helps individuals live within their means and hedge against personal economic setbacks. We checked with a cross-section of economists to see whether they thought this theory -- which was popularized by left-of-center economist John Maynard Keynes -- is generally considered accurate today. The experts we talked to said that it has broad, but not universal, approval. Most of the skepticism about the paradox of thrift has come from the right. Conservative economist Dan Mitchell of the libertarian Cato Institute said that free-market economics doesn't dispute that higher saving leads to lower consumption, but it places less importance on that shift. Free-marketers say that as long as the national income is growing, then the displacement of consumption by savings doesn't matter that much. J.D. Foster, a senior fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that when Keynes popularized the concept in the early 20th century, the money that was "saved" was actually stuck in the proverbial mattress, at which point it really did leave the economic system. By contrast, there are many relatively safe options for parking one's money today, even accounting for the shakiness in the financial sector since 2008. And if a higher savings rate means that people are putting their money into banks or other safe investments, that money makes its way back into the economy as capital available to lend. In turn, greater availability of loans can help juice the economy. That said, there are still many defenders of the original Keynesian view of the paradox of thrift. They cite real-world evidence from the past few years, in which investment has fallen compared to pre-recession levels despite historically low interest rates. "Businesses and households evidently do not want to invest as much in 2010 as they did in 2007" because they're not confident those investments will pay off, said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution. "Of course, one reason for their lack of confidence is the very slow growth in household consumption, which is a byproduct of the rise in household saving rates. On the surface, then, the facts tend to support the broad version of the paradox of thrift. The jump in the household saving rate has thus been harmful to economic growth, at least in the short run." We'll acknowledge that there's a difference of opinion in how economists view the impact of the saving rate's growth during the recession. But on Will's core factual assertion -- that the savings rate has climbed during the recession -- he's correct. So we rate his statement True.

pomt-01648	"We’ve seen highway fatalities actually decrease in Colorado" since marijuana use was legalized.	half-true	/oregon/statements/2014/aug/22/anthony-johnson/have-colorado-highway-fatalities-decreased-marijua/	Oregon voters will have the chance in November to join only Colorado and Washington as states where recreational use of marijuana is legal. Not surprisingly, the issue is already heating up, with those for and against staking out positions they hope will sway voters on Measure 91. The claim: Anthony Johnson, the measure’s chief petitioner and director of the advocacy group New Approach Oregon, made his pitch recently when the City Club of Portland met to debate the merits of nine political issues, legal marijuana among them. When an opposition speaker questioned why Oregon should follow the lead of Colorado and Washington into the relatively uncharted territory of legal pot, Johnson noted the pluses of regulation and taxation. Addressing opposition predictions that driving accidents would spike in those states, he added, "We've seen highway fatalities actually decrease in Colorado" since recreational use of marijuana became legal there in January. Since the effect legalization might have on impaired driving is a big topic in Oregon in the lead up to November, PolitiFact Oregon checked the numbers. The analysis: Colorado’s medical marijuana law took effect in 2002, giving the Centennial State a relatively long history of dealing with the drug in an other-than-illegal capacity. However, recreational use has been in effect for only seven months, making any numbers suspect in terms of how longer-term trends might play out. That said, we figured that comparing the number of traffic fatalities recorded during the first seven months of this year with the first seven of 2013 would the fairest way to evaluate Johnson’s claim. We called Emily Wilfong, a Colorado Department of Transportation spokeswoman. As of Aug. 22, 2014, she said, 295 people had died in motor vehicle crashes in the state. That compared with the 313 deaths reported as of the same time a year ago. A difference, yes, but one of less than six percent. But even so, Wilfong added, those two figures don’t reveal a useful picture when it comes to assessing traffic deaths in the age of legal marijuana. For starters, neither figure includes the icy dangers of Colorado’s winter driving season, which begins around mid- to late-October, she said. Hazardous conditions could easily skew the number of traffic fatalities dramatically. For another, neither includes an analysis of exactly how the deaths occurred. "There could well be a big decrease in the number of pedestrian fatalities," Wilfong said. "There’s nothing in these figures to show that impaired driving has been reduced to any measurable degree." Muddying the numbers further is the fact that toxicology reports showing what drivers had in their systems may not come back for months, she said. "So we have some numbers," Wilfong said, "but we’re not at all certain what they mean at this point. It’s way too early to tell." Trooper Josh Lewis, Wilfong’s Colorado State Patrol counterpart, agreed. "Statistically, we’re essentially neck and neck with last year," he said. "But there’s nothing to say that marijuana use is reducing the number of fatalities or that there’s any correlation between the two. It could well be months or years before we have gathered that sort of data." We tried to reach Johnson, but were told he was out of the office. The Yes on 91 campaign referred us to Art Way, senior drug policy manager of the Drug Policy Alliance (Colorado). Over the past decade, he said -- or roughly the time that Colorado began loosening its marijuana laws -- total highway fatalities are down. Statistics bear that out, but the margin is slim and there are other factors such as improvements in vehicle safety and trauma medicine. The ruling: Anthony Johnson, chief petitioner for Measure 91, which would legalize recreational marijuana use in Oregon, pointed to Colorado’s brief seven-month experience with legal pot and noted that traffic fatalities have decreased there over that stretch. Colorado’s most recent statistics show that 18 fewer people have died so far this year in fatal traffic accidents than did during that same time period in 2013. Nothing in those numbers, however, supports any contention that legal marijuana had anything to do with a drop that’s as much as a blip as anything. Johnson’s statement is true, but it omits important details and context. We rate it Half True. Thoughts on our ruling? Click on over to OregonLive/politics.com and leave your comments.

pomt-03320	The Republican-authored state budget includes a provision "forcing people earning as little as $12,000 to buy private health insurance that could cost them as much as $4,000 per year."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2013/jul/26/dave-hansen/wisconsin-sen-dave-hansen-says-state-budget-forces/	Work on the Republican-authored state budget is all over, capped by Gov. Scott Walker’s signature June 30, 2013. But the shouting continues. State Sen. Dave Hansen (D-Green Bay) protested after the Associated Press reported that a GOP real-estate agent wrote to Walker about buying state office buildings while the Legislature considered Walker’s budget -- which ended competitive bidding for such sales. "The ink on the budget wasn’t even dry," Hansen claimed in a July 19, 2013 news release, "before one of these wealthy Republican donors was angling for a sweetheart deal from a political party that appears all too eager to reward their friends." Hansen included an income-tax break and an expanded voucher-school program among the "rewards," but it was a health-care claim on Hansen’s list that caught our eye. The GOP budget, he said, included a move "forcing people earning as little as $12,000 to buy private health insurance that could cost them as much as $4,000 per year." So, by Hansen’s calculation, the state budget means low-income people will be pushed into the private market and find themselves spending fully one-third of their income on health care. Hansen is talking about Walker’s controversial decision to reject the federal Medicaid expansion and instead require some 90,000 poor people to get coverage from the new private insurance marketplaces, known as exchanges, under Obamacare. Critics, including Democrats such as Hansen, said that despite federal subsidies a chunk of those people would not be able to afford private insurance from the exchanges. Currently, those people have very limited out-of-pocket costs under the state’s BadgerCare Plus health program. Hansen, in his blast at the budget, puts a hard number on the challenge facing some people with his $12,000/$4,000 scenario. The two numbers are familiar to experts who track how the Obamacare exchanges will work in Wisconsin. At an income of $12,000 -- just above the federal poverty line of $11,490 -- an individual will no longer be eligible for state BadgerCare coverage and will have to move into the federal exchanges. The $4,000 is a worst-case scenario figure for out-of-pocket costs in the exchanges for a family of two with a household income of up to 200 percent of the official federal poverty level, notes Jon Peacock, research director at the Wisconsin Council on Children and Families, a liberal advocacy and research group. But Hansen muffs the illustration using the two figures. One big problem is he mixes an income level for one person with the costs facing a household of two. A single person with an income of $12,000 would pay about $240 a year in insurance premiums, and if serious health problems arise could pay up to an additional $2,100 in out-of-pocket costs (deductibles, co-pays and co-insurance), said Peacock and Sonya Schwartz, a member of the research faculty at Georgetown University’s Center for Children and Families. That adds up to a possible total outlay of almost $2,400 -- one-fifth of the cited income -- not the $4,000 or one-third that Hansen says. No small change in either case, but it makes for a big difference. A couple of final notes. The $4,000 cost figure Hansen cites could come into play for married couples, for instance, but only if their combined income was above $15,510 -- higher than the $12,000 Hansen cites. Most of the people who would be moved from BadgerCare, though, would be single parents with custody of a child. The child would stay on BadgerCare, however. The maximum costs for a parent who is right at the poverty level would be around $2,400. They jump up to over $4,000 for a single parent making $30,000, Peacock said. So, Hansen’s specific example is significantly off the mark -- and that’s especially problematic because he’s talking about the worst-case scenario to begin with. Our rating Hansen sought to highlight the biggest impact on a group of poor people when he said the Republican move will have the effect of "forcing people earning as little as $12,000 to buy private health insurance that could cost them as much as $4,000 per year." But Hansen errs in the example and significantly overstates the effect. We rate his claim False.	None	Dave Hansen	None	None	None	2013-07-26T05:00:00	2013-07-19	['None']

pomt-02452	"Travis County now has the highest urban county tax rate in Texas."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2014/feb/26/andy-brown/travis-countys-tax-rate-ranks-among-very-highest-a/	It’s not unusual for a candidate to bemoan taxes. Still, Andy Brown’s claim in a mailer stopped us short: "Travis County now has the highest urban county tax rate in Texas." Brown, an Austin lawyer running for Travis County judge, aired his statement under an arrow suggesting county tax bills steadily escalated while his Democratic primary opponent, Sarah Eckhardt, served on the Travis County Commissioners Court. We’re focusing here on whether the county has the highest tax rate of the state’s urban counties. By email, Brown’s campaign manager, Jim Wick, told us the campaign compared the 2012 total tax rate for Travis County with the rate in other counties that are home to the state’s five largest cities. Wick included a chart indicating that in this subset, the Travis County rate of $0.5001 per $100 property valuation exceeded the rates in Harris, Dallas, Tarrant, Bexar and El Paso counties. El Paso County, Brown’s chart indicates, had the next-highest rate, $0.40887 per $100 valuation. "Since there is no statutory definition of an urban county, we defined it as a county that has a ‘big city’ in it that is often compared to other big cities around Texas," Wick wrote. By phone, he said: "We were trying to compare apples to apples." We took our own, broader look. Online, the Texas Association of Counties drew on data collected by the state comptroller’s office to create a chart listing the "general fund property tax rates" for every Texas county for 1996 through 2012. Among the 15 most populous counties, the chart and our own web research suggested that in 2012 and 2013, Travis County had the second-highest total property tax rate--topped only by Hidalgo County, which is home to McAllen near the Texas-Mexico border. Hidalgo County’s rate of $0.59 per $100 valuation in 2012 and 2013 compared with Travis County’s respective rates of $0.5001 and $0.4946 per $100 valuation. Among these 15 counties, Travis-neighboring Williamson County had the third-highest 2013 rate, $0.49029 per $100 valuation. Travis County’s rates in 2012 and 2013 far outpaced the total rates in the state’s four more populous counties. In this subgroup, the next-closest 2013 rate--$0.40021 per $100 valuation--was levied by the most populous county, Harris. The other more populous counties and their total tax rates: Dallas ($0.2431 per $100 valuation); Tarrant ($0.2640 per $100 valuation); and Bexar ($0.296187 per $100 valuation). MOST POPULOUS TEXAS COUNTIES TOTAL PROPERTY TAX RATE in DOLLARS PER $100 VALUATION, 2012 TOTAL PROPERTY TAX RATE in DOLLARS PER $100 VALUATION, 2013 Harris 0.40021 0.40021 Dallas 0.2431 0.2431 Tarrant 0.264 0.264 Bexar 0.326866 0.296187 Travis 0.5001 0.4946 El Paso 0.40887 0.43 Collin 0.24 0.2375 Hidalgo 0.59 0.59 Denton 0.282867 0.284914 Fort Bend 0.48076 0.48476 Montgomery 0.4838 0.4838 Williamson 0.49029 0.49029 Cameron 0.384291 0.384291 Nueces 0.355259 0.340999 Brazoria 0.48586 0.43202 Sources: Web page, "Texas Total County Property Tax Rates 1996 - 2012," Texas Association of Counties; Web page, "Harris County, Truth in Taxation Summary;" Document, "2013 AD VALOREM TAX RATES FOR DALLAS COUNTY;" Web page, "Tarrant County, Rates and Exemptions;" Web page, "2013 Official Tax Rates & Exemptions," Bexar County Tax Assessor-Collector; Web page, "Truth in Taxation Summary," Travis County; News story, "El Paso County Commissioners Court adopted a 2-cent tax increase," El Paso Times, Sept. 24, 2013; Chart, "TAX RATE HISTORY," Collin County Tax Assessor-Collector; Chart, "41 HIDALGO COUNTY TAX OFFICE 2013 TAX RATE SCHEDULE," Hidalgo County; Telephone interview, Stacey Dvoracek, chief deputy, Denton County Tax Assessor-Collector, Feb. 24, 2014; Web page, "2013 Fort Bend Tax Rates," Fort Bend County; Web page, "Tax Rate Information," Montgomery County; Web page, "Tax Rate Information," Williamson County; Chart, "2013 Jurisdiction Tax Rates," Cameron County Appraisal District; Chart, "2013 Nueces County Tax Rates," Nueces County; Chart, "Brazoria County Tax Rates," Brazoria County Appraisal District We noticed another wrinkle in that Travis County has long had one of the highest tax rates among the urban counties. There wasn’t a change in this respect in Eckhardt’s time as a commissioner. According to the information compiled by the counties’ association, Travis County had the highest total rate among the five most populous counties every year from 1996 through 2012. Travis County’s total rate even exceeded the Hidalgo County rate from 1996 through 1999, the chart indicates, though Hidalgo has had a higher rate every year since. When we pointed this out, Wick told us the mailer’s use of "now" was intended to mean at "this very moment." Finally, it’s worth noting that however the county’s tax rate compares to others, it would take more research to tell whether Austin-area residents pay more in property taxes than other Texans. Each local resident’s tab includes taxes collected by governmental entities including, perhaps, the city of Austin and a school district. Our ruling Brown said Travis County now has the highest urban county tax rate in Texas. Travis County had the second-highest total property tax rate of the state’s 15 most populous counties in 2012 and 2013, we found, also levying the highest rate of the state’s seven most populous counties. But in contrast to Brown’s message, Travis County's tip-top ranking isn't new. The county’s rate has exceeded the rates of more populous counties every year since 1996. We rate this claim, which lacked these clarifications, as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-07950	"As many as a quarter of our students aren’t even finishing high school."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jan/25/barack-obama/barack-obama-state-union-says-quarter-us-high-scho/	In his State of the Union address on Jan. 25, 2011, President Barack Obama advocated investments in both physical and human capital. But he said the nation’s rates of educational achievement were falling short. "Over the next 10 years, nearly half of all new jobs will require education that goes beyond a high school degree," Obama said. "And yet, as many as a quarter of our students aren’t even finishing high school." We looked at this question last year, when Education Secretary Arne Duncan offered a similar statistic on the Aug 29, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week with Christiane Amanpour during a discussion of education policy. "In this country, we have a 25 percent dropout rate," he said. "That's 1.2 million students leaving our schools for the streets every single year. That is economically unsustainable, and that is morally unacceptable." We wondered whether it was really true that one of every four American high school students drops out before graduating. We concluded that while Duncan used a commonly cited statistic, education experts we contacted cautioned that it's an imperfect measurement. First, a bit about the complex world of measuring dropout rates, drawing liberally from a prior article by our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas. Researchers and governments have many different ways of measuring how many students leave school before graduating. "A dropout rate seems like it should be the most intuitive thing in the world, but it’s not," said David Bills, a professor at the University of Iowa College of Education who specializes in comparative statistics. "There are almost as many ways of calculating state dropout rates as there are states." One way to calculate it is to track individual students as they progress from freshman year of high school until graduation. This provides the most accurate data, but tracking students this way requires a lot of effort, so many school districts do not do it. The main alternative is to track the decline in enrollment between freshman year and graduation. This is known as the AFGR, or averaged freshman graduation rate. It's much easier to do -- and it's the most consistent "apples to apples" statistic across the 50 states -- but it is undermined by a greater risk of error. That's because AFGR does not necessarily distinguish between students who actually dropped out and those who left for other reasons, such as moving to a school in another state, leaving to follow one's parents to a new military assignment, graduating early or graduating late. "If a kid leaves one school but is never tracked if he enrolls in another school, that can count as a dropout," Bills said. "Also, a lot of kids who leave high school but later get GEDs are often counted as dropouts. And sometimes dropout rates are calculated as the number of people aged 16-24 not in school and without a degree, which can also inflate the number." Students who leave for other reasons can be excluded, but this is not always done, and not doing it tends to inflate the apparent number of dropouts. Standardization mandated by provisions of the No Child Left Behind Act has reduced these errors over time, but the statistics are not yet perfect, our experts said. And, needless to say, analyzing different data with different methods will inevitably yield varying results. To add to the confusion, any of the measurements cited above might be termed the "dropout" rate in public discourse. At the Education Department, we spoke to Tracy Dell'Angela, director of outreach and communications with the Institute of Education Sciences, which oversees the department's National Center for Education Statistics, which among other things calculates AFGR. She said that when Duncan talks about the dropout rate, he tends to subtract the AFGR (nearly 75 percent for the last available year, 2007-2008) from a full student universe of 100 percent to get a 25 percent dropout rate. In one sense, Duncan was on solid ground -- his calculation is certainly a common way to use the statistics. But the numbers require some important caveats. In addition to the issue of transfer students cited earlier, the statistics do not necessarily treat home schoolers accurately (they may be counted as dropouts if they begin home schooling after 9th grade and eventually graduate from home school). In addition, Education Department data has sometimes left out entire states, including South Carolina in 2007-2008. Also, the AFGR statistics only refer to public school students. In fact, there is no comprehensive data on graduation and dropout rates from private schools, which account for about 8 to 9 percent of high school students. Since parents paying tuition are likely to be especially motivated to see their children finish school, the true national dropout rate reported probably overstates the actual percentage of American children failing to graduate from high school. We ended up rating Duncan’s comment Half True, noting that while we understood the need for simplicity in a televised interview, Duncan could have easily said the dropout rate "may be as high as 25 percent." In fact, Obama in his State of the Union address did essentially that, prefacing the statistic by saying that "as many as a quarter of our students aren’t even finishing high school." We still think the 25 percent statistic is undermined by a variety of problems, but we give Obama credit for offering a range. So we find his claim Mostly True.

pomt-12674	Wisconsin is "the most -- if not Number 1, number 2 -- gerrymandered state in the country" for state legislative boundaries.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/mar/17/dave-hansen/attacking-republicans-democratic-state-senator-say/	A federal court has ruled that boundaries drawn by Wisconsin Republicans in 2011 for state legislative districts were so excessively partisan as to be unconstitutional. Two months later, in January 2017, the three-judge panel ordered Republican Gov. Scott Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature to redraw the districts (the state is appealing to the U.S. Supreme Court). Understandably, Democrats have cried foul. One of them, state Sen. Dave Hansen of Green Bay, went so far as to declare in a March 5, 2017 TV interview: "We are the most -- if not Number 1, Number 2 -- gerrymandered state in the country." Is he right? The court case Boundaries for the state Assembly and state Senate (as well as for Wisconsin’s congressional districts) are redrawn every 10 years -- by the state Legislature itself, which can lead to problems. As the Harvard Political Review has observed generally about redistricting, which is done by the legislature in most states: "Allowing partisan legislators to redraw their own districts creates a clear conflict of interest, and historically the temptation to game the system has proven too great to resist for the majority party." The federal court said the Wisconsin state legislative maps drawn in 2011 by Republicans were among the most heavily skewed to one party of any plan in the country going back more than 40 years. One of the goals, the court concluded, "was to secure Republican control of the Assembly under any likely future electoral scenario for the remainder of the decade, in other words to entrench the Republican Party in power." The Washington Post’s "The Fix" blog called Wisconsin one of the most gerrymandered states in the nation, noting that in 2012, Democratic candidates for the state Assembly received more votes than Republicans, but won just 39 of 99 districts. The blog said the court’s ruling was the first time in a decade that a court has thrown out legislative maps because they favored voters of one party over another. The new boundaries have been reflected in election results. As Craig Gilbert, author of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s Wisconsin Voter blog, has reported: 2012: Republicans got only 46 percent of the presidential vote in Wisconsin, but won 60 percent of the seats in the state Assembly. 2014: Republicans got just over 52 percent of the vote for governor, but captured 63 percent of the Assembly seats. 2016: Donald Trump won 50.4 percent of the vote for president, but won 64 percent of the Assembly seats. Viewed another way, according to political scientists at Binghamton University: Wisconsin Democrats probably have to win about 55 to 56 percent of the statewide vote to win control of the state Assembly, while Republicans need only win 44 to 45 percent. And Theodore Arrington, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte, agreed that depending on how gerrymandering is measured, Wisconsin is among the worst states. So, the Wisconsin state legislative maps stand as an outlier. How Wisconsin compares to others isn’t a precise calculation, but it stands out in that way, too. Ranking states To back Hansen’s claim, his office pointed us to a column that reported on a 2015 study by Simon Jackman, who at the time was a political science professor at Stanford University. (He is now CEO of the US Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.) Jackman was hired by the plaintiffs in the federal court case. He studied 41 states, not all 50, and ranked Wisconsin’s map as the fifth-worst: North Carolina Virginia Michigan Florida Wisconsin Wisconsin ranked higher, however, in a 2014 study we found that was led by University of Chicago law professor and redistricting expert Nicholas Stephanopoulos: Wyoming Wisconsin Oklahoma Virginia Florida Both studies used a measure called the "efficiency gap," a number that is arrived at through an equation. That is, the difference between each party's "wasted" votes in an election -- where votes are wasted if they are cast for a losing candidate, or for a winning candidate but in excess of what the candidate needed to win -- divided by the total number of votes cast. Stephanopoulos told us Wisconsin’s ranking differs in the two studies because the studies treated uncontested races differently. But whether Wisconsin ranks fifth or second "is just a matter of a percentage point or two, and is substantively irrelevant," he said. There are some caveats, though, as other redistricting experts noted. Charles Hampton, an emeritus professor of mathematical sciences at Wooster College in Ohio, said he thought the second study was too dependent on vote totals in its analysis and not on the redistricting plan itself. Michael Li, who is senior counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice Democracy Program at New York University School of Law, told us the "partisan biases" found in the studies can be largely but not completely explained by gerrymandering. But he said political geography -- for example, Democrats tending to live in big cities -- also explains some of the disparity in Wisconsin. Justin Levitt, a professor at Loyola Law School in Los Angeles who maintains a website on redistricting, cautioned that "there are no universally agreed-upon rankings, in part because gerrymandering usually describes an unfair drawing of the lines, and there's no universally agreed-upon sense of what's fair, or what's fair for what purposes." Our rating Hansen says Wisconsin is "the most -- if not Number 1, Number 2 -- gerrymandered state in the country" for state legislative boundaries. A federal court has said maps drawn in 2011 by Wisconsin Republicans were among the most heavily skewed to one party of any plan in the country going back more than 40 years. And, with the caveat that there isn’t a universally accepted definition of gerrymander, two studies put Wisconsin at or near the top. We rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-05050	Says Mitt Romney "has a corporation in Bermuda (but) failed to disclose that on seven different financial disclosures."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/10/robert-gibbs/democrats-say-mitt-romney-failed-disclose-offshore/	In the Democratic playbook, the more attention paid to Mitt Romney’s wealth, the better. Over the past few days, many Democrats questioned whether Romney used offshore holdings to dodge U.S. taxes and pressed him to release more of his personal financial information. Obama campaign senior adviser Robert Gibbs took the occasion during CNN’s State of the Union to say, "Nobody knows why he has a corporation in Bermuda, why he failed to disclose that on seven different financial disclosures." We wondered if Gibbs had his facts right. Does Romney currently have a stake in a Bermuda corporation? And did he fail to disclose it seven times? Reporting by the Associated Press and Vanity Fair teed this up. Both news organizations explored one of Romney’s overseas accounts, Sankaty High Yield Asset Investors, Ltd. The firm is described in SEC filings as "a Bermuda corporation wholly owned by W. Mitt Romney." (For more details, check out the AP's interesting account.) In his 2010 tax return and his 2011 estimated filing, Romney includes Sankaty High Yield Asset Investors, Ltd. The beginning balance is pegged at $10,432. He and his wife Ann are the sole owners. According to the Associated Press, Romney ran his investments in other Bain Capital deals through this offshore corporation. Democrats have pounced on the issue. Offshore holdings might be perfectly legal, but they also might paint Romney as one of the super-rich who may be using an offshore tax shelter. Romney’s ownership of Sankaty is not in doubt, at least not as recently as this past December, according to Romney’s 2011 estimated tax return. So Gibbs appears to be on solid ground that Romney has the company now. We asked the Romney campaign if they could give us more current information on the status of Sankaty High Yield Asset Investors, but they did not respond. In an interview with Radio Iowa on Monday, Romney deflected the issue, saying his foreign investments are in a blind trust. "I don’t manage them. I don’t even know where they are," Romney said. "That trustee follows all U.S. laws. All the taxes are paid, as appropriate. All of them have been reported to the government. There’s nothing hidden there." As for Gibbs’ other assertion that Romney has failed to disclose his stake in Sankaty seven times, that also is largely accurate. We counted six disclosure forms where Romney made no reference at all to the Bermuda corporation. Those include his filings in Massachusetts when he was running for governor or holding office and his federal disclosures for his presidential bids. The seventh appears to be his 2001 disclosure, which lists Sankaty High Yield Asset Investors LLC. Note the slight difference in those three letters -- LLC instead of Ltd. The LLC, a limited liability corporation he named on the form, is based in Delaware. The offshore corporation by the same name ends in Ltd. and there is no mention of it until Romney’s lawyers began amending his disclosures this year. There is some question whether he was required to disclose this asset. In 2003, on the eve of running for governor, he put Sankaty into a blind trust. Thereafter, he disclosed the presence of the trust and might not have been required to say what was in it. It is also unclear whether the nominal value of Sankaty would be high enough to warrant disclosure. In 2011, its value was $10,432. However, as the Associated Press pointed out, that could well ignore the potential income that might flow through the fund. It is possible for investments made many years ago to produce over $1 million in payoffs that suddenly appear on the books. Our ruling Obama campaign adviser Robert Gibbs said Romney owns a Bermuda-based corporation and that he failed to disclose his ownership seven times. The documentary evidence indicates Gibbs is right that Romney owned it when he filed his estimated tax return in December and that he did not disclose it earlier. The Romney campaign has not said the statements are wrong. We rate Gibbs claim True. UPDATE -- We may have had the lyrics to Kokomo in our heads ("Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama...") because twice in this article we referred to the Bahamas when we meant Bermuda. We've corrected the mistakes, although we still can't get the song our of our head.	None	Robert Gibbs	None	None	None	2012-07-10T15:59:40	2012-07-08	['None']

pomt-03155	The Libertarian Party "is the third-largest political party in the U.S."	false	/florida/statements/2013/sep/09/libertarian-party-broward-county/libertarians-say-theyre-third-largest-political-pa/	In politics -- or any blood sport -- it’s rare to hear a team proudly chant, "We’re No. 3! We’re No. 3!" But that’s what we heard from Libertarians in the purple state of Florida. We spotted a claim about the numbers and growth of libertarians in an announcement about a Libertarian event in Broward County: "The Libertarian Party is the third-largest organized political party in the United States and has seen tremendous growth over the last two years as many Democrats and Republicans have become disenchanted with their respective parties." (The article was written by Karl Dickey who serves on the Libertarian Party of Florida’s executive committee and represents Broward, Palm Beach and Hendry counties.) We found a similar claim on the Libertarian Party of Broward website that the party is "the third-largest political party in the U.S." We wanted to explore the numbers and the power of the Libertarian Party. Is it the third-largest party in the country? We’ve looked at the numbers of Libertarians in the past. But as Sen. Rand Paul -- a Kentucky Republican with a libertarian outlook -- makes headlines as a potential 2016 presidential contender, it seemed like a good time to revisit the numbers. Counting libertarians Libertarian activists and political scientists we contacted suggested the same source: Richard Winger, a Libertarian in California and editor of a monthly newsletter, Ballot Access News, which includes data on party registration that Winger researches. His December issue showed there were 325,807 registered Libertarians nationwide. (About half the states tally Libertarians, Winger’s data shows.) The number of registered Libertarians was higher than other national third parties including the Green, Constitution or Reform parties. But with Democrats’ registration at 43.5 million and Republicans at 41.3 million according to Winger’s data, that puts any third-place finisher trailing way behind. Also, the number of Libertarians was substantially lower than two catch-all categories which Winger calls "indp. misc" at 26.8 million and "other" at 2.9 million. The miscellaneous category includes states that have a miscellaneous category, as well as voters who write in answers (such as "birthday party") on their registration. Winger’s "other" includes a combination of actual parties. Since those catch-all categories were large, we picked a couple of states to look in more detail at third-party registrations. In California, there were 477,129 registered with the American Independent Party. In New York, there were 430,072 registered with the Independence Party as of November 2012. But Winger said those groups in California and New York aren’t "nationally organized parties. Those are one-state parties." That’s why when Winger talks about Libertarians’ voter registration he includes the phrase "nationally organized" -- something the Libertarians in Broward omitted. We’re not suggesting that those state parties in California or New York are powerful players nationwide -- or even in their own states. Some New York voters wrongly think they are registering as independents, according to the New York Daily News. Markham Robinson, a leader with the American Independent Party, told PolitiFact in an interview that he did a survey of AIP voters and of the 200 who responded, one-third didn’t realize they had registered with a party. Still, Robinson said he’d give that third ranking to his own group based on voter registration. Robinson suggested another way to measure third-party influence: a group’s registration as a percentage of total voters. By that method, he gave a shout-out to the Independent American Party in Nevada -- they garnered almost 5 percent of the state’s registration as of October. Libertarians do have a point when they say they are growing. Ballot Access News showed in 2008 there were 240,328 Libertarians, compared with 325,807 in 2012, an increase of about 36 percent. But their power lies not in electing Libertarians but more in the libertarian philosophy making inroads with the GOP. And some experts told us to examine votes received or the number of candidates who ran as signs of party strength rather than just voter registration. In 2012, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson received about 1.3 million votes -- more than any other third-party candidate. Johnson's tally, amounting to about 1 percent, is the largest for a non-major-party candidate since Ralph Nader's Green race in 2000, said J. David Gillespie, author of a book on third parties. "Libertarians always run far more people for congressional and state legislative seats across the nation than do the Greens, Constitution Party, or any other third party," he said. Some libertarians choose not to register with the Libertarian Party, either because they don’t like party labels or so they can participate in the nominating contests held by the major parties. Libertarians "do have influence beyond their size, because libertarian ideas appeal to people on both left and right," said Shaun Bowler, a political science professor at the University of California. Our ruling The Libertarian Party in Broward said on its website that the Libertarian Party "is the third-largest political party in the U.S." Quantifying the number of Libertarians is tricky; some states don’t track the affiliation. As for those officially registered with the Libertarian Party, it’s about 326,000. Some state-based parties -- most notably the Independence Party in New York and the American Independent Party in California -- have more people registered to their party than that, though.

pomt-10068	"The Capitol was built by slaves."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/jan/19/nancy-pelosi/legend-slaves-building-capitol-correct/	Every now and then, a fact goes viral. Current case in point: that slaves helped construct the U.S. Capitol, where the son of an African man is set to be sworn in as the nation's 44th president. Pundits and politicians have mentioned this dozens of times in the past few days, wielding it as potent shorthand for all the historical import of the moment. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House, mentioned it in her remarks at the Dec. 2, 2008, dedication of the Capitol Visitors Center: "The Capitol was built by slaves," Pelosi said. "Today, I want to talk about the fact that it's so appropriate that, though long overdue, this Capitol Visitors Center is ready for 2009, which is the 200th anniversary, the bicentennial of the birth of Abraham Lincoln, the great emancipator." We wanted to find the details behind the assertion and give it more context. It turns out there's far less in the historical record on the subject than one might expect. Early historians of the Capitol's construction were largely indifferent to the work of common laborers, both paid and slave. Records from the time are spotty. Only in the past 15 years or so has attention been trained on the role slaves played in constructing perhaps the nation's most important building — and the work has been led not by professional historians, but by individuals who developed a personal interest in the subject, such as retired Washington television reporter Ed Hotaling and freelance writer Bob Arnebeck. In 2005, Congress appointed a task force to research the subject, which issued a report in conjunction with the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, finally bringing a measure of scholarly rigor to bear on the topic. The task force acknowledged it was not able to tell the full story. "No one will ever know how many slaves helped to build the United States Capitol Building — or the White House," says the 2005 task force report, entitled History of Slave Laborers in the Construction of the United States Capitol. But the task force did find plenty of evidence of slave involvement in the Capitol's construction. Perhaps the most compelling evidence were records of payments from the commissioners for the District of Columbia — the three men appointed by George Washington to oversee the construction of the Capitol and the rest of the city of Washington — to slave owners for the rental of slaves to work on the Capitol. The records reflect 385 payments between 1795 and 1801 for "Negro hire," a euphemism for the yearly rental of slaves. Slaves were likely involved in all aspects of construction, including carpentry, masonry, carting, rafting, plastering, glazing and painting, the task force reported. And slaves appear to have shouldered alone the grueling work of sawing logs and stones. Slave crews also toiled at the marble and sandstone quarries that provided the stone to face the structure — lonely, grueling work with bleak living conditions in rural Virginia and elsewhere. "Keep the yearly hirelings at work from sunrise to sunset — particularly the Negroes," the commissioners wrote to quarry operator William O'Neale in 1794. The commissioners' use of slave labor was unremarkable for the time. When the Capitol was constructed, from 1793 to 1826, the building trades in almost every colony augmented the work force with slave labor. This would have been especially true in the Potomac region — the home of about half the 750,000 African-Americans living in the United States, according to the 1972 book Free Negroes in the District of Columbia, by Letitia Woods Brown. Most of the slaves who worked on the Capitol are known by first name at best — the records refer to a payment of $13.00 to slaveholder Teresa Bent for "Nace," for example, and $23.00 to Elizabeth Brent for "Harry" and "Gabe." But one particular slave, Philip Reid, achieved some renown as an individual. He was a slave laborer for Clark Mills, who was hired to cast the Statue of Freedom, the Capitol's crowning feature. The government paid Reid $1.25 a day for his work. The statue, a draped female figure holding a sheathed sword in one hand and a laurel wreath in the other, stands atop the Capitol dome, 288 feet above the site of Obama's swearing in. Pelosi might have specified that slaves were only part of the work force, but they were involved with almost every aspect of construction for at least the first several years.

pomt-03648	The Dolphins stadium renovation will "create more than 4,000 new local jobs."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/may/01/friends-miami-first/miami-dolphins-pac-says-stadium-renovation-will-cr/	As Miami-Dade residents begin to vote on whether to help finance a $350 million stadium for the Miami Dolphins, project boosters distributed mailers promising that the project will deliver thousands of new local jobs. One mailer stated: "The plan will not only create more than 4,000 new local jobs, it is critical for attracting more sporting and entertainment events to a world class Miami facility which increases tourism, supports local businesses and pumps hundreds of millions of dollars into our community." The mailer was paid for by the stadium’s political action committee, Friends of Miami First, which has raised $1 million since April 1. The contributions came from the Dolphins and South Florida Stadium LLC, team owner Stephen Ross’ company. The 4,000 jobs figure has been repeated multiple times in recent months as the Dolphins sought financing from the state and county. A separate mailer states "support over 4,000 new jobs for Miami-Dade" and shows a photo of a construction worker. Here we are fact-checking the mailer’s claim that the renovation of the Sun Life stadium will "create more than 4,000 new local jobs." (Read our related Dolphins stadium fact-checks here and here.) Goal includes local hires The job creation figure is a selling point for the Dolphins, as they work at record speed to convince state legislators who conclude their session May 3 to sign off on a plan for $90 million in sales tax rebates and to allow an increase in the mainland Miami bed tax to generate about $289 million. The mailer omits those amounts, but it does state that the team would repay the state and county about $159 million. If the Legislature and Gov. Rick Scott give the go-ahead, Miami-Dade voters will be asked if they want to designate annual tourist room taxes for the project in a May 14 referendum. (Early and absentee voting started April 29.) The agreement requires private funding, which is expected to come from the Dolphins and the NFL to pay for more than half the project. By May 22, the NFL will decide whether to award the 50th Super Bowl in 2016 to Miami or San Francisco. The team’s agreement with the county says that the team will "aspire" to hire at least 70 percent of the workers from Miami-Dade with 10 percent from Miami Gardens -- the city where the stadium is located -- and at least 20 percent from low-income areas. The team will also "aspire" to hire at least 35 percent of the subcontractors from Miami-Dade. There is no financial penalty if the team doesn’t meet those local hiring goals and there is no goal or requirement regarding the sheer number of jobs, county spokeswoman Suzy Trutie said. Study used to come up with job figures The mailer didn’t provide details about its numbers, so we asked Dolphins spokesman Eric Jotkoff to elaborate. Jotkoff allowed a PolitiFact Florida reporter and a Miami Herald business reporter to review -- but not retain -- a copy of a study paid for by the Dolphins that the team used to arrive at that figure. The study, prepared by the Washington Economics Group in 2010, was about a possible $225 million stadium renovation which assumed some hotel bed tax participation by Broward County, so it includes job projections for Miami-Dade and Broward combined. It concluded the project would produce 3,740 jobs, which assumes at least one year of employment per person. That includes 1,550 direct jobs and the remainder are indirect jobs in related industries and induced jobs generated by the economic activity. The jobs included 39 percent in the "knowledge based sector," which includes information technology, finance, real estate and other areas; 34 percent construction; and the remainder were government related or "other." But the Dolphins have not produced a study of the current project to show it will create more than 4,000 local jobs. Instead, the team is using cocktail napkin estimates here: If a $225 million project would create 3,740 jobs, then a $350 million project would create at least 4,000, they say. "It’s a conservative estimate of jobs that this will create," Jotkoff said. These 4,000 jobs are associated with the 25-month construction project. Jotkoff said some of the jobs will continue beyond the 25 months but he had no details as to how many. The same firm did a separate study in 2013 that concluded there are 14,503 permanent current jobs at the Sun Life Stadium, mostly with the Dolphins. That study was prepared for the Greater Miami Chamber of Commerce, which endorsed the stadium proposal, and a related entity the South Florida Progress Foundation. Experts weigh in on jobs claim We sent the Dolphins’ jobs claim and a summary of the 2010 study to multiple economists, including some who specialize in the business of sports. They raised several caveats about the job growth figures. First, these aren’t permanent jobs. (Jotkoff said some jobs would extend beyond 25 months, but he had no details as to how many.) These are "4,000 jobs we are talking about during the construction phase," said University of Florida economics professor Roger Blair, who teaches a class on the business of sports. "Why is that something get excited about? (These are) jobs that people will have for a couple of years and then they will disappear." And, those jobs aren’t coming here for free -- the public is paying for them through the hotel bed tax and the state sales tax. Economists say that you have to factor in the spending that won’t happen elsewhere in the state, due to the public money earmarked for this particular project. The majority of sales taxes go into the state’s general fund, which pays for law enforcement, education, environmental programs and other areas. The bed tax would be an increase, so the Dolphins can argue that’s new money and wouldn’t be spent elsewhere, since it is being created for them. Tourist taxes can only be spent on certain uses such as stadiums, convention centers and museums. "The problem is that these jobs have to be financed," said Smith College economics professor Andrew Zimbalist. "Would it create jobs if the county hired 1,000 workers to dig a big hole and then a 1,000 more to fill it up? If so, then no city would ever have any unemployment." (Zimbalist is a consultant for Major League Baseball but told PolitiFact he does not consult for the NFL.) The jobs wouldn’t be significant for the county, economists told PolitiFact. "I certainly don’t want to disparage any job creation figures, as those are real jobs for real people, but payroll employment in Miami-Dade County is over 1 million, so this wouldn’t be an economic game changer," said Chris Lafakis, senior economist at Moody’s who analyzes Florida’s economy. "The best way to judge the economic merits of this project are how will this project be paid for and how else would that funding be spent? These are very important questions in order to determine the net benefit to the Miami Dade economy." Also, one expert pointed out that the study was paid for by team, so that’s not an independent analysis. "The organizations that often provide these economic impact studies have something to gain or have a vested interest," said Robert Baade, a professor who specializes in the economics of sports at Lake Forest College. "Certainly if the team commissioned the study that would be true ... They are going to put the project’s best foot forward ... They realize there is a skeptical and reluctant public and they’ve got to make the project look good. That doesn’t make them evil -- it does mean they are erring on side of optimism rather than taking a more conservative approach." Our ruling The mailer distributed by Miami First said that the Dolphins stadium renovation will "create more than 4,000 new local jobs." The Dolphins based the number on a 2010 study of a $225 million project that concluded 3,740 jobs in Miami-Dade and Broward. They haven’t shown any study of the current project to support their claim that it will create more than 4,000 local jobs. Instead, they tacked on an extra 260 jobs to the new $350 million project and say that’s conservative. The key omission here is that these are jobs associated with the 25-month stadium renovation project and include temporary positions. The Dolphins say that some jobs would continue, but they have provided no details as to how many of those 4,000 jobs would extend beyond the construction phase. To get those jobs, the team would receive $379 million from the state and county over about three decades, and eventually pay back about $159 million. As to whether the jobs will be local, the team has set a goal to hire the vast majority of the workers from Miami-Dade County but there is no financial penalty if they fail to do so.

pomt-05410	"Over the history of Austin, it’s always gotten more expensive."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/may/03/mike-martinez/mike-martinez-says-austin-has-always-grown-more-ex/	In an interview aired April 19, 2012, Austin City Council Member Mike Martinez was asked by Matt Largey of Austin’s KUT, 90.5 FM whether the council could do more to make Austin affordable. Yes, Martinez replied, adding a beat later: "Over the history of Austin, it’s always gotten more expensive. And that’s not going to change." Martinez continued: "What we do as a council is to try to manage that economic growth to where it doesn’t negatively impact our residents as much as it could. If we didn’t involve ourselves, if we didn’t insert ourselves, I dare say it would be a whole lot worse." Setting aside the council’s role and impact, has Austin always gotten more expensive? Of course, Martinez told us in a telephone interview. Saying he’s been an Austin resident since 1988, Martinez said that gas prices, property values, property taxes and utility costs have all gone up. He added: "I don’t think you need to do a study. You’re not paying the same price for a gallon of milk that you paid 20 years ago." (Wise-guy response: You are if you don’t drink milk.) "Always" is a powerful characterization; Austin was established in 1839. And Martinez did not provide, nor did we find, information specifically showing Austin growing more expensive every year through history. Seeking the long view, we queried David C. Humphrey, who wrote the entry for Austin in the Handbook of Texas Online. He replied by email: "Over the years, Austin's economy has had its downs as well as its ups. In the latter 1980s, for example, starting in 1986, housing prices tumbled and Austin's office vacancy rate jumped to No. 1 in the nation... Austin's economy took a few years to recover but was sizzling again by the mid-1990s. The early 1930s, during the Great Depression, were certainly hard economic times for many Austinites. Wages and salaries fell (UT faculty members took a 25 percent pay cut), and unemployment grew acute, though Austin's economy held up better than that of many other towns and cities." Humphrey, summing up, said Austin prices haven’t always been on the rise, though prices have trended upward in recent years. We’ve poked into Austin’s affordability before, rating Mostly False a 2011 claim that Austin had lately experienced the highest cost of living of any large Texas city. At the time, we considered a composite cost-of-living index managed by the Virginia-based Council for Community and Economic Research. The council’s index is based on the costs of housing, utilities, grocery items, transportation, health care and miscellaneous goods and services, but it does not weigh the effect of property taxes, which is substantial in Texas. The index enables comparisons of the cost of living between cities at any given time but does not lend itself to gauging changes in a city over time, council spokesman Dean Frutiger recently told us. Frutiger forwarded Austin’s index for the first quarter of 1991 through 2011. In eight of those years, the index suggests, Austin’s cost of living was lower than the national average. In the first quarter of 1994, 1997 and 2004, Austin’s cost of living exceeded the national average. Mindful that Martinez spoke about Austin’s cost of living in itself, we turned next to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks the Consumer Price Index, the government measure of the average change over time in the prices of consumer items — goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living. James Howard, a Dallas-based bureau economist, told us by telephone that Austin is not among southern cities where prices are routinely checked by field staff. However, the bureau’s index research for some metropolitan areas of 150,000 to 1.5 million in population since 2002 included checks of prices in San Antonio, Beaumont-Port Arthur, Brownsville-Harlingen-San Benito, Amarillo and Midland-Odessa. And according to that research, the CPI-U -- that is, the index for urban consumers -- went up nearly every year from 2002 to 2012, with the bumps ranging from 1.1 percent, in 2002, to 4.7 percent, in 2008. The index dropped slightly in one year, 2009, by 0.4 percent. It then increased 1.8 percent in 2010. Howard pointed out older bureau research for similar cities indicating that the CPI-U escalated every year from 1977 through 1997. Other experts pointed out other ways of gauging changes in Austin’s cost of living. Beverly Kerr, vice president for research at the Greater Austin Area Chamber of Commerce, applied a version of the CPI-U to average home prices as calculated by the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University. Based on 2011 dollars, Austin’s average 2011 home price of $251,600 was higher, by about $100,000, than Austin’s average 1990 home price of $149,762. Again calculated in 2011 dollars, the average home price dropped in six of the 21 years between 1990 and 2012, Kerr’s calculation suggests — in 2001, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009 and 2011. The biggest drop was $13,095 from 2007 to 2008, when the average home price was $253,787. Wondering about apartment rents, we checked with Dallas-based Laura Williams of ALN Apartment Data Inc. who guided us to its graph indicating that rents paid by Austin residents steadily climbed from late 2005 to early 2008, then dropped off to 2010 before mostly increasing to 2012. Separately, Kerr guided us to Hendricks & Partners, whose Austin spokesman, George Deuillet, told us average rents in Austin increased all but one year from 2006 through 2011, dropping 3.5 percent in 2009. A little more: Robin Davis of Austin Investor Interests, which has a website tracking apartment trends, told us that local apartment rents dropped from 2001 to 2004 before gradually climbing through 2008, dipping in 2009 and subsequently climbing. We recognized one more aspect to gauging how expensive Austin has been during a telephone interview of Bruce Kellison, associate director of the University of Texas Bureau of Business Research, IC² (Innovation, Creativity, Capital) Institute. Kellison counseled that any analysis of changes in the cost of living should try to account for wage changes. It’s possible, he said, that while prices increased, wages outpaced them. We asked Austin economist Stuart Greenfield to assess how average wages have tracked with the cost of living. Greenfield, drawing on information from state and federal agencies, said unadjusted annual pay in Travis County, which includes Austin, increased about 24 percent from 2001 through 2010, narrowly outpacing inflation which ranged from 23 to nearly 24 percent, according to different versions of the CPI. Put another way, he said, real annual pay increased about 1 percent -- a smidge. And does this suggest that life in Austin grew a little less expensive? On average, Greenfield replied, "one’s well-being improved" slightly. Nudged before we finished this research, an Austin consultant to Martinez, Mark Littlefield, pointed out that by the calculations of the the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, the CPI was far greater in 2012 than it would have been at Austin’s founding. "There have been years of nominal decreases, like during the Great Depression, but over time things have obviously ‘gotten more expensive’ in Austin," Littlefield said by email. According to the bank’s calculation, though, the CPI stayed the same or decreased in about 70 of the years from 1840 through 1955. After that, it dropped in one year, 2009, by 0.4 percent. Our ruling In some ways, Austin has grown more expensive of late. Yet rents dipped in some years. And the area’s average annual pay outpaced inflation over a recent decade. Also, while we did not come up with precise pre-1990s information, it's reasonable to speculate that periods of economic difficulty through history included decreases in Austin's cost of living. This claim has a nowadays’ ring of truth, but its "always" element disregards times when costs dropped. We rate Martinez’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-10280	"The fact is that although we have had a president who is opposed to abortion over the last eight years, abortions have not gone down.''	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/21/barack-obama/abortion-numbers-have-gone-down/	In his Aug. 16, 2008, appearance with megachurch pastor Rick Warren, Sen. Barack Obama asserted that "abortions have not gone down'' in the United States during the presidency of George W. Bush, a strong abortion opponent. "I believe in Roe vs. Wade , and I come to that conclusion not because I'm proabortion, but because, ultimately, I don't think women make these decisions casually. I think they — they wrestle with these things in profound ways, in consultation with their pastors or their spouses or their doctors or their family members," Obama said. "And so, for me, the goal right now should be — and this is where I think we can find common ground. And by the way, I've now inserted this into the Democratic Party platform, is how do we reduce the number of abortions? The fact is that although we have had a president who is opposed to abortion over the last eight years, abortions have not gone down and that is something we have to address." But Obama's statement is directly contradicted by statistics that show legal abortions have fallen since the start of the 21st century. The New York-based Guttmacher Institute reported in January 2008 that in 2005 the country's abortion rate fell to 19.4 abortions per 1,000 women aged 15 to 44, continuing a trend that started after the abortion rate peaked in 1981 at 29.3. The institute, a think tank on reproductive health issues, reported that the number of abortions also fell, to 1.2-million in 2005, which it said was 25 percent below the record high of 1.6-million abortions in 1990. And the federal Centers for Disease Control reported in its latest Abortion Surveillance Report that in 2004 there were 839,226 legal abortions, down 1.1 percent from 2003. The abortion ratio of 16 per 1,000 women has been the same since 2000, it added. Rebecca Wind, spokesman of the Guttmacher Institute, said the difference in the two sets of numbers reflects differences in data collection. She said the CDC relies on state health departments, and not all states require abortion statistics reporting. Guttmacher does its own survey of all legal abortion providers and reports a fairly high response rate. In any case, she added, "There's no way to spin this one. The abortion rate is at its lowest rate since 1974.'' Obama made his comments to Warren in the context of cutting the number of abortions. He said he wanted to find "ways that we can work together to reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies, so that we actually are reducing the sense that women are seeking out abortions.'' In that context, his comment about abortions made sense. Guttmacher data showed that 49 percent of pregnancies were unintended in 2001, unchanged from 1994. Obama's campaign did not respond to an e-mail seeking an explanation for the senator's statement. But his comment about the abortion rate was wrong, so we rule this claim False.

pomt-07447	"Seniors will have to find $12,500 for health care because Republicans voted to end Medicare."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/20/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democrats-say-republicans-voted-end-medicare-and-c/	A new political ad from Democrats shows seniors running a lemonade stand, cutting the grass, and even stripping at a bachelorette party -- all to raise money to pay for Medicare. The stripper, dressed as a firefighter, bellows, "Did someone call the fire department? Because it's about to get HOT in here!" The young women throw money at him while he dances around with a pink feather boa. (See the ad here.) "Seniors will have to find $12,500 for health care," the ad says, "because Republicans voted to end Medicare." So do grandparents have to go back to work because of a Republican vote? Not really. The Republican proposal explained The ad critiques a budget proposal from Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., chairman of the House Budget Committee. Ryan’s plan would dramatically cut federal spending in the name of fiscal discipline, and it has widespread support in the Republican caucus. One of the its major features is dramatically restructuring Medicare, the government-run health insurance program for those 65 and older. Right now, Medicare pays doctors and hospitals set fees for the care beneficiaries receive. Medicare beneficiaries contribute premiums for some types of coverage, and younger workers contribute payroll taxes. Ryan’s plan leaves Medicare as is for people 55 and older. In 2022, though, new beneficiaries would receive "premium support," which means they would buy plans from private insurance companies with financial assistance from the government. People who need more health care would get a little more money. Some call this a voucher program, but the proposal says it’s not a voucher plan, because the government would pay the insurance companies directly. The proposal requires private insurers to accept all applicants and to charge the same rate for people who are the same age. The plans would comply with standards to be set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. The plan gradually raises the Medicare eligibility age to 67, and it provides smaller premium support to high earners. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) analyzed Ryan’s proposal and found that it will save the government money. But it does so by asking future Medicare beneficiaries to pay more for insurance. "A private health insurance plan covering the standardized benefit would, CBO estimates, be more expensive currently than traditional Medicare. Both administrative costs (including profits) and payment rates to providers are higher for private plans than for Medicare," the CBO concluded. Ryan says the plan would offer more choice for Medicare participants and increase competition among private insurers to drive down cost. What the ad gets wrong Yes, the Republican plan would be a huge change to the current program, and seniors would have to pay more for their health plans if it becomes law. Democrats, including President Barack Obama, have said they are strongly opposed to the plan. But to say the Republicans voted to end Medicare, as the ad does, is a major exaggeration. All seniors would continue to be offered coverage under the proposal, and the program’s budget would increase every year. Republicans say that future spending projections for Medicare are not sustainable, and the program requires changes. Their proposal "protects and preserves Medicare -- with no disruptions -- for those in and near retirement and provides those now under the age of 55 with a strengthened, personalized Medicare program they can count on when they retire," said Conor Sweeney, a spokesperson for House Budget Committee. Democrats, though, contend that the proposal would change the essential nature of Medicare as a guarantee of health coverage for seniors. The Congressional Budget Office released a detailed analysis of the proposal, and concluded that future beneficiaries would pay more for current levels of coverage, and that some will decide to go without any insurance. The Republican proposal will end the aspect of Medicare that directly covers specific services, such as hospital coverage. "It's as if you took the Office of Faith-Based Partnerships and ended the faith-based portion of it, but continued to call it faith-based," said Jesse Ferguson of the DCCC. "There is no doubt that Medicare -- a health insurance program for seniors -- would end under the House Republican plan and, according to the independent Congressional Budget Office, health insurance costs would rise for seniors." Democrats, including Obama, have said the plan would end Medicare "as we know it," a critical qualifier. But the 30-second ad from the DCCC makes a sweeping claim without that important qualifier . Another problem with the ad is that it claims that participants would have to find $12,500 to pay for Medicare. That number is based on statistics compiled by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The ad doesn’t mention, though, that the number includes money that would go to Medicare in any case. The CBO estimates beneficiaries would contribute about $6,150 in premiums in 2022 if the program isn’t changed at all. So the extra money seniors need to pay under the Republican proposal is more like $6,350. Still another problem with the ad involves who’s immediately affected by the Republican proposal. In one scene, the ad shows a senior citizen pushing a walker behind a lawn mower. A teenager looking on eats an apple and says, "You missed a spot." In reality, people 55 and older won’t see changes under the Ryan plan. It’s actually that teenager -- or anyone else 54 or younger -- who would pay extra money when they are older. And finally, the ad neglects another critical fact: The Republicans voted on a budget resolution that states policy preferences, but the vote did not actually change Medicare, much less end it. As we’ve noted before in previous fact-checks, budget resolutions are non-binding documents that cannot be viewed as the equivalent of legislation that establishes law. Deeply desiring something and accomplishing it are different. We ran this by Richard Kaplan, an elder law expert at the University of Illinois, who agreed the Republicans have not voted to end Medicare. "Nobody voted to end it," he said. "They voted to hopefully change it one day, when they get a chance, but they would need a Republican-dominated Senate and a Republican president, neither of which they have." "It’s not as if this is of no consequence. But it doesn’t change Medicare," he said. Our ruling Both Republicans and Democrats would no doubt agree that Ryan’s plan for Medicare is a dramatic change of course. But we don’t agree with the ad’s contention that the proposal ends Medicare. Additionally, images in the ad imply that current seniors will have to go back to work to pay for changes to the program. That’s not true either. It’s actually those 54 and younger who will need extra money. With its scenes of seniors going back to work, it seems intended to frighten those who are currently enrolled in Medicare. Finally, the Republicans' vote was symbolic and didn’t actually change the program. When you add up all those distortions, we find the ad highly misleading. The ad’s aged firefighter says, "Did someone call the fire department? Because it's about to get HOT in here!" We agree. Pants on Fire!

pomt-00859	The delay in school testing "was not that of a vendor, the problem was not that of the test materials itself, it was the product of a cyber attack."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2015/mar/16/h-marlene-otoole/house-education-chair-blames-florida-testing-delay/	On day 1 of the new computerized standardized tests in Florida, students and administrators across the state couldn’t log on to the tests, forcing some districts to postpone the assessments. The problems that started March 2 spanned the state and hit Florida's largest counties including Miami-Dade, Broward and Hillsborough. Initial reports were that it was a technical glitch in the hands of the testing vendor, American Institutes for Research. But by the end of the week, state law enforcement were also investigating a cyber security attack. Miami-Dade Superintendent Alberto Carvalho would later call it a "catastrophic meltdown," and the testing problems added more fuel to the fire about Florida’s focus on tests. During a House Education Appropriations Committee meeting March 12, chairwoman and state Rep. H. Marlene O'Toole, R-Lady Lake, put the blame solely on the cyber attack. "On the testing problems, many of you may have read in the media, that the problem was not that of a vendor, the problem was not that of the test materials itself, it was the product of a cyber attack," she said. O’Toole’s claim suggested that the sole problem was the cyber attack, but that conflicted with news reports and information provided by the state Department of Education. The testing woes Whether K-12 students are taking too many tests is a hot topic during this legislative session, with many teachers and parents pushing for fewer tests. Gov. Rick Scott promised during his 2014 campaign to investigate every statewide test and in February ordered the state to stop giving an 11th-grade Florida Standards Assessment for language arts. This year, students started taking the Florida Standards Assessments aligned to Florida's new education benchmarks, based on the Common Core State Standards. The new tests replaced the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Tests. Testing started on Monday, March 2 -- and was an instant mess. The problems occurred on the computer-based tests given in grades 8-10 when they couldn’t log on to the testing platform. The Tampa Bay Times reported that testing problems occurred in more than half of the districts. The state sent districts an email Tuesday morning saying that the testing vendor, AIR, had fixed software problems the day before. But the problems persisted in some places. "What happened was AIR did an update to their system the day before testing began," Stewart explained to a House education committee March 5. "Admittedly that was the wrong timing, and it caused them some issues with data retrieval." AIR issued a statement to the media, including PolitiFact Florida, accepting "full responsibility" for the technical difficulties. "Ultimately, we concluded that an update we performed had inadvertently degraded system performance, resulting in the delays districts experienced. Once we were able to identify the problem, we promptly resolved it," a spokesman wrote. But on March 9 -- one week after the testing troubles began -- Stewart sent a press release stating that the Florida Department of Law Enforcement was investigating testing delays caused by cyber-attacks on a server used to administer the test. Stewart wrote that "some of the delays in testing" were due to cyber-attacks and repeated that AIR’s system update had resulted in the initial delays Monday and Tuesday. "By Tuesday afternoon, the issue with the log on server was resolved," Stewart wrote. "While there were some sporadic reports of denial of service on Monday and Tuesday, significant concerns of an attack did not occur until Thursday morning when DOE received widespread reports from a number of districts of ‘white screens’ after logging in. By approximately 8:30 a.m. Thursday, the problem had subsided and the districts that continued were able to test successfully for the rest of the day. AIR confirmed the cause of this issue was a cyber-attack on the log on server." AIR told PolitiFact Florida that the cyber-attack was launched against a firewall that protects the servers. "There was no attempt to infiltrate the firewall, but rather to make the website unavailable by flooding the firewall with nonsense connections," an AIR spokesman said. School districts have a two-week window to deliver the tests, and as of the middle of the second week, about 87 percent of the students had taken the tests. We sent portions of Stewart’s press release to O’Toole spokesman Joshua Blake, who said she misspoke during the committee. "I intended to convey that a cyber-attack was reported to have played a role in those initial difficulties, but the numbers show that 87 percent have completed the test as of yesterday, and I am encouraged by that number," O'Toole said in a statement provided by Blake. Our ruling O’Toole said that the testing "problem was not that of a vendor, the problem was not that of the test materials itself, it was the product of a cyber attack." Actually, a vendor update was responsible for the initial problems that kept students from logging onto the new testing system. The cyber attack was another problem that happened later in the week. O’Toole admitted she misspoke. There is an element of truth here because the cyber attack did create problems, but it wasn’t the only culprit. We rate this claim Mostly False.	None	H.

pomt-05958	Says Wisconsin Democrats during the previous administration adopted "double-digit tax increases."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jan/25/scott-walker/fighting-recall-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-says-do/	In his latest TV ad, released on the first anniversary of his inauguration, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker makes a case for why he should not be only the third U.S. governor ever recalled from office. The Republican takes credit for erasing Wisconsin’s $3.6 billion budget deficit and for saving taxpayers "hundreds of millions of dollars" by making government employees pay more for pension and health benefits. Walker closes the ad, released Jan. 3, 2012, by drawing a contrast with his Democratic predecessor. "In the three years before I took office," he says, without naming Jim Doyle, "Wisconsin lost 150,000 jobs. But now, well, employer confidence is up, and since the start of the year, Wisconsin has added thousands of new jobs. Instead of going back to the days of billion-dollar budget deficits, double-digit tax increases and record job loss, let’s keep moving Wisconsin forward." That’s some broad language. So broad, some would think the double-digit increases were a fact of life for most residents. While widespread jobs losses in the recession and the deficit Walker inherited are well known, we wondered what Walker meant by "double-digit tax increases." Walker repeated the "double-digit tax increases" claim on Rush Limbaugh’s national radio talk show on Jan. 17, 2012, the day before petitions seeking the recall election were submitted. And he did it again the next day, claiming Democratic recall candidate Kathleen Falk intends to "take Wisconsin back to the days" of double-digit tax increases. Let’s see if that’s what state Democrats did. Democrats did boost taxes with the 2009-2011 state budget and a 2009 budget adjustment bill. We found, when rating a $5 billion claim by Walker running mate Rebecca Kleefisch as False, that the two measures raised taxes and fees by just over $3 billion over the two-year period. Ben Sparks, a spokesman for the Republican Party of Wisconsin, said Walker’s double-digit claim refers to the same two budget measures. In a document Sparks provided, Walker cites three sets of tax changes to back his claim. School property taxes Walker said that, because of the Democrats’ 2009-2011 budget, school property tax levies would have increased an estimated 17.3 percent in 2011 had he not taken the steps he did with his 2011-2013 budget. Hmmm. In the ad, Walker flatly claimed that Democrats raised taxes by double-digits. Now he’s talking about a hypothetical -- indeed, one that didn’t occur. Like any governor, Walker had the opportunity to fashion his own budget. And with a Republican-controlled Legislature, he cut state aid to schools and school districts’ ability to raise property tax revenues. The result: 2011 school levies dropped 1 percent. What about the other two tax changes Walker cites? Business taxes Walker contends Democrats raised business taxes by $456 million, or 28 percent, over two years. Among other things, he cited the Democratic adoption of "combined reporting," which taxes a relatively small number of Wisconsin-based businesses on income from subsidiaries outside the state, rather than only those within Wisconsin. That tax is estimated to raise $187 million over two years. He also cited elimination of a tax deduction for domestic production, which is estimated to increase corporate income tax payments by nearly $72 million. Dale Knapp, research director of the nonprofit Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, said there isn’t a good base on which to calculate the $450 million increase. But roughly $350 million of that increase is to be paid in corporate income taxes, which is roughly an increase of 21 percent, he said. So, that material is generally on point. What’s left? Miscellaneous taxes Walker cites a number of double-digit tax increases the Democrats made, including a 42 percent hike in the tax on cigarettes to $2.52 per pack; more than doubling the $75 per-bed per-month assessment paid by nursing homes; and more than doubling the "tipping fee" charged to landfills, which is ultimately passed on to garbage generators such as families. Our own research turned up one Walker didn’t cite. The Democrats raised the top income tax rate from 6.75 percent to 7.75 percent. That 1-percentage-point increase amounts to a 15 percent boost in the rate itself. The change caused a 13.5 percent increase in the actual tax paid by people with an adjusted gross income of $1 million or more, according to the taxpayers alliance. Our rating In a TV ad, Walker said the Democratic administration and Legislature that preceded him approved "double-digit tax increases." There certainly were not widespread double-digit increases in the taxes most people directly pay -- income taxes and the sales tax. But there are a variety of other tax increases that rose by double digits. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2012-01-25T09:00:00	2012-01-03	['None']

pomt-08545	"The Republican candidate [John Loughlin] has talked about privatizing Social Security ... so we know where he stands on the issue."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/02/david-cicilline/cicilline-says-loughlin-has-talked-about-privatizi/	It may be the most frequently used weapon in the Democratic arsenal this midterm election season: accusing the GOP of wanting to "privatize" Social Security. So many Democrats have made such claims about their Republican opponents that our national PolitiFact team and those in other states have reviewed the issue on more than a half-dozen occasions. Most found that the Democrats have distorted the Republican position to some degree, with the claims receiving Half True or Barely True ratings. Here in Rhode Island, the topic takes on particular significance because we have one of the highest percentages in the country of people 65 and older, more than 14 percent. Nearly 140,000 Rhode Island seniors receive Social Security benefits. Democratic congressional candidate David Cicilline has joined the chorus of critics in his new "Fighting For Social Security" campaign tour, suggesting to seniors that his GOP opponent, state Rep. John Loughlin, would gamble with their money. At his first stop, on Sept. 23, he told a group of elderly voters at Pawtucket's St. Germain Manor Senior Center: "The Republican candidate has talked about privatizing Social Security, and when there was a resolution [in the Rhode Island General Assembly] urging Congress not to privatize Social Security, he was one of seven people to vote no on that. So we know where he stands on that issue." Speaking quite literally, it's true that Loughlin has talked about the concept of privatization. It would be hard to be a Republican -- or a Democrat -- running for federal office and not address whether that's a good or bad idea. And Loughlin acknowledges his 2005 vote against a Rhode Island House resolution pressing Congress not to privatize the program. Why did he vote that way? He says he didn't think it made sense to completely block the concept. Moving on to the next part of his claim, we asked Cicilline for examples of where Loughlin "stands on the issue" of privatization. His campaign provided us with several. The first was in a quote from Loughlin in The Providence Journal in February. "I think that citizens should be able to choose to put a portion of their Social Security payroll taxes into private investment accounts, but it should be completely voluntary. Recent stock market volatility is going to cause some people to want to stay within the current system and that's fine," Loughlin told a reporter. A second, similar reference came two days after the September primary when Loughlin told The Pawtucket Times that "younger workers should be allowed to privatize some of their Social Security" to give them greater flexibility. Like our PolitiFact counterparts in other states, we question whether Loughlin's suggestion that workers be allowed to voluntarily divert a portion of their payroll to a personal investment account constitutes a desire to privatize. What we found was that this issue is very much a war of words. Loughlin believes the option to investment in a personal account is simply that, an option. Cicilline counters that voluntary changes are no different than full privatization because they would eat away at the Social Security funding stream, destabilizing the program and taking it one step closer to elimination. "I don't think we're claiming he wants to abolish Social Security, but this isn't us putting words in his mouth," Cicilline campaign manager Eric Hyers told us. "He used the 'P' word." Loughlin dismissed the idea that voluntary accounts and full privatization are comparable -- or that Cicilline knows where he stands on the issue -- calling his opponent's comments "completely and totally false." Though Loughlin does support the concept of allowing people to make choices about parts of their contribution money "That is not the same by any stretch of the imagination as privatizing Social Security," he argues. "Not even close." Privatization, Loughlin believes, implies a mandated change, something he says he opposes. "This is a very common line of attack on the Democratic attack wheel ... " Loughlin continued. "The playbook tells them, go to all senior centers and the nursing homes and say the Republican candidate wants to take away your Social Security and kick you off and they want to put it in that risky thing down on Wall Street called the stock market." At the same time, the Republican is sharply critical of the current Social Security system, on several occasions even comparing it to a Ponzi scheme. PolitiFact Rhode Island will examine that comment in a separate item Sunday. But let's get back to the privatization question. Taking it point by point, Cicilline is correct when he says Loughlin has talked about privatization. It's important to note however that words matter. Had Cicilline made a more stringent accusation, we might have judged it differently. He's also right that Loughlin voted against the resolution urging Washington to oppose it. On the third point, however, Cicilline misses the mark. He does not appear to know where his opponent stands on the issue. Loughlin himself says Cicilline is flat out misinterpreting his position. Yet that hasn't stopped Cicilline from criss-crossing the state using the accusation to scare elderly voters and win votes. Yes, Loughlin has expressed dissatisfaction with the current program and has publicly supported tinkering with the system to offer a private option. But to our knowledge, the GOP candidate has never advocated for making the program fully private. And he says he has no plans to do so. We rate Cicilline's claim Half True.

pomt-08141	"The senior senator from Arizona (John McCain) said he couldn't support repealing 'don't ask, don't tell' because of the economy."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/dec/06/harry-reid/sen-harry-reid-says-sen-john-mccain-opposes-dont-a/	In an address from the floor of the Senate on Dec. 4, 2010, Democratic Sen. Harry Reid used the analogy of Lucy from the Peanuts cartoon -- who repeatedly pulled the football away every time Charlie Brown went to kick it -- to describe Sen. John McCain's reasoning for his opposition to abolishing the military's controversial "don't ask, don't tell" policy. "First, Sen. McCain said he would seriously consider repealing it if the military leadership thought we should, and (when) the military leadership said it should be repealed, he pulled away the football. Then Sen. McCain said he would need to see a study from the Pentagon. When the Pentagon produced the study saying repeal would have no negative effect at all, he pulled away the football again," Reid said. "And his latest trick, he said yesterday that he opposed repealing 'don't ask, don't tell,' a proposal that would be a great stride forward for both equality and military readiness ... because of the economy," said Reid, whose quote was picked up in Politico. "I repeat, the senior senator from Arizona said he couldn't support repealing 'don't ask, don't tell' because of the economy." "I have no idea what he's talking about, and no one else does either," Reid said. Reid's statement -- based on comments McCain made the day before during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing on the Defense Department's report about the "don't ask, don't tell" policy -- seemed to suggest that McCain believed "don't ask, don't tell" had some sort of negative economic consequences. But that's not the context for McCain's comments. Rather, it was an issue of legislative priority. McCain's point was that the issue of how to address a flailing economy ought to be addressed before the Senate considered something like "don't ask, don't tell." "I will not agree to have this bill go forward ... because our economy is in the tank," McCain said. "Our economy is in the tank, and the American people want that issue addressed. And the military is functioning in the most efficient, most professional, most courageous fashion than at any time in our history. "So to somehow believe that this is some kind of compelling issue at a time we're in two wars ... is obviously not something that we should be exercising a rush to judgment." Two days earlier the entire Republican caucus in the Senate signed a letter, sent to Reid, promising to filibuster any bills proposed by Democrats until the Senate had acted to prevent the expiration of the Bush tax cuts for all taxpayers. Republicans have argued that letting the tax cuts expire even for the wealthy, as Democrats proposed, would deal a devastating blow to the economy. McCain's comments about not taking up "don't ask don't tell" in light of the economy are consistent with that Republican pledge. McCain added that he would be willing to consider the "don't ask, don't tell" issue in depth during the next legislative session. "I would be more than eager in the coming year to have additional hearings, as they had some 13 hearings when 'don't, ask, don't tell' was enacted," McCain said. "And I would pledge to work with you on that effort, but certainly not during a lame-duck session when parts of my state are suffering in ways that they never have in the history of my state." It's true that McCain listed the poor economy as a reason he would not support "don't ask, don't tell," but only in the context of the economy needing to be a higher priority for the Senate. When Reid claimed, "the senior senator from Arizona said he couldn't support repealing 'don't ask, don't tell' because of the economy," the implication seems to be that McCain was making an argument that "don't ask, don't tell" would harm the economy. Especially when Reid added, "I have no idea what he's talking about, and no one else does either." The policy's impact on the economy would be a confusing argument. But in context, McCain's reference to the economy was quite clearly ranking other priorities against it. We rule Reid's statement Half True.

pomt-12362	"Property taxes are lower right now than they were" in December 2010 on a median-valued home in Wisconsin.	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/jun/07/scott-walker/property-taxes-lower-typical-wisconsin-home-under-/	For a while there, Gov. Scott Walker was coy about whether he would run for a third four-year term in 2018. But now his intentions are all but official, and he is repeatedly sounding themes that could show up as part of his campaign platform. On May 18, 2017, Walker was interviewed by Jeff Wagner, a conservative talk show host on WTMJ-AM in Milwaukee. Wagner opened by asking about one of the governor’s favorite topics: property tax reform. Walker responded by declaring that property taxes on a median-value home "are lower right now than they were" in December 2010, the month before he took office. He’s correct, though there’s a caveat. Prior fact checks There’s no question property taxes, though they might increase for some individual property owners and decrease for others, have generally been on the decline since Walker took office and his fellow Republicans took control of the Legislature in 2011. In 2015, we rated Mostly True a Walker claim that because of his actions, property taxes were lower than they were four years earlier. Walker’s actions to limit the ability of local governments and school districts to raise levies played a major role. But the lower property taxes to that point were also due in part to declines in housing values. In January 2017, when Walker said that property taxes -- as a percentage of personal income -- were "the lowest that they've been since the end of World War II," our rating was True. An analysis by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance showed that on the measure Walker cited, they were lowest since 1946. And on our Walk-O-Meter, which tracks Walker’s campaign promises, we’ve rated In the Works his pledge to cut property taxes so that the levy on a typical home in 2018 is lower than it was in 2010. Current claim Walker’s new claim refers to a specific measure -- an estimate of the hypothetical property tax on a median-valued, or typical, Wisconsin home. The estimates are done by the nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau. That tax was $2,963 for 2010-’11, just before Walker took office; and it’s $2,832 for 2017-’18. 2010-’11 2011-’12 2012-’13 2013’-14 2014-’15 2015-’16 2016-’17 2017-’18 2018-’19 $2,963 $2,953 $2,943 $2,926 $2,831 $2,849 $2,852 $2,832 $2,831 A caveat Todd Berry, president of the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance, told us it’s important to note that levies -- the total property taxes collected -- have risen in each year but one during Walker’s tenure, even though the the tax on a median-valued home is lower than before he took office. The reason is that compared to commercial and manufacturing properties, residential values have lagged. As a result, more of the property tax burden has shifted to commercial and manufacturing and away from residential, Berry said. Our rating Walker says "property taxes are lower right now than they were" in December 2010 on a median-valued home in Wisconsin. Estimates done regularly by the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau show that the hypothetical property tax bill on a typical Wisconsin home is $2,832 for 2017-’18 -- $131 lower than the year before Walker took office. But it’s worth noting that the total amount of property taxes collected have risen in each year but one during Walker’s tenure. And that the drop in residential property taxes is due to commercial and manufacturing properties rising at a faster rate -- not due to collecting less taxes. For a statement that is accurate but needs additional information, our rating is Mostly True.

pomt-03098	"In fiscal year 2011-2012, 4,191 abortions were paid for by taxpayers via the Oregon Health Plan."	true	/oregon/statements/2013/sep/24/oregon-2014/does-oregon-health-plan-pay-about-4000-abortions-y/	A group called Oregon 2014 is trying to collect enough signatures to put a measure on the ballot that would prohibit taxpayer spending on abortions. The group tried to do the same in 2012 but failed to collect enough signatures. In any case, on its website is this statistic: "In 2012 there were 9,015 abortions in Oregon. In fiscal year 2011-2012, 4,191 abortions were paid for by taxpayers via the Oregon Health Plan." The suggestion came to us via a reader, who had heard a signature gatherer cite the statistic. Was it true? We contacted Oregon 2014 right away, where a co-chief petitioner said the statistic was solid and that he welcomed a fact check. "I’ve been called a liar to my face," said Jeff Jimerson, "and I try to direct them to the information." The information comes from the Oregon Health Authority. The number of abortions paid by the state has fluctuated from 4,105 in 2002-03 to 3,424 in 2008-09 to 4,191 in 2011-12. This is the most up-to-date information available, said Karynn Fish, an OHA spokeswoman. But isn’t there a restriction on using public money to finance abortions? There is. The Hyde Amendment, first approved by Congress in 1976, prohibits the use of public money to pay for abortions, except in case of rape or incest or to save the mother’s life, for the most part. This affects low-income women who receive health care through federal Medicaid. In response to the Hyde Amendment, Oregon’s Department of Human Resources then issued a rule limiting reimbursement for abortions. People sued. The appellate court voted the rule unconstitutional, in that it violated the equal privileges and immunities clause of the Constitution. In 1984, the Oregon Supreme Court took a different approach, ruling that Human Resources had overstepped its rule-making authority, which was to pay for medical services for needy people. In Oregon, the Health Plan uses a mix of federal and state monies to provide health care for low-income residents. Oregon is among a minority of states that allow using state taxpayer money for elective abortions. Petitioners hope to change that by adding these words to the Constitution: "No public funds shall be used to pay for any abortion, except when medically necessary or as may be required by federal law." We may see this measure on the 2014 ballot; we may not. But it is accurate to say that state taxpayer money paid for about 4,000 abortions in the most recent year available.

pomt-01585	"Miller Brewing is not a U.S. company any more. Neither is Anheuser-Busch."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/sep/08/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-miller-brewing-and-anheuser-busch-a/	During an appearance in Milwaukee, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan delved into the growing controversy surrounding inversions, the practice of U.S.-based companies buying foreign firms and then relocating their own headquarters to another country to enjoy lower taxes. Bloomberg News reported that nine U.S. companies are planning tax inversions this year. The most recent and highest profile case came in August 2014 when Burger King said it planned to buy Canada-based doughnut chain Tim Hortons and relocate its own headquarters from the United States to Canada. In an appearance before the Rotary Club of Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Press Club, Ryan was asked if inversions should be banned. He said that the U.S. tax code needed reform and that American-based companies pay far more in taxes than their counterparts in other countries. "The trend we have seen lately are foreign companies buying U.S. companies for many reasons, like tax reasons," said Ryan, R-Janesville. "Simply putting up a fortress around America with these anti-inversion rules, all that we'll end up doing is accelerate the takeover of U.S. corporations by foreign corporations." Ryan then popped open a claim involving one of Brewtown’s icons. "Miller is not a U.S. company any more. Neither is Anheuser-Busch," he said. "Think of what this does to our communities. The royalties, the headquarters and all that." Yes, beer and politics get mixed up again. A few weeks back, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke told an ABC News interviewer that she favored New Glarus Brewing Co.’s Spotted Cow to Leinenkugel's Summer Shandy, because Spotted Cow was available only in Wisconsin. After asking around to see if that was widely known, we checked it out and rated it True. When we asked our beer drinking cohorts about where Miller and Bud were based, we got some of the same stumped looks. After all, Milwaukee is where Frederick J. Miller bought the Plank Road Brewery and founded Miller Brewing Company in 1855. "He brewed his delicious beer using yeast that he carried in his pocket from Europe," the company’s history says. Although Miller is still brewed in Milwaukee (and elsewhere), the company is no longer based here. In 2002, South African Breweries, already one of the largest breweries in the world, bought Miller. That created SABMiller. In 2008, SABMiller added the the U.S. business of Molson Coors, creating MillerCoors. The new company moved its headquarters from Milwaukee to Chicago, while the corporate parent is based in London. Brewery employment has remained about the same in Milwaukee at about 750 workers, the company said in June of 2013. The number of corporate office jobs in Milwaukee, including sales and marketing and executives, declined by about 370 to 607. What about Bud? Meanwhile, TV ads for Anheuser-Busch’s flagship brew, Budweiser often feature a heavy Americana feel, with red, white and blue and tributes to returning soldiers and small towns. But today the corporate parent is a long way from St. Louis, where its roots date to 1852. In a hostile takeover, the international conglomerate InBev bought Anheuser-Busch for $52 billion in 2008. Anheuser-Busch is now one of many subsidiaries and the deal resulted in hundreds of jobs being cut, including many in St. Louis. The full name of the company is now Anheuser-Busch InBev. The headquarters is in Belgium. The company leaped over SABMiller to become the largest brewer in the world. Before the company bought Anheuser-Busch, InBev grew from a combination of Belgian breweries, the addition of Labatts in Canada and breweries in Russia, China, Germany and Brazil. Since then, the company has added Mexico’s Grupo Modelo, according to a history on the company’s website. "I don't think the tax code was a driving factor for any of the mergers," said Eric Shepard, executive editor of Beer Marketer’s Insights, a trade publication. "AB InBev was more about other synergies," he said. "They probably don't mind a lower tax rate, however." In addition, moves into new markets are necessary because beer sales are flat in the United States and Europe, according to a Sept. 3, 2014 profile of AB InBev in Forbes. "Amid stagnating beer sales in developed markets, comprising North America and Western Europe, the brewer has looked to tap into the growth potential of emerging beer markets such as Brazil, Mexico, China and South Korea, mainly by acquiring small regional brands and leveraging its strong marketing and advertising muscle," the article said Our rating Ryan cited two well-known beer makers -- including one founded in Milwaukee -- when asked about inversions. He said the parent companies of Miller and Anheuser-Busch are located overseas. They were part of a long-standing and rapid world-wide consolidation of the major breweries.

pomt-14235	"We have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/14/hillary-clinton/new-york-debate-clinton-says-us-has-higher-account/	Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders voted for a law that gave higher standards to toy guns than real guns, opponent Hillary Clinton charged at the New York Democratic debate. A 2005 law put restrictions on people’s ability to sue the gun industry for crimes committed using their products. As Clinton often points out, she voted against this law, while Sanders voted for it. "We have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns," Clinton said April 14. The claim that this law gives higher standards to toy guns is something Clinton has said in recent weeks. It’s not a settled question. Here’s why. A liability gap? The law at issue is the 2005 Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush and seen as a victory for gun rights advocates. The purpose of the law is to protect gun dealers and manufacturers from lawsuits when their products are misused, meaning if a gun dealer legally sells a person a gun, and then the buyer uses the gun to commit a crime, the gun dealer and manufacturer cannot be held liable for the crime. The law arose after victims, cities and states started to bring lawsuits against gunmakers that pursued new legal paths, such as one that argued manufacturers Glock Inc. and China North Industries had oversaturated the market, producing so many guns that it was inevitable some would fall into criminal hands. Most judges dismissed these kinds of lawsuits, but a minority allowed them to proceed. There are several situations that are not protected from lawsuits under the law. It does not protect gun dealers who transfer a gun knowing it would be used for criminal purposes, nor those who knowingly break state or federal law if the violation results in harm. Gun manufacturers can also be sued if the gun, when used properly, causes injury because the product is defective. Opponents argue that the law stops some victims from having their day in court because the liability immunity is so broad and ambiguous, while the exceptions are narrow. Supporters, though, say the law protects gun dealers and manufacturers from frivolous and expensive legal proceedings. We’ve written before that Congress has passed laws giving some other industries varying levels of immunity. A couple experts told us Clinton’s statement is unsound because the law sought to impose equivalent, rather than fewer, standards for gun makers that are already established for manufacturers of other products. As it stands, the victim of a crime committed with a toy — say, if a person seriously injured another person by shooting them with bb gun pellets — generally cannot sue the toy manufacturer, just as they can’t sue Toyota or Budweiser if they’re struck by a drunk person driving a Prius. The 2005 law "basically put gun manufacturers in the same position that other product manufacturers are in," said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles. "They’re responsible for defectively manufactured and designed products but not for failing to prevent criminal misuse of their products." Additionally, toy guns and real guns pose fundamentally different risks because real guns are much more likely to be used in a crime than a toy gun, said Timothy Lytton, a Georgia State University law professor who edited a book on suing the gun industry. So before the law, the gun industry was subject to a wider range of liability that just doesn’t apply to a toy. As such, it’s hard to imagine a realistic incident with a toy gun that would cause someone to bring a suit against the toy company, yet they would not be able to sue a gun manufacturer for an equivalent situation involving a real gun. A hypothetical situation might be if a city experienced an epidemic of deaths or injuries that resulted from a prevalence of realistic-looking toy guns; think of the recent story of Tamir Rice, a Cleveland child carrying a toy gun who a police officer shot and killed, said Alexandra Lahav, a professor of civil procedure at the University of Connecticut School of Law. In that case, a city might want to bring a suit against the toy gun manufacturer or seller for creating a public nuisance. But under the 2005 law, a city cannot sue a gun company if there is an epidemic of people being injured or killed by their guns. Lahav added, though, that she thinks the idea someone would bring a suit like this against a toy company is highly unlikely. In theory, there might be a liability gap between toy guns and real guns, but that wouldn't necessarily play out in reality, she said. Toy and real gun manufacturers can be sued for product defects that cause injury when the product is used as intended. But if an injury is caused by a product defect coupled with a criminal misuse of the product, a toy gun manufacturer could be held liable, but a real gun manufacturer could not under the 2005 law, said Adam Winkler, also a UCLA law professor and an expert in the Second Amendment. That limits the gun industry’s incentives to make their products as safe as possible. The fact that a party cannot even attempt to bring these kinds of lawsuits against real gun manufacturers sets them apart from other industries, including toys, said Mark Geistfeld, a law professor at New York University and an expert in products liability. Such lawsuits against the gun industry might be destined to fail, but the 2005 law doesn’t even allow for the arguments to be tested. "You’ve granted an immunity to the gun industry that you haven’t granted to any other industry," Geistfeld said of Sanders, noting that this supports the gist of Clinton’s point: that Sanders holds guns to a lower standard. Lytton noted, though, that he would not presume to know whether Sanders or anyone else who voted for the law would grant similar immunity to the toy industry if the opportunity arose. "It’s not fair to basically enter into hyperbole that somehow he treated firearms differently (so) he would come down harder on toy guns," Lytton said. Our ruling Clinton said, "We have tougher standards holding toy gun manufacturers and sellers to account than we do for real guns." She’s parroting a line she has stated previously. Clinton points to a 2005 law granting the gun industry certain immunity from lawsuits. In her camp are scholars who believe the law made the gun industry less susceptible to liability than other industries, including the toy gun industry. But other scholars think the law made the gun industry’s liability about the same as that of a toy gun manufacturer. And because real guns carry so much more risk for injury than toy guns, it’s hard to compare them effectively. This is a complex legal question, on which reasonable minds can disagree, so we rate Clinton’s claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4319fa9b-87b6-473d-a29c-487b2e070a6c	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2016-04-14T21:53:08	2016-04-14	['None']

pomt-00522	"Two weeks ago, a man entered the world’s busiest airport in Atlanta, Georgia, carrying a loaded AR-15 automatic weapon with an extended-capacity, 100-round magazine."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2015/jun/23/hank-johnson/johnson-errs-description-airport-gun-right-about-c/	When Jim Cooley carried his AR-15 rifle fully loaded with a 100-round drum into Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport last month, it revived a Georgia congressman’s efforts to restrict weapons in airports nationwide. U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Lithonia, cited the incident in again proposing the Airport Security Act, which would ban loaded weapons outside airports’ security areas. Federal law already bans carrying weapons through airport security checkpoints. "Two weeks ago, a man entered the world’s busiest airport in Atlanta, Georgia, carrying a loaded AR-15 automatic weapon with an extended capacity, 100-round magazine," Johnson said in a House floor speech June 15. "Mr. Speaker, actions like this, which follow shootings at airports in Los Angeles and Houston, undermine public security in the same way as yelling ‘fire’ in a crowded theater." Johnson’s proposal has been assigned to the House Homeland Security Committee, where the political battle over gun control will continue. But something in the rhetoric caught our eye for a closer look. Was the rifle in question at our airport an automatic weapon? THE HISTORY The AR-15 that Cooley carried is most likely the most popular such rifle on the market today. That is in part because several variants have been made since Colt started selling its version of the rifle as a semi-automatic weapon to civilians in the early 1960s. One modified version of the firearm was adopted as the M-16 rifle, deployed by the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War era. Several different manufacturers have since made versions of the rifle for private use. But the term "AR-15" has consistently been used to refer to the semi-automatic version Colt made popular. A fully automatic version is not sold directly to civilians. The federal assault weapons ban prohibited some versions of the AR-15 – such as those with collapsible stocks and bayonet lug – sold to civilians between 1994 and 2004. However, AR-15s built before the ban were legal – as were versions designed to comply with the federal law. Those loopholes effectively kept various forms of the AR-15 in production. For instance, admitted movie theater shooter James Holmes used a version of the AR-15 in the Aurora, Colo., massacre in 2012 that would have been illegal under the federal ban. But similar versions, including the Colt Match Target rifle, would have been legal, according to a 2004 University of Pennsylvania study funded by the National Institute of Justice. AUTOMATIC VERSUS SEMI-AUTOMATIC So, it’s clear the rifles can be deadly. In fact, semi-automatic weapons are often more deadly than the scarier sounding automatic versions, said Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at the University of Central Florida. That boils down to the difference between the two: Automatic weapons fire continuously when the shooter pulls the trigger once. The firing stops only when you release the trigger. Semi-automatic weapons will automatically reload, but the shooter must pull the trigger for each shot fired. Many law enforcement agencies that use small arms rifles, such as for SWAT teams, prefer semi-automatic weapons because there is less recoil in firing them. That allows for better aim, Corzine said. Nearly all AR-15 rifles are manufactured as semi-automatic weapons, in part because of that accuracy. However, gun shops do sell converter kits and manuals, which allow the rifles to be turned into automatic weapons that wouldn’t differ at a glance from the semi-automatic version, Corzine said. "An automatic firing mechanism is not more lethal in number of people killed, but you will end up with more people hit," Corzine said. "If you are shooting into a crowd, you’re going to hit a lot of people." IN GEORGIA The 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that killed 26 children and school staff prompted Connecticut, Maryland and New York to join three other states with heavy restrictions or outright bans on the AR-15. But Georgia is not one of the states with restrictions. Likewise, Cooley was legally able to sling his AR-15 over his chest because of a 2010 state law that allows weapons in areas not covered by airport security. Cooley, who lives in Winder, said he brought his gun and the high-capacity magazine for safety when dropping off his daughter for a flight. His weapon, he said, is a semi-automatic rifle. "If you look at the video, the officer called my rifle an automatic weapon, and I had to correct her," said Cooley, who posted a video of his visit to the airport while carrying the weapon. "It is a semi-automatic rifle. To say it’s not is untrue. You can’t just say anything you want on the House floor." In his floor statements, Johnson cited the economic role that airports, especially Hartsfield-Jackson, play in communities as a reason to regulate guns for safety concerns. Johnson was at meetings in the United Nations when we reached out to him. Ben Waldon, his director of intergovernmental affairs, told us the congressman concedes he misspoke in calling Cooley’s weapon an automatic rather than a semi-automatic weapon. Waldon added that the 100-round drum also was a concern, regardless of the status of the weapon. Studies indicate limiting high-capacity magazines can affect gun violence since they are involved in more crimes (about 25 percent) than automatic and semi-automatic weapons (2 percent to 8 percent). Small-capacity magazines require the shooter to reload, which gives bystanders a chance to intervene as they did in the 2011 shooting of U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords that killed six. "Mr. Cooley’s weapon was a semi-automatic. But it is an assault rifle, with a high-capacity magazine," Waldon said. "The congressman feels these kinds of weapons stoke fear, not civility, and the incident in Atlanta demonstrates the extremes of allowing these kinds of guns in airports." OUR RULING U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson cited a recent incident of a man carrying his AR-15 rifle in Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in reviving his efforts to ban weapons from all areas of airports. Johnson called the gun an "automatic weapon," something he and his staff concede was incorrect. The gun owner has confirmed he owns the semi-automatic version of the rifle. That is the more common make of this weapon, although all sides and experts acknowledge the weapon can be converted to an automatic weapon. The bigger concern was the 100-magazine drum. Even in a semi-automatic weapon, that would allow a shooter to fire 100 rounds before reloading, the scary prospect that Johnson appeared to want to reference in his statement. Johnson got the gun wrong, the magazine for the weapon right. For that reason, we rate Johnson’s statement Half True.

pomt-04635	"With the auto rescue," President Barack Obama "saved more than 1 million middle-class jobs all across America," including more than 28,000 in Wisconsin.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/sep/14/jennifer-granholm/obama-auto-rescue-saved-28000-middle-class-jobs-wi/	In a high-volume, arm-pumping speech at the Democratic National Convention on Sept. 6, 2012, former Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm proclaimed that President Barack Obama saved the American automobile industry. It’s a claim, made repeatedly at the convention, that PolitiFact National has said is on pretty solid ground. But Granholm got more specific. "With the auto rescue," Obama "saved more than 1 million middle-class jobs all across America," said Granholm. She continued by claiming jobs saved in a number of states, such as the election battlegrounds of Florida (35,000), Michigan (211,000) and Ohio (150,000). She said more than 28,000 jobs were saved in Wisconsin alone. For us, Granholm’s claim really has three parts: the U.S. and Wisconsin jobs-saved figures; whether those jobs were "middle-class"; and whether Obama deserves full credit for saving the jobs. Let’s turn the ignition. Auto industry crisis Granholm, now a law professor and host of a talk show on Current TV, is a Democrat who served eight years as Michigan’s governor after being elected in 2002. She alluded in her speech to late 2008, when the auto industry was near collapse. As PolitiFact National has reported, layoffs at auto plants and among auto parts suppliers were on track that year to reach 250,000 workers. General Motors was virtually out of cash to pay its bills and Chrysler was not far behind. (Granholm stated in her speech that Republican Mitt Romney’s response at the time was to "Let Detroit go bankrupt." But as our colleagues noted in rating that claim Half True, it was a New York Times staff writer who put that headline on an opinion piece penned by Romney in which he advocated a "managed bankruptcy" with new management, new labor agreements and federal guarantees for post-bankruptcy financing.) The auto rescue began under President George W. Bush, who just before leaving office gave Chrysler and GM more than $17 billion in loans. (Ford never asked for assistance.) Then in 2009, Obama provided $80 billion in relief. Some was offered as loans to the automakers, but much more was given in exchange for stock. The Italian car company Fiat became the majority stockholder of Chrysler; the second-largest owner is the autoworker union’s retiree health care trust fund. For GM, the U.S. government now owns about one-third of the company, private shareholders about one-third and the retiree trust fund 10 percent. Number of jobs saved Obama’s campaign said the evidence for Granholm’s claim comes from a May 2009 study produced by the Center for Automotive Research. The center is an independent research group based in Ann Arbor, Mich., that gets some funding from automakers. The study, released as the auto bailout was still playing out, made projections based on whether Chrysler and GM went through quick bankruptcies ("best-case" scenario) or lengthy bankruptcies ("worst-case" scenario). Under the best-case scenario -- bankruptcy filings and settlement with debtors completed within 90 days -- an estimated 63,200 U.S. jobs would have been lost by the end of 2009, the study said. That included 9,700 direct jobs, with the rest coming from automaker suppliers and "spin-off" jobs -- jobs lost as a result of reduced spending by auto and auto-supplier employees. Under the "worst-case" scenario -- bankruptcy proceedings that were "disruptive and disorderly" and would "drag on" -- the U.S. would have lost 1.34 million jobs by the end of 2009, including nearly 204,000 direct auto jobs, the study estimated. For Wisconsin, the 2009 jobs loss was pegged at 1,766 under the best-case scenario and 30,513 under the worst-case scenario. Granholm then did some math, subtracting the best-case jobs number from the worst-case number. For example, for Wisconsin, she claimed the bailout saved more than 28,000 middle-class jobs (30,513 minus 1,765 equals 28,748). The math Granholm did isn’t done in the study. And it’s not clear if she was trying to be conservative by citing figures slightly smaller than the maximums. But Obama’s campaign did respond to our question on this point by noting that the Center for Automotive Research did a later study, in November 2010, estimating that the auto rescue -- by avoiding the worst-case scenario with drawn-out bankruptcy proceedings -- saved an estimated 1.14 million U.S. jobs, slightly fewer than the earlier estimate of 1.3 million jobs. Kim Hill, associate research director of the Center for Automotive Research, noted that other studies also produced estimates of more than 1 million U.S. jobs being at stake. They included one study from the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C. think tank, and another from the University of Maryland. But the Center for Automotive Research study Granholm relies on provided a range of job loss predictions, and Granholm chooses numbers that best serve her rhetorical purpose. Moreover, the study's figures were estimates, not actual counts of jobs saved. There’s no way to know whether close to the worst-case scenario would have emerged had Obama not provided the auto rescue. And the alternate scenario outlined in the same report showed a much smaller potential job loss. Types of jobs saved The study Granholm cited did not use middle-class or any similar term in describing the jobs saved -- and it’s a term that many people interpret differently. Hill, of the Center for Automotive Research, told us that more than half of the projected jobs saved could easily be classified as middle-class, given that average annual salary and fringe benefits exceed $60,000 for auto workers and $40,000 for auto supplier workers. But to claim that all of the more 1 million jobs saved were middle class "gets to be a stretch," he said. Obama’s role As for credit for saving jobs, Granholm gave it all to Obama. But Obama doesn’t get full credit because Bush’s aid to Chrysler and GM kept them afloat and bought time for Obama to decide how to respond to the crisis, PolitiFact National concluded in its article about whether Obama saved the auto industry. Moreover, our colleagues observed, no one can say what would have happened without massive government intervention. Our rating Granholm said that "with the auto rescue," Obama "saved more than 1 million middle-class jobs all across America," including more than 28,000 in Wisconsin. The two figures are drawn from estimates from an independent study -- but: it’s not certain that job losses would have reached those levels without the rescue; not all of the jobs projected as saved were middle-class jobs; and Obama deserves a major share of the credit for saving jobs, not all of it. Granholm’s claim was partially accurate but left out important details. On balance, we rate it Half True.

pomt-03336	"The president has had 1,540 of his nominations confirmed, only four defeated."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/jul/22/mitch-mcconnell/obama-only-four-nominations-defeated-mcconnell-say/	The long-running Senate battle between Democrats and Republicans over the filibuster and delays in processing President Barack Obama’s nominations came to the brink this past week. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., threatened to use the so-called nuclear option and set aside the 60-vote majority needed to close debate and bring a nomination to the floor. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., said if Reid did that, he was "going to be remembered as the worst leader of the Senate ever." The two sides healed the breach after many urgent phone calls and a meeting of every senator in the Old Senate Chamber, a room one lawmaker called "hallowed ground." But before the return to relative civility, McConnell had been on NBC’s Meet the Press where he argued that the president had done pretty well for himself. "What is the problem here?" McConnell asked. "The president has had 1,540 of his nominations confirmed, only four defeated." McConnell’s office said he meant to say 1,560. We checked, and he did use the correct number just three days earlier. We also looked at the Library of Congress nominations database for Obama’s first and second terms and confirmed McConnell’s numbers. But what drew our attention was McConnell’s claim that only four had been defeated. That number refers to people who failed on a measure to end debate (called "cloture) and send their names to the floor for a simple majority vote. It takes 60 votes to end debate. McConnell’s list includes Craig Becker (National Labor Relations Board), Caitlin Joan Halligan (U.S. Circuit judge), Goodwin Liu (U.S. Circuit judge), and Richard Cordray (director, Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection). However, that doesn’t account for many of the people Obama put forward who have withdrawn due to opposition from Senate Republicans. "McConnell is using misleading numbers," said Ian Ostrander, a political scientist at Texas Tech University. "He’s taking advantage of the fact that very few nominations actually fail through a direct vote." There are many ways to stymie a nomination. There is the threat of filibuster which requires clearing the 60-vote majority to end debate. Alternatively, opponents can run out the clock and return the nomination to the White House with no vote at all, generally right before the summer recess or at the end of the year. Or an individual senator, anonymously or publicly, can place a hold and block a nomination from moving forward. Ostrander said that the White House might withdraw a nomination, or never put someone’s name forward if minority opposition seems too strong. He cited the examples of Susan Rice, Obama’s first choice for Secretary of State, and Elizabeth Warren, his first pick to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Neither was ever formally nominated. Republicans didn’t like key aspects of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau in the first place. In May 2011, 44 GOP senators sent a letter to the administration saying they "will not support the consideration of any nominee, regardless of party affiliation" until changes were made. When Obama replaced Warren with Richard Cordray, it made no difference in the Republican position. Cordray was the first stalled nominee to win confirmation immediately after the deal that averted the crisis in the Senate. Occasionally, Ostrander said, the nominee on their own steps back due to long delays. He put Federal Reserve Board nominee Peter Diamond in this category. Diamond, a Nobel Prize-winning economist, was nominated three times. Twice in 2010, the Senate did not reject him; it simply made no decision and returned the nomination to the White House. Sen. Richard Shelby, R-Ala., worked hard against the nomination and never backed down. The White House nominated Diamond a third time in June 2011, but he withdrew saying he saw that his name would never make it to the Senate floor. Ostrander has studied more than two decades of non-judicial nominations. His doctoral thesis: Winning the Waiting Game: Senatorial Delay in Executive Nominations. Ostrander has detailed at what point nominations failed in the nomination process: 84 percent stalled or were withdrawn before going before a committee. Another 0.03 percent were rejected by a committee vote, while 0.01 percent were rejected in a floor vote. "McConnell is choosing to count as failures cases that only account for a small fraction of overall failures," Ostrander said. Overall, 69 of Obama’s nominees withdrew for any reason since 2009. During the first term, Ostrander said he counts 38 who likely pulled out under pressure from Republican opposition. We reviewed in detail 12 instances (beyond McConnell’s four) where nominees withdrew after encountering opposition, either to their specific background or to Obama’s policies. Those include Donald Berwick to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, Erroll Southers to lead for the Transportation Security Administration, Michael Mundaca for the Treasury Department’s Office of Tax Policy, and Dawn Johnsen to be assistant attorney general, among others. There is an additional issue with McConnell’s measure of Obama’s success rate. We contacted five other political scientists, and they agreed that McConnell’s statement overlooked the impact of delayed nominations even if they ultimately win confirmation. In the book Defending the Filibuster: The Soul of the Senate, Richard A. Arenberg and Robert B. Dove said the filibuster is a moderating force and a check on executive power. We asked Arenberg if McConnell’s point about the president’s track record on confirmations was valid. "Clearly, it's not only the final outcome that matters," Arenberg said. "Delay in confirmation can certainly hamper an executive agency." Michael Gerhardt, a law professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, has studied the nomination process. "The problem is not just the delays; it is the limited authority of an acting or temporary head," Gerhardt said. "Here, the statistics might not accurately capture the harm done to the executive branch." Our ruling McConnell said Obama faced no real problems getting his nominees confirmed by the Senate, saying that only four of 1,540 nominations had been defeated. His office later said he misspoke and the number should have been 1,560. We find he's partially accurate but is leaving out some important details. Yes, it's true that when nominations reach a final vote, the vast majority have been approved by the Senate. But this accounting ignores those who withdrew before a vote, including the estimated 38 who withdrew after Republican opposition. It also does not account for high-profile figures such as Susan Rice who were never nominated because of opposition. We rate the claim Half True.

A Feb. 26, 2017, article on TheSeattleTribune.com says in a headline, "Trump’s Android device believed to be source of recent White House leaks." The post was flagged by Facebook users as being potentially false, as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat fake news. The readers got this one right. The story is fake. The story says two "private intelligence agencies" have determined that several news leaks that have been damaging to the Trump administration — from plans for executive orders to internal fights with staff — likely came from the president’s own phone. But TheSeattleTribune.com is a website that makes up their stories, and is associated with another faux news site called AssociatedMediaCoverage.com. Their disclaimer says the website "is a news and entertainment satire web publication" and that all articles "are fictional and presumably satirical news." If the counter on the story is to be believed, this one has been viewed more than 171,000 times in less than a week. It’s been used in online forums and also is popular on Facebook. It’s even appropriated a Twitter hashtag. The article claims #DitchTheDevice is an online effort by social media users to get Trump to quit using the phone. But really, that hashtag was formerly used to try to get people to stop staring at their phones all day long and enjoy life a little bit more. In any event, that’s what the hashtag means now, as thousands of people have used it while tweeting out TheSeattleTribune.com link. The story keys off a maelstrom of news about leaks from the White House, combined with Trump’s penchant for tweeting and his reported actual use of an unsecured Android phone. But this story?

pomt-01805	Obama’s 2012 policy on younger immigrants "created these children coming across" the border.	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2014/jul/23/lou-dobbs/dobbs-obama-policy-young-immigrants-created-crisis/	One of the consistent talking points among conservatives discussing the thousands of kids arriving at the U.S. border is that President Barack Obama’s 2012 immigration policy is responsible. The policy allowed certain young people without legal status to apply for a two-year deferral of any removal proceedings. Though it does not apply to people just now crossing the border, conservatives say it gave children and their families the idea that they could try. And so they have. We’ve heard that thinking from former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Republican strategist Karl Rove and now, Fox Business News host Lou Dobbs. "This president and his administration knew what was happening with the issuance of the executive order in 2012, which created these children coming across," Dobbs said on July 21, 2014. There is a problem with the claim, however. The dates don’t line up as neatly as people are letting on. The deferred action policy In June 2012, about four months before the presidential election, the Obama administration issued a memo saying it would allow certain young people without legal immigration status to apply for a two-year deferral of any removal proceedings. That deferral could be extended and anyone who was accepted would also gain the ability to work in this country. Generally speaking, it targeted people who had come across the border with their parents when they were little and had lived in the United States for many years. The move came after Republicans rejected a bill, the DREAM Act, that would have put these immigrants on a path to citizenship. To qualify, people had to show that they came to the country before they were 16, had lived here continuously since 2007, had never been convicted of a crime, were age 30 or under, and were either in school or had at least a high school education or had served in the armed forces. The government began accepting applications in mid August. Tracking the rise of children coming to the border The Congressional Research Service is a nonpartisan body that delivers policy research for Congress. In a June 2014 report, analysts included a chart showing how many new children had been handed over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement. Under a 2008 law aimed at protecting young victims of human trafficking, this is the agency responsible for taking care of unaccompanied minors apprehended by U.S. border or immigration agents. The chart measured the number of children processed by month, so we can get a better picture of how things played out along the border. The numbers don’t include children stopped at the border and immediately sent back, but they do mirror the overall trends. As you can see, monthly referrals largely were steady between October 2008 and January 2012. They then started to rise between January and April 2012, months before Obama announced his executive action. After that, they plateaued until January 2013, when they grew exponentially. Based on this chart, the rate of arrivals nearly doubled before Obama announced his new policy. Overall, there is not a simple cause and effect relationship that Obama issued his policy and arrivals went up. But this isn’t to say that Obama’s policy played no role in the current flood of children arriving at the border. The administration tacitly acknowledges some relationship. Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson published an open letter in key Central American countries in which he made the point that the new policy would not apply to children who show up today. "A child must have been in the United States prior to June 15, 2007 – seven years ago," Johnson wrote. In a report on the causes behind the current crisis, congressional researchers said many factors are driving the flood of children at the border. Those fleeing El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras account for most of the influx. Those countries suffer from high rates of crime and poor economies. Surveys found that about half of the children had been harmed or threatened by gangs or agents of the state. Children did not tend to come from Central American countries with less crime and better economies. The same surveys found that many of the children sought to join family members already living in the United States. The 2008 revised trafficking law is another potential factor. It opened a new legal option for unaccompanied children from countries other than Mexico and Canada. They can apply for asylum on the grounds that if they were sent home, they have good reason to fear that they would face persecution. It is unclear if fear of gang-violence meets that condition. Nevertheless, the children are getting a hearing and while they wait for the process to play itself out, they remain in this country. Our ruling Dobbs said the Obama policy directed at younger immigrants created the the problem at the border. The initial rise in arrivals began before Obama announced the policy and if anything, plateaued or declined a bit immediately afterward. However, the administration went out of its way recently to send the message that the policy did not apply to newcomers, suggesting the policy played some role. The influx of children comes mainly from the most troubled nations in Central America. The claim that Obama’s policy created the influx does not match the timeline and ignores other important factors. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-01839	Former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney are "unable to visit Europe due to outstanding warrants."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jul/17/facebook-posts/are-george-w-bush-dick-cheney-unable-visit-europe-/	Former President George W. Bush and former Vice President Dick Cheney have been out of office for more than five years, but that doesn’t mean the rest of the world has forgotten about them. In many countries, policies that Bush and Cheney spearheaded to fight terrorism continue to color views of the former United States leaders -- most notably the opening of the detainee center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, and the use of waterboarding and other "enhanced interrogation" methods that many consider torture. A reader recently sent us a social media meme that captured this sentiment. It shows a photograph of the two men, with the caption, "When I was growing up, I would never have believed that a former president and vice president of the United States would be unable to visit Europe due to outstanding warrants." The idea that Bush and Cheney could be arrested overseas isn’t entirely far-fetched. In 1998, Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London after Spain requested extradition for charges related to the murders of Spanish citizens in Chile during his time in office. In addition, Israeli politicians Tzipi Livni and Dan Meridor canceled trips to the United Kingdom in 2009 and 2010 amid threats of legal action, in Livni’s case for an Israeli strike on Gaza and in Meridor’s case an Israeli raid on a Turkish ship headed to Gaza. (The British government later changed the law, allowing Livni and others to make subsequent visits.) In 2005 Donald Rumsfeld nearly pulled out of a conference in Germany until receiving prosecutors’ assurances that he wouldn’t be arrested, according to the Guardian. Bush attracted significant media attention in 2011 when he canceled a trip to Geneva, Switzerland, to address the United Israel Appeal. A lawyer for the group told a Swiss newspaper that the cancellation stemmed from concerns about protests, not fear of arrest. Given all this, we wondered: Are there really outstanding warrants against Bush and Cheney from a legitimate authority, as the meme suggests? And are the two men in any danger of being arrested if they leave the United States? So we took a closer look. Arrest warrants and the International Criminal Court Interpol, the international police organization, does not list any outstanding arrest warrants for Bush or Cheney in their searchable database. Meanwhile, experts in international law said they were not aware of pending warrants, particularly from the most obvious entity that might issue one -- the International Criminal Court in the Hague. The ICC is a permanent, independent court that investigates and brings to justice individuals who commit war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide, according to the Congressional Research Service. Cases may be referred to the ICC either by a member state, the court’s own prosecutor, or the U.N. Security Council. The court only investigates and prosecutes serious crimes by individuals (not by organizations or governments), and then, only when national judicial systems are unwilling or unable to handle them. However, the ICC "has not issued warrants for any American citizen, let alone for Bush, Cheney, or anyone else," said Anthony Clark Arend, Georgetown University professor of government and foreign service. Brett Schaefer, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation, said that the ICC has undertaken two preliminary examinations involving Iraq and Afghanistan -- an early step in the process. But in neither case does action seem imminent. In the case of Iraq, the prosecutor has said that the ICC lacks jurisdiction for several reasons, including that Iraq is not a party to the statute that established the court, and that the U.N. Security Council has not referred the situation to the ICC. Action on Afghanistan, which is an ICC party, is more plausible, and the preliminary examination first made public in 2007 is ongoing. However, Schaefer said, "it is uncertain whether the court will actually proceed to a formal case." But even if the ICC did advance its investigation to a later stage, the most important takeaway is that neither Bush nor Cheney would be personally at risk. While 122 nations have become members, the United States has not -- and that makes a big difference in cases such as this. While the court may prosecute individuals from ICC-state parties, such as the United Kingdom, for alleged crimes even in places like Iraq where it does not have jurisdiction, Schaefer said, the fact that the United States is not a party -- at least for now -- means "this is not an issue for President Bush or Vice President Cheney." Obstacles to prosecution It’s conceivable that national courts could take action instead, experts say. But while some non-governmental human-rights groups have pushed for criminal prosecutions, the experts we checked with were not aware of any pending, and public, warrants for Bush or Cheney. An obstacle to a national-court prosecution of Bush or Cheney is that "most states don't have laws allowing for prosecution based on universal jurisdiction -- the international law principle that allows any state to try certain serious crimes, no matter where committed," said Steven R. Ratner, a University of Michigan law professor. "And some that do have cut them back in recent years due to fears of a flood of litigation or foreign-policy concerns." A state that did seek to prosecute Bush or Cheney would face both the practical difficulty of carrying it out as well as an expected diplomatic backlash from the United States. "No state has any interest in arresting a former U.S. president or vice president," Ratner said. "Say goodbye to good relations with the U.S.!" This reality, he said, makes the likelihood of a prosecution of Bush or Cheney "highly doubtful." Where Bush and Cheney have traveled outside the United States We couldn’t find any examples of Bush or Cheney visiting Europe, but they have traveled to other countries since they left office. Bush visited Haiti as part of an effort by the charitable foundation he co-founded with former President Bill Clinton after a devastating earthquake in the Caribbean nation. And Bush also joined Clinton at a regional economic summit held in the Canadian province of British Columbia. Cheney, meanwhile, has gone to British Columbia to promote his book, In My Time: A Personal and Political Memoir. But these trips weren’t without turbulence. Typically, protesters have followed both Bush and Cheney at such events. At his book event, Cheney faced a crowd of 200 people chanting and holding signs that said, "Cheney War Criminal" and "Torturer," according to the Canadian television network CBC. The incident was serious enough for police to don riot gear, and it led to one arrest. As for Bush’s trip to the regional summit in Canada, it attracted a similar-sized crowd but was somewhat more peaceful, according to the CBC. Meanwhile, both Bush and Cheney have canceled speaking engagements in Toronto, though their camps did not cite concerns about arrest warrants as the reason. Cheney cited "personal safety" concerns, while Bush chalked it up to a "scheduling change." Our ruling The meme on social media said that Bush and Cheney are "unable to visit Europe due to outstanding warrants." The claim that there are "outstanding warrants" is flat wrong. And while it’s theoretically possible for a national court to issue an arrest warrant against either man, as was done with Pinochet, there is no sign of that happening. We rate the claim False.

pomt-00134	Says Beto O’Rourke "voted to shield MS-13 gang members from deportation."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2018/oct/25/donald-trump/mostly-false-donald-trump-claim-beto-orourke-voted/	President Donald Trump, stirring Texas supporters, charged Democratic U.S. Senate nominee Beto O’Rourke with voting to shield violent gang members from deportation. Trump, urging voters at an Oct. 22, 2018, Houston rally to re-elect his onetime nemesis, Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, said that O’Rourke, the third-term congressman from El Paso who opposes Trump’s avowed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, "even voted to shield MS-13 gang members from deportation." Trump went on: "He doesn’t want to deport them. He says they’re people, they’re people. They carve you up with a knife but they’re people." So, did O’Rourke vote to shield MS-13 gang members from deportation? We didn’t get a White House reply to our request for Trump’s factual backup. But we identified a 2017 House vote on a proposal related to deporting or not admitting criminal gang members to the United States. O’Rourke and an outside expert subsequently told us the Texan’s vote didn’t shield MS-13 members from deportation, which happens regularly under current law. What’s MS-13? It’s a misconception that MS-13 members hail entirely from abroad in that the violent group started in Los Angeles where many refugees from civil strife in El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua fled in the 1980s. In 2017, the Justice Department said there are an estimated 10,000 MS-13 gang members operating in at least 40 states. Members are concentrated in Los Angeles, Long Island in New York and the region outside Washington, D.C., the New York Times reported in March 2018. The Times, citing federal authorities, said the gang’s 30,000 other members live in Central America or Mexico. MS-13 stands for Mara Salvatrucha, which comes from the words "mara," a Spanish term for gang, "salva," for El Salvador, and "trucha," slang for cunning. The "13" refers to the thirteenth letter of the alphabet, or "M," which denotes the gang’s allegiance to the Mexican Mafia, a prison gang, DOJ said. In 2012, MS-13 became the first street gang to be designated by the government as a transnational criminal organization when President Barack Obama did so. Our October 2018 search of the Immigration and Customs Enforcement website yielded more than 270 web pages detailing actions against MS-13 members----including arrests, criminal convictions and removals. A 2017 House vote Another web search led us to see that the House in September 2017 voted mostly along party lines to send the Senate the Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act. As of October 2018, it still hadn’t received Senate consideration. In a news story at the time, The Washington Post said that the proposal "would allow officials to take action against suspected gang members, regardless of whether they've been convicted of a crime." Advocates said the move would enhance public safety. Before the vote, the White House issued a statement saying advisers would urge Trump to sign the measure into law should the House version reach his desk. That statement credited the proposal with giving "law enforcement needed tools to help ensure that criminal alien gang members are deported quickly and never again allowed to enter the United States." Separately, the American Civil Liberties Union said the measure "would promote racial profiling, erode due process and unintentionally affect others, such as clergy who try to help gang members," the Post story said. Immigrant advocates maintained "it would give law enforcement wide latitude in designating groups of people as gangs and seeking to deport, detain or block their asylum before a crime has been committed," the story said. By our read, the legislation would enable federal officials to designate criminal gangs, defined as five members or more bent on criminal activity, and permit a consular or law enforcement official not to admit a person to the U.S. if the official knows or has reason to believe the individual is or has been in a criminal gang--with no requirement that the individual have criminal convictions. Also, the legislation permits immigration authorities to start deportation proceedings against anyone in the U.S. believed to be or have been in a criminal gang. O’Rourke’s nay Next, we confirmed from a roll call vote that O’Rourke was among 174 Democrats to vote against the measure, which won House approval by 233-175. Rep. Justin Amash of Michigan was the sole Republican to vote "no." In floor debate, a co-sponsor of the proposal, Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, said that without the legislation, MS-13 members could legally stay in the U.S. unless they were convicted of deportable offenses, according to a transcript in the Congressional Record. If the legislation became law, Labrador told members, ICE would newly "be permitted to place alien gang members into removal proceedings on the grounds of being criminal gang members" as determined by specifications in the measure of crimes considered to be gang related, Labrador said. Labrador also said: "I have heard some uneasiness that ICE will use these provisions to charge any alien they encounter with gang activity. Our bill does not allow that." Under the measure, he said, ICE would have the burden of proof when charging an immigrant with a deportable offense. "The government must convince an immigration judge of its case," Labrador said. Democratic members countered that the proposal would enable the Department of Homeland Security to deny admission to or deport any immigrant, including one who has no criminal history or gang affiliation, so long as DHS believes the person is associated with such a group. Under the proposal, Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., said, there "is no need for conviction or even an arrest. All DHS needs is a belief that the individual has assisted any group of five or more people that DHS believes has committed one of these long list of offenses," Lofgren said. Zofgren also suggested the legislation could lead to a religious group that aids immigrants facing charges. "This isn't just theoretical," Lofgren said, going on: "During the 1980s, members of the faith community were repeatedly criminally prosecuted for providing transportation to undocumented immigrants." There was a related vote. By 220-184, members rejected a Democrat’s motion to have the proposal amended to bar the deportation of any person "for action taken on behalf of a religious organization whose primary purpose is the provision of humanitarian assistance or aid." O’Rourke voted in favor of the motion. O’Rourke campaign disputes characterization By email, Chris Evans of O’Rourke’s campaign responded to our inquiry about Trump’s claim by disputing the president’s characterization of O’Rourke. Existing law, Evans said, "makes immigrants who commit crimes related to gang activity deportable." O’Rourke, Evans wrote, "believes in ensuring MS-13 members are held responsible for their crimes under our justice system and he believes in enforcing our current immigration law." We also heard back from David Bier, an immigration policy analyst for the libertarian-rooted Cato Institute. Bier, a former staff adviser to Labrador, called Trump’s claim about O’Rourke incorrect. Calling the legislation a "political effort," Bier told us by phone that significantly, neither the White House nor other supporters of the measure had identified examples of MS-13 members the government couldn’t deport without the House-approved changes in law. "If there were any examples," Bier said, "they’d be displaying them." Does existing law shield gang members? Stepping away from the legislation, we wondered whether existing law shields MS-13 gang members from deportation. Early this year, PolitiFact looked into whether MS-13 members detained in the U.S. were being let go by authorities. To the contrary, Steve Yale-Loehr, who teaches at Cornell Law School, responded that the government by law must detain individuals who have committed certain crimes while going through deportation proceedings. He pointed out provisions in federal code requiring the government to take into custody any individual convicted of a range of offenses including those involving firearms, illegal drugs or aggravated assault. Yet individuals can seek asylum if they have suffered persecution or fear they will suffer persecution due to race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion. Yale-Loehr said: "If an individual caught along the border claims asylum, he or she will have their claim reviewed by an asylum officer with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. If they can show they have a credible fear, the individual goes through the immigration court process. If they don’t have a credible fear, or if an immigration judge denies their asylum claim," they will be deported, Yale-Loehr said. But immigration experts said that it’s difficult for gang members to receive asylum. Fatma E. Marouf, a professor of law and director of the Immigrant Rights Clinic at Texas A&M University School of Law, said: "If the gang member persecuted others or committed a serious crime in the United States or his country of origin, he would likely be barred from asylum." If a gang member or criminal can somehow make a substantive case that their asylum argument should be heard, the immigrant would be allowed to stay in the United States until their hearing. They would typically post a bond to do so. Critics call this wrinkle "catch and release." Yale-Loehr said Border Patrol agents and ICE officials can release people in this way, under what is known as prosecutorial discretion. In addition, immigration judges can allow immigrants in deportation proceedings to be released after they pay a bond, if they meet certain conditions. "But that is happening less and less often under the current administration, and the government is certainly not required to release people who may be deportable, Yale-Loehr said in February 2018. He cited a Department of Homeland Security memo that drastically cut back on the practice in February 2017, shortly after Trump was inaugurated. Our ruling Trump said O’Rourke "voted to shield MS-13 gang members from deportation." We see an element of truth to this claim because O’Rourke did not vote for a Trump-backed measure pitched as easing deportations of suspected criminal gang members. But we spotted no evidence that O’Rourke’s "no" was a vote to shield violent gang members from deportation. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-15065	Tens of thousands of Atlanta households pay more than 30 percent of their income towards rent.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/sep/25/matthew-charles-cardinale/claim-about-atlantas-affordable-housing-hits-mark/	For somewhere between $1,400 and $4,000 a month, you can rent in the luxury apartment complex Inman Quarter in Atlanta’s Old Fourth Ward. But you’ll also need to earn at least $48,000 – and up to $160,000 – a year to afford skyline views without spending more than 30 percent of your income on a (fancy) roof over your head. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and Census Bureau both consider those who pay more than that to be "cost burdened," since they may have difficulty paying for other necessities such as food and medical care. Housing advocates, including Atlanta Progressive News CEO Matthew Charles Cardinale, worry that those people are getting lost in the newly energized Atlanta housing market. "Tens of thousands of Atlanta households are cost-burdened, meaning they pay more than 30 percent of their income towards rent," Cardinale recently wrote in the Saporta Report. "This includes more than 25,000 cost-burdened renter households subsisting on $20,000 or less per year," he continued. In a market of gleaming new developments targeting high-end renters, do that many people needed less pricey options? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check. Housing in Atlanta We reached out to Cardinale to ask his source, and he pointed us to a 2015 update of last year’s Atlanta’s housing strategy report. A chart on page 10 of the report, shows about 27,000 households that make $20,000 or less and another 13,000 households with incomes between $20,000 and $35,000 spent more than 30 percent of their income on housing in 2012. Cardinale said that shows the city’s own data back up his proposal, to require new developments list how much of their complexes will be at or below 30 percent of the city’s median income, as well as how many will fall between 30 and 50 percent, between 50 and 80 percent and more than 80 percent. "It would basically be an affordable housing scorecard, not requiring projects to include affordable housing but to provide information on what’s being done," Cardinale said. The recommendation has been pending in a City Council committee since November. Yet Mayor Kasim Reed has, under the housing strategy, pledged to cut by 10 percent the number of residents who are cost burdened on rent by 2020, according to an opinion piece this summer by his deputy planning commissioner. The Census estimates The city may have its work cut out for it on that front. To verify the strategy report, we looked at the Census data cited in the chart. The 2012 American Community Survey estimates that of 103,219 households in Atlanta in 2012, 50,509 of them spent 30 percent or more of their income on housing. That’s 49 percent of city households – and 10,000 more than plotted in the city’s chart. The survey for 2014, released just last week, isn’t even that rosy. Of 105,999 households now estimated in the city, 52,787 of them paid more than 30 percent of their income on rent in the past 12 months. That’s just a hair under half of households. The only improvement? Those scrambling the most to keep up with rent – households spending more than 50 percent of their income on housing – dipped by 574 households, to 27,100 in 2014. That’s a full percentage drop – but still 26 percent out of city households. How does Atlanta stack up? For context, PolitiFact Georgia tried to find out if one out of every four households spending half of their income for a place to sleep was unusual. Sadly, not really. Renters are on the rise in the 11 most populous American metro areas, Atlanta included. A May report by New York University's Furman Center, which studies real estate and urban policy, and Capital One bank, found each of those cities saw the amount of rental housing grow faster than any increase in owner-occupied homes in 2013. Yet despite that growth, renters everywhere struggled to keep up with increasing rents and shrinking vacancies. Atlanta, for instance, saw the vacancy rate drop from 16 percent to 9.9 percent between 2006 and 2013. Median monthly rents, meanwhile, jumped 8 percent in that period, from $888 to $963. And in Atlanta and the other 10 cities, more than three out of every five low-income renters were severely rent burdened – paying more than half of their income on rent. Our ruling A left-leaning housing advocate championed a scorecard of new housing development in Atlanta by claiming that "tens of thousands" of households in the city paid more than 30 percent of their income on rent. They do, whether looking at the city’s housing strategy plan or the 2012 U.S. Census estimates that shaped the report. By 2014, those estimates had grown even worse. And, Matthew Charles Cardinale would have been on target with an even more dramatic claim: More than a quarter of Atlanta households spent more than half of their incomes on housing. Atlanta faces the same challenges as other large cities in serving a growing rental population. To do so will require the right data. And Cardinale hits the mark with his claim about affordable housing in Atlanta. We rate his claim True.	None	Matthew Charles Cardinale	None	None	None	2015-09-25T00:00:00	2015-09-13	['None']
pomt-03425	"If you are born poor in America, we rank ninth or tenth in our citizens’ ability to climb up through that ladder and get themselves into the middle class."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/jun/26/tim-ryan/rep-tim-ryan-says-united-states-ranks-behind-other/	After votes conclude for the day, members of Congress can book time at the U.S. House of Representatives’ podium to deliver floor speeches on their favorite topics. That’s what Youngstown-area Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan did earlier this month when he and California Democratic Rep. John Garamendi held forth on the "The American Dream," and obstacles the poor face in their efforts to improve their situation. "If you are born poor in America, we rank about ninth or tenth in our citizens’ ability to climb up through that ladder and get themselves into the middle class," Ryan told Garamendi, arguing that the United States had moved away from a philosophy it had until the mid 1980s when it made educational investments that facilitated people’s economic rise. Because the ability to rise from rags to riches is a key facet of the American Dream, we asked Ryan’s office where he got his sobering statistic about America’s lack of social mobility. Ryan spokesman Pat Lowry said it came from a March 2010 article in the British newspaper, The Guardian, which was reporting on a study produced by a Paris-based coalition of 34 countries, including the United States. The study performed by the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development found it is easier to climb the social ladder in other developed countries than it is in the United States, Italy and Britain. In that study, Denmark, Australia, Norway, Finland, Canada, Sweden, Germany, Spain and France all scored ahead of the United States in children’s ability to exceed their parents’ income. The study found that in the United States, Italy and the United Kingdom, at least 40 percent of the economic advantage that high-earning fathers have over low-earning fathers is transmitted to their sons. In countries with more social mobility, just 20 percent of that advantage carries into the next generation. "Policies that facilitate access to education of individuals from disadvantaged family backgrounds promote intergenerational wage mobility, and are also likely to be good for economic growth," the study said. Its findings echo similar research conducted in the United States. A 2008 report on economic mobility produced by the Pew Charitable Trusts and Brookings Institution found that while "Americans have an optimistic faith in the ability of individuals to get ahead within a lifetime or from one generation to the next, there is growing evidence of less intergenerational economic mobility in the United States than in many other rich, industrialized countries." It noted yet another study that showed U.S. social mobility lags behind Canada and several other northern European countries, but observed that other research has found U.S. social mobility exceeds that of developing countries such as Ecuador, Peru and Brazil. The research on developing countries equated America’s level of social mobility with that of Pakistan and Nepal, though it cautioned that statistics for developing countries are harder to come by because they lack income surveys that span three or more decades, so researchers must estimate how much money participants’ parents made. During the 2012 election cycle, Republicans including presidential candidate Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan of Wisconsin observed that mobility in the U.S. lags behind other countries. A 2012 New York Times article on the subject cited some of the factors that hinder social mobility in the U.S., like pay tilted toward educated workers and the magnitude of the gaps between the rich and middle class. It notes the U.S. "maintains a thinner safety net than other rich countries," and that "poor Americans are more likely than foreign peers to grow up with single mothers. "That places them at an elevated risk of experiencing poverty and related problems, a point frequently made by Mr. Santorum," the article says. "The United States also has uniquely high incarceration rates, and a longer history of racial stratification than its peers.". While it flies in the face of the notion that anyone can rise from the bottom to the top in the United States, a number of studies uphold Ryan’s contention that America’s social mobility lags behind that of many other countries. America’s exact ranking in those studies depends on which countries are surveyed, but the research Ryan alluded to did find the U.S. to be 10th among the 12 examined countries. However, it is important to clarify that those 12 were all developed countries, and other research has found that U.S. social mobility exceeds that of developing countries. Ryan did not qualify his statement to reflect that. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Tim Ryan	None	None	None	2013-06-26T06:00:00	2013-06-11	['United_States']
pomt-14707	"The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked."	false	/punditfact/statements/2016/jan/05/laura-ingraham/laura-ingraham-say-claim-90-support-gun-background/	Gun control advocates often cite the statistic that 90 percent of Americans support expanding background checks for gun purchases. President Barack Obama just did it in his Jan. 1, 2016, weekly address. But conservative radio talk show host Laura Ingraham says that statistic is not accurate. "The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked," Ingraham said on Fox News Sunday on Jan. 3. "Lots of the myths about gun ownership are perpetrated by people who never much liked the Second Amendment in the first place and who have a vested interest in amassing more power in Washington, D.C." PolitiFact has rated this 90 percent statistic True as recently as October. So we decided to try and figure out what Ingraham was talking about when she said this is a myth that has been debunked. Go to the polls Under current law, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but the checks are not required for gun sales by private sellers. National polls conducted in 2015 consistently show that around 90 percent of Americans support some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases. Here are a few examples: Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Dec. 16-20: "Would you support or oppose a law requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows or online?" Support: 89 percent. Oppose: 9 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent. CBS/New York Times poll, conducted Oct. 21-25: "Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers?" Favor: 92 percent. Oppose: 7 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent. Gallup poll, conducted Oct. 7-11: "Would you favor or oppose a law which would require universal background checks for all gun purchases in the U.S. using a centralized database across all 50 states?" Favor: 86 percent. Oppose: 12 percent. Unsure: 2 percent. Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Sept. 17-21: "Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?" Support: 93 percent. Oppose: 6 percent. Unsure/No answer: 1 percent. Pew Research Center poll, conducted July 14-20: Do you favor or oppose "making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks"? Favor: 85 percent. Oppose: 13 percent. Unsure/Refused: 2 percent. Pew found that support for background checks spans all partisan and demographic groups, and it is also favored by a majority of households that own guns and those that do not. So are all of these polls wrong? We reached out to Ingraham’s producers and didn’t hear back. We couldn’t find any sort of definitive debunking of this stat, but we did find that some gun rights advocates have taken issue with this statistic for reasons such as the survey questions referring to the general idea of background checks rather than specific legislation. For example, in 2013, polls found that 90 percent of Americans supported expanded background checks. However, when Congress failed to pass a popular bill that would have increased background checks, 47 percent were disappointed or angry that it failed, while some 39 percent were relieved or very happy, according to a Washington Post/Pew Research Center poll. Some gun rights activists took this as proof that the 90 percent figure was phooey. This highlights an odd discrepancy: While people overwhelmingly support specific gun policy ideas, like universal background checks and banning suspected terrorists from buying guns, the support is not as robust when it comes to actually expanding gun control. The same October CBS/New York Times poll that found 92 percent support for expanded background checks also shows 46 percent of Americans think laws covering gun sales should be either made less strict or stay the same. Just 51 percent said the laws should be made more strict. "People don't seem to like the idea of ‘gun control,’ but they still want the government to do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill," said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles and author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America. Our ruling Ingraham said, "The 90 percent statistic of supporting background checks, that's been debunked." Numerous respected polls from 2015 show around 90 percent support for some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases. While there are some questions as to what inferences can be made from these findings — such as whether that 90-percent support translates into support for specific legislation — there hasn’t been a definitive debunking of the statistic. We rate Ingraham’s claim False.	None	Laura Ingraham	None	None	None	2016-01-05T11:23:43	2016-01-03	['None']
pomt-11945	"Jason Aldean gig canceled after he sells out to liberals on ‘SNL’."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/oct/10/asamericanasapplepieorg/fake-news-site-says-jason-aldean-gave-anti-gun-scr/	A fake news story that said country singer Jason Aldean had a concert canceled after making an anti-gun statement following his Saturday Night Live performance is the work of a website that appears to be part of a troll network. "Jason Aldean gig canceled after he sells out to liberals on SNL," read the Oct. 8, 2017, headline on AsAmericanAsApplePie.org. Facebook users flagged the content as possibly being fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news stories. At least part of the story showed up in a couple of other posts also questioned by Facebook users. Aldean was performing onstage at a Las Vegas country music festival on Oct. 1 when a gunman opened fire on the crowd from a hotel room, killing 58 and injuring 489 more. He appeared for a musical performance on Saturday Night Live on Oct. 7, singing I Won’t Back Down, which also served as a tribute to Tom Petty, who died Oct. 2. The AsAmericanAsApplePie.org post, however, mixed some real details with some entirely fictional ones. It said Aldean addressed the audience before the song to say "people should not own more than one gun," and blamed the National Rifle Association for the massacre. Aldean did not do that. It then gives a real quote from Aldean, who said about shooting victims, "So I want to say to them, ‘We hurt for you, and we hurt with you.’ But you can be sure that we’re going to walk through these tough times together, every step of the way. Because when America is at its best, our bond, and our spirit, it’s unbreakable." You can watch the real statement and performance here: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The post snaps back into fake events by saying Aldean "took a knee" as the band played part of the national anthem, and told people "not to cave to the NRA’s terroristic agenda" and "always stand up to gun violence and the policies that enable it." None of those things happened, but the article said it spurred a #BoycottJasonAldean hashtag and led to the cancellation of Aldean’s concert in Birmingham, Ala. Aldean’s Birmingham show was Aug. 10. There is a #BoycottJasonAldean hashtag, but it’s difficult to tell if it stems from this fake story, which has fooled many people on Twitter, of Ultimate Fighting Championship president Dana White’s condemnation of Aldean for choosing to perform on SNL over UFC 216 in Las Vegas the same night. Aldean did cancel three California shows after the shooting "out of respect for the victims, their families and our fans," but returned to Las Vegas on Oct. 8 to visit with shooting survivors. AsAmericanAsApplePie.org has all the hallmarks of a series of fake websites associated with Christopher Blair, a self-described liberal troll who creates fictional stories to try to fool conservative readers.

pomt-08998	Republicans extended unemployment insurance under President Bush "when he asked to extend unemployment insurance."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/13/david-axelrod/republicans-supported-unemployment-under-bush/	Congress has been unable to agree how to boost the economy, creating headaches for President Obama and his Democratic Party. Obama adviser David Axelrod took questions on the issue from Jake Tapper on ABC News' This Week. "How can the president create jobs without there being any willingness on Capitol Hill to spend money to do so?" Tapper asked. Axelrod agreed there is "not a great appetite" for additional spending in Congress. "But I do think there are some things we still can accomplish. I do think that we can get additional tax relief for small businesses. That's what we want to do, additional lending for small businesses. They're an engine of economic growth. We're hoping we can persuade enough people on the other side of the aisle to put politics aside and join us on that. (And) unemployment insurance, we ought to extend unemployment insurance. People are suffering," Axelrod said. "You can't get the votes, though," Tapper interjected. "Well, we'll see. We'll see," Axelrod said. "But at a time when there's one job vacancy for five unemployed workers looking for jobs, clearly we have a responsibility to do it. The Republicans met that responsibility each time under President Bush, when he asked to extend unemployment insurance. They ought to do it now. Let's not play politics with this issue." We were intrigued by Axelrod's statement that Republicans helped President George W. Bush pass extensions for unemployment insurance. So we decided to fact-check it. A little background on unemployment insurance: When workers lose full-time work through no fault of their own, they are usually eligible for unemployment benefits, small weekly payments intended to partially make up for lost wages. Employers pay taxes to fund the program, and states administer it based on federal guidelines. How much a person gets and how long benefits are paid varies by state. Usually, the benefits last about six months. In tough times, though, Congress often extends benefits, because of the difficulty of finding new jobs when unemployment is very high, as it has been since 2008, when the economy floundered. As a result, Congress has been arguing this summer about extending benefits again after extending them five times since Obama took office in 2009. Recent extensions have been structured so that workers in states where unemployment is higher receive additional weeks of benefits. In the states where unemployment is highest, some unemployed workers have been paid benefits for close to two years. But the extensions have run out for some workers, and Congress has been unable to agree on whether to extend them again. That's the context in which Axelrod commented that Republicans extended unemployment for Bush "when he asked." We found several instances of President Bush signing into law unemployment insurance extensions. Some extensions were highly targeted, such as aid to airline workers after 9/11 and to victims of Hurricane Katrina. But Bush signed two general extensions in 2003 for 13 weeks each, with significant Republican support. He also signed extensions in 2008 with Republican support. We were unable to find any instances when Bush asked for an extension of unemployment benefits and Congress refused him. None of the experts we consulted could recall such a case. So Axelrod was technically right that Bush appears to have gotten Congress to extend unemployment insurance "when he asked." But in reviewing news articles on unemployment during the Bush administration, we noticed that, even when they supported extending benefits, Bush and Congressional Republicans were generally more skeptical than Democrats were. We noted that Republicans said then the same thing that some conservatives say now, which is that unemployment payments are a disincentive in some cases to taking a new job. Economists have noted this effect in studies, but they say that it is more significant during normal economic times. Axelrod's comment implies that Republicans were willing to extend unemployment insurance under Bush but are balking now that Obama is president. But we find the employment landscapes under Bush and Obama so different as to defy comparison. Extensions under Bush usually were for fairly short periods of time, such as two 13-week extensions in 2003. Also, some Republicans want the current extension combined with other spending cuts, to prevent the deficit from getting bigger. Projected deficits now are much larger than they were under Bush. Finally, it's worth noting that some reports indicate the unemployment legislation has failed to gain Republican support because Democrats have combined it with other measures. While Axelrod is right that Republicans supported Bush's proposals to extend unemployment benefits, it's important to note that there are differences between then and now. So, we rate his statement Mostly True.	None	David Axelrod	None	None	None	2010-07-13T18:13:57	2010-07-11	['George_W._Bush', 'Republican_Party_(United_States)']

pomt-08239	If the state turns down money for high-speed rail, it will "kill nearly 10,000 permanent Wisconsin jobs."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2010/nov/15/sierra-club/sierra-club-says-killing-high-speed-rail-project-w/	The debate over the proposed high-speed rail line from Milwaukee to Madison percolated during the campaign for governor. It flared up on the eve of the election, and has raged since Republican Scott Walker was elected Nov. 2, 2010. Walker wants the project stopped, even if it means rejecting $810 million in already-approved federal money. After state officials signed contracts in a pre-election push to ensure the project moves forward, outgoing Gov. Jim Doyle has backed off -- but argues ending the project will cost taxpayers $100 million. Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, who lost to Walker, has said the city will consider legal options if the train is killed. Virtually everyone has entered the fight, often wielding statistics to argue their point. That includes the Sierra Club’s Wisconsin chapter. Weapon of choice: Jobs. In a news release and a petition, the Sierra Club argues if the state turns down money for high speed rail, it will "kill nearly 10,000 permanent Wisconsin jobs." If PolitiFact had sound effects, we’d add a loud whistle here. As in, that’s a lot of jobs. And as in, let’s have a timeout and get to the bottom of this. Many different job-related statistics have been bandied about in the debate. The state Department of Transportation estimates there are the 13,719 jobs involved in construction, engineering, design and train manufacturing tied to the project. On the campaign trail, Walker argued the project would create only 55 permanent jobs, declaring in an open letter to President Barack Obama on his notrain.com web site: "That’s $14.5 million per job, not including any hidden costs!" There, Walker is talking about jobs on the train line itself -- conductors, engineers, ticket-takers and the like. In making the claim, he is purposely choosing the smallest possible number to make his point. But what of the nearly 10,000 permanent jobs claimed by the Sierra Club and others, some of whom are now citing the Sierra Club as the source of the number? These are jobs not tied directly to the project and as such are hardest to measure hardest to quantify. Yet the group offers a very specific number: 9,572. The number comes from a 2006 economicanalysis prepared for Amtrak and nine states, including Wisconsin, a group called the Midwest Regional Rail Initiative. The study, prepared by Transportation & Economics Management Systems, became part of the state’s application for the train funding. The study says: "The development of the system integrates so many communities, and provides such a wide reaching impact that it will generate on its own a 0.1 percent growth to the region’s economy." The sweeping conclusion: "It will support existing manufacturing and service industries and will foster the growth of new small businesses across the Midwest because of the improved access between communities. It will encourage large businesses to distribute their operations more widely across the Midwest and reap the benefit of providing more efficient ‘back shop’ operations in the highly accessible smaller communities." OK, but how do you quantify all that? If you dig into the study, you find it is based on numerous assumptions and applies multipliers and other formulas to come up with a bottom line: Expanded train service would create 58,000 jobs in the nine states, boost property values by $5 billion and increase urban household income by $1 billion. Let’s look at some of the factors and underlying assumptions, with an eye toward how the Sierra Club and others are using them when they claim 10,000 permanent jobs are at stake with the Milwaukee to Madison line. Size of the system The numbers are based on the prospect of a fully-built system throughout the Midwest. That is, it’s not just high-speed rail from Milwaukee to Madison, but Chicago all the way to Minneapolis. And Chicago to St. Louis. And ultimately connections to Omaha, Kansas City, Indianapolis, Detroit, Cleveland and more. It even includes a spur to Green Bay, with proposed stations in Menomonee Falls, Fond du Lac, Neenah and Appleton. That piece alone accounts for 3,200 jobs in the study, some of which overlap with the Milwaukee jobs. But the federal funds allocated so far only cover some pieces of the plan. And there is no certainty the full system will ever be built -- in Ohio, Governor-elect John Kasich has vowed to block the Cleveland to Cincinnati to Columbus piece. So, even if Walker were to have a change of heart, the system may be smaller and have fewer connections, which could mean its jobs impact is smaller as well. Jobs gained, jobs lost The study suggests that new jobs and opportunities will develop around the new route, as more people take advantage of the high-speed connections. However, as people board the train they are taken off the highways and don’t as often take to the skies. But the study counts only the new jobs, not any lost ones. "How many airline pilots or contractors renovating terminals will not be needed?" said Steven E. Polzin, of the Center for Urban Transportation Research at the University of South Florida, an expert on rail proposals, whose group has been criticized for favoring cars and roads. "How many auto workers, gas station attendants, road contractors, etc." So, part of the equation is missing. Stations as economic hubs The study assumes that stations will become economic hubs, prompting other businesses to create jobs nearby. But the stations envisioned are no sure thing. For instance, the initial Madison station was to be near the airport -- not ideal for someone headed to the Capitol. Now it’ll be in the city center, but going into the city slows down a traveler from Milwaukee to Minneapolis. Leaders of some cities, including Brookfield and Wauwatosa, have said they don’t even want a proposed station. So, more uncertainty. Other travel options If the price of gas remains relatively low, there will be less incentive for travelers to get out of their cars and board the train. Indeed, cars may be able to make the trip faster -- assuming there’s no traffic congestion. Initial train speeds are planned to be 79 miles an hour, not including stops; the train would run at higher speeds later. Whats more, Mitchell International Airport is enjoying an air carrier -- and airfare -- war, which has helped it attract more passengers than ever. There is no telling how long that will last, but low air fares could have an impact on who grabs the train. Polzin, who reviewed the study at the request of PolitiFact Wisconsin, said it appeared to be professionally done, using methods that are generally accepted. He noted that such studies are usually done to build support for a project "and look exclusively at the benefits of the specific option, not the comparative benefits of other options or directing those resources to others purposes." Indeed, the state Department of Transportation has not highlighted the 10,000 permanent jobs figure, focusing instead on construction-related jobs for the Milwaukee-to-Madison line. "That’s work that we did ourselves," said Cari Anne Renlund, executive assistant for the state DOT. "We need to talk about what we know is real." We’ll leave Projection Land and return to reality as well. The Sierra Club’s Wisconsin chapter and others say killing the high-speed train will kill jobs, specifically 9,572 permanent ones. Their number is taken from a professional analysis, but that analysis is based on a host of assumptions -- including that an entire Midwest network is built -- many of which could change. And while the Sierra Club suggests the jobs are an immediate loss, the report itself puts them years into the future. The Truth-O-Meter isn’t a crystal ball. But it’s got a present-day rating that fits this claim: Barely True. (Note: Paragraph three of this item was changed on Nov. 16, 2010 to more closely reflect what Mayor Barrett has said in regard to the train and the city's options.) Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-00838	Creflo Dollar needed a $65 million Gulfstream G650 to carry thousands of pounds of food and other supplies -- as well as the Word of God -- worldwide.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2015/mar/23/juda-engelmayer/creflo-dollars-need-65-million-jet-never-gets-grou/	Pastor Creflo Dollar’s plan to travel the world in the fastest and most luxurious business jet ever built never got off the ground. He and other leaders at World Changers Church International in College Park launched Project G650 with the goal of raising nearly $65 million for the airplane, largely from $300-plus donations from 200,000 of the faithful. But negative public reaction to Dollar’s fundraising plea was so swift that it was halted within days of its launch. A promotional video featuring Dollar was quickly pulled down, but lives via YouTube. Some of the harshest words came from the faith community, including contemporary gospel’s Kirk Franklin who said: "When I camouflage my ‘greeds’ to look like ‘needs,’ that’s a shortage of character." Others asked: Why couldn’t pastor and evangelist Dollar conduct his mission travels as most do, via commercial airline, rather than a Gulfstream G650? We tried to reach Dollar directly but were referred to Juda Engelmayer, senior vice president at 5W Public Relations in New York. He is representing Creflo Dollar Ministries and has been fielding questions about the now-defunct fundraising campaign. In an article that appeared March 13, Engelmayer told The Christian Post that Dollar is now taking commercial flights when he visits churches in New York. But, "it’s not that simple," Engelmayer said, when a ministry team of 10 to 15 people "take thousands of pounds," even 100,000 pounds, "of food and provisions with them when they go around the world." That’s why the Gulfstream G650 is needed, he suggested. "The plane is not so Creflo Dollar can get on by himself and fly." Engelmayer made similar comments to the Associated Press. He said members of the ministry travel much of the year bringing their message, food and supplies to people around the world, and this jet has the fuel efficiency, speed, cargo space and seating the church needed. So is that a reason the ministry wanted donations of $65 million -- to have an airplane with cargo space capable of carrying thousands, possibly 100,00 pounds of food and other supplies? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check the facts. First a little background about the 53-year-old megachurch pastor and evangelist and how he came to say he was praying for a Gulfstream G650. Dollar preaches what is known as the prosperity gospel, a religious doctrine that financial blessing is the will of God for Christians. A native of College Park, he founded the non-denominational World Changers Church International, which boasts 30,000 members, 350 employees, an 81-acre campus and mission work on six continents. Dollar has long been criticized for being a preacher who lives a lavish lifestyle with Rolls Royces, million-dollar homes and jets. The tax exempt status of his ministry -- as well as five others -- was the focus of a U.S. Senate committee’s three-plus year investigation that started in 2007 and was based on public complaints and media reports about large salaries, lavish expenditures. Dollar protested the investigation, which closed with no findings of wrongdoing. Committee investigators said Dollar and the ministry at that time had four airplanes, including the one he wanted to replace with the $65 million Gulfstream. The plane World Changers and Dollar made the case for the new jet -- the Gulfstream G650, which is manufactured in Savannah -- after the church’s longtime Gulfstream G1159A, more commonly known as a G-III, was damaged and taken out of service last last year. They said the jet -- built in 1984 and purchased in 1999 -- traveled four million miles and had two recent mishaps: one where the right engine failed near Hawaii enroute to Australia; and a second in which the airplane’s nose hit a London runway while Dollar’s wife, Taffi, and three of his daughters were aboard. It was after these incidents, Dollar told potential donors on the video, "I knew it was time to begin to believe God for a new airplane." PolitiFact found a National Transportation Safety Board report confirming that older jet received "substantial airframe damage" in the accident that occurred on takeoff from London to Canada. Eight people were on the airplane, including one woman who was taken to the hospital with minor injuries. Aviation expert Richard Aboulafia confirmed that the jet likely would need to be replaced if it had substantial airframe damage. But Aboulafia, vice president of analysis at the Teal Group in Washington, said Dollar -- in proposing that the disabled jet be replaced with a $65 million G650 -- was suggesting going from "the old Honda to the new Rolls Royce." This 18-seat jet, which won aviation’s most prestigious honor, the Collier Trophy in 2014, is considered the best and fastest high-end corporate jet ever built. It’s the mode of travel for world governments, the very top echelon of business executives and likely the richest of the rich, he said. Does it have cargo space for thousands of pounds of food and other supplies? Experts told us the answer is no. Carrying cargo is not this jet’s mission, Aboulafia said. "If they make that claim [that they were buying the Gulfstream G650 to carry cargo], they're expecting the public to be a lot dumber than it is," he said. Cargo space on a business jet is measured in terms of golf bags, Aboulafia said. Steve Cass, vice president for technical marketing and communications with the jet’s manufacturer, Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., confirmed the jet’s space limitations. The G650 has room for 18 passengers and 2,500 pounds of baggage, Cass said. We sent an email to Engelmayer asking him to clarify his "cargo’ comments. He did not respond specifically to that request, but said there is "no campaign for a plane, and the ministry’s work helping people in need and spreading the gospel continues as it always has. "There is nothing more about this to discuss," he said. Rusty Leonard, founder and CEO of MinistryWatch.com said he was ‘disturbed, but not surprised" to learn Dollar was trying to raise money for a $65 million jet. "This is normal behavior for a prosperity gospel preacher who turns the gospel upside down by making it all about your/their own blessings/success rather than about sacrificially blessing others who are in need as Jesus actually taught," he said. His organization does not recommend donating to Dollar’s organizations, Leonard said. Our ruling: Dollar and other leaders in World Changers Church International launched and then dropped a campaign that asked followers to pony up $65 million for a top-of-the-line luxury jet. It’s an airplane generally reserved for world leaders, the top crop of business executives and billionaires. One rationale given for buying the aircraft was that the church needed to be able to carry thousands of pounds of food and other goods -- as well as ministers bringing the Word of God -- to other parts of the world. That argument never got off the runway. It is inaccurate and bordering on ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.	None	Juda Engelmayer	None	None	None	2015-03-23T16:53:55	2015-03-13	['Bible']

pomt-07843	Says 25 percent of Austin's public school buildings are "underutilized."	half-true	/texas/statements/2011/feb/13/janet-mitchell/austin-school-district-task-force-co-chair-says-25/	Speaking to an Austin school task force’s exploration of possible Austin school closures, the volunteer group’s co-chair recently applauded alternative ideas yet warned that campus shutdowns aren’t off the table. Janet Mitchell told the Austin American-Statesman for a Jan. 20 news article: "The reality is that the (Austin school) district has a long-term inefficiency in utilization of school buildings. We have 25 percent of our school buildings that are underutilized. At some point... the community is going to need to decide whether we continue to invest in under-enrolled schools or whether we need to save those dollars to invest in teachers and programs." One in four schools--underused? We left a message for Mitchell, then asked the school district for elaboration. Joe Silva, assistant director for planning services, provided a spreadsheet listing each of the district’s 100-plus schools and whether each one is operating at, under or over the student capacity for which it was designed. Silva said the district has historically considered a campus under-enrolled if its school buildings, not counting portables, are at 75 percent capacity or less. He said the citizens task force set an under-capacity threshold of 85 percent. By the 85-percent threshold, 34 schools -- 31 percent -- are under-enrolled. By the usual district threshold, 22 schools -- 20 percent -- are under-filled. The calculations count both students who live in a school’s attendance zone and those attending via transfers. According to the spreadsheet, the district’s least-crowded school is Pearce Middle School, at 31 percent of capacity. The school normally serves more students; sixth grade wasn’t offered this year. Also least-crowded, according to the spreadsheet, are Becker Elementary, at 40 percent, and Blackshear Elementary, at 41 percent. Silva said that four of Becker’s permanent classrooms serve students shifted temporarily from their home schools to the disciplinary Alternative Center for Elementary Students. Those students aren’t counted in Becker’s enrollment calculation, he said, because the district can place the program at any location. Mary Saul, ACES’ director, told us that up to 36 students in the program occupy permanent classrooms at Becker. Silva initially told us that the district would describe under-enrolled schools as under capacity, not underutilized. That is, he said, many schools not filled with students still use their available space to offer add-on programs for students, families and the community. Also, he said, the district’s central administration places administrative and other staff in space available in the schools. He passed along campus survey results indicating that in 2009-10, 29 of the district’s 2,425 elementary classrooms, 1 percent, were used by principals for "discretionary" purposes, with others used for instruction, student and parental support or by district administrative staff. "Very few campuses are underutilized," Silva said. "But many are under capacity." Bumfuzzled? So were we, until Mitchell told us she’d said "underutilized" after seeing the term in a presentation to the school board. The 15-page presentation, "Facility Master Plan, Board Update," was shown to the board Jan. 10. It includes a page titled "Current Facility Inefficiencies" with this subhead: "Utilization (Permanent Capacity/Enrollment)." The page says the target utilization for the district is 85 percent to 105 percent; 27 schools -- or 25 percent -- are below the bottom target figure and 55 schools are above it. Silva later told us the results differ from the breakdown he gave us because the presentation used 2009-10 enrollment totals and ours had more recent enrollment totals. So, 25 percent or so of the schools are below target capacity for students, but that’s not to say most of their space isn’t being used. In fact, a key consultant on the master plan, Carolyn Staskiewicz, president of Ohio-based DeJong-Richter, told us in an interview that "utilization" -- a term reflecting the students enrolled in a school divided by the school’s capacity--could give the erroneous impression that the schools aren’t fully used. At her suggestion, we poked into the term--underutilization--by contacting the Arizona-based Council on Educational Facility Planners International. Spokeswoman Barbara Worth pointed us to Ron Fanning, chairman of the board of Ohio-based Fanning/Howey Associates, Inc., among the nation’s largest school architecture firms. Fanning agreed with Staskiewicz’s definition of utilization, but said it’s not the only factor to weigh in judging a school’s value: "You really have to look at each individual building" on its merits, "what it can hold, based on the programs being taught at that school... You can’t do a broad-brush statement." Stefan Pharis, who has a child at Barton Hills Elementary, told us the facilities task force has yet to take into account a comprehensive state measure of schools’ efficiency. According to online posts by the state comptroller’s office, the Financial Allocation Study for Texas (FAST), as ordered by the 2009 Legislature, reflects how districts and campuses spend their money -- and how the spending translates into student achievement. "There’s an implication when you say (a school is) underutilized, that somehow they’re wasteful in terms of spending," Pharis said. According to the comptroller, he said, "Some of these schools... excel academically and they do it at a cost-effective price." Our take: Mitchell’s statement accurately echoes the consultant-endorsed characterization of under-enrolled schools as being below their "target" utilization. However, "underutilized" is potentially misleading when applied to schools that may in fact be fully used, and could be targeted for closure as a result of that label. This is critical, missing context. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Janet Mitchell	None	None	None	2011-02-13T06:00:00	2011-01-20	['None']

pomt-06101	Wisconsin’s monthly job reports have a "margin of error" of 75 percent and were "way off" in eight of first 10 months of 2011.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2012/jan/04/rebecca-kleefisch/preliminary-vs-revised-job-change-estimates-wiscon/	No doubt: the primary target of a massive recall campaign in Wisconsin is Republican Gov. Scott Walker. But Democrats and their allies are also collecting hundreds of thousands of signatures on petitions seeking to recall Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch. With the recalls as the backdrop, Kleefisch appeared Dec. 18, 2011 on WISN-TV’s weekly public affairs show in Milwaukee. Host Mike Gousha asked her about job creation, which is not on pace to meet the Walker campaign promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs during his first term. "The last five months, we've lost private-sector jobs in the state of Wisconsin," Gousha said. "If the reforms are working, if the strategy is working, why are we losing jobs when other states are adding them?" Kleefisch began to smile and replied: "Well, first of all, I think we have to acknowledge how those figures come out. Our Department of Labor actually surveys only about 4 percent of job creators throughout the state of Wisconsin. And so we're talking about a margin of error of plus-or-minus 75 percent, like what we saw in October." Kleefisch also claimed the survey "has been way off" in estimating the number of jobs gained or lost in eight of the months since she and Walker took office in January 2011. She was referring to the difference between the preliminary and revised estimates that are done for each month. To be sure, Kleefisch and Walker did not complain the job estimates were unreliable when they showed job gains during the first six months of 2011. And "margin of error" is really a different measure -- how off the numbers are from reality, not from one estimate to the next. But in the interview, Kleefisch defined her terms, so viewers had a good sense of what she meant. So, is Kleefisch right -- do the state’s monthly estimates on jobs gained or lost have a discrepancy of 75 percent? And are the preliminary estimates often "way off" when compared to the revised estimates? How numbers are generated Let’s start with how the government generates its numbers. Each month, the Wisconsin Department of Workforce Development, which is part of the Walker administration, releases employment statistics. The figures, which garner regular news coverage, include the number of jobs added or lost since the previous month. The numbers are not actual job counts. They are estimates produced by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics based on surveys it does of employers throughout the country. The method is statistically valid because the employers surveyed reflect the makeup of each state, said Ken Robertson, the federal bureau’s current employment statistics program manager. A preliminary estimate of the jobs added or lost each month is released after three weeks of surveying, Robertson said. The surveying continues, however, and a revised estimate is reported following the end of the month. The revised figures almost always vary from the preliminary ones because they are based on a larger number of surveys. Kleefisch’s claims Given that Kleefisch’s claims were made in connection with the recall campaign, we asked the the Republican Party of Wisconsin, rather than her staff, for evidence to back her claims. Spokesman Ben Sparks confirmed that Kleefisch was referring in the interview to the preliminary and revised job figures for October 2011. But she misidentified what she was citing. Kleefisch had been asked about private-sector job losses, but the 75 percent variation she cited actually was for private- and public-sector jobs -- that is, all jobs, excluding farm jobs -- according to the Department of Workforce Development figures. The preliminary estimate for October was a loss of 9,700 non-farm jobs in Wisconsin, with the revised estimate showing only 2,400 jobs lost. The revision, as Kleefisch suggested, was a 75 percent reduction. For private-sector jobs lost, the revision was actually higher -- 85 percent. But Kleefisch cited the October 2011 job figures only as an example -- claiming most of the 2011 monthly reports were "way off." How do the preliminary numbers compare to the revised job figures for the first 10 months of 2011? We’ll look at both private-sector jobs and total non-farm jobs, since the question dealt with the first and her answer the second. We calculated the percentages based on figures provided in the state Department of Workforce Development’s Dec. 15, 2011 report, the most recent monthly report available. Here’s an example of one calculation: In January 2011, the revised estimate was that 7,700 total non-farm jobs were added that month; the preliminary estimate was 6,200 jobs added. That’s a difference of 24 percent. Again, the following percentages represent the difference between the revised and preliminary estimates, not the rate at which jobs were lost or added each month. Total non-farm jobs January -- 24 percent February -- 58 percent March -- 15 percent April -- 52 percent May -- 22 percent June -- 16 percent July -- 22 percent August -- 78 percent September -- 11 percent October -- 75 percent So, the 78 percent variation in August was even higher than the 75 percent revision in October that Kleefisch cited. In the other months, the variances were significant, but considerably lower. The average variance over 10 months was 37 percent. (One note for perspective: An estimated 2.75 million people were employed in Wisconsin in October 2011. So, while the final estimate for the month -- 2,400 jobs lost -- was 75 percent smaller than the preliminary estimate, it represents a fraction of the total number of jobs in the state.) Private-sector jobs Here’s how much the preliminary and revised estimates varied on monthly job changes for private-sector jobs only: January -- 12 percent February -- 17 percent March -- 22 percent April -- 20 percent May -- 0 percent June -- 15 percent July -- 14 percent August -- 75 percent September -- 11 percent October -- 85 percent So, once again, the variations were 75 percent or higher in August and October. The average monthly variation was 27 percent, lower than for total non-farm jobs. Robertson of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics said the August and October variations are "larger than we like to see." He said that, on the national level, variations of roughly that magnitude occur about once a year, but he didn’t know about individual states. Our conclusion Kleefisch said the monthly jobs numbers have a "margin of error" of 75 percent and were "way off" in eight of the first 10 months of 2011. In her response to the question, Kleefisch did some mixing of apples and oranges and using the phrase "margin of error" was misleading. But she did define her terms in the interview. The difference between the preliminary and revised numbers was 75 percent or higher in two of the first 10 months of 2011. As for "way off," on average, the variations between preliminary and final estimates in 2011 have been significant: 37 percent for total non-farm jobs and 27 percent for private-sector jobs. Kleefisch’s statement is partially accurate but left out important details -- our definition of Half True.	None	Rebecca Kleefisch	None	None	None	2012-01-04T09:00:00	2011-12-18	['None']
pomt-09692	Claims that Obama said, "For those who oppose our policies, you should just shut up and go away."	false	/florida/statements/2009/nov/11/cw-bill-young/us-rep-claims-obama-told-republicans-shut-and-go-/	Back in his Florida district, U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young decided to toss some red meat at the feet of a group of eager Republicans. Taking the microphone at Monday's meeting of the Pinellas Republican Executive Committee, Young said that President Barack Obama, during a recent campaign rally for a Democratic candidate running in Virginia, told Republicans to "go away." "He said, 'For those who oppose our policies, you should just shut up and go away,' " Young said to an overflowing crowd of Republican Party activists and insiders. "Well, we ain't gonna shut up and we ain't going away." When Young relayed Obama's message, some people in the audience gasped. Could the president have said that? Almost every word the president utters in public is saved, recorded or typed somewhere. That makes separating truth from fiction when it comes to Obama's public statements pretty easy. Let's get one part out of the way: After an exhaustive review of transcripts, newspaper stories and videos of Obama's recent campaign speeches, Obama never said the sentence exactly as Young attributed it to him. We did find the speech Young was referring to, however. It was given by Obama on Aug. 6 on behalf of Virginia gubernatorial candidate Creigh Deeds, and was referenced in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece written by James Taranto a few days later. At one point while writing about the speech, Taranto describes "Obama's petulant demand that his critics shut up and get out of the way." That's pretty much what Young relayed to the crowd of Pinellas Republicans. So we tracked down the transcript from the speech itself. The Virginia speech focused heavily on the economy and the president's support of a $787 billion stimulus package. He joked with the crowd that some Republicans are trying to blame him for the country's economic woes. "You've got folks on the other side of the aisle pointing at the federal budget and somehow trying to put that at our feet. Well, let's look at the history. When I walked in, we had a $1.3 trillion deficit. That was gift-wrapped and waiting for me when I walked in the Oval Office," Obama said. "Without my policies we'd have an even higher deficit going forward. The one exception is the recovery package that we had to do in order to get this economy moving again." Obama continued, "So you can't go out there and charge up the credit card, go on ... shopping sprees on things that didn't grow the economy, hand over the bill to us, and then say, 'Why haven't you paid it off yet?' I got that bill from (Republicans). So we've got some work to do. I don't mind, by the way, being responsible. I expect to be held responsible for these issues because I'm the president. But I don't want the folks who created the mess to do a lot of talking. I want them just to get out of the way so we can clean up the mess. I don't mind cleaning up after them, but don't do a lot of talking. Am I wrong, Virginia?" The last half of the quote, the "get out of the way," was picked up by the local newspapers covering the speech and spread from there. Conservative commentators like Taranto said it showed Obama's unwillingness to work with Republicans on bipartisan solutions. But the broader context shows that Obama's criticisms were more targeted. Specifically, Obama was criticizing Republicans who blame him for the country's economic problems, when -- he says -- many of the problems were created while Republicans were in power. That's a far cry from Young's report of Obama's statement -- "For those who oppose our policies, you should just shut up and go away." Young's statement is much more sweeping and dismissive than anything the president said. We rate Young's claim False.	None	C.W.

pomt-14166	Says an array of statistics show that conditions in some parts of Baltimore rival that of "the West Bank in Palestine," "North Korea," and "distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China and South Africa."	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/apr/28/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-says-conditions-baltimore-no-better/	Residents of some Baltimore neighborhoods are no better off than people living in impoverished North Korea and the violent West Bank, Bernie Sanders said during a campaign rally in Maryland ahead of that state’s primary. "Poverty in Baltimore, and around this country — poverty is a death sentence," Sanders said April 24. He then laid out some rather unflattering and harsh comparisons: "Fifteen neighborhoods in Baltimore have lower life expectancies than North Korea. Two of them have a higher infant mortality rate than the West Bank in Palestine. Baltimore teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 face poorer health conditions and a worse economic outlook than those in distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China and South Africa. We are talking about the United States of America in the year 2016 — a country in which the top 1/10th of 1 percent now owns almost as much wealth as the bottom 90 percent." While it would be wrong to take Sanders’ claim to mean that conditions overall are worse than Baltimore, we found that his specific comparisons are largely accurate. "The comparisons fairly make the point that there are some parts of this rich country where conditions resemble those in much poorer countries," said Alan Berube, an expert on urban poverty at the Brookings Institution. "This isn't isolated to Baltimore; there are neighborhoods in nearly every big U.S. city and metropolitan area, and many rural communities, that perform just as poorly on these outcomes." Let’s take Sanders’ claims one by one. Life expectancy in North Korea The Sanders campaign referred us to a Washington Post article noting that 14 Baltimore neighborhoods had shorter life expectancies than North Korea in 2013. (The article originally said 15 but was corrected.) His number is slightly outdated. In 2014, the latest year where there’s data on both places, the average life expectancy in North Korea was 69.81 years, according to the CIA World Factbook. That placed the impoverished dictatorship at No. 155 in longest lifespans out of 224 countries. The United States overall ranked at No. 42 with 79.56 years. Residents in 12 of Baltimore's 56 neighborhoods lived shorter lives, according to data from the Baltimore City Health Department provided to the Baltimore Neighborhood Indicators Alliance. That’s not 15, but it’s close. (For context, just five Baltimore neighborhoods have life expectancies higher than the U.S. national average, and four of them are relatively affluent and white.) Here’s a map from the University of Maryland’s Capital News Service that compares the life expectancies of Baltimore neighborhoods in 2013 to other places in the world: An important caveat: The city of Baltimore has a total population around 600,000 people while North Korea has a population 40 times that. That means fewer events in Baltimore neighborhood could swing the overall life expectancy of a neighborhood up or down. Infant mortality in the West Bank For this claim, the Sanders campaign referred us to a Vox article that said two neighborhoods in Baltimore — Little Italy and Greenmount East — had a higher rate of infant mortality than the West Bank, Honduras and Venezuela in 2013. But in his speech, Sanders only mentioned the West Bank. In 2014, 13.49 out of 1,000 babies died before their first birthday in the notorious conflict zone, according to the CIA’s World Factbook. The West Bank places in the middle of the pack in infant mortality at No. 117 out of 224 countries. The United States, meanwhile, ranked at No. 169 with a rate of 6.17 deaths per 1,000. In 2014, 11 Baltimore neighborhoods had a higher rate than the West Bank. In Hilltop and Little Italy, at least 20 out of 1,000 infants died before their first birthday. That’s not only higher than the West Bank, Honduras and Venezuela but also war-torn Syria and oppressive Uzbekistan. Teen health in distressed cities in developing countries Sanders claimed that "Baltimore teenagers between the ages of 15 and 19 face poorer health conditions and a worse economic outlook than those in distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China and South Africa." The Sanders campaign cited a Washington Post article by Johns Hopkins University researchers. "Teenagers in Baltimore face poorer health and more negative outlooks than those in urban centers of Nigeria, India and China," they write. Contrary to what Sanders said, the work by the Johns Hopkins researchers don’t consider economic outlooks nor do they show Baltimore conditions being worse than South Africa’s. Nonetheless, his broader point is accurate. The researchers published a comprehensive set of studies published in the Journal of Adolescent Health in 2014 that compared the well-being of teens in impoverished areas in Baltimore; Ibadan, Nigeria; Johannesburg, South Africa; New Delhi, India; and Shanghai, China. Baltimore teens reported the highest rates pregnancy and, after Johannesburg, the second highest rates of substance use, sexual and physical violence, and feeling unsafe in their community: Our ruling Sanders presented a series of comparisons showing that conditions in some parts of Baltimore rivaled that of "the West Bank in Palestine," "North Korea," and "distressed cities in Nigeria, India, China and South Africa. Some of Sanders’ figures need to be updated, but the gist of his specific comparisons are accurate: 12 Baltimore neighborhoods have a lower life expectancy than North Korea; 11 have a higher infant mortality rate than the West Bank; and research shows health conditions are worse for poor teens than in Baltimore than in Ibadan, New Delhi and Shanghai.

pomt-00626	Says he was known as "Veto Corleone" for cutting spending as Florida governor.	true	/florida/statements/2015/may/26/jeb-bush/saga-jeb-bushs-one-time-alias-veto-corleone/	Former Gov. Jeb Bush has resurrected an infamous moniker from his days in Tallahassee on the campaign trail in an attempt to show he is the godfather of fiscal conservatism. During a meeting with business leaders in Portsmouth, N.H., on May 20, 2015, Bush pointed out he was well-known for using the line-item veto at his disposal as governor. "They called me Veto Corleone, which was something I was quite proud of," Bush said, citing a reference to Marlon Brando’s character in The Godfather. He added that he vetoed 2,500 separate line items totaling $2 billion over his eight years. Bush has brought out that anecdote several times during the run-up to a presidential campaign, implying he would again focus on cutting wasteful spending. We wondered if he was accurate in claiming that nickname. We made our own inquiries and found that yes, pork projects really did sleep with the fishes. Offers he could refuse Bush came into office in 1999 vowing to use his line-item veto on state spending he didn’t like, and he followed through with a vengeance. He also wanted the state to focus on building reserves. That first year, he shocked lawmakers by slashing $313 million out of the $48.6 billion budget approved by the Legislature. It was more than double the previous veto record of $150 million set by Republican Gov. Bob Martinez in 1988. The Senate was so angry about the cuts, they sued Bush over his partial veto of funding for an extended school year. The Florida Supreme Court eventually ruled Bush defied the state Constitution by cutting $16 million out of a $40 million appropriation to keep schools open longer. They said he either had to cut all of the program or none of it. Media reports said John Thrasher, then speaker of the House, dubbed Bush "Veto Corleone" after the fictional mafia don (spelled Vito Corleone) for his liberal use of the power. Thrasher, who is now president of Florida State University, confirmed to PolitiFact Florida that he coined the nickname, which seemed to be something of a friendly dig. Thrasher’s collegial relationship with Bush was apparent in 2000, when Thrasher brought the budget to Bush’s office while wearing a white lab coat and a stethoscope "to make sure the governor has a heart." Bush answered by approving a couple of Thrasher’s pet projects, then chopping another $313.7 million out of appropriations. Here’s a look at how much Bush vetoed from each year’s budget: Year Total state budget Amount Bush vetoed 1999 $48.6 billion $313 million* 2000 $51 billion $313.7 million 2001 $48.3 billion $288.8 million 2002 $50.4 billion $107 million 2003 $53.5 billion $33 million 2004 $57.3 billion $349 million 2005 $64.7 billion $180 million 2006 $73.9 billion $448.7 million * The state Supreme Court ruled a $16 million veto in 1999 unconstitutional. The first year of Bush’s second term, in 2003, Bush cut a low of $33 million, but $7.2 million of that was funding for high-speed rail. Bush later led an effort to repeal a constitutional amendment requiring the creation of high-speed rail transit in the state. Bush also saved the most for last, hacking $448.7 million out of the 2006 budget, including a university tuition increase, spending on parks and police vehicles, as well as job training and education programs. That year state spending was up to $73.9 billion, a 52 percent increase from his first year in office. "It's never easy," Bush said in 2006. "You always hurt people's feelings. I don't enjoy that. And I'm always surprised that people are surprised. I've been consistent. There should be no surprises. And the people who really follow the budget knew that." We should note that if Bush wins the presidency, he likely won’t get to whack as much. A president doesn’t have a line-item veto and has to either accept or reject an entire piece of legislation. Our ruling Bush said "they called me Veto Corleone" as governor for his frequent use of the line-item veto. He did have a fondness for ruthlessly slashing projects he deemed wasteful or not in line with his agenda. Thrasher confirmed he nicknamed the governor after the fictional mobster.

pomt-07945	Says a "Canadian provincial prime minister came to Ohio for his medical treatment because of the delay in Canadian health care which would have endangered his life."	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2011/jan/26/bill-batchelder/ohio-house-speaker-william-g-batchelder-tells-heal/	New House Speaker William G. Batchelder loves telling a good story. With a legislative career in the Ohio House stretching back to 1968, Batchelder is well-known for his floor speeches peppered with political references and historical anecdotes from days long gone. Therefore, it was no surprise that Batchelder’s initial speech as the 101st House Speaker on Jan. 3 tied together the Ohio legislative session of 1937-38, the Roman historian Titus Livy, a lunch meeting with Florida Gov. Jeb Bush as well as the 1787 comments of Ben Franklin upon wrapping up the Constitutional Convention. After describing the challenges facing Ohio, the Medina Republican’s speech took a sunny turn as he mentioned the medical services in Ohio "that are second to none." In illustrating this point, Batchelder mentioned that the king of Saudi Arabia as well as a top Canadian official had sought treatment in Ohio. "The Canadian provincial prime minister came to Ohio for his medical treatment because of the delay in Canadian health care which would have endangered his life," Batchelder said. Beyond suggesting that Ohio medical treatment was first-class, Batchelder was also making a political point in suggesting that Canada’s universal health care system is second-rate. While the Cleveland Clinic’s care for Saudi royalty is well-known, Batchelder’s Canadian anecdote caught us by surprise. It seemed to us that if one of Canada’s premiers (as the top provincial leaders are known) had come to Ohio for medical care that it would have been a big deal, but it just didn’t sound familiar. So we put on our Politifact hardhat, and began digging. We first called Batchelder spokesman Mike Dittoe to find out more about where the claim originated. Dittoe told us that Batchelder personally inserted the reference into his Jan. 3rd speech, but didn’t have more details. Eventually, Dittoe got back to us that Batchelder told him "it’s on the tip of my tongue" but couldn’t quite recall the name. However, Dittoe said it was not former Newfoundland and Labrador Premier Danny Williams, who traveled to Miami in February 2010 for open heart surgery. It was the leader of one of the western provinces, according to Batchelder. Later, Dittoe reversed himself in an e-mail and wrote that it was Williams that Batchelder was referring to in his speech. He said that it had been "widely speculated" that Williams came to the Cleveland Clinic for "post-operative medical treatment" following his surgery in Florida. But, Dittoe acknowledged, there is no way to know for sure because HIPAA rules prevent the sharing of information of when a patient visits a doctor. Initially told to look west by Batchelder, we searched Canadian newspapers in the national capital of Ottawa and eight provincial and territory capitols from Ontario on westward and northward (Toronto, Winnipeg, Regina, Edmonton, Victoria, White Horse, Yellow Knife and Iqaluit for all you geography nerds) for references to a provincial premier getting health care treatment. During our search, we learned that Yukon Premier Dennis Fentie had cancerous tumors removed in 2007— in Vancouver. And we found out that former Ontario Premier Ernie Eves had emergency heart bypass surgery several years ago — in Toronto. But there were a whole raft of stories about Williams, who resigned his office in December. His February 2010 trip to Miami for specialized heart surgery was big news — and a public relations disaster up north — in all of the major Canadian newspapers. The initial stories didn’t say where Williams was getting treatment, but afterward news trickled out that it had taken place in Miami. Williams told the press that the health care treatment in Miami was better, and that he knew he would be criticized or perceived as a line-jumper if he stayed in Canada, where the special surgery has a waiting list. Not the same thing as saying your life is endangered by the Canadian health care system, but in the ballpark. More importantly, we didn’t find even find any references to any Canadian officials heading to Ohio for medical treatment. Much less for medical treatment that saved their life that was endangered because of delays in the Canadian system. As far as the Canadian press is concerned, a provincial premier has never come to the Buckeye State for medical treatment. Just to double-check on whether Williams had an Ohio stop for medical treatment, we called the St. John’s Telegram, the daily newspaper in the provincial capital. We spoke to Dave Bartlett, a reporter who interviewed Williams following the February 2010 heart surgery. "I’m fairly confident he never came to Ohio for any kind of treatment," Bartlett said. "My understanding is that he stayed in Florida for several weeks after the surgery and then he went to the Vancouver Olympics." So let’s take a look at what we’ve got cooking here: Batchelder claimed that a Canadian provincial premier came to Ohio for medical treatment that basically saved his life but could only remember that it was the head of a western province. And after scouring newspapers across eight Canadian provincial capitals, we could find nothing matching Batchelder’s description. Batchelder’s staffer said it definitely was not Danny Williams, former premier of Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada’s easternmost province. Williams did have a trip south to Miami for specialized heart surgery. But then the staffer said it was Williams that Batchelder referred to in the speech and said it has been "widely speculated" that he came to the Cleveland Clinic for post-operative treatment. However, they had no proof of it. Meanwhile, a local Canadian reporter who covered Williams surgery said he is "fairly confident" he never came to Ohio for treatment. The Williams surgery in the United States was big news and it was initially unclear where in this country he was going for treatment. But by the time Batchelder made his speech in the House, it was 11 months after Williams had his surgery. Batchelder, as speaker of the House, is in a position of authority that also carries great responsibility. When he speaks, people listen. Yet neither he nor his office could point us to any concrete evidence that a high level provincial official came to Ohio for treatment. And given that the best they could come up with was that it was "widely speculated" that Williams might have come to Cleveland, the claim is more than just inaccurate; it’s ridiculous to a point that we’re ready to set the good speaker’s double-knits ablaze. We rate Batchelder’s claim Pants on Fire. Comment on this item.	None	William G. Batchelder	None	None	None	2011-01-26T06:00:00	2011-01-03	['Canada', 'Ohio']

pomt-00753	Says "all my grandparents" immigrated to America.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/apr/16/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-flubs-familys-immigration-history-/	Hillary Clinton this week became the latest example of a politician flubbing her family’s ancestry while making the case for her presidency. Clinton was speaking at a business roundtable inside an Iowa produce store when she related her personal family heritage to the struggles of undocumented immigrants trying to work in the United States. "I think if we were to just go around this room, there are a lot of immigrant stories," Clinton said, according to a video of the event. "All my grandparents, you know, came over here, and you know my grandfather went to work in a lace mill in Scranton, Pa., and worked there until he retired at 65. He started there when he was a teenager and just kept going. So I sit here and I think well you’re talking about the second, third generation. That’s me, that’s you." BuzzFeed’s Andrew Kaczynski quickly pointed out that Clinton was wrong, primarily using census and military records from Ancestry.com. An unidentified Clinton spokesman admitted the error in a statement to BuzzFeed, saying Clinton’s "grandparents always spoke about the immigrant experience and, as a result she has always thought of them as immigrants." While it’s clear Clinton is incorrect, and why her claim rates False on the Truth-O-Meter, we wanted to provide as much context as possible to this claim. Megan Smolenyak, a "genealogical adventurer and storyteller" who recently examined Clinton’s Welsh roots, can see where the campaign is coming from. Seven of Clinton’s eight great-grandparents were born overseas into working-class families. Clinton’s paternal grandfather, Hugh Rodham Sr., was born in England, but her three other grandparents were born in the United States. Hugh Rodham’s wife, Hanna (also Hannah) Jones Rodham, was born in Scranton, Pa., to Welsh parents a couple years after they emigrated. Census, civil and military records show Clinton’s maternal grandparents, Della and Edwin Howell, were born in Illinois. (Della’s mother was the one great-grandparent born in the United States.) Even though three of Clinton’s grandparents were born in the United States, Smolenyak said they probably strongly identified with their immigrant parents and older siblings, and she considers Clinton’s ancestors more "off the boat" than most politicians. Clinton is not the first person, famous or not, to potentially confuse family lore with the cold facts of her roots. Her misfire follows the misinterpreted family trees of U.S. Sens. Marco Rubio, who wrongly said his parents were Cuban exiles, and Elizabeth Warren, who claimed American Indian heritage while working as a Harvard professor. "We hold politicians to higher standards for accuracy in their family histories than we do genealogists and historians," Smolenyak said. "Your Great Aunt Tilly tells you something, and you believe it." Finding Hanna Jones Again, it is clear Clinton was wrong when she said "all my grandparents" immigrated to America. But Smolenyak recently upended the real story about one-quarter of Clinton’s roots. A few months ago, Smolenyak started researching Clinton’s Celtic connections for Irish America magazine. She was not expecting to find anything new in the well-documented background of a high-profile American, but she wrapped her investigation with a "wake-up call" for genealogists. Researchers had made critical mistakes in the background of Clinton’s paternal grandmother, Hanna Jones Rodham (born in Scranton), she found. At the beginning, Smolenyak knew she needed to search for records with names spanning all kinds of possibilities, as Jones is a common name in Wales , and a woman named Hanna could go by several names, including Annie, Anna, Hanna, Honora or Nora. (Americans weren’t as picky about the spelling of their names and records retention back then, she said.) Census records show two women born in the early 1880s in Lackawanna County, Pa., named Hanna (or Hannah) Jones. But researchers chose the wrong Hanna Jones and ran with it, wrongly assigning Hillary Clinton’s roots to that woman’s parents and creating a false echo chamber (PolitiFact can relate to the frustration). The wrong Hanna Jones, born in 1883, had a readily accessible birth record, but the right one, born in 1882, did not. Smolenyak confirmed the real Hanna Jones, Clinton’s grandmother, by picking up clues from records over time. A low-key marriage announcement in the Aug. 9, 1902, edition of the Scranton Times-Tribune offered potential proof that Jones and Hugh Rodham eloped in a nearby New York town where marriage had fewer restrictions: Ms. Anna Jones, of Brick avenue, was quietly wedded to Hugh Rodham, of Park place, at Binghamton, Memorial Day. Mr. and Mrs. Rodham will make their residence with the bride’s parents on Brick avenue. From there she could find out more information about the Joneses who lived on Brick in Scranton and match up what she knew about Hanna with other records about the family. Census records from 1910, 1920 and 1930 say Hanna (and also Hannah) Jones was born in Pennsylvania while her husband was born in England. Her parents are listed as born in Wales. PolitiFact found an unfinished application for a 1937 marriage license from Clinton’s father, Hugh E. Rodham, that lists the birthplace of both of his parents, Hugh Sr. in England and Hannah in Scranton. Interestingly, the marriage license does not list Hugh Jr.’s eventual wife and Hillary’s mother, Dorothy Howell, but another woman whom he did not marry, Catherine Meisinger. Our ruling Talking about immigration in Iowa, Clinton said, "All my grandparents, you know, came over here." It’s very clear from the evidence that not all of Hillary Clinton’s grandparents were immigrants. In fact, only one was. It’s possible she misspoke, but it doesn’t make her comment more accurate. We rate her claim False.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-04-16T16:47:39	2015-04-15	['United_States']

pomt-09059	"In her first appellate argument, Ms. Kagan told the court that the speech and press guarantees in the First Amendment would allow the federal government to ban the publication of pamphlets discussing political issues before an election."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jun/29/jeff-sessions/sessions-says-kagan-argued-government-could-ban-po/	In the Supreme court nomination hearings for Elena Kagan, Republicans quickly zeroed in on Kagan's first oral arguments before the Supreme Court as solicitor general in the landmark case Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission, which dealt with corporate financing of political materials. Taking the first crack in his opening statement was Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee: "In her first appellate argument, Ms. Kagan told the court that the speech and press guarantees in the First Amendment would allow the federal government to ban the publication of pamphlets discussing political issues before an election. "I would remind my colleagues that the American revolution was in no small part spurred by just such political pamphlets: Thomas Paine's Common Sense." To suggest that the government now has the power to suppress that kind of speech is breathtaking." Sessions' comment does get to the heart of the controversy surrounding the government's position on the case, but Sessions paints the substance of those arguments with a very broad brush and ignores the limits of the legal questions involved. The case before the Supreme Court challenged the application of a campaign reform bill known as the McCain-Feingold Act with respect to whether the nonprofit corporation Citizens United could air a video critical of then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. In a broader sense, though, the issue was whether the government had the authority to ban corporate or labor union funding of independent political broadcasts advocating for a candidate just prior to an election. In her oral arguments before the Supreme Court, Kagan argued that pamphlets were "pretty classic electioneering," and therefore fell into the category of corporate-financed election materials that could be limited by the McCain-Feingold Act. Now, corporations could still form separate political action committees (PACs) to get their message out. But Kagan said she argued in favor of the position taken by Congress that corporations and labor unions had such a "corrupting influence" on elections that they should not be allowed to directly fund political messages for or against a particular candidate very close to an election. In a 5-4 decision, the Supreme Court went the other way, arguing that the First Amendment protects the speech of corporations and individuals alike. In his concurring opinion, Justice John Roberts wrote that the government's position "asks us to embrace a theory of the First Amendment that would allow censorship not only of television and radio broadcasts, but of pamphlets, posters, the Internet, and virtually any other medium that corporations and unions might find useful in expressing their views on matters of public concern." So, right off the bat, we are talking about pamphlets directly funded by corporations or labor unions. That's a big qualifier left out of Sessions' comment. And Sessions' point is further muddled when he drops in the example of Thomas Paine's pamphlet Common Sense, -- which in 1776 argued for American independence from British rule. Paine's 48-page pamphlet was not corporate-financed, so it's technically not applicable in this discussion. And it might not have been even if it was. "Solicitor Kagan was arguing that, under the Federal Election Campaign Act, corporate funds could not be used to publish a pamphlet that expressly advocated the election or defeat of a specific candidate for federal office," said Brett Kappel, an attorney specializing in ethics and lobbying law at the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Arent Fox. "The Act would not have prevented Thomas Paine from publishing Common Sense since that famous pamphlet had nothing to do with candidates running for office. Today it would be considered an issue ad, not an electioneering communication." The Federal Election Commission doesn't regulate advertising unless it includes the name or image of a candidate for federal office, Kappel noted. Others argue that whether Common Sense was technically not corporate-financed is not the issue. "Common Sense itself was probably not published by a corporation, but in today's world, it surely would have been," said Bradley A. Smith, Professor of Law at Capital University Law School. "How many such efforts can you name that are not?" The statement by Sessions "was a bit of rhetorical excess, perhaps," said Sean Parnell, president of the Center for Competitive Politics, a campaign-finance advocacy group. Obviously, he said, Sessions could have added a good bit of context. Kagan never argued that the government could ban any pamphlet. Nonetheless, Parnell said, in the context of limited corporate-financed political messages, Sessions' comment accurately described Kagan's position that in addition to a video, the government could ban a pamphlet. During some close questioning by Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, on the Citizens United issue on the second day of the confirmation hearing, Kagan quickly framed the limits of the issue, stating that the statute ''applies only to corporations and unions when they make independent expenditures, not to their PACs ... within a certain period of an election." She also noted that as solicitor general, she was defending the statute as written by Congress, which "made the determination broadly that corporations and trade unions had this corrupting influence on Congress." "And the statute as it was written applies to pamphlets as well as to the movie in the case, and we made a vigorous argument that the application of that statute to any kind of classic electioneering materials, not books -- because they aren't typically used to electioneer -- but that the application of the statutes to any kinds of classic electioneering materials was in fact constitutional and that the court should defer to Congress' view of the need for this," Kagan said. Given the time constraints on opening statements, we are willing to allow Sessions a bit of rhetorical leeway. Kagan did argue that pamphlets should be included in the types of communication the government could prohibit. But again, that's in the context of pamphlets paid for directly by corporations or labor unions making independent expenditures (not through their PAC) for a pamphlet advocating for a specific candidate within the last months of an election. That's an awful lot of limiting context left out. And the point is further muddled by using the example of Paine's Common Sense. It's not at all clear that that pamphlet would have fallen under the regulation of the McCain-Feingold Act. And so we rate Sessions' comment Half True.

pomt-15146	"Of the 25 wealthiest nations, we're the only one that doesn't provide basic health coverage."	true	/virginia/statements/2015/sep/01/dan-gecker/dan-gecker-says-us-only-wealth-nation-without-univ/	When it comes to health care, state Senate hopeful Dan Gecker says the U.S. is in a dubious league of its own. "Of the 25 wealthiest nations, we’re the only one that doesn’t provide basic health coverage," Gecker, a Democrat who serves on the Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors, said during an Aug. 18 candidates’ forum. Gecker is seeking the 10th District Senate seat that long has been held by Republican John Watkins, who is not seeking re-election. Also running is Glen Sturtevant, a Republican who serves on the Richmond School Board; Marleen Durfee, an independent who is a former Chesterfield supervisor; and Carl Loser, a Libertarian from Powhatan County. Gecker, in his comment, was referring to universal coverage, in which all citizens get national help in paying for health costs. We wondered if he was right about about the United States’ exceptional status among the wealthiest nations. Gecker pointed us to a report last year issued by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of 34 nations -- mostly with industrialized economies -- seeking to improve trade. The report says only two OECD countries -- the U.S. and Mexico -- do not offer universal care. A chart in the study shows that all of the other OECD nations provide coverage for more than 90 percent of their people.. The roster of OECD nations, however, does not translate to a list of the 25 wealthiest countries. Gecker also directed us to the World Bank’s ranking of the wealthiest nations based on each country’s gross domestic product divided by its population -- a figure called GDP per capita. About two-thirds of the nations on the World Bank’s 25-richest list belong to the OECD. We sought to compare that ranking with a list of all nations that provide universal health care. We found two organizations that try to keep tabs on nations that provide universal coverage. One is the New York State Department of Health, which compiled a 2011 list to give medical providers guidance on billing practices when they treat foreign patients. The other resource is a 2010 study by researchers in the United Kingdom and the U.S. examining universal health care around the world. Among high GDP-per-capita nations, universal care coverage is the norm. Only three of the 25 wealthiest -- the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Qatar -- weren’t listed as having universal health care. The embassy for Qatar told us that the country does provide universal health care. Saudi Arabia is listed as providing universal health care in a June 28, 2012, story from The Atlantic magazine. We reached out to the Saudi Arabian embassy several times to confirm that’s the case, but did not hear back. A 1998 study published in the Journal of Family Community Medicine says "Saudi Arabian policy is to provide free, comprehensive and universal health care services to all citizens." The final source Gecker cited is a 2012 op-ed by David de Ferranti, former vice president of the World Bank, and Julio Frenk, the former dean of the Harvard School of Public Health, about universal health care coverage. "Except for the United States, the 25 wealthiest nations have some form of it (universal coverage)," de Ferranti and Frenk wrote in their op-ed. We got a similar take from two other health care analysts we contacted. Andrea Feigl, a visiting scientist at Harvard who co-wrote the 2010 U.K.-U.S. report, told us in an email that "The United States is still on its way towards UHC (Universal Health Coverage), and it is the last developed country to do so." The World Health Organization said in a September 2014 report that the United States is "currently the only high-income country without nearly universal health-care coverage." Our ruling Gecker said that "of the 25 wealthiest nations, we’re the only one that doesn’t provide basic health coverage." Gecker was referring to rich nations that provide coverage to all of their citizens. We can’t say definitively that the U.S. is the only one that doesn’t provide universal coverage, but evidence strongly points that way. So we rate his statement True.

pomt-01696	Says Rick Scott "is letting Duke (Energy) keep collecting billions" despite troubled power plants.	half-true	/florida/statements/2014/aug/13/nextgen-climate/pac-accuses-rick-scott-letting-duke-energy-fleece-/	Gov. Rick Scott has a new enemy on the campaign trail: Billionaire environmentalist Tom Steyer. And Steyer has started bringing his message and massive checkbook to the airwaves. In an Aug. 8, 2014, commercial from Steyer’s political action committee NextGen Climate, the group accused the Republican incumbent of letting utility company Duke Energy run wild on the state’s citizens. The ad references the botched upgrade at the now-shuttered Crystal River nuclear plant and canceled Levy County nuclear project. "We Floridians are paying billions to the nation's largest power company and getting nothing in return," says a TV reporter. Then the narrator: "One defective power plant. Another never built. Florida fleeced by Duke Energy. Rick Scott knew, but he’s letting Duke keep collecting billions anyway." The ad flashes a statement attributed to the Tampa Bay Times: "Duke’s customers on the hook for up to $3.2 billion." It also says Scott received $500,000 in campaign contributions from Duke and its pre-merger counterpart, Progress Energy, strongly implying a connection. The commercial was one of two NextGen Climate ads released attacking Scott. The other accused Scott of accepting campaign contributions from a Texas company performing unauthorized oil drilling in Collier County. We looked at that one in a separate item. It’s obvious Scott heard of the troubles in Citrus and Levy counties, since it was a major headache for the 1.7 million Florida residents billed by Duke Energy for electricity (the company said it doesn’t comment on political ads). But we wondered, is there something Scott could have done to prevent the utility from pulling in billions for the troubled projects, even though no customer is benefitting from them? PolitiFact Florida decided to check the fine print. The nuclear option The saga of Duke Energy’s ill-fated nuclear plants on Florida’s west coast is complex, making it hard to comprehensively explain its ups and downs. (The Tampa Bay Times has extensively covered the morass.) We will give you a quick overview, though: In 2006, the state Legislature overwhelmingly passed SB 888, allowing utilities to charge a so-called "advance fee" to customers in order to pay for nuclear projects. The fee was based on the number of kilowatt hours the customers used, and shifted the expense of new nuclear projects to customers instead of shareholders. Unfortunately, while the bill allowed utilities to collect the fee for facilities yet to be built, there was no language included to ensure those companies had to actually build anything. That same year, Progress Energy began selecting a site in Levy County for a new nuclear power plant. Over the years, the potential cost of the project neared $25 billion, and Progress collected roughly $1 billion in advance fees to help pay for it. In 2009, Progress Energy was also upgrading its Crystal River nuclear plant by installing new steam generators. Progress elected to perform the upgrade itself and the reactor containment dome contracted during the project, requiring extensive repairs. Progress planned to reopen the plant in 2011, but the company committed one mistake after another in the work. Estimates to repair the building reached as high as $3.4 billion. Progress merged with Duke Energy in 2012. State lawmakers changed their tune about the advance fee in 2013 amending the 2006 law with SB 1472, saying a utility has 10 years after it gets its federal license to begin construction or lose access to the fees. The projects also had to be "reasonable," an important addition, considering the Levy project had turned into the most expensive nuclear power plant in U.S. history. The same day lawmakers passed the amendment by a wide margin, the Florida Supreme Court rejected an environmental group’s challenge to the fee, saying the 2006 fee was constitutional and the state’s Public Service Commission had a framework with which to apply it. Duke then decided in 2013 to shut down the Crystal River plant rather than fix it, even after using $265 million in advance fee money. The total cost of the Crystal River project grew to about $1.7 billion from repair work, having to buy electricity for customers elsewhere and other expenses. The company also canceled the Levy County project after spending $1.5 billion on it. Duke continued to clamor for more advance fee cash, saying it may one day continue the Levy County project or build a natural gas plant. They also claimed decommissioning the Crystal River facility would take 60 years and cost another $1.18 billion, much of which the utility collected for its federally required decommissioning fund. The five-member Public Service Commission voted 4-1 in October 2013 to settle with Duke Energy over $5 billion in costs for the two doomed projects. Customers would shoulder $3.2 billion in expenses, insurance would pay $835 million and shareholders would pay the rest, with Duke keeping about $250 million ($150 million for Levy, $100 million for Crystal River). Customers will have to pay monthly charges of $3.45 per 1,000 kilowatt hours for Levy through the early part of 2016 and $2.17 for Crystal River through at least 2017 -- all for two projects that never produced any electricity in exchange for the money paid. Who’s to blame? The commission’s members are appointed by the governor, who relies on the Legislature to draft a list of nominees when members’ four-year terms are up. Of the five veteran members on the board under Scott, four were previously chosen by Gov. Charlie Crist, and one was originally picked by Gov. Jeb Bush. Scott reappointed each, and the Legislature confirmed them. "Like judges appointed by the governor to the judiciary, PSC commissioners make independent decisions based on the established evidentiary record for each case," spokesperson Cindy Muir said. "PSC decisions are not reviewed by the Legislature or the governor." Scott did have some say on who served on the commission, however, although he has not spoken publicly about the two nuclear plants or the PSC’s vote. Scott could have urged lawmakers to deal with the advance fee, but no action was taken until 2013. Many lawmakers were still not pleased with the commission’s settlement. Rep. Dwight Dudley, D-St. Petersburg, called the 2013 changes to the fee "total eyewash" and several legislators demanded a complete repeal of the advance fee. That hasn’t happened. A change in the law is the only way consumers could avoid the advance fee, and that’s not up to the PSC or the governor alone, according to Public Counsel J.R. Kelly. "Whether the governor likes it or not and, to a certain extent, whether the PSC likes it or not, they have to follow the law," Kelly said. "I don’t know what the governor’s office or anyone else could have done." He pointed out that whether or not the governor and the commissioners share opinions on subjects, the PSC’s board members are appointed to four-year terms in order to avoid political reprisals after making unpopular decisions. Commissioners can only be removed for malfeasance, he said. Our ruling NextGen Climate said Scott "is letting Duke (Energy) keep collecting billions" after the utility company took in billions for two failed nuclear projects. The $3.2 billion settlement was the decision of the Public Service Commission, however, and not the governor or the Legislature. Scott and lawmakers have a say in who serves as commissioners, but the board’s decisions in utility matters is final. Scott could have asked for a change in the advance fee from 2006 that led to the flap, but he didn’t. He also could have appointed commissioners who may have voted differently. Beyond that, there’s not much the governor could do about the settlement the PSC awarded Duke. But it’s not like Scott has spoken up on the issue. If anything, he has been notably silent. We rate the statement Half True.	None	NextGen Climate	None	None	None	2014-08-13T11:33:44	2014-08-08	['None']
pomt-08511	Says Peter Kilmartin voted "in favor of expanding the 'good behavior' statute to sex offenders."	false	/rhode-island/statements/2010/oct/07/erik-wallin/wallin-says-kilmartin-voted-expand-good-behavior-l/	There are few things that scare the public more than the possibility of sex offenders running loose on the streets. So when Republican candidate for attorney general Erik Wallin issued a news release warning voters that his opponent, Democrat Peter Kilmartin, voted to allow sex offenders to shave time off their prison sentences for good behavior, it caught our attention. His claim began like this: "Erik Wallin, candidate for Attorney General, today criticized Representative Kilmartin for his vote in favor of expanding the 'good behavior' statute to sex offenders and called for its overall repeal for those who commit violent felonies (including sex crimes) and domestic violence offenses." He repeated much of that accusation in a subsequent appearance on WPRO 630-AM's "John DePetro Show." The good behavior statute he's talking about is part of a state law that dictates when and how prison inmates are allowed to earn time off their sentences. He is referring to a change in that policy enacted by lawmakers in 2008. But let's go back to what the law said before that rewrite. Since 1976, the statute has allowed well-behaved prison inmates -- except those serving life sentences -- to trim up to 10 days a month off their prison stays under a formula that was tied to the length of their sentence. For example, an inmate sentenced to eight years could knock eight days per month off his or her prison time, while someone serving five years could earn up to five days off a month. Prisoners could also earn small amounts of additional time off for what is known as meritorious service. Sex offenders were not excluded from those guidelines. Nor were violent felons or anyone else besides those with life sentences. In 2008, faced with cost concerns, crowding and calls for a good conduct policy that would allow those serving short sentences to earn as much time off as those imprisoned for more serious crimes, the state convened a panel to revamp the policy. That group was made up of prosecutors, public defenders, state police, the chief judge of the Superior Court, corrections officials and legislators. The result was a line item in Governor Carcieri's midyear budget that would have allowed all inmates except those serving life sentences to earn up to 10 days per month off their time -- a full third -- regardless of their crimes. The proposal also allowed inmates to earn up to five days more per month off for participating in rehabilitation programs such as substance-abuse treatment and anger management. House leaders later decided to consider the measure as a separate bill, rather than a budget item. (It is worth noting that as the House whip, Kilmartin was a member of that leadership team.) But as that bill made its way to the House floor, a small group of legislators on both sides of the aisle roared in protest. The new rules, they said, did not specifically exclude sex offenders, meaning they too were eligible for the increased good behavior benefits. House lawmakers rewrote the bill to specifically exclude sex offenders from benefiting from the new policy. In other words, they were still governed by the less generous statute from the 1970s. The legislation passed March 27, 2008, with Kilmartin voting yes. For procedural reasons, it found its way back into the midyear budget bill. It passed, complete with the language excluding sex offenders, in May of that year. Kilmartin again voted yes. But neither of his two votes that year gave any new privileges to sex offenders, as Wallin suggests. In fact, they did exactly the opposite, targeting sex offenders as the only inmates -- along with those serving life sentences -- who could not benefit. "Basically every other inmate at the [Adult Correctional Institutions] got a real benefit from this change, and the sex offenders did not," said Patricia Coyne-Fague, chief legal council for the state Department of Corrections. So why did Wallin accuse Kilmartin of a vote the representative never made? Wallin acknowledged that the new rules excluded sex offenders, and he said his initial new release contained "bad wording," noting that he sent out a subsequent statement that downplayed the sex offender side of what he said. In retrospect, Wallin said the essence of his claim had more to do with what Kilmartin didn't do than what he did. "My argument is simply that [Kilmartin] voted for a bill that continues to allow sex offenders to get credit for good behavior ... He failed to close the loophole," or repeal the older portion of the law that rewards sex offenders. Wallin is right about that. Sex offenders are still eligible to trim time off their sentences under a policy that some voters might not approve of. But that is the result of a law that passed in 1976, when Kilmartin was 14 years old. It had nothing to do with the 2008 votes. The claim stops short of receiving a Pants on Fire because Wallin acknowledges that the news release was poorly worded. But that doesn't change the fact that he accused his opponent of voting in favor of something he didn't vote for. We find this claim False.

pomt-14925	My campaign "finished the last quarter reporting the most cash on hand of any Republican in the field … $13.8 million in the bank, $3.5 million more than the Jeb Bush campaign."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/oct/30/ted-cruz/ted-cruz/	Ted Cruz of Texas recently declared that his campaign’s fundraising is "astonishing" and suggested that’s a surprise to the "Washington chattering class" and maybe even former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, another Republican bidding for president. Sen. Cruz, appearing in Houston Oct. 26, 2015, to accept endorsements from statewide elected Republicans including Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, celebrated how much he’s raised in Texas and in general. He made us wonder with mention of the Texas-born Bush, who’s trying to become the third member of his family to win the White House. Cruz said: "And we finished the last quarter reporting the most cash on hand of any Republican in the field… $13.8 million in the bank, $3.5 million more than the Jeb Bush campaign." Cruz added that if he’d predicted such an outcome relative to Bush six months before, reporters would have laughed aloud. Early in 2015, Bush drew headlines for raising money at a vigorous clip. No giggling here. But was Cruz right about his campaign having the biggest pile of cash on hand and exceeding Bush’s balance by $3.5 million? Campaign vs. campaign, you bet your cacti. But throw in money raised by PACs and Super PACs devoted to individual candidates and it could be there’s far more money stowed away to boost Bush. Then again, PAC fundraising updates won’t be filed until 2016. Campaign vs. campaign To our inquiry, Cruz campaign spokeswoman Catherine Frazier emailed us a list indicating that Cruz’s campaign ended the year’s third quarter, June through September 2015, with more cash on hand than any other Republican aspirant. Separately, we fetched a Federal Election Commission summary, dated Oct. 19, 2015, stating that through September 2015, Cruz’s campaign had nearly $13.8 million cash on hand. And Cruz’s balance, according to the document, exceeded the cash on hand of any of 15 other listed current or former Republican presidential candidates. At No. 2, retired surgeon Ben Carson had nearly $11.3 million cash on hand, according to the summary, followed by Florida Sen. Marco Rubio with nearly $11 million and Bush with nearly $10.3 million. To be precise, per Cruz’s claim in Houston, Bush’s cash on hand of $10,271,129 was a little more than $3.5 million less than Cruz’s $13,778,904. We’re not saying here that Cruz outraised everyone. According to another FEC summary, also dated Oct. 19, 2015, Carson raised some $31 million through September 2015, outpacing Cruz’s nearly $27 million and Bush’s nearly $25 million. Businessman Donald Trump, who has led many Republican voter polls, reported a scant $254,773 cash on hand through the third quarter. But Trump, who's wealthy, also has declared plans to self-fund his candidacy. Maybe how much cash he has on hand isn’t significant. Also, Politico noted Oct. 15, 2015, Trump fielded about $3.7 million in donations in the third quarter. Notably too, Democratic presidential hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders each ended the quarter having raised more money and also having more cash on hand than any Republican. Clinton, the former first lady, senator and secretary of state, had nearly $33 million on hand, according to the FEC, and Sanders, a Vermont senator, had $27.1 million. PACs and Super PACs There’s another wrinkle if you consider how much money PACs and Super PACs devoted to candidates may have in cash on hand. According to a chart built by the New York Times, last updated Oct. 16, 2015, Bush-backing PACs and Super PACs had $98.2 million cash on hand through June 2015. In contrast, Cruz PACs and Super PACs had $37.5 million cash on hand. We don’t see a path to more recent balances; a footnote to the Times chart says most of these groups aren’t required to file an updated report until Jan. 31, 2016. Separately, the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign spending, posted a chart in October 2015 showing Bush PACs and Super PACs fielding far more money than any other hopeful, again with information limited to what such groups had reported through June 2015: SOURCE: Web post, "Behind the Candidates: Campaign Committees and Outside Groups," Center for Responsive Politics, last updated Oct. 27, 2015 (accessed the same day) The chart is preceded by explanatory text: "The modern presidential campaign isn't a single organization. Yes, there's always an official campaign committee. But for every White House candidate, there is usually at least one super PAC or other outside organization devoted to getting him or her elected. These groups can solicit unlimited donations and later use them to pummel rivals – or, as seems to be the case this cycle, take on some of the duties traditionally handled by a campaign, such as organizing town hall meetings or doing voter outreach." The explanation continues: "Outside groups aren't allowed to coordinate with official campaign committees, but they're often run by friends and former staffers – even family members – of the candidate they're helping. Overall, as of the middle of 2015, single-candidate super PACs in the presidential race had raised more money than the candidates themselves. But that wasn't true among Democrats, whose potential nominees raised more than the super PACs supporting them." Frazier of Cruz’s camp agreed by email it could be that money accumulated to promote Bush’s candidacy still runs ahead of funds raised for Cruz’s cause. Regardless, she reminded, Cruz limited his Houston claim to funds raised by campaigns alone. Our ruling Cruz said his campaign "finished the last quarter reporting the most cash on hand of any Republican in the field… $13.8 million in the bank, three and a half million dollars more than the Jeb Bush campaign." This is all so, though Bush still might remain ahead (perhaps way ahead) in money accumulated on behalf of a Republican. We won’t know how much total cash has been stashed to help each candidate until PACs report again in 2016. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check.

pomt-09515	"In the three months before the act took effect, America lost 750,000 jobs a month. In the last three months, we've lost about 35,000 jobs a month."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/17/joe-biden/biden-says-job-losses-have-fallen-750000-month-350/	The stimulus bill is one year old. To celebrate its anniversary, administration officials are touting its successes. Vice President Joe Biden is among those talking up the bill. In a USA Today op-ed, he wrote that the success of the stimulus legislation, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, can be measured by the number of jobs it has created. "We think the Recovery Act is working because of the progress we've made in slowing job loss," Biden wrote on Feb. 17, 2010, exactly a year since the stimulus bill was signed by President Barack Obama. "In the three months before the act took effect, America lost 750,000 jobs a month. In the last three months, we've lost about 35,000 jobs a month. That's progress — not good enough, not where we need to be, but progress. And most economists agree that that progress is thanks in a very large part to the Recovery Act." For this item, we'll focus on whether Biden is correct that America lost 750,000 jobs a month before the stimulus bill went into effect and only 35,000 a month in the last three months. Jay Carney, Biden's communications director, said that the numbers cited in the op-ed came from monthly job losses reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in January, February and March of 2009, as well as the last three months. On average, the economy lost about 752,000 jobs per month in the first three months of 2009, which is close to the 750,000 that Biden wrote in his op-ed. But Biden specifically wrote that job losses averaged that amount "in the three months before the act took effect," which was officially Feb. 17, 2009, the day the bill was signed. So, that time frame includes November and December of 2008, and January 2009. For that time period, the average was about 726,000 jobs. So, when it comes to job loss averages in the months before the stimulus bill officially went into effect, Biden is off by about 26,000 jobs. Carney said that the stimulus bill had very little effect on the economy until April 2009, so that's why they included March in their calculations. Next, we turned to average job losses for the last three months. The Bureau of Labor Statistics has not published data for February yet, so we focused on November and December of 2009, and January 2010. In this case, Biden is spot on: The average number of job losses over the last three months has been about 35,000. Whether the stimulus is entirely responsible for slowing job losses is a matter of opinion, and the subject of heated debate between conservative and liberal economists. Brian Riedl, a budget expert with the conservative Heritage Foundation, said that knowing whether the bill has helped stem job losses requires knowing how the economy would have performed had the stimulus bill never been put into law. He argues that the economy may have actually lost jobs as a result of the stimulus bill. For every job that's created through government spending, the government has to take money away from another part of the economy, which can produce job losses, he said. "At best, it's a zero-sum game." Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, says that it's difficult to say exactly how many jobs have been created by the stimulus. "You can't look at a job and say, 'This job would not have been here without the stimulus.'" But you can measure the stimulus bill's impact on employment by looking at aggregate demand, Horney added. People have been buying more groceries, clothes and other goods, which indicates a stabilizing job market. So, back to Biden's claim. He said that job losses averaged about 750,000 in the three months before the stimulus bill went into effect. Including job loss statistics for the month of March 2009, Biden is correct. But the bill was signed Feb. 17, 2009, and officially went into effect that day. And using that measure — November and December of 2008, and January 2009 — Biden is off by about 26,000 jobs. Biden also said that job losses averaged about 35,000 for November and December 2009, and January of 2010, which is also correct. Because Biden is not quite right on the first part of his statement, we'll knock him down a point. As a result, we find his claim to be Mostly True.

pomt-07640	"Put simply, less government spending equals more private sector jobs."	half-true	/virginia/statements/2011/mar/16/eric-cantor/eric-spending-says-less-government-spending-equals/	Rep. Eric Cantor, R-Va., has focused on two topics since becoming House majority leader in January: spending and jobs. He linked the two in a March 4 news release. "To put it simply: less government spending equals more private sector jobs." We set out to see if economists -- and past economic data -- agree with Cantor, who returned to this theme in a March 15 press conference with other Republicans. First we looked for occasions where government spending has decreased. There have been three since World War II: At the end of that war, with government spending falling in the 1946, 1947 and 1948 fiscal years. During the Korean War, followed by a drop of 6.9 percent in 1954 and a further decline of 3.4 percent the following year. From 1964 to 1965, with spending falling 0.25 percent. That a large decrease came after World War II should come as little surprise, as government spending went from $9.14 billion in 1939 to $92.71 billion in 1945, with the American government essentially funding most of the global war effort against Germany and Japan. As the U.S. economy returned to peacetime status, government spending fell by 40.4 percent in the 1946 fiscal year, 37.5 percent the next year and 13.7 percent the year after that. Comparing spending data to job data is tricky, in part because the Treasury Department, which tracks spending and Gross Domestic Product, operates on a fiscal year that runs from Oct. 1 until Sept. 30. Before 1976 the fiscal year ran July 1 through June 30. The Bureau of Labor Statistics, by contrast, operates on calendar years. In 1946 private sector employment soared, driven by millions of veterans who came home, left the military and returned to former jobs or took new ones. Strong employment growth continued in 1947 before tailing off in 1948. But again, these changes reflected far more than a cut in government spending. The American economy was far and away the world’s strongest after the war, with much of Europe’s industrial capacity ruined by six years of terrible devastation. What about the mid-1950s? Government spending fell during two consecutive fiscal years. Private sector jobs dropped in 1954 by 585,000, grew by 2.3 million in 1955 and then climbed by 673,000 in 1956. In the final case the U.S. economy added more than 2 million private sector jobs in both 1965 and 1966. Brian Riedl, a research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, suggested we also look at job expansion in years where government spending grew at a slower rate than GDP. In those years the government essentially becomes a smaller part of the overall economy. This occurred five times during the 1983 through 1988 fiscal years, and each year the economy had strong employment growth, adding more than 1.5 million jobs annually. In 1983 and 1984, more than 3.4 million annual jobs were added, though that was also a period when the United States was recovering from the severe recession of 1981 and 1982. GDP also grew faster than government spending between 1992 and 2000. The U.S. gained jobs each of those years, and in all but two of those years more than 2 million private sector jobs were added to the economy. The low point was 1992, when 915,000 new jobs were created. So again, large job growth has often happened during times when government spending was decreasing or growing slower than GDP. But several economists told us we should not confuse correlation -- the fact that these two things were happening at the same time -- with causation. Government spending has historically risen during times of recession, as Uncle Sam seeks to prop up the economy. And social programs such as unemployment insurance or food stamps cost more when more people are out of work. At the same time, tax revenue is falling because people who lose jobs pay far less income tax. Riedl, who said he strongly believes cutting government spending helps grow the private sector, noted that the positive impacts occur in the long-run, not the short-term. "When federal spending drops that leaves more money for the private sector," he said. "That’s a neutral effect. But over time the private sector is more likely to spend the money in [more] productive ways than the government, and to invest it better than the government." The Heritage economist said the lag time for these benefits depends on how the private sector spends any additional funds. Investments in new factories or research projects can take years to return profits to a company and the economy. Cantor’s staff said their claim was based in part on a blog post by John Taylor, an economist from Stanford University. Taylor has long argued against the stimulus spending. On his blog he disputes reports by Moody’s economist Mark Zandi that the $61 billion in spending cuts proposed by the House GOP would cost the economy 700,000 jobs over 2011 and 2012. Taylor said that if the government can produce a "credible" debt-reduction plan it should "increase economic growth and reduce unemployment by removing uncertainty and lowering the chances of large tax increases in the future." The removal of uncertainty would also stimulate higher investment spending -- on both employees and technology -- by American businesses, Taylor believes. His calls were echoed in a February 13 letter to President Barack Obama from about 150 economists. The letter said action should be taken to immediately "rein in federal spending." Cantor and other House Republicans are also citing a new report on government spending by Andrew Biggs, Kevin Hassett and Matt Jensen, scholars at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. The report, essentially an extended version of a Dec. 29, 2010 op-ed that ran in The Wall Street Journal, stated that cutting federal spending is the most efficient way to balance the budget and feed future economic growth. They claimed deficit reduction programs fail if they are too reliant on tax increases. Chris Edwards, director tax policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said the GOP is right to pursue spending cuts. But he said the argument that spending cuts would definitely create more private-sector jobs is rooted in political rhetoric, not economic fact. "I’m not sure talking about jobs is the way to go," Edwards said. "The unemployment rate has more to do with microeconomic factors" than federal spending plans. Edwards added that the U.S. budget deficit may be increasing uncertainty and making businesses more cautious about hiring, but he said it is virtually impossible to quantify the size of this impact. Not all economists are convinced the cuts will have a positive impact on jobs. Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Brookings Institution, said the short-term impact of a spending cut is usually negative. Consider, for example, the $61 billion cut proposed by House Republicans for the current fiscal year. If approved, Burtless said, government agencies might find themselves cutting back on contracts with private companies. Those companies, having less business, might then need to lay off employees to maintain their profits. "Let’s say a cut to the defense procurement budget leads to a loss of 300,000 defense industry jobs," Burtless said by way of example. "To have any benefit, we now need to add 300,000 jobs to replace the lost ones, then add more." Stressing that he does not think the long-term benefits match up to Cantor’s claim, Burtless said that even if it is true, the private sector makes hiring decisions based on economic demand or the need to increase production. The only way to reduce unemployment, he added, is for product demand to increase. Let’s review. Cantor says "less government spending equals more private sector jobs." His staff cites letters and articles by a group of economists. Total federal spending has only decreased a few times in the past 70 years, and the only large drops came at the end of World War II and the Korean War. Private sector jobs increased after both of those wars, but the gains were driven by many factors, including the return to a peace-time economy and the demobilization of millions of soldiers, many of whom went directly into the private work force. During larges stretches of the 1980s and 1990s government spending grew at a slower rate than the overall economy, and large job growth occurred. But economists warned us there is a not a direct link between spending policies and job policies. Cantor may be right with his prescription of lower spending to spur higher job growth. But he goes too far when he asserts a cut equals more private sector jobs. No one knows for sure. The congressman is presenting an economic theory as established fact. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-01244	"Proximity to high-voltage power lines lowers property values by as much as 30 percent."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/nov/16/friends-india-point-park/india-point-park-group-says-proximity-large-power-/	For more than a decade, residents and officials from Providence and East Providence have lobbied to have the high-voltage power lines that traverse the waterfront along India Point Park buried. The latest estimate to complete the job is $33.9 million, with a 25 percent contingency fund, meaning costs could be as low as $25 million or as high as $42 million, according to figures made public by National Grid. The Friends of India Point Park, the group that has led the effort to move the power lines underground and take down the poles and towers that support them, argues that the project is worthwhile, primarily because it will remove what its members contend is a visual blight along the shores of East Providence and Providence. Burying the lines would improve the scenic beauty of the park and make the vacant land abutting it near Route 195 more marketable -- and more valuable, the group argues. "Proximity to high-voltage power lines lowers property values by as much as 30%," the group says on its website, adding that multiple studies bear this out. We were curious if there really is a negative effect on property values and, if there is, whether it’s that large. We called David Riley, the co-chairman of Friends of India Point Park, for more information. He sent us a lot of documents and references to back up the claim -- burying us in information, so to speak -- but we decided to start with a paper published in 2010 in the Journal of Real Estate Literature that is cited on his group’s website. That paper, written by a Texas A&M University professor and a colleague, reviewed more than a half-century of studies on the effects of electric transmission lines on property values. The studies included a 1992 survey of appraisers, with the majority of respondents saying that high-voltage power lines would lower the market value of a nearby property by 10 percent on average. They also included sales price analyses. Many were inconclusive or failed to quantify an effect. One 1979 model predicted a 6-percent decrease for homes between 50 and 200 feet of power lines. Another 1995 study said the effect was a drop in value of less than 5 percent and another done in 2002 in an area near Montreal put it at 9.6 percent on average. None mentioned a decrease of 30 percent. "The studies reviewed, while having some inconsistencies in their detailed results, generally pointed to small or no effects on sales price due to the presence of electric transmission lines," the authors said. That didn’t sound like it supported the Providence group’s claim. So we looked at what Riley sent us. His documents included a summary on the previously cited Montreal study that described the negative price effect as "ranging from 5% to well in excess of 20%." We got a copy of that 2002 study. Although it said that the average decrease was smaller, it did find a 21-percent decrease in residential sales prices for an area of homes within 50 feet of high-voltage power lines. We found separate studies in Canada carried out in relation to a power line outside Vancouver that found negative price effects of up to 27 percent for homes in close proximity, according to a report on a transmission line proposal in Alberta. Riley also sent us part of a report on property values near a power line outside of Houston. That 1993 report found that assessed values of properties abutting the easement for the power line were up to 31 percent less than those farther away. And he sent an excerpt from a 2012 report on sales in Montana that found a decrease in the values of homes in a subdivision near a transmission line of 25 percent to 30 percent. Lastly, we found two references (here and here) to a study in Quebec that found that values of second home lots near a high-voltage power line along recreational land were up to 34 percent lower than expected. (Because the study is in French -- and our last French class was in high school -- we were reliant on secondary sources that summarized it.) We called Providence-based real estate appraiser Tom Andolfo, who has chaired the Rhode Island chapters of the Appraisal Institute and the Real Estate Appraisers Board, to get his view. In testimony before state regulators in 1994 on removing the power lines that cross from East Providence to Providence, he cited the 31 percent number from the Houston study. He told us, however, that he believes the actual effect is not as large. "A realistic figure could be from 5 to 15 percent," he said. But Riley said he believes that because the power lines running across East Providence and Providence are on the water, the effect on property values would likely be at the upper range of figures cited in the studies. "It … seems logical to me that power lines obstructing water views will likely depress property values more than wires in front of, say, buildings, because they'll be more conspicuous and obstructing a more pleasant, valued view that owners are paying for," he told us. Our ruling The Friends of India Point Park says that proximity to high-voltage power lines lowers property values by as much as 30 percent. There are many studies on the effects of power lines on property values. Nearly all of the ones that we found determined that there was a negative effect on values. But they differ widely in what that effect actually is. Most put it at less than 10 percent. But we found four studies in the United States and Canada that found decreases that ranged from close to 30 percent to more than 30 percent. They appeared to be isolated cases, but they did occur, according to the studies. The Friends of India Point Park does not say that such a price effect is the norm. The group only says that a decrease in value can be as much as 30 percent. Riley says that language was chosen on purpose. (There’s also some question about what the group means by "proximity) but we won’t get into that here.) Because the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details -- the preponderance of studies showing property value decreases of 10 percent or less -- we rate it Half True.

pomt-08816	This year, Newt Gingrich "has raised as much money as Mitt Romney, Tim Pawlenty, Sarah Palin, and Mike Huckabee combined."	true	/georgia/statements/2010/aug/15/esquire-magazine/magazine-says-newt-gingrich-leads-fundraising/	Twelve years after he resigned amid Republican Party defeats and ethics troubles, former longtime Georgia Congressman Newt Gingrich is "ascendant," a recent Esquire magazine article reported. Gingrich, who gained renown for helping orchestrate the historic 1994 Republican takeover of Congress, has managed to maintain his position as the party's philosopher king, according to "Newt Gingrich: The Indispensable Republican" a profile by John H. Richardson. This accomplishment may have produced real political gains. Although Gingrich has not said he is running, he is an early leader in polling for the 2012 presidential election, the article said. Plus, he's trouncing the competition in the thing that matters most in contemporary politics: raising cash. This year, Gingrich "has raised as much money as Mitt Romney, Tim Pawlenty, Sarah Palin, and Mike Huckabee combined," the article states. Is he really beating all of them? Even Palin? Granted, the 2012 race is far from beginning in earnest, and Gingrich's real chances are unclear. Thanks in part to his conservative fan base, his name comes up regularly as a possible presidential contender, but he has yet to commit. Still, his fundraising is well worth a look. Even though it's not clear whether Gingrich plans to run for president, federal law allows him to operate a "527 group," a type of political organization capable of raising massive amounts of money. His American Solutions for Winning the Future raised the cash mentioned in the Esquire article. It describes itself as "a unique tri-partisan organization designed to rise above traditional gridlocked partisanship, to provide real, significant solutions to the most important issues facing our country." American Solutions has opposed stringent regulation of the energy industry and advocated for giving more leeway to school districts that want to fire mediocre teachers, among other things. One of Esquire's fact-checkers backed up the article's claim by pointing us to a page on the website of Media Matters for America,a liberal group that fact-checks claims by the media. It referenced articles about the fundraising efforts of various political action committees, or PACs, and American Solutions. They show that American Solution's haul dwarfed those of the PACs for potential political candidates. So what are PACs and 527 groups? We asked Paul Ryan,an attorney for the Campaign Legal Center,which advocates for campaign finance reform and strengthening federal ethics rules and enforcement. We also consulted Federal Election Commission rules and tax code. It's complicated, so bear with us. 527 groups are a type of nonprofit named after the section of federal tax code that outlines what they can do. They exist to raise money to get a candidate elected. Political action committees, or PACs, raise money to elect candidates, too. Many are also free from paying income tax under the same code that creates 527 groups. There are several types of PACs, and the kind that's controlled by candidates can't accept money directly from corporations or labor unions. They have strict donation limits that can be as small as $2,400 per individual. 527 groups such as Gingrich's try hard to avoid being regulated as a PAC, and that's a tricky business. A bunch of local, state and federal laws chime in on what it means to be a PAC, but if a 527 can avoid being pigeonholed, the payoff is big: Corporations and labor unions can give non-PAC 527 groups as much money as they choose and as often as they want. According to OpenSecrets.org, Newt Gingrich's 527 received $350,000 from a single corporate donor during the 2010 election cycle. Politicians interested in running for major offices find it useful to start 527s or PACs to lay the groundwork for their campaigns. They help them exert influence over issues or races. Which one they start depends on how they want to spend. Yes, 527s can raise far more money, but PACs can do things that 527s can't. For instance, by law, current federal officeholders have to play by PAC rules when they raise funds. And it's easier for a PAC to give money to a specific candidate. So 527 groups and PACs are not the same thing, a fact that the Esquire article acknowledges, albeit imperfectly. It said that 527s are barred from promoting the interests of a specific candidate when, in fact, that's what they're all about. But a lot of them avoid contributing to candidates to duck being regulated under tougher PAC rules. Pawlenty, who is governor of Minnesota, does not have a 527 group, a PAC staffer confirmed. Press representatives of the other candidates did not respond to our requests for comment, and a Web search found no evidence that they currently have 527 groups either. Now it's time to examine the numbers. We looked up American Solutions' Internal Revenue Services filings, plus the FEC filings for the PACs of Huckabee, Palin, Pawlenty and Romney. By June 30, American Solutions had raised $6,081,984.00.The others had raised $6,015,422.33. Gingrich wins. Federal filings confirm that Gingrich has indeed raised more than the other candidates combined -- but with a very important caveat. Comparing 527 groups with PACs is not entirely fair because it's much easier for a 527 group to raise money. The Esquire article acknowledged the difference between PACs and 527 groups. And while it mixed up some details, it got right the overall point that they're hard to compare. Given that Esquire gave its statement adequate context, we rule this statement True.

pomt-12154	"We’re spending 18 percent of our GDP on healthcare while the average among industrialized countries is closer to 8 percent."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2017/aug/09/mike-gallagher/mike-gallagher-target-claim-health-care-costs-us-v/	Since his arrival in Congress in January 2017, first-term U.S. Rep. Mike Gallagher, (R-Green Bay) has gotten a crash course in health-care politics. When he was interviewed July 9, 2017, on "Upfront with Mike Gousha," a public affairs show that airs on WISN-TV (Channel 12), Gallagher reiterated his support for repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act, but said the issues with health care in the U.S. are deeper than those the now-stalled House bill tried to address. "Whatever we’re doing right now with our health care system is not working," he said, later adding: "The biggest source of frustration for me, as a new member of Congress, is we’re having this debate over health insurance reform when, really, we need to turn to the drivers of health care costs in this country." Then he offered this statistic: "We’re spending 18 percent of our GDP on health care while the average among industrialized countries is closer to 8 percent." Is he right about the numbers? The numbers Gallagher drew his statistics from two reports, according to Madison Wiberg, his communications director. The U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) tracks the nation’s expenditures on health care over time. Those numbers show the U.S. spent 17.8 percent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on healthcare in 2015, the most recent year for which data is available. The 8 percent came from the amount the U.K. spent of its GDP in 2013 (actually 8.8 percent), according to Wiberg. That number came from a 2015 report from the Commonwealth Fund, a private foundation that aims to improve health care systems in industrialized nations through funding independent research. But Gallagher’s claim referenced the average of all industrialized nations, not just England. The average high-income nation actually spent 10.6 percent of its GDP on health care in 2015 according to an analysis by the Kaiser Family Foundation. That gap between the U.S. and other developed nations is longstanding and well-known. But the difference isn’t one that began with the passing or even the implementation of the Affordable Care Act, often termed Obamacare. Kaiser found that the gap between the U.S. and other high-income nations has been growing since about 1980. In the four decades since, the percentage of GDP in the U.S. spent on health care shot up from 6 percent (on par with other high-income countries at the time) to the 17.8 percent in 2015. In comparison, the Netherlands, the next highest spender, used 12 percent of its GDP on care. When spending is measured by person, the picture is not much different. At $9,451 per person, the U.S. spends almost twice the average for comparable countries, $4,908, according to data from the Organisation for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD). For a while, the rate of growth was slowing, both in the U.S. and abroad. A 2015 report by The Commonwealth Fund listed the slowdown as a key finding and data from the 2017 annual National Health Spending report by the CMS showed the same slowdown from about 2003 to 2013. In 2014 and 2015, the major provisions of the ACA were implemented and CMS reported increases in spending growth comparable to periods of recession. The difference, according to the paper, was "from 2013 to 2015 the number of uninsured individuals fell by 15.0 million, and the insured share of the population reached 90.9 percent." In other words, the spending went up in part because more people were insured. More for our money? While it does not impact our rating, we thought we’d take a quick look at how the U.S. stacks up in terms of outcomes. According to most recent data from the OECD, American life expectancy at birth was 78.8 in 2015, the 9th lowest of 34 OECD nations (the data does not include Canada). In a 2013 report, "U.S. Health in International Perspective: Shorter Lives, Poorer Health," authors wrote that even Americans in advantaged demographics -- "white, insured, college-educated or upper income" -- have worse health outcomes than similar people abroad. The panel found that in addition to obesity and other lifestyle-related issues, Americans are worse off than their foreign counterparts with respect to drug use, HIV/AIDS, lung disease (even though other countries smoke more). The list goes on: Americans are dying of heart disease more often. They’re having limbs amputated due to diabetes complications more often. In two areas, the U.S. fared better -- Americans are less likely to die from cancer and received better end-of-life care. "Almost always, Americans were in poorer health," said Steven Woolf of Virginia Commonwealth University, who chaired the National Academies committee that did the report. The researchers identified five overlapping reasons for the discrepancy: a health system where people lack access to basic care and insurance coverage, behaviors such as alcohol abuse and overeating, social and economic conditions, physical environments (for instance, we drive more than we walk or bike), and public policies and social values that fail to consider health impacts. Our rating Gallagher said "We’re spending 18 percent of our GDP on health care while the average among industrialized countries is closer to 8 percent." His number for the U.S. spending is on target, but the one he uses for other industrialized nations is a bit low. That said, he’s right about his major point: The U.S. has long outspent industrialized nations on health care -- a trend that began long before the implementation of Obamacare.

pomt-01143	"A lot of what (Cuba’s) survival depends on is Venezuelan oil money, which is drying up."	mostly true	/punditfact/statements/2014/dec/18/ana-navarro/navarro-cubas-economy-survives-largely-venezuelan-/	President Barack Obama’s historic decision to open full diplomatic relations with Cuba has appalled many opponents of the Castro regime. Among their biggest complaints is that Cuba got huge concessions from the United States without being required to make fundamental changes to its political system. CNN contributor and Republican strategist Ana Navarro also argued that Obama could have outwaited the Castro brothers, Fidel and Raul. The Cuban economy is in shambles, Navarro told CNN’s Anderson Cooper. "A lot of what their survival depends on is Venezuelan oil money, which is drying up," Navarro said. "Now that we are so close to the end of those two dictators -- who have oppressed these people for over half a century -- now we're going to change and do it unilaterally without them lifting the oppression?" The Cuba-Venezuela connection has been on the lips of many commentators since the news broke. We thought it would be good to put a number to Venezuela’s generosity toward Cuba and to what extent that aid is a matter of life or death for the Cuban economy. Cuba and Venezuela have been joined at the hip in their shared antipathy toward the United States. The superpower to the north sees both governments as fundamentally opposed to political freedom and free markets. In return, leaders in Cuba and Venezuela regularly speak out against the United States. Out of this tension emerged a deal between Cuba and Venezuela. Cuba sent tens of thousands of medical staff and other skilled professionals to treat Venezuela’s poor and otherwise aid the government. In exchange, Venezuela sent Cuba oil and provided money to modernize that country’s infrastructure. The plunging price of oil has put the basic tenets of that swap in jeopardy, experts say. Cuba’s supply line We found estimates that Venezuela sends about 80,000 to 100,000 barrels of oil per day. Luis R. Luis is the former chief economist with the Organization of American States, an international body with representatives of governments that span from Canada to Argentina. Luis told PunditFact the swap means a lot to Cuba. "Venezuelan oil and transfers play a key role in allowing the country to import essential foodstuffs, medicines and industrial inputs," Luis said. "The value of oil plus investments and grants from Venezuela to Cuba varies greatly from year to year largely because of oil price fluctuations. In 2008 it was over 10 percent of GDP. Last year some 6 percent of GDP. This year less." Former International Monetary Fund economist Ernesto Hernandez-Cata offered a slightly higher estimate of "just over $7 billion, or 11 percent of Cuba’s GDP," in 2011. Whatever the exact percentage, and even though the aid has been falling, Venezuela pulls a lot of weight in the Cuban economy. University of Maryland economist Roger Betancourt said that impact only grows when you factor in trade between the two nations. Betancourt, who co-founded the Association for the Study of the Cuban Economy, said Venezuela accounts for about 40 percent of Cuba’s trade in goods. We found another estimate that put Venezuelan purchases at 20 percent of Cuba’s GDP. Why would Venezuela stop helping Cuba? Venezuela has seen the price it receives for sending oil overseas fall 40 percent this year because of the drop of oil prices worldwide. And oil revenues account for about 95 percent of the country's export earnings, according to the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries. As such, Venezuela faces an economic collapse that include defaulting on its debts. "You only need to look at the economic disaster that is Venezuela, and clearly it’s a bad bet to have all your chips in one basket," Christopher Sabatini, policy director at Council of the Americas, told Bloomberg. "That 100,000 barrels per day gift of oil is going to end very soon." Not a matter of life or death While the Venezuelan connection is hefty, its importance can be overblown. Hernandez-Cata ran the numbers and found that if the aid stopped, Cuba's real GDP would contract "somewhere between 7 percent and 10 percent" without Venezuelan oil. Which would be no garden party for Cuba, but as Hernandez-Cata noted, the country emerged from a fall of 38 percent in GDP when the USSR cut off its economic support in the early 1990s. And today, Cuba has been moving to diversify. "Current efforts to obtain financing at non-market terms from other countries, like Algeria, Angola and Brazil, would, if successful, diminish the magnitude of the shock," Hernandez-Cata wrote. A longtime critic of the Castro regime, Pedro A. Freyre, a partner in the law firm of Akerman LLP, is skeptical of the doom and gloom predictions of Cuba’s precarious economy. "Cuba has turned surviving misery into an art," Freyre said. "Cuba has been diminishing expectations for decades. Everything collapsed in 1992. It was a disaster and they survived." For the record, Freyre, who lost a brother-in-law in the failed U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs assault on Cuba in 1961, now favors normal diplomatic relations. Our ruling Navarro said a lot of Cuba’s survival depends on Venezuelan oil money, and that it's drying up. The data we found and the experts we reached back that up, to a point. Venezuelan aid added at least 6 percent to Cuba’s GDP last year. Venezuela is also a major trading partner, buying as much as 40 percent of Cuba’s trade in goods. The loss of direct support from Venezuela could cause a 7 to 10 percent drop in Cuba’s GDP, experts told us. While that hasn't happened yet, it's certainly a strong possibility. Though Cuba has been moving to reduce its dependency on Venezuela, and has a track record of making it through tough times, that would still be a significant hit. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-04903	Says the "largest tax increase in American history is set to occur on January 1st unless President Obama and Congress can come to an agreement."	half-true	/texas/statements/2012/aug/03/francisco-quico-canseco/quico-canseco-says-bush-cuts-expiring-would-cause-/	EDITOR’S NOTE: A reader emailed us to point out that we got one tax-cut option backwards in the next-to-last paragraph. Nobody’s considering giving tax cuts only to the wealthy; rather, one option is to extend the tax cuts for everyone but the wealthy. The tax increase figure is given correctly, though: Letting the tax cuts expire for the wealthy would translate to a tax increase of about 0.4 percent of GDP. We’ve corrected the sentence below, and it does not affect our calculations. U.S. Rep. Francisco "Quico" Canseco opened a recent email blast by saying that an historic tax surge has his attention. "As you may know," the San Antonio Republican wrote constituents, "the largest tax increase in American history is set to occur on January 1st unless President Obama and Congress can come to an agreement." His email also says the Republican-majority House would vote later that week on preventing the increases. Canseco was hardly the first advocate to declare that the tax hike would be record-setting. When the tax cuts put in place under President George W. Bush were last up for renewal in 2010, "largest ever" became a rallying cry of sorts for congressional Republicans and news entities alike. In a Fox News Sunday appearance that year, former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin made a similar claim. At the time, PolitiFact ruled her claim "Pants On Fire" because she was wrong about the ranking and incorrectly described the Democrats' plans. The tax-related figures haven’t changed much since. Estimates vary as to how much taxes would rise if the Bush-era tax cuts were allowed to expire without exceptions. Congress approved the tax breaks in 2001 through the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act, and adjusted them in 2003 through the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act. The tax cuts were set to expire in 2010, because they passed Congress through a procedure known as reconciliation, which only requires 50 votes in the Senate. But, after a heated debate, lawmakers voted in 2010 to extend them for two more years. Some tax analysts have argued that, because the tax cuts were intended to be temporary, their expiration does not count as a tax increase. We’re not getting into that argument here. Most estimates for the increase caused by repealing the tax cuts hover around $3.7 trillion over 10 years, the number represented in the Congressional Budget Office’s Budget and Economic outlook from January 2012. (The number is listed under the category of "extend certain income tax and estate and gift tax," though analysts assured PolitiFact New Hampshire that it refers to the Bush tax cuts). Another $900 billion increase would stem from keeping the Alternative Minimum Tax from socking more taxpayers. In raw dollars, then, the resulting $4.6 trillion total would rank among the greatest tax increases in history. By email, Canseco’s spokeswoman, Kyler Arnold, pointed out by email that the CBO said in January 2012 that the impact of not extending the Bush-originated tax cuts would be about $5 trillion. Table 1-6 in the report indicates that the cumulative costs of extending the tax cuts and steadying the Alternative Minimum Tax through 2023 would be $5.3 trillion, counting nearly $800 billion in debt service. But there’s a better way to compare the potential increase with tax increases through history. Economists do this by calculating tax increases as a percentage of the gross domestic product, or GDP. GDP means a country's entire annual economic economic output; it's a way of measuring the entire economy. If we calculate tax increases as a percentage of GDP, it means we don't have to worry about distortions from variables like inflation or economic growth. Spread over the next 10 years, the $4.6 trillion tax increase would amount to about 2.25 percent of the nation’s GDP. That figure, calculated with help from several tax analysts, starts from adding together the Budget Office’s projected GDP figures over the next 10 years, 2013-2022; then the total is divided by the $4.6 trillion figure. The result is higher than most tax increases in recent history, according to a 2006 U.S. Treasury report analyzing all tax measures since 1940. According to the report, the Bush tax cuts have held a higher percentage of the GDP than many of the biggest tax laws in recent history. It beats out the the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, which measured in at 1.23 percent of GDP by the time all its provisions went into effect in 1986. It also measures larger than the Revenue Act of 1941, which at $3.6 billion, amounted to 2.2 percent of GDP. Yet, according to the analysis, the Bush tax cuts fall well below the Revenue Act of 1942, which is estimated at 5.04 percent of GDP. That act passed into law after the United States entered World War II. And this would make the Bush tax cuts, should they expire, the second-largest tax increase in history, as a percentage of GDP. "There is no doubt, if all the (Bush) tax cuts were allowed to expire, this would have a very big impact," Howard Gleckman, an analyst at the Tax Policy Center, an independent tax analysis group, told PolitiFact New Hampshire. Gleckman, author of the blog TaxVox.org, continued: "But, if you’re asking the question, would it be the largest tax increase ever, the answer is no." By email, Arnold pointed out the 1942 tax increase included a 5 percent "Victory" income tax add-on that was repealed in 1944 "and never designed to be a permanent tax increase" while, she said, "the tax increase set to occur at the end of the year is a permanent tax increase, absent legislative action. Comparing a tax bill (including a temporary tax increase for the war) to a permanent tax increase is not apples to apples." We ran Arnold’s thought by Gleckman, who pointed out that when they passed into law, the Bush tax cuts had a built-in end date -- one since extended by Congress. Broadly, he said, all tax laws are temporary in that sense, though Bush’s cuts were explicitly temporary. Gleckman agreed that ending the Bush tax cuts would result in the biggest hike by the GDP gauge since 1942. However, he said, the difference between the No. 1 and speculated-about No. 2 tax increase, 2.25 percent of GDP versus 5 percent, is huge. "This is like saying the horse that came in second by 20 lengths almost won," he said by phone. Broadly, as Gleckman notes, few in Washington expect the Bush tax cuts to expire in full. Rather, the debate this year has centered on whether to extend the tax breaks for everyone or extend them for all but the nation’s highest earners. If only cuts for the most wealthy residents were allowed to expire, it would mean a tax increase of about 0.4 percent of GDP. Our ruling The trillions of dollars at stake with the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts places them among the nation’s most costly. Still, the cuts, if allowed to expire, would amount to less than half the percentage of the gross domestic product reflected in the 1942 tax increase. We rate Canseco’s claim as Half True.

pomt-05594	"There is not one single federal housing program yet that has not needed a bailout to survive."	half-true	/georgia/statements/2012/mar/30/lynn-westmoreland/westmoreland-all-federal-housing-programs-need-bai/	U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland thinks taxpayers may be dragged into the bailout business again, thanks to the Federal Housing Administration. The FHA provides mortgage insurance to encourage banks to write loans to people who have little cash for a down payment. Many of these loans went bad when the housing bubble burst, and FHA officials are trying to raise money to keep the insurance afloat. It’s not the first time, Westmoreland said during a Feb. 29 congressional hearing. "There’s not been one single federal housing program yet that has not needed a bailout to survive," Westmoreland said. All federal housing programs? We contacted a Westmoreland spokeswoman to get the story. Leslie Shedd, the spokeswoman, said Westmoreland was referring to three programs that were started to keep the housing market stable and encourage Americans to buy homes: Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHA. Here’s how the feds got involved in the housing market: After the real estate market collapsed during the Great Depression, the feds took steps to encourage banks to make home loans and families to buy houses. They created the FHA, which issues mortgage insurance to guarantee that banks will get their money back even if a homeowner doesn’t make payments. This encourages banks to approve mortgages for people who don’t have a lot of money or have mediocre credit. They also created Fannie Mae, and later Freddie Mac, to help lenders raise money to make more loans. Fannie and Freddie do this by selling the mortgages lenders’ make in bulk as securities and guaranteeing they will make a return. Other programs perform similar tasks. For instance, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, like the FHA, insures home loans, but only for houses in rural areas. The Office of Public and Indian Housing backs them for native lands, while the Department of Veterans Affairs guarantees them for veterans. Ginnie Mae, like Fannie and Freddie, guarantees mortgage securities, but its securities are made up of government-backed loans by the FHA, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and Public and Indian Housing. This is what our research found: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac Fannie and Freddie were bailed out by taxpayers in 2008. But calling them "federal housing programs" is a thorny issue. They weren’t controlled by the government until the bailout. Congress chartered Fannie and Freddie as "government-sponsored enterprises," or GSEs. They are supposed to help the U.S. meet its housing policy goals, but they were designed as for-profit corporations with their own shareholders and boards of directors. The federal government explicitly said it did not back the GSEs’ securities. "They are in no way categorized as federal housing programs," said Ted Gayer, co-director of the economic studies program at the Brookings Institution. The feds estimate the bailout will cost between $220 billion and $311 billion through 2014, though some of that will be paid back. Federal Housing Administration The president’s proposed budget for 2013 says the U.S. Treasury might have to give the FHA $688 million in emergency funds, but whether help will come in the form of a taxpayer-funded bailout is uncertain. The FHA hiked the cost of mortgage insurance earlier this month to raise money, and it is set to receive about $1 billion from a legal settlement over fraudulent foreclosure practices. Its officials say these measures will avoid a bailout, but critics say this won’t be enough. Ginnie Mae Ginnie Mae hasn’t been bailed out, and it’s not clear it’s in dire trouble. A November 2011 General Accounting Office report found that higher-than-expected defaults could force Ginnie Mae to dip into its reserves. It also concluded that Ginnie should do better at predicting future costs and documenting its methods. But so far, Ginnie has taken in more money than it has spent, the GAO said. All the rest The remainder of the federal programs are smaller players in the mortgage markets. As of the second quarter of 2011, the FHA backed nearly $1 trillion in single-family loans. Veterans Affairs backed less than a quarter of that, while the USDA backed some 7 percent, according to data from the federal agency that took over Fannie and Freddie. They have yet to run into the kinds of trouble that Fannie, Freddie and the FHA are experiencing. The USDA and PIH have not needed a bailout so far, but Edward Pinto, a former Fannie Mae executive and scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, warns the USDA might need one, in part because it makes riskier loans. The FHA requires down payments of 3.5 percent. The USDA allows loans with no money down. As for Veterans Affairs, the word "bailout" does not apply. Whenever one of its loans defaults, taxpayers automatically pick up the tab. The program is not expected to pay for itself. Conclusion Westmoreland’s claim that "there is not one single federal housing program yet that has not needed a bailout to survive" has shortcomings. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been bailed out. And the FHA is in need of help, though it has not been bailed out at this point. But Fannie and Freddie did not come under federal control until 2008. They are strange creatures on the U.S. financial landscape. They were created by the government but operated independently until the housing bust. At that time, they were bailed out by the feds. The three other federal housing efforts have not been bailed out. And it’s not clear that they will need taxpayer assistance. Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the FHA are much larger players in the housing market. This bolsters Westmoreland’s larger point that organizations designed to help the housing market need help, too.

pomt-00641	Georgia is on track for 1,200 traffic fatalities this year, a reversal of nine years of declines.	true	/georgia/statements/2015/may/20/russell-mcmurry/already-deadly-georgia-roads/	PolitiFact Georgia was revving up for the summer driving season when a statement from the head of the Georgia Department of Transportation caught our attention. The state is on pace to see 1,200 people lose their lives on Georgia roads this year, Commissioner Russell McMurry said in news reports. If that happens, it would be a reversal after nine years of declines. Is that possible, even before the busy season of summer? We set aside our packing – we’ll decide on a bikini or one-piece later – and decided to check. As recently as January, PolitiFact Georgia confirmed that road fatalities appeared to be declining again in Georgia. But by April, when five Georgia Southern nursing students died in a pileup crash outside Savannah, scores of single-car crashes had sent the trend line in the other direction. As of Tuesday morning, 465 people had been killed in vehicle crashes in Georgia, state DOT data show. That’s 69 more deaths, or 17 percent more, than during the same period in 2014. That keeps Georgia with an average of 100 deaths a month, which would result in a year-end total of 1,200 deaths for the first time since 2011. It would also be the first year-to-year increase in nine years, as this chart shows: Year 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Totals 1,505 1,298 1,250 1,236 1,199 1,189 1,169 So the GDOT commissioner is right on the overall numbers – a scary enough prospect. But to compare apples to apples, it’s worth calculating the rates of death as well. That is, would the current pace create the first year deaths don’t decline relative to the number of cars on the road, too? Yes, according to data from the state Department of Revenue. The number of vehicles registered annually is: Year 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Totals* 8.64 8.57 8.59 8.71 8.92 8.32 8.80 9.12 *In millions, rounded In 2008, there were about 8.6 million registered vehicles in Georgia. That translates into 1.7 deaths for every 10,000 registered car or truck. In 2014, with nearly 8.8 million registered vehicles but fewer fatalities, the rate dropped to .1.3 deaths for every 10,000 vehicles. Should Georgia stay on pace to an even 1,200 deaths – improbable but an exact number to compare against the 9.1 million vehicles registered this year – the rate holds at 1.3 deaths. It’s not an increase, of course. But it’s not the steady decline in rate, as well as overall numbers, that transportation officials had hoped to see continue and that McMurry noted. And, the rate still means that more people are dying in traffic accidents at a time when the state has seen 95 percent compliance in seat belt usage – a large factor in reducing fatalities, said Teri Pope, a spokeswoman for the Northeast DOT region. DOT data shows that 62 percent of people killed in crashes are not wearing the simple safety devices. "A lot of these deaths are preventable, and that’s the heartbreaking part of it," Pope said. In other words, driver behavior is the, well, driver of the spike in roadway deaths. In an effort to counter that, the DOT has partnered with the Governor’s Office on Highway Safety and the state Department of Public Safety to launch the Drive Alert, Arrive Alive campaign. The effort focuses on education efforts about the dangers of driving drowsy or while using mobile phones – both considered distracted driving – and greater enforcement of seat belt usage and safe driving. In other words, PolitiFact Georgia expects to see lots of safety reminder signs and state troopers on the roads. You should, too. Our ruling Georgia DOT Commissioner Russell McMurry said in recent news reports that the state is on pace to see 1,200 people die in traffic accidents this year – all before the start of the busy summer driving season. Transportation numbers back up that claim.

pomt-07201	Says the Ohio Consumers’ Council office employs 74 lawyers and that the funding them is wasteful duplication.	pants on fire!	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/07/bill-batchelder/ohio-house-speaker-william-g-batchelder-says-consu/	Absent a dramatic reversal, the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel will be classified a budget loser once lawmakers finalize the state’s two-year spending plan in the coming weeks. Republican Gov. John Kasich and Republican lawmakers have taken direct aim at the office, which is charged with protecting Ohio consumers in utility cases. The GOP-controlled House of Representatives supported Kasich’s proposal to cut 51 percent of the agency’s funding and added provisions to muzzle the office on issues related to natural gas markets and to eliminate the counsel’s call center, a repository for consumer complaints. National consumer groups sharply criticized the proposals, claiming they would prevent the office from fulfilling its mission. House Speaker William G. Batchelder, a Republican from Medina, was asked recently about the proposed cuts. Batchelder, echoing similar reasoning from Kasich, said the cuts are justified because the agency is overstaffed and because it plays a role similar to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio. Supporters of the consumers’ counsel say the office plays a watchdog role separate from the PUCO, which decides whether to approve rate increases the utilities propose. "There are 74, I believe, attorneys in that office," Batchelder said on the Ohio News Network’s "Capitol Square" on May 29. "Is that duplicative? Is it wasteful? And I think since the legislature was busy with an axe on everything else, it makes it pretty hard to sell having the duplication or having 74 lawyers. I don’t know how many the attorney general has." PolitiFact Ohio thought 74 seemed awfully high and decided to check out the speaker’s claim. It didn’t take long to conclude Batchelder was wrong. The agency has a total of 82 employees, according to a staff listing the OCC provided. Of those workers, only 14 are attorneys. Some workers are part-time, meaning the office’s staffing level equates to 72 full-time workers. "We currently have 12 attorneys on staff assigned to case work and two vacancies. In addition to the 12 staff attorneys, the Consumers’ Counsel Janine Migden-Ostrander and the Deputy Consumers’ Counsel Bruce Weston are also attorneys," OCC spokeswoman Beth Gianforcaro wrote in an e-mail. Other departments at the OCC include the analytical department, communications, operations and the call center. Migden-Ostrander has said a 51 percent budget cut – from $8.5 million to $4.1 million, as Kasich and the House proposed – would result in layoffs and the elimination of the call center. But cutting the agency’s budget won’t save the state money. The office is entirely funded from fees levied on the state’s utilities, not tax dollars. Spending less money on the OCC would only put money back in the utilities’ pockets. On May 31, the Senate unveiled its budget proposal, which reduced the OCC’s cut to 34 percent and removed the prohibition on the counsel talking about natural gas markets, which some called a "gag order." A spokesman for Batchelder said the speaker misspoke about the number of attorneys in the office. "He was trying to assert there were 74 employees at the office of the consumers’ counsel and not 74 attorneys," Batchelder spokesman Mike Dittoe said. "We apologize for the slip of the tongue there." We’ll allow that the speaker may have misspoke, rather than purposefully misused the statistics he cited. But he did repeat the inaccuracy, and wondered aloud how that number of lawyers compared with the staff of Attorney General Mike DeWine, Ohio’s top lawyer. And the number itself is so overstated that it ecllipses the total staffing level of the consumers’ counsel office. Furthermore, his complaint about duplication of services and wasteful spending when the state is "busy with an axe on everything" is misleading because funding for the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel doesn’t come from general tax revenues. Rather, it is raised through fees levied on utilities. PolitiFact Ohio has noted before that as speaker, Batchelder is one of the most influential politicians in the state and Ohioans listen to what he says. In this case, he made the claim on a television broadcast on a statewide news network. And in this case his statement is not just inaccurate, but also makes a ridiculous claim. When that happens, the Truth-O-Meter points to one rating: Pants on Fire.	None	William G. Batchelder	None	None	None	2011-06-07T06:00:00	2011-05-29	['None']

pomt-00603	"Thanks to restrictive and anticompetitive ballot laws," candidates in November 2014 ran unopposed in nearly half of Wisconsin’s state representative races but in Michigan and Minnesota nearly all races had challengers.	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/jun/03/andy-craig/ballot-laws-mean-only-half-assembly-races-are-cont/	When state Assembly seats are on the ballot, Wisconsin voters have far fewer candidates to choose from than residents of neighboring Minnesota and Michigan, a group called Competitive Elections Wisconsin claims. In a May 11, 2015 letter to Assembly Speaker Robin Vos (R-Rochester), a leader of the group who is also an official with the Libertarian Party of Wisconsin took the claim a step further. "The problem is simple. For all offices in Wisconsin, the number of signatures required for nomination petitions is too high," Andy Craig wrote in the letter, which was released publicly. "These levels are set such that incumbents and candidates with party backing can meet them with ease, but upstart challengers are often scared off from even attempting it." The result, Craig contends, is that nearly half of the candidates elected to the Wisconsin Assembly in November 2014 were alone on the general-election ballot. By contrast, he continued, "just 9 out of 134 Representatives ran unopposed in Minnesota. In Michigan all 110 State Representative elections were contested by both major parties." "It is hard to believe that people in Wisconsin are that much more disinterested in deciding who their legislators are," Craig wrote. Craig’s letter caught our attention. Wisconsin historically has high voter turnout. Can our legislative races be so uncompetitive -- and is it due to unusually high hurdles to candidacy? The evidence When we asked Craig, a 2014 Libertarian candidate for secretary of state, to back up his claim, he pointed to the Ballotpedia and Ballot Access News websites. The websites include tallies of contested races and state-by-state comparisons of candidacy requirements. Regarding the contention that lower ballot access hurdles result in more candidates and fewer uncontested elections, Craig told us, "that seems self-evident, primarily in the comparison to other states that make it easier." He also cited his experiences recruiting and assisting candidate, some of whom missed making the ballot because they couldn't get enough signatures in time. We checked with election experts and compiled our own tallies of contested races from state election websites. Here’s what we found: Michigan and Minnesota did have at least two candidates facing off in the 2014 general elections in virtually all cases cited. And Wisconsin’s Assembly candidates were unopposed in nearly half the races. (It should be noted that in 17 state Senate races, Wisconsin had only two without multiple candidates. But the group’s claim focused on Assembly races, and even when including both senators and representatives there are still far more uncontested races in Wisconsin than in the other two states.) That gap between those states is longstanding, according to research by the National Institute on Money in State Politics. And mirroring a national trend, Wisconsin has seen the number of uncontested Assembly races double since the mid-1970s, Ballotpedia reported. Why is there a gap? Now to the "why" part. Craig points out, correctly, that Michigan and Minnesota allow candidates to pay $100 filing fees to secure a ballot spot if they don’t want to collect signatures from residents. Wisconsin does not allow the filing fee option. Elsewhere in the Midwest, two others states with a lot of uncontested 2014 races -- neighboring Illinois and Iowa -- similarly have no option to forgo signature collection. Richard Winger, editor of Ballot Access News, said he thinks relatively more difficult ballot access rules explain the differences in those states. "Asking strangers for signatures is somewhat like hitch-hiking," Winger said. "It is psychologically difficult for most people to ask for favors from strangers." Winger is a widely quoted expert on ballot access laws and advocates for fairness in allowing minor party candidates on ballots. We heard a more skeptical view from Barry Burden, an expert in election administration at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. As parties, the Democrats and Republicans quality for ballot lines pretty easily in all three states, and there is little doubt that any of them would lose their status as major parties, Burden said. He added that it can be harder for minor party candidates to get on ballots. But the claim rests on what individuals have to do to get on ballots. The fee option might attract more candidates, Burden said, because it is low and, since it can be paid at the last moment, requires little organization or planning. But the signature requirements are also low, he said. That requirement is lower in Wisconsin (200 for Assembly candidates) than Minnesota (500) for major party candidates. In Michigan, the rule is 200 for major party candidates and 600 for independents. "Any candidate who has at least a skeletal organization or a little free time should be able to scoop up a couple hundred signatures without much trouble," Burden said. Burden and others suggest that other factors are at play. For the last two election cycles in Wisconsin, the redrawing of legislative district lines has helped to squelch competition, Burden said. As the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s Craig Gilbert reported in "Dividing Lines", that redistricting and the ultra-polarized geography of southeastern Wisconsin mean that "there are practically no competitive seats in the most populous part of this competitive swing state." Burden said party strategy differences can determine whether parties field candidates in "lost causes" areas. In Minnesota, Burden noted, public funding of elections there is more likely to enhance competition by luring in candidates who might otherwise believe they would be unable to compete financially. In Michigan, some have suggested that the state’s term limits enhance competition. Burden disagreed, saying that by creating automatic openings every six to eight years, term limits actually reduce competition in other years. Strong candidates, he said, typically wait to run until the incumbent is forced from office. Our rating Andy Craig of Competitive Elections Wisconsin claimed: "Thanks to restrictive and anticompetitive ballot laws," candidates in November 2014 ran unopposed in nearly half of Wisconsin’s state legislative races but in Michigan and Minnesota were challenged in nearly all races. There’s no dispute that Wisconsin dramatically lags those states in competitive races, and ballot access rule differences are one possible factor in that gap. But it’s clear that other factors are at play as well. We rate his claim Half True.	None	Andy Craig	None	None	None	2015-06-03T05:00:00	2015-05-11	['Minnesota', 'Michigan', 'Wisconsin']

pomt-04698	"Seven presidents before (Barack Obama) -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/05/julian-castro/julian-castro-says-seven-presidents-barack-obama-s/	President Barack Obama’s health care law has been one of the most polarizing aspects of his presidency, with Republicans criticizing it at every turn. But the keynote speaker at the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro, didn’t run from it. He applauded Obama for pursuing expanded health care -- and succeeding where his predecessors had failed. "Seven presidents before him -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans," Castro said. "President Obama got it done." We wondered whether Castro’s history was correct. So we checked with a variety of public policy and health care historians and found that Castro’s in the ballpark -- but that a lot of caveats are in order. Let’s start with the presidents who almost certainly fit Castro’s definition of having "tried to expand health care to all Americans." • Harry Truman. On Nov. 19, 1945, Truman wrote a message to Congress saying that "the health of American children, like their education, should be recognized as a definite public responsibility." According to the Truman Library, "the most controversial aspect of the plan was the proposed national health insurance plan." It called for "the creation of a national health insurance fund to be run by the federal government. This fund would be open to all Americans, but would remain optional. Participants would pay monthly fees into the plan, which would cover the cost of any and all medical expenses that arose in a time of need. The government would pay for the cost of services rendered by any doctor who chose to join the program." The American Medical Association attacked the plan, characterizing the bill as "socialized medicine." Truman ultimately abandoned the effort after the outbreak of the Korean War • Richard Nixon. In 1971 and 1974, Nixon offered separate proposals to expand health insurance to all, or nearly all, Americans. Generally speaking, they involved employer mandates to provide health insurance, supplemented by subsidies for poorer Americans. "I shall propose a sweeping new program that will assure comprehensive health-insurance protection to millions of Americans who cannot now obtain it or afford it, with vastly improved protection against catastrophic illnesses," he said in 1974. The 1974 effort gained some traction in Congress but faltered as Nixon became consumed by scandal. "Had it not been for his destruction as a result of the Watergate affair, legislation might well have passed during his presidency," said Princeton University health care historian Paul Starr, the author of Remedy and Reaction: The Peculiar American Struggle over Health Care Reform. • Bill Clinton. In 1993 and 1994, Clinton -- in a process spearheaded by First Lady Hillary Clinton -- sought to pass a major overhaul of the health care system that would have aimed for universal coverage. Even though the Democrats controlled Congress at the time, the plan did not win enactment. So that’s an easy three. It isn’t much of a stretch to get a fourth: • Lyndon Johnson. Technically, Johnson never sought full universal health care. But it seems churlish to deny inclusion on this list to the man who signed Medicare and Medicaid into law. They aren’t universal care for everybody, but they are universal care for large subsets of the population. You can add a few more if you lower the bar a bit. • John F. Kennedy. Kennedy voiced strong support for legislation that would ultimately become Medicare. On May 20, 1962, he held a televised rally to push the proposal at a packed Madison Square Garden in New York City. (The American Journal of Public Health later noted that hours later, the AMA rented the empty hall to film a rebuttal by its president, without showing the empty seats.) But he died before the legislation could come to fruition.) • Gerald Ford. Ford endorsed Nixon’s second proposal, but it didn’t get far on his brief watch. • Jimmy Carter. Carter proposed "a step-by-step plan to achieve universal coverage," Starr said. "It came relatively late in his first term, and it was too weak to satisfy (Democratic Sen.) Ted Kennedy and many other Democrats." Carter’s efforts were "halfhearted," said Brown University political scientist James Morone, co-author of The Heart of Power: Health and Politics in the Oval Office from Roosevelt to Bush. You can actually add a couple more if you bend Castro’s definition even further. • Theodore Roosevelt. He did endorse the idea of expanding health insurance to all, but only as as a presidential candidate for the Bull Moose Party in 1912, not during his earlier term in the White House. • Franklin D. Roosevelt. In his State of the Union address in 1943, Roosevelt called for a social insurance system that would extend "from the cradle to the grave," and he was preparing a program and a speech on national health insurance at the time of his death. In the midst of World War II, Roosevelt never pursued it in earnest, but Truman took up the mantle instead • Dwight Eisenhower. Eisenhower reacted to Democratic proposals for single-payer health care by proposing an expansion of care within the model of private-sector medicine. Eisenhower’s approach was to make permanent the tax break for employer-sponsored health coverage (which remains today) in order to encourage as many Americans as possible to get covered through their workplace. For those who were not employed, Eisenhower proposed that the government "reinsure" private insurance companies to encourage them to add less profitable populations to their coverage rolls. While Morone calls the Eisenhower plan relatively "timid," it nonetheless sparked the AMA’s opposition, which helped kill it in Congress. The remaining Republican presidents did act to expand health coverage in certain ways, but none of our experts thought they met Castro’s definition of pushing for universal health care. • Ronald Reagan signed the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act, which requires hospitals to serve patients in urgent need, and the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, or COBRA, which allows individuals to keep paying for coverage if they lose their insurance. In addition, with almost no support from his own cabinet, Reagan added catastrophic care to Medicare toward the end of his presidency, though the provision was later repealed. • George H.W. Bush, worried about the Democrats getting traction with health care in a 1991 Senate special election, sent a plan to congress. "Bush didn't like the issue, but he had a really good health team that put together a pretty good republican proposal," Morone said. • George W. Bush pushed for and signed the expansion of Medicare to include prescription drug coverage. Putting it all together, "you could cut the number to five or raise it to eight depending on how strictly you want to interpret Castro’s words," Starr said. Our ruling Castro said that "seven presidents before (Obama) -- Republicans and Democrats -- tried to expand health care to all Americans." It’s a slam dunk getting to three or four presidents, and it’s possible to reach seven presidents, but to do that requires a looser interpretation of expanding coverage "to all Americans." On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.

pomt-07429	Salaries for Virginia’s teachers are below the national average.	true	/virginia/statements/2011/apr/25/kitty-boitnott/education-association-president-says-virginia-teac/	The Virginia Education Association has complained for decades that salaries for state teachers are below the national average. Kitty Boitnott, president of the 60,000-member organization, made the claim during an April 20 interview with WVTF Public Radio in Roanoke about merit pay for educators. "The General Assembly has offered numerous times to get our teachers into the national average, and we’re certainly nowhere near that, and yet now we’re going to offer limited incentives to just a handful of people," Boitnott said. "That doesn’t make sense to me." We examined her claim that state teachers are paid below the national average. Carol Donohue, the assistant director of government relations for the Virginia Education Association, said Boitnott’s information comes from a December 2010 report from the National Education Association. The report shows that the average 2010-2011 salary for classroom teachers in Virginia was $51,559. That’s about 9 percent lower than the average national public teacher salary of $56,069, according to the report. Virginia had plenty of company in paying its teachers below the national average. In addition to the Old Dominion, 34 other states had teacher salaries trailing the average, according to the NEA report. Virginia’s average pay for teachers ranked 23rd-highest among states. The top average state-wide salary was $72,708 in New York, while the lowest was $35,201 in South Dakota. So in raw dollars, Virginia’s average teacher salary ranks near the middle of states. The amount of money it takes to live comfortably in Virginia is going to be different than what it takes in New York or South Dakota. So we looked at where Virginia ranks in cost of living. Virginia was the 26th most expensive state to live in during the last quarter of 2010, according to a report by the Missouri Department of Economic Development. In other words, Virginia ranks in the middle of state both in teacher salaries and cost of living. The VEA has long argued that Virginia is wealthy and can afford to pay teachers better than most states. Higher salaries, it argues, would help Virginia recruit and retain the best instructors. We looked at Virginia’s ability to pay more, turning to data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. In 2010,Virginia’s per capita income was $44,762 -- the seventh highest among the states. So it’s a logical argument that Virginia has greater ability than most states to pay teachers more. Virginians have higher salaries than most Americans. Their cost of living, meanwhile, ranks in the middle of states. But we digress. Boitnott said Virginia pays its teachers below the national average and we owe you a rating on that.

pomt-13891	Says Gov. Doug Ducey wants to use "taxpayer dollars to increase the salaries of private prison guards."	mostly true	/arizona/statements/2016/jun/29/arizona-house-democrats/arizonas-house-democrats-claim-governor-wants-incr/	Arizona House Democrats are questioning the priorities of their Republican counterparts, balking at a Department of Corrections plan to buy a $137 million privately run prison in Kingman. The Democrats say the plan, which was developed by the governor’s office, the corrections department and the Department of Administration, is bad for taxpayers. "Gov. (Doug) Ducey wants to use public, taxpayer dollars to increase the salaries of private prison guards," the Democrats wrote in a June 20 blog post. "Guards employed by a multi-billion dollar company that made nearly $140 million in profits last year." While the state wants to purchase the prison, they want a private company -- GEO Group -- to continue to manage it. Does the sale include a raise for the private corrections workers? Acronym soup The history of the Kingman prison is a bit complicated, and filled with companies with strange names, so we’ll take it slow. The prison was opened in August 2004 as part of a plan by Gov. Janet Napolitano to build more inmate beds using the private sector. As part of the original agreement, the state was scheduled to pay off the construction of the facility over 20 years and then take ownership. Until the state’s debt was paid off, a non-profit, Mohave Prison LLC, was created to own the prison. Management and Training Corporation, a Utah-based private prison operator, was originally contracted to manage Kingman. However, after multiple inmate riots in July 2015, the state fired MTC, and GEO Group assumed their contract. GEO Group is one of the largest private prison operators in the country. The Florida-based company manages more than 60 correctional facilities nationwide. Now Ducey and others in the state want to buy the Kingman prison early as part of what they say is a cost-saving measure. According to the proposal, the state owning the prison would save taxpayers more than $70 million and reduce the per-prisoner cost from $60.10 to $40.37 a day — a savings of more than 30 percent. Buying the prison nine years early would allow the state to refinance and reduce the amount of interest paid on the facility, the state says. The plan was approved by the state Legislature for fiscal year 2017 and is expected to be implemented sometime in the "next few months," according to Department of Corrections spokesman Andrew Wilder. Plan would include raises If the purchase goes through as expected, the state would officially own the prison, but it would still be managed by the GEO Group. As part of the plan, the state would offer $2 million to increase the salaries of the GEO Group workers. Keely Varvel, chief of staff for the Arizona House Democrats, pointed us to page 18 of the proposed purchase plan, which says that $2 million is intended "to increase starting salaries for correctional officers and improve retention." But there’s a big caveat: The $2 million in annual expenses would be offset by the $8 million in annual savings the state would incur for buying the prison. Pablo Paez, a spokesman for the GEO Group, called the Democrats’ claim an "unfair characterization." He said the proposal allows for "significant savings for taxpayers overall," while providing additional resources for staff wages. In essence, Paez said, Democrats are focusing on one side of the ledger -- money spent increasing salaries -- while ignoring the larger cost savings. The average salary for a state correctional officer is $36,800. Under this plan, Kingman correctional officers would see a 13 percent raise, from $29,453 to an average salary of $33,300. That’s still less than the state average and well under the national average of $45,320, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Daniel Scarpinato, a spokesman with Ducey’s office, said the overall plan, besides saving money, allows the state to "invest in ensuring public safety." Our ruling Arizona House Democrats said, "Gov. Ducey wants to use public, taxpayer dollars to increase the salaries of private prison guards." That’s literally accurate. The state contracts with GEO Group to manage the Kingman prison in question, but GEO pays its correctional officers. And if the state purchases Kingman, it would use $2 million for raises for the prison staff. The major caveat is those raises would be more-than-offset by money the state says it will save with the purchase of the Kingman facility.

pomt-06150	Says it cost Massachusetts taxpayers $100,000 when Mitt Romney and his staff purchased computer hard drives.	false	/new-hampshire/statements/2011/dec/19/democratic-national-committee/dnc-says-mitt-romney-and-staff-cost-massachusetts-/	For some opponents, the issue of electronic records during Mitt Romney’s time as Massachusetts governor has become the $100,000 question. In an advertisement released earlier this month, the Democratic National Committee accused members of the Romney administration of costing taxpayers $100,000 when they purchased their computer hard drives and wiped them clean as they left office in 2006. "When Mitt Romney left the Massachusetts governor's office, e-mails were deleted, servers wiped clean and computer hard drives went out the door with his top aides," the narrator reads in the ad, released December 6, 2011. "His and his staff's efforts cost taxpayers $100,000. All this raises one important question, what is Mitt Romney hiding?" The records issue has been well documented in recent months. Romney acknowledged in November that staff members purchased their computer hard drives as they left office. He maintained his staff did not break the law, and last month PolitiFact checked his claim that if they had turned over their records to the following administration, they would have been first. We rated the claim True. But did the Romney administration’s actions really cost taxpayers $100,000? The computer hard drives themselves didn’t cost nearly that much, according to reports. The Boston Globe, which first broke the records story last month, reported that 11 aides purchased their hard drives at the time, paying $65 dollars each for a total of $715. The $65 figure equaled both the price of a new hard drive and the installation costs, and staff members purchased the hard drives with their own money, according to Terry Dolan, who served as director of administration for six governors, including Romney, between 1985 and 2008. "That was effectively at no cost to the Commonwealth," Dolan said Thursday. "They paid the cost of a replacement hard drive. They didn’t buy the monitor, the speakers, the whole nine yards." The costs don’t end there, however. Around the time Romney aides purchased the hard drives in late 2006, his administration agreed to a new lease with their computer provider, Ontario Investments, Inc., of New York. The governor’s office was 18 months into a three-year, $108,000 lease, the first ever for the governor’s office, which had previously purchased all its computers, Dolan said. But office officials opted out of that agreement in December 2006 in favor of a new three-year, $205,900 contract to upgrade the technology. The new lease covered the same 115 computers as the original agreement, according to the contract, but added new bells and whistles. "They were 18-month old computers that were functional," Dolan said. "We got bigger screens. … I'm not sure (the old computers) had CD drives in them at that time." By a simple comparison, the two different lease documents show that the governor’s office paid about $97,000 more for the second lease than for the original. But, does this mean it cost taxpayers that much? Not so fast, Dolan says. Eighteen months remained on the original lease when administration officials initiated the new, more expensive agreement, according to the lease documents. This means administration officials would have had to renew, renegotiate or search for a new contract by June 2008, resulting in additional costs. To keep calculations even, then, you need to measure the difference between the two agreements through June 2008, when the original was set to expire. The original $108,000 lease, initially expected to run from June 2005 to June 2008, averaged a monthly cost of $3,000, while the second, which ran from December 2006 to December 2009, averaged $5,719 per month. The difference between the two monthly charges is $2,719, and multiplied by the 18 months remaining on the original lease equals a total difference of $48,942 -- about half of the DNC’s $100,000 figure, a figure first reported December 6 by Reuters. One further note: The DNC ad indicates that Romney’s staff scrapped the original computer lease because they no longer contained hard drives, which is not true, according to Dolan, Romney’s director of administration. Administration officials had already been working on the new lease when the staff members bought the hard drives, she said Thursday. "The decision was made to replace all the computers, and then inquiries were made (about buying the hard drives)," Dolan said. "To my recollection, it was something like, ‘Well, as long as the computers are going back … maybe we can keep the hard drives.’" Romney’s campaign staff did not return requests for comment. Our ruling: The total difference between the original lease and the second computer contract signed by the Romney administration was about $97,000, close to the $100,000 mentioned in the DNC ad. But this is not an apples to apples comparison. Rather, the total difference in cost passed on to taxpayers during the term of the first lease was about $49,000 -- not quite half of the DNC total. Further, administration officials had already been looking into a new computer lease when the aides purchased the hard drives, so the lease costs are not a direct result of the sale of the hard drives, as the DNC alleges. We rate the claim False.	None	Democratic National Committee	None	None	None	2011-12-19T12:43:33	2011-12-06	['Massachusetts', 'Mitt_Romney']

pomt-14240	Says Hillary Clinton supported and continues to "support fracking."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/apr/13/bernie-sanders/does-hillary-clinton-support-fracking/	Looking to out-green Hillary Clinton in New York, Bernie Sanders charged that Clinton’s position on fracking was at odds with voters. New Yorkers ended the practice in the state in 2014, and Sanders called for a nationwide ban during an April 11 rally in Binghamton. Clinton, in contrast, remains on the side of the frackers, Sanders said on NBC’s Meet the Press, when he launched a multipart attack on Clinton’s positions on fracking, trade and campaign finance. "Well, when you vote for virtually every trade agreement that has cost the workers of this country millions of jobs, when you support and continue to support fracking, despite the crisis that we have in terms of clean water," he said April 10, "and essentially, when you have a super PAC that is raising tens of millions of dollars from every special interest out there, including $15 million from Wall Street, the American people do not believe that that is the kind of president that we need to make the changes in America to protect the working families of this country." Was Sanders telling the fracking truth? (We examined Clinton’s support for free trade in a separate fact-check.) While Clinton’s past support of fracking is well documented, her current position leaves more wiggle room than Sanders’ statement suggests. Shale promoted 'round the world To refresh, fracking or hydraulic fracturing means producers are blasting pressurized water, sand and chemicals into shale rock miles underground to extract natural gas. The Environmental Protection Agency considers shale gas to be clean energy. Some environmentalists, though, are doubtful that it’s that much better than coal or oil, given reports that fracking can cause methane leaks (a greenhouse gas that’s much more potent than carbon dioxide) and earthquakes and set water ablaze. Clinton clearly supported the practice as secretary of state. Her special envoy for international energy affairs launched the Global Shale Gas Initiative encouraging other countries to explore shale as an energy source. An in-depth investigation by progressive magazine Mother Jones said that Clinton’s support of fracking was "part of a broader push to fight climate change, boost global energy supply, and undercut the power of adversaries such as Russia that use their energy resources as a cudgel." We found instances of Clinton and the State Department talking up fracking to Latin America, the European Union, Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria, Pakistan, China and India. "The United States will promote the use of shale gas. Now, I know that in some places is controversial. But natural gas is the cleanest fossil fuel available for power generation today, and a number of countries in the Americas may have shale gas resources," Clinton said in a 2009 speech to the Inter-American Development Bank. After Clinton left the State Department in 2013, she continued to support fracking but repeatedly called for "smart regulations" in speeches and in her book, Hard Choices. Fracking with nuance in 2016 Compared with Sanders’ unequivocal opposition and the Republicans’ strong support, Clinton has a more complicated answer when it comes to fracking. Essentially, she supports it as long as there’s environmental oversight and no local opposition. Here’s how Clinton detailed her position during the March 6 debate in Flint, Michigan: "I don’t support it when any locality or any state is against it, No. 1. I don’t support it when the release of methane or contamination of water is present. I don’t support it — No. 3 — unless we can require that anybody who fracks has to tell us exactly what chemicals they are using. So by the time we get through all of my conditions, I do not think there will be many places in America where fracking will continue to take place. And I think that’s the best approach, because right now, there are places where fracking is going on that are not sufficiently regulated." ("My answer is a lot shorter," responded Sanders. "No, I do not support fracking.") Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin referred us to Clinton’s plan "to address the fracking-related risks people are concerned about." "This is particularly important given that the federal government doesn’t get to say where fracking occurs and where it doesn’t, but can put new safeguards in place," Schwerin said. Katie Brown of Energy in Depth, the research and education arm of the Independent Petroleum Association of America, told PolitiFact that Sanders’ position to ban all fracking is outside the mainstream. "Hillary Clinton, on the other hand, joins Democrats across the county such as Sen. Chuck Schumer, and California Gov. Jerry Brown, and Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper (just to name a few), who have all touted strong regulations by the states and supported fracking for its environmental and economic benefits," Brown said. Warren Gunnels, Sanders’ policy director, referred us to a Reuters article, in which supporters of fracking cast Clinton’s comments as campaign rhetoric and opponents urged her to cut the caveats and ban it outright. But what exactly would Clinton’s caveats mean for frackers? A portrait of regulated extraction Clinton’s three conditions would uphold existing bans and add new ones to the mix. But they wouldn’t amount to a universal ban. The first condition leaves local and state bans in place, such as those in Vermont, New York and a few dozen cities and counties across America. Her second condition would add dozens of sites that have methane emissions or water contamination. Natural gas is primarily methane, so we’ll assume Clinton is talking about "fugitive emissions" or leaks. Estimates for fugitive emissions, typically expressed as a percentage of the total production, vary widely. A round up of studies by watchdog blog Carbon Brief found estimates ranging from 0.6 to 9 percent (the threshold for being cleaner than coal is 3.2 percent). Various industry and independent research has indicated that a good chunk of leaks come from a small number of "super-emitters" (roughly one in 25 facilities, according to a 2015 Colorado State University study). Clinton could ostensibly shut down these methane spewers, which include, for example, about 50 production sites in northern Texas and four lift wells in the Gulf Coast. Water contamination is not systemic, according to a controversial 2015 EPA study, which nonetheless identified 151 cases of fracking fluid spills in 11 states from 2006 to 2012. Robert Howarth, a noted critic of fracking and biogeochemist at Cornell University, estimates at least 4 percent of production wells pollute water, but contends that the problem is widespread given the sheer number of wells. Under Clinton’s condition, fracking could be banned in, for example, at least 25 counties in Pennsylvania and at least 12 counties in Colorado, if not in all 11 states with noted cases of spills. Frackers are already meeting Clinton’s third condition, to an extent. At least 26 states have some rules on chemical disclosure on the books, though most allow frackers to protect "trade secrets," according to the American Chemical Society. In addition, the Obama administration now requires drillers on federal and tribal lands to report the composition of their fracking fluid to FracFocus, an industry-backed registry of more than 100,000 wells across America. (Here’s an example.) Environmentalists contend that these rules are not nearly enough. Howarth told PolitiFact that chemical additives are "a small part of the problem." "The frack return fluids are full of really nasty materials in addition to the additives, and the precise nature of this toxic brew is seldom known," he said. "Clinton's focus on just the additives is misguided." That being said, Clinton’s condition could ban fracking in Virginia and Missouri, two states with fracking activity but no disclosure rules in place at the time of this report. Here’s a map that shows how Clinton’s conditions could affect fracking in America: Our ruling Sanders said that Clinton supported and continues "to support fracking." As secretary of state, Clinton supported and promoted fracking around the world. As a 2016 candidate, her support comes with conditions such as local choice, stronger environmental regulation and chemicals. Sanders’ claim is accurate but needs additional information.

pomt-04621	"Sen. Bob Menendez voted to enact a new tax on the sale of homes of 3.8%."	pants on fire!	/new-jersey/statements/2012/sep/17/menendez-facts/bloggers-say-bob-menendez-voted-new-38-tax-sale-ho/	A debunked claim making the rounds on the chain e-mail circuit for years has been revitalized to attack a New Jersey Democrat. A blog called "Menendez Facts" falls far short of the truth in a post claiming U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez "voted to enact a new tax on the sale of homes of 3.8%." "In 2010 Sen. Bob Menendez voted to enact a brand-new tax on the sale of homes. Sen. Bob Menendez voted for this during one of the most horrific housing markets in recent history. When families are struggling to sell their homes, as housing prices plunge Sen. Bob Menendez voted to take even more money from families struggling to sell their homes," the Sept. 4 blog post says. The post includes a chart that lists how much this new tax would cost homeowners. Sell your home for $200,000? The chart claims you would pay $7,600 in taxes. Sell your home for $500,000? That’ll cost you $19,000 in taxes, according to the chart. But that’s simply false. Menendez Facts acknowledged in an e-mail that we were fact-checking this claim and said they would update their blog post this week, but did not say how. Versions of this home sales tax claim have been checked by PolitiFact and other nonpartisan fact-checking groups several times before. The claim has been roundly declared as false and PolitiFact has rated it Pants on Fire. Such claims stem from a provision included in the 2010 national health care overhaul. On March 25, 2010, the Senate passed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which was the second part of the health care bill. Menendez, who is running for re-election in November, voted in favor of that bill, which included a new tax on investment income for wealthy individuals that goes into effect in 2013. The law created a 3.8 percent tax on investment income for individuals who have an adjusted gross income of more than $200,000 or couples with an adjusted gross income of more than $250,000. That investment income could include profits from real estate transactions. PolitiFact National noted in a similar fact-check in July, that those high-income earners represent less than 5 percent of all taxpayers. Individuals or couples who make less than those income thresholds would not be subject to the tax. But even if a couple earned more than those thresholds, the tax only applies to profits from the sale of a home, not the sales price itself, as the blog post claims. Also, if the home being sold is your primary residence, the first $250,000 in profits for an individual, or the first $500,000 in profits for a couple, is excluded from the tax. And for some perspective, the National Association of Realtors reported that the national median existing-home price in July was $187,300. No homeowner could make $250,000 in profit on the sale of that home and, therefore, would not pay the 3.8 percent tax. Paul Brubaker, Menendez’s campaign communications director, said in an e-mail, "Senator Menendez worked on behalf of New Jersey’s middle class families, and all Americans, to help provide them access to quality, affordable health care by helping to make the Affordable Care Act the law of the land. It is sad that, even though the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the law, some falsehoods about the law persist ­– evidently with the help of the MenendezFacts.com web site." Our ruling A blog called Menendez Facts claimed that "Sen. Bob Menendez voted to enact a new tax on the sale of homes of 3.8%." That’s a distortion of the truth. Menendez voted in favor of a bill tied to the health care law that created a tax on investment income for high-income earners. Though that investment income could include profits from real estate transactions, it is not a tax on the sales price of a home and it would not impact the vast majority of Americans. Wealthy individuals who sell their home for a large profit may be subject to the tax, but the blog does not make that clear and suggests the tax applies to the sales price of homes, regardless of an individual’s income. So again we set this ridiculous claim ablaze: Pants on Fire! To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.	None	Menendez Facts	None	None	None	2012-09-17T07:30:00	2012-09-04	['None']
pomt-04572	College tuition "costs have risen by 25 percent under the Democrats."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/sep/25/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-spanish-language-ad-says-college-costs/	In a recent Spanish-language television ad, Mitt Romney criticizes President Barack Obama’s record on higher education. A translation provided by the campaign has the narrator saying, "Four years ago, Hispanics hoped Democrats would get an ‘A’ in improving our education. The reality is that more than 75 percent of the population thinks that college is not affordable. Tuition costs have increased 25 percent under Obama and the Democrats, and total student debt has reached a trillion dollars." After a clip of Obama saying he wants to be held accountable on education, the narrator continues in Spanish, "When it comes to education, Obama and the Democrats have failed our kids." We first checked with the Romney campaign, which said the figure came from the College Board, which produces an annual study of college costs. The College Board found that for the school-year 2008-2009, the average published tuition and fees for in-state students at public four-year colleges and universities was $6,585. By the 2011-2012 school year, it stood at $8,244. That’s an increase of slightly over 25 percent. So the claim has a grain of statistical truth. But there are several other issues to consider. The first one has to do with the translation. The exact words the narrator says are, "Los costos han subido 25 por ciento por los Demócratas," while the screen says, "25% costos de universidad," with a large arrow pointing upward. While it’s clear that the ad is saying that "costs have risen by 25 percent under the Democrats," it’s less clear whether the "costs" in question are tuition alone or tuition plus room and board. The distinction makes a difference. Tuition and fees plus room and board rose from $14,333 to $17,131 over the same period. That’s just under a 20 percent increase, short of the 25 percent claimed in the ad. Because of the uncertainty over the translation, we won’t count this as a strike against the ad’s accuracy. But other issues are more problematic: • The tuition figure is only for in-state students at public universities. The College Board also offered data for other types of schools, and each was smaller than 25 percent. Here's how much tuition and fees increased for other situations: * Public, four-year institutions -- up 19 percent. * Public, two-year colleges -- up 23 percent * Private, four-year institutions -- up 13 percent; * For-profit institutions -- up 11 percent. So, the Romney campaign was cherry-picking by using the 25 percent figure. • The 25 percent figure doesn’t adjust for inflation. The College Board data cited in the ad does not adjust for inflation. But Department of Education statistics do. According to the Education Department, inflation-adjusted costs (tuition, room and board) for all institutions were $17,257 in 2008-2009 and $18,133 in 2010-2011. That’s a 5 percent increase over two years or, extrapolating out to 2011-2012, an increase of between 7 percent and 8 percent over the same time period that the ad is talking about. Certain sectors rose faster than others -- public, four-year institutions rose by 12 percent once you extrapolate out to the full period. But even this increase is well below 25 percent. • The ad uses "published" rates, not "net costs." Universities’ published rates are like the sticker prices on cars. They are the prices before they are offset by financial aid. To students and parents, it’s actually the net cost that matters most. Due in part to financial aid programs and tax credits in Obama’s economic stimulus package, the net cost for the average student at a private, four-year institution has actually declined since 2008-2009, from $13,620 to $12,970 -- a drop of 5 percent. At public, four-year institutions, in-state students saw the net price rise from $2,310 to $2,490, an increase of 8 percent -- less than the 25 percent jump cited in the ad. • Who gets the blame for rising college costs? The escalating cost of college is nothing new -- it’s been going on for years. In fact, if you look at the trends in the inflation-adjusted Education Department data for all institutions, the rates of growth under Obama -- 2.2 percent and 2.7 percent in the years where data is available -- are lower than the rates of increase in six of the preceding eight years under President George W. Bush. Of course, the president of the United States doesn’t set college prices. Who does? A combination of the marketplace, private universities and the state-government officials such as governors and legislatures who set state subsidies for public institutions. And with the Republicans controlling a significant majority of governorships and state legislatures since 2010, as well as a sizable minority of governorships and legislatures prior to 2010, the GOP bears some responsibility as well. And as we’ve noted, the one area in which Obama had a degree of control over -- federal aid to students -- his actions have helped bring down the net cost of college. Our ruling The ad claims that "costs have risen by 25 percent under the Democrats." It’s true that the published costs for one type of college and one type of student have risen by 25 percent since Obama took office, but other data shows a smaller rise for tuition and fees, particularly when inflation is taken into account. Even for the college costs that have risen, the Romney campaign does not provide sufficient proof to link that rise to Obama. Governors and legislatures bear far more responsibility for rising prices at public universities, and to the extent Obama has had any effect, it has been to help slow or even decrease the cost burden through federal assistance to students. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2012-09-25T16:09:52	2012-09-21	['None']

pomt-12686	"A woman working full-time is paid 79 to 80 cents for every dollar a man is paid, and it's even less for women of color, and on average $11,000 per year is lost simply because she isn't a man."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/mar/14/patricia-farley/taking-closer-look-florida-democrats-claims-about-/	Dozens of women rallied Tuesday at the Florida Capitol to fight for equal pay for women and men. Democrats organized the rally to bring attention to SB 410 and HB 319, which have not been scheduled for a hearing. The bills would enact penalties on employers who pay women less than men, allow victims of discrimination to sue for wages, and would extend protections to the transgender workers. An official of the Democratic Women's Club of Florida offered up a quick snapshot of the reality of today’s gender pay gap, which refers to the difference between what men and women earn. "A woman working full-time is paid 79 to 80 cents for every dollar a man is paid, and it's even less for women of color, and on average $11,000 per year is lost simply because she isn't a man," said one of the club’s vice presidents, Patricia Farley. We did not hear back from Farley, but PolitiFact has explored claims about the gender pay gap more than once. Farley is referencing data widely available from the U.S. Census Bureau. ‘A woman working full-time is paid 79 to 80 cents for every dollar a man is paid’ This stat has become a rallying cry for those who seek to eliminate employment discrimination based on gender. And it’s backed by U.S. Census Bureau data. In a report released in September 2016, the Census Bureau wrote that in 2015, the female-to-male earnings ratio of full-time, year-round workers was 0.80. Translated into dollars, that means that in 2015, women working full-time earned 80 cents for every dollar earned by men working full-time. The figure should be used with caution. For instance, former President Barack Obama’s administration released an ad that said women are paid "77 cents on the dollar for doing the same work as men" in 2012. That’s not accurate. The figure derived from a federal government measure actually refers to the average disparity between what men and women earn, so saying "the same work" is inaccurate. Also, discrimination is not the only explanation for a difference in pay. Other factors include: the degrees women pursue, the jobs women pursue, time taken off to take care of children, and the number of hours worked and experience. For instance, as of 2014, women worked in more minimum wage jobs than men. Excluding all those factors, a study by the American Association of University Women 2013 found a 7 percent wage gap between men and women a year after graduating college. As Farley said, women of color earn even less. A 2014 report from the National Women’s Law Center concluded that black women made 60 cents to the dollar earned by a white man, and Hispanic women made 55 cents, according to the report. Asian-American women actually earn higher wages than black and Hispanic men and women, as well as white women according to Pew Research. Still, Asian-American women lag behind white males for annual earnings. ‘On average $11,000 per year is lost’ Farley’s last point can be calculated by looking at the same 2015 Census data for the median earnings of full-time, year-round workers who are 15 years old and up, regardless of occupation. If you look at those numbers, the median wage in 2015 was $40,742 for women and $51,212 for men. The average difference is $10,470, which is very close to Farley’s $11,000. This pattern holds consistent if you look at data from the last five years. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Other data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks average annual weekly median earnings of full-time salary workers 16-and-older using the Current Population Survey. In 2016, median weekly earnings for women were $749, or $38,948 a year. Men brought in $915 a week, or $47,580 a year. This produces a smaller average annual earnings difference of $8,632. Experts have said, however, that looking at a longer period of time would be more useful to draw conclusions. "I think the average does help, but I'd rather see the lifetime earnings calculated for the mean and median female worker rather than extrapolating from the average for one year," said Tara Sinclair, a George Washington University economist, told us in 2014. Our ruling Farley said that a "woman working full-time is paid 79 to 80 cents for every dollar a man is paid, and it's even less for people of color, and on average $11,000 per year is loss every year simply because she isn't a man." Farley is citing common talking points that can be backed up by data from the U.S. Census Bureau. While her figures are accurate, a bulletproof number to illustrate the gender gap will always be murky because the difference in pay can be affected by the careers women and men choose and taking time off to take care for children. We rate this Mostly True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	Patricia Farley	None	None	None	2017-03-14T18:12:09	2017-03-14	['None']
pomt-07923	Secure Communities "has a proven track record of enhancing public safety by focusing on violent offenders and those that pose a threat to our communities and our national security."	half-true	/rhode-island/statements/2011/jan/30/peter-kilmartin/kilmartin-says-secure-communities-program-has-prov/	Just days after he was sworn into office, Attorney General Peter F. Kilmartin made news by signing an agreement to implement a federal program called Secure Communities, which the federal government says it created to identify and deport illegal immigrants who have committed serious crimes. The decision came less than a week after Governor Chafee rescinded his predecessor’s executive order targeting undocumented immigrants. Among other things, Chafee’s decision ended a cooperative program between the state police and the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency to enforce immigration laws. Under the Secure Communities program, fingerprints of arrested suspects are sent to the Department of Homeland Security, which checks them against a database of immigration violators and others. ICE then prioritizes whom it will take action against, based on the severity of the person’s criminal background and the threat he or she poses to communities. ICE plans to implement the program nationwide. It is now in use in 37 states, although it’s only statewide in seven. In a Jan. 11 news release announcing Rhode Island’s intent to join the program, Kilmartin said: "Secure Communities is a proactive method of making neighborhoods safe by dealing with individuals who have committed crimes against us. The program has a proven track record of enhancing public safety by focusing on violent offenders and those that pose a threat to our communities and our national security." Kilmartin’s announcement triggered complaints from opponents of Secure Communities, and a noisy protest in the lobby of the attorney general’s building. Critics, including Steven Brown, executive director of the Rhode Island Affiliate of the American Civil Liberties Union, say the program has led to thousands of deportations of people with no criminal records. They also say it leads to racial profiling and deters victims and witnesses of crimes from coming forward if they or family members are undocumented immigrants. We wondered whether Kilmartin’s assertion -- that the program focuses on "violent offenders" and "threats to our communities and national security" -- was accurate. When we called Kilmartin’s office, his spokeswoman, Amy Kempe, said Kilmartin was relying on information from ICE and directed us to that agency. So we contacted Ross Feinstein, spokesman for ICE in Washington, D.C. He said in an email that in 2010, ICE "set a record for overall removals of illegal aliens, with more than 392,000 removals nationwide." He said more than half of those removed were convicted criminals. Feinstein said the Secure Communities program alone, from its beginning in October 2008, has identified and led to the "removal" of more than 59,300 aliens convicted of crimes. We also found the program has plenty of critics. Three groups that oppose Secure Communities fought ICE in federal court and won a judgment ordering the agency to reveal data about the program. The groups -- the Center for Constitutional Rights, the National Day Laborer Organization and the Immigration Justice Clinic at the Cardoza School of Law at Yeshiva University in New York City -- are part of a national initiative called "Uncover the Truth." Sarahi Uribe, national coordinator of Uncover the Truth, said the group obtained documents in recent months from ICE that show that the majority of the people picked up in the program are not hardened criminals. "It’s amazing because they continue marketing the program as targeting serious criminals, even though the numbers don’t support it," Uribe said. Among the records obtained are monthly data for Secure Communities from October 2009 through August 2010. The records show that during that period, 41,929 people were identified through Secure Communities for deportation, as so-called "removals and returns." Those people were divided into four categories based on criminal record. A total of 9,667 -- about 23 percent -- were classified as Level 1 offenders: those convicted of "aggravated felonies such as murder, rape or sexual abuse of a minor." Another 16,581 -- about 40 percent -- were labeled as Level 2 offenders: those convicted of any felony, or three or more misdemeanors. A total of 4,621 -- about 11 percent -- were Level 3 offenders: those convicted of crimes punishable by less than one year in prison, typically misdemeanors. And 11,060 people -- about 26 percent -- had no criminal record at all. So ICE’s own data shows that, in the second year of a two-year program, 37 percent of the immigrants deported were either non-criminals or had been convicted of minor crimes. Asked to respond, ICE’s Feinstein said that the agency’s priority is "to initiate enforcement against criminal aliens," but that doesn’t "preclude ICE from initiating action against immigration violators and others subject to removal at the time of encounter. In fact, there are classes of non-criminals that are also ICE priorities." He said the so-called "non-criminal aliens" are "non-U.S. citizens arrested and booked for a crime who have no recorded conviction but have one or more immigration violations and are priorities for ICE to remove due to various reasons, such as: visa overstay, an illegal entry, an illegal reentry after removal, a final order of removal in place, known gang affiliations, ICE fugitives, etc." Kempe, after checking back with ICE officials, said the attorney general believes people convicted of even relatively minor crimes -- selling marijuana, painting graffiti or vandalizing a neighborhood -- are threats to the community. That may be. But we believe that, in the light of the ICE data, Kilmartin went too far when he said Secure Communities "has a proven record" of focusing on "violent offenders" and "threats to communities and our national security." That may be the intent, but the numbers show a mixed result. We rule his statement Half True.	None	Peter Kilmartin	None	None	None	2011-01-30T00:01:00	2011-01-11	['None']
pomt-09321	Crist sent his "top policy staffer to the House Committee to testify in support of the proposal," then vetoed the bill.	true	/florida/statements/2010/apr/15/adam-hasner/charlie-crist-SB6-adam-hasner/	Gov. Charlie Crist's decision to veto a controversial education bill linking teacher raises to student performance created a swift backlash from Republicans who considered the measure a legislative priority. House Majority Leader Adam Hasner, R-Delray Beach, reacted less than 10 minutes after Crist announced his veto of Senate Bill 6 on April 15, 2010. “I'm disappointed that after sending his top policy staffer to the House Committee to testify in support of the proposal, Governor Crist would change his mind and now veto the bill,” Hasner said in a press release. We know Republicans have said Crist supported and would sign the bill -- Republican Party of Florida Chairman and state Sen. John Thrasher went as far as to say Crist promised he would sign the bill -- but did Crist ask a staffer to attend a committee hearing to indicate the governor's support? State records show -- and video evidence confirms -- that a Crist staffer did attend a House committee hearing in support of the education bill. On March 25, 2010, at a hearing of the House PreK-12 Policy Committee, Crist education policy chief Terry Golden said she supported the teacher pay bill on behalf of the Office of the Governor. Here's a copy of the appearance record from the meeting, which was first obtained by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel. PolitiFact Florida also watched an archived video of the 3-hour, 40-minute hearing, to see if Golden attended the meeting, and if she indicated she supported the teacher tenure bill. Two hours and 55 minutes into the committee hearing, Golden is recognized to speak. She stands up from her seat and says: "The Office of the Governor waives in support." The comment is typical in committee meetings when a group indicates its position but does not wish to take the time to address the full committee. (If the first video link doesn't work, try this one). A corresponding action packet from the meeting also lists Golden as a "proponent" of the bill. It should be noted that the bill that the governor ultimately vetoed was almost exactly the one that appeared at that March 25 committee meeting. The only change, the Sun-Sentinel reported, was an amendment by Sen. Evelyn Lynn to allow principals to take into account advanced degrees in their performance reviews. On the governor's Web site, Golden is listed as a policy chief in the Education Policy Unit of the Governor's Office of Policy and Budget. Golden also is a registered lobbyist for the governor's office. Previously she worked as a lobbyist for Mixon and Associates, a Tallahassee lobbying group that lists nine school districts among its clients. We tried to call Golden to ask who asked her to attend the hearings on SB 6 and its companion bill, HB 7189, and why she indicated support of the bills. But Golden's office referred our inquiries to the governor's press office. Crist spokesman Sterling Ivey said Golden supported the teacher tenure bill under orders from Kathy Mears – the governor’s director of legislative affairs – and Ken Granger, policy director of the Governor’s Office of Policy and Budget. “I think at the end of March, conceptually the Executive Office of the Governor was in support of the direction of the bill,” Ivey said, noting that Golden works for Crist's top education policy adviser Scott Kittel. Crist, however, told a group of reporters on April 14, 2010, that he didn't know Golden ("I don't even know who that person is -- though I'm sure they're a great person") or why she indicated that she supported the bill on Crist's behalf. "I'm me and they're them," Crist told the reporters in an exchange that was caught on video. "What I've learned ... is that a lot of times people will say that the governor's office feels this way and the governor's office feels that way, and regrettably from time to time, rare though that may be, they may not have actually talked to the governor." That may be true, but the one ultimately responsible for the actions of Crist's administration is Crist. A Crist education policy staffer went to a House committee hearing on March 25 and indicated the governor's support for a controversial teacher pay plan. Three weeks later, Crist vetoed essentially the same bill. We rate Hasner's statement True. Story has been updated with comments from Crist spokesman Sterling Ivey.

pomt-03040	"Nobody's addicted to" marijuana.	false	/florida/statements/2013/oct/08/john-morgan/john-morgan-says-nobodys-addicted-marijuana/	High-profile Orlando attorney John Morgan is leading an effort in Florida to legalize medical marijuana, arguing that the drug is safer and cheaper than other painkillers. As a recent guest on Bay News 9’s Political Connections, Morgan also discussed whether marijuana is addictive. "Nobody's addicted to it," Morgan claimed. We decided to fact-check Morgan’s claim based on input from readers. But we didn’t have to dig too far. Morgan told us he was wrong. "It was a huge mistake," said Morgan. "I’m sorry and embarrassed I messed up." Morgan said he was "flat out wrong" about marijuana not being addictive and meant to focus on the use of the drug compared to more potent painkillers. "Some levels of addiction kill you -- marijuana may make you slow, but it will never kill you," said Morgan, a personal injury attorney who is leading the group People United for Medical Marijuana. The group has launched a petition drive to add an amendment to the state’s Constitution to legalize medical marijuana in 2014. Even though Morgan said he made a mistake, we were curious enough to check a few more sources. Aaron Norton, a psychotherapist who specializes in addictive disorders, said that "cannabis dependence is a diagnosable disorder." "Not everyone who uses it becomes addicted," said Norton, but some are more vulnerable, including people with mental disorders, adolescents and young adults. "In the course of my career, I have probably treated hundreds of patients who are cannabis-dependent, and many of them also met the two diagnostic criteria associated with physiological dependence -- tolerance and withdrawal," Norton said. Marijuana abuse is recognized as cannabis-use disorder in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. The manual’s list of symptoms include craving; taking larger doses over a longer period of time than intended; recurrent use that results in failure to fulfill major obligations at work, school or home; and tolerance (needing more to get the desired high). It’s also described as an addictive substance by the government-funded National Institute on Drug Abuse, which writes: "Estimates from research suggest that about 9 percent of users become addicted to marijuana; this number increases among those who start young (to about 17 percent, or 1 in 6) and among daily users (to 25-50 percent)." Psychiatrist Dr. Darren Rothschild, an addiction medicine specialist, says he’s worked with patients who have developed a serious dependence on marijuana and "the impact is substantial." "In order to feel normal, they have to have the drug," Rothschild said. "Not everyone who smokes becomes addicted, but it’s erroneous to say it doesn’t happen." Rothschild said people who smoke marijuana daily over a long period of time are the ones most susceptible to dependence on marijuana versus intermittent smokers who may occasionally smoke pot at a party. "I’d say none of those people are addicted." Dr. Samir Sabbag, assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, Division of Alcohol and Drug Abuse Treatment and Research, said "long-term use of marijuana is indeed addictive," though he noted people can be addicted to a variety of things, including the caffeine in chocolate and coffee. Even groups that support relaxing marijuana laws, such as the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), concede that Morgan was incorrect to say that marijuana is not potentially addictive. "Can people have an abusive relationship with marijuana? Absolutely," said NORML executive director Allen St. Pierre. But St. Pierre says marijuana is "not addictive in any way shape or form the same way that alcohol, nicotine and other legal and illegal drugs, even caffeine, can cause serious withdrawal." Our ruling Orlando attorney John Morgan said that "nobody’s addicted to" marijuana. Morgan quickly admitted that he was wrong, and experts agreed. We rate the claim False.

pomt-11978	Says a photograph shows Seattle Seahawks player Michael Bennett burning the United States flag.	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/sep/29/vets-trump/fake-photo-shows-seattle-seahawks-player-michael-b/	A photograph plastered on a Facebook page that allegedly supports President Donald Trump purported to show an NFL player burning an American flag in the locker room, but it has very clearly been manipulated. An image posted on the "Vets for Trump" Facebook page on Sept. 28, 2017, showed Seattle Seahawks defensive end Michael Bennett shirtless and holding a United States flag that has been set ablaze. Teammates, coaches and staff appear to be cheering Bennett on in the background. "#Seattleseahawks - no more NFL," the caption on the post read. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Commenters were outraged by the photo, with one person declaring "burning the Flag that I shed my blood to honor would be just cause to whack you upside your ignorant disrespectful head." Another ironically wrote that he "couldn't even in good conscious photo shop such a picture." The Vets for Trump Facebook page didn’t accept messages or list phone or email information. It listed as contact information the website VeteransForDonaldTrump.com, a domain registered to someone named Vladimir Lemets. Trump targeted the NFL after a handful of players had decided to kneel during the playing of the Star-Spangled Banner, as a protest against racism in America. Trump demanded on Twitter that NFL players "stop disrespecting our Flag & Country" by kneeling during the national anthem to protest racism in America. Trump had said players should be fired if they refused to stand. More than 200 players across the league chose not to stand the following weekend to show their opposition to Trump’s criticism. Both the Seahawks and the Tennessee Titans chose not to stand on the field for the national anthem during their Sept. 24 game in Nashville (all but one member of the Pittsburgh Steelers chose not stand on the sideline for the song, either). But while the Seahawks banded together in protest, Bennett did not burn a flag in the locker room that day. Looking at the photo more closely, it’s obvious that the flag has been Photoshopped into the image. The lighting is all wrong and even though the flag is ablaze in an enclosed space, it doesn’t appear to be giving off smoke. The real proof that the image is fake is that it is actually close to two years old, at least. It appeared in a tweet from the Seahawks on Jan. 3, 2016, and is credited to Rob Mar on the team’s website. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com For the record, Bennett did speak out on the Trump controversy. He said at a CNN town hall event on Sept. 27 that the protests were "about treating people like human beings." "The changes start with the heart," he said. "This is not a violent protest. This is a peaceful protest. We are challenging people spiritually, not physically, spiritually to change the way you have been doing. Change the culture." Trump’s feud has led to other fake claims beyond this one. We previously checked claims that the NFL fined Steelers players $1 million each and that Fox Sports refused to broadcast games "until players respect the flag." We rated both Pants On Fire!

pomt-02869	Under Obama, the national debt "has been reduced every year for the last five years."	false	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/14/al-sharpton/al-sharpton-attacks-sarah-palin-comparing-slavery-/	The Rev. Al Sharpton used his MSNBC show PoliticsNation Tuesday to criticize former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin for recently likening the national debt to slavery. But in doing so, Sharpton and pundit Goldie Taylor made a common mistake -- confusing the national debt with the deficit. Here’s what Sharpton said: "I mean, first of all, slavery in the American context was based on race. So you can’t talk about slavery in American context without talking about race," said Sharpton, reacting to Palin’s defense that her comparison is not racist. "But second of all … the debt … by the way has been reduced every year for the last five years under this president." Taylor then chimed in, "You know, our national debt is as low as it has been since World War II. And so the notion that our national debt is growing at some astronomical rate really is a misnomer." In this case, Sharpton’s specific claim is wrong. The debt has risen each year in terms of dollar amount and as a share of the economy since 2007. And it will continue to increase this year, said Jason Peuquet, Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget research fellow. On Jan. 20, 2009, when Obama took office, the country’s total outstanding debt was $10.6 trillion. It stood at $17.1 trillion as of Nov. 8, 2013, according to the Treasury Department’s "Debt to the Penny" calculator. What Sharpton likely meant to say is that the deficit "has been reduced every year for the last five years." The deficit is the difference between what a government collects in revenues and spends in any one year. The debt is the accumulation of annual deficits minus any annual surpluses. We’re not letting Sharpton off the hook for his words, especially because he should know the difference, but if he had said deficit he’d be closer to the truth. The country started running a deficit instead of a surplus in 2002, at $159 billion. The recent run of deficits peaked in 2009 at $1.4 trillion, Obama’s first year in office. Since then, it’s come down, and there are a couple of ways to count that. One way is in sheer dollars, through historical tables from the White House Office of Management and Budget and the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office: 2008: $458.6 billion deficit 2009: $1.413 trillion deficit 2010: $1.294 trillion deficit 2011: $1.299 trillion deficit 2012: $1.087 trillion deficit 2013*: $642 billion deficit * estimated In this view, the deficit fell in 2010, 2012 and 2013, but increases in 2011. By another measure -- the deficit as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product -- the deficit did fall four consecutive years. Not five, as Sharpton tried to indicate. Unlike in the current-dollar method, the deficit as a measure of GDP between 2010 and 2011 because GDP grew faster in that year, said Alan Auerbach, a University of California economics and law professor. The deficit as a percentage of GDP shot up from 3 percent in 2008 to 10.1 percent in 2009. We turn again to data from White House Office of Management and Budget to look at the trend. 2008: 3.2 percent deficit 2009: 10.1 percent deficit 2010: 9 percent deficit 2011: 8.7 percent deficit 2012: 7 percent deficit 2013*: 6 percent deficit *estimated Projections from the Congressional Budget Office show slightly different percentages, but the trend remains the same for those years. CBO, however, estimates the deficit will fall through 2015 but tick up again in 2016 and beyond. "So, the deficit fell between 2009 and 2012," said Harvey Rosen, Princeton University economics professor, by email. "However, both figures are much bigger than anything since the early 70s (and I suspect since the late 1940s.)" Our ruling Sharpton said that the national debt "has been reduced every year for the last five years." Sharpton confused the downward trend in annual deficits with the debt, which is what he said on air and what Palin controversially likened to slavery. We rate his claim False.

pomt-11473	"Adolf Hitler confiscated all the weapons — took all the weapons, had a registry of everybody — and then on the night of June 30, 1934, sent out his secret police and murdered all of his political opponents."	false	/florida/statements/2018/mar/06/david-simmons/florida-lawmaker-mangles-nazis-gun-control-history/	During a key vote in the Florida Senate to reject an assault weapons ban, Republican Sen. David Simmons argued that the original reason for the Second Amendment was so people could protect themselves from a tyrannical government. Simmons invoked the Nazis to drive home his point. "Adolf Hitler confiscated all the weapons -- took all the weapons, had a registry of everybody -- and then on the night of June 30, 1934, sent out his secret police and murdered all of his political opponents," Simmons said March 3. "You think it doesn't happen in a free society? It does." We reached out to Simmons and did not hear back, but Hitler’s gun policies are a familiar talking point among opponents of gun control, and one that we explored during the 2016 presidential campaign. Simmons’ statement misses several historical facts. Hitler was both a giver and a taker By the time Hitler took power in 1933, Germany had been operating under the 1928 Law on Firearms and Ammunition. The measure relaxed strict controls imposed after World War I that banned all gun ownership, and created a system to register and sell firearms. Columbia University law professor Bernard Harcourt translated a couple of key provisions in the law that exempted "officials of the central government, the states, as well as the German Railways Company" and "community officials to whom the highest government authority has permitted acquisition without an acquisition permit." Dagmar Ellerbrock, an expert on German gun policies at the Dresden Technical University, told us in 2015 that the Nazis introduced a collective gun license for members of Nazi organizations. One of the main beneficiaries was the paramilitary Sturmabteilung, or brownshirts. After the German parliament, the Reichstag, granted Hitler emergency powers in March 1933, he had a free hand. "Under totalitarian rule, it took just a few weeks to drastically increase the number of Germans who held private weapons," Ellerbock said. An armed member of the Sturmabteilung guards Communists arrested in Berlin following a key parliamentary Nazi victory March 5, 1933. (German Federal Archives via Wikicommons) At the same time, the German state confiscated weapons from Jews, Communists, Social Democrats and unions that refused to affiliate with the Nazi Party. Did the 1928 registration law make this easier? Perhaps, but Ellerbock’s research showed many holes in the system. For the most part, it recorded only new sales, while many people had unregistered weapons dating from World War I. When they came to power, the Nazis used whatever gun records they had to seize weapons from their enemies, but Ellerbock told us the files included very few of the firearms in circulation. "In my records, I found many Jews who well into the late 1930s possessed guns," Ellerbock told us. So registration was spotty, confiscation was selective and Nazi allies found it easier, not harder to get weapons. Much later, in 1938, the Nazis passed a new law that liberalized gun ownership in many respects, while simultaneously banning ownership and manufacture by Jews. June 1934 Simmons brought up June 30, 1934, when Hitler "sent out his secret police and murdered all of his political opponents." That was the night of Operation Hummingbird, Hitler’s crackdown on a very specific group – the Sturmabteilung that he had nurtured and encouraged to intimidate any group that stood in his way. The paramilitary group’s leader Ernst Röhm was eager to consolidate his power, and that set him on a collision course with established leaders in the German military and Hitler’s top advisers. They persuaded Hitler that Röhm was planning a coup. Over a span of several days, Röhm and scores of Sturmabteilung leaders were arrested and executed. The Nazis killed at least 85 people, most but not all associated with Röhm. Specific to Simmons’ remark, the incident had more to do with internecine fighting among the Nazi community than with going after disarmed citizens. Quite the opposite, the Nazi leaders knew full well that they were going up against a group that had plenty of weapons. At one tense moment, a truckload of armed brownshirts drove up to the hotel where Röhm was being arrested. According to Hitler’s chauffeur, Hitler himself walked up to the unit’s leader and told him to "drive back to Munich immediately!' The man complied. Our ruling Simmons said that Hitler "took all the weapons" and had a registry of everyone and then, on the night of June 30, 1934, murdered his political opponents. This oversimplifies and mangles the historic facts. While Hitler did take weapons away from Jews, Communists and Social Democrats, he also armed private citizens to better terrorize those same political opponents. To reduce Nazi gun policy to confiscation of weapons is to miss at least half the story. According to a German historian who has gone through the records, Hitler "drastically increased" the number of privately held weapons. On the confiscation side, she noted that the registry was limited and far from comprehensive. Contrary to what Simmons said, Hitler didn’t take everyone’s weapons and the registry at the time was so incomplete that many Jews retained their weapons. Furthermore, Simmons miscasts the connection between Hitler’s gun policies and the events of June 30, 1934. Far from targeting disarmed leaders, it was a strike at the well-armed pro-Nazi Sturmabteilung. Hitler’s real desire to disarm his opponents doesn’t overcome the flaws in this statement. We rate this claim False. Update (March 7): Simmons responds After we published we heard from Simmons. He told us that when he made his remarks, he was referring to the people Hitler subjugated and killed, primarily the Jews. "I do not believe I am in error," Simmons said. "All Jews were denied the ability to have weapons. They had registries of everyone who was Jewish. And they killed 6 million." Simmons said that on the Senate floor, "you only have so much time and you have to condense things." Videotape of Simmons’ remarks shows no mention of the Jews. The claim we checked is complete and omits no context. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	David Simmons	None	None	None	2018-03-06T11:32:39	2018-03-03	['Adolf_Hitler']

pomt-08404	"Since 2000, when he entered politics, Jon Husted has been on the ballot six times for three different political offices."	true	/ohio/statements/2010/oct/22/maryellen-oshaughnessy/maryellen-oshaughnessy-cites-jon-husteds-election-/	Professional experience in politics, unlike many professions, can be viewed as a negative. Current political ads – whether tapping into voter unrest over the economy or local corruption – are warning voters that supporting experienced candidates will not solve their problems. Maryellen O’Shaughnessy, the Democratic candidate for secretary of state, recently felt the sting of being labeled a "professional politician" in a TV commercial paid for by her opponent, Jon Husted. So O’Shaughnessy responded, calling Husted, a Republican, a "perpetual candidate." "Since 2000, when he entered politics, Jon Husted has been on the ballot six times for three different political offices," O'Shaughnessy said in a news release posted on her campaign website in late September. Because Husted decided to make political experience an issue in the race, we decided to check O’Shaughnessy’s counterclaim about his experience. Husted is currently a state senator representing the Dayton area. Before that, he was a state representative for eight years. For four of those years he was Ohio Speaker of the House. He worked for the Dayton Area Chamber of Commerce before arriving in Columbus as a state legislator. O’Shaughnessy, by comparison, was a member of Columbus City Council from 1998 to 2008. She was elected Franklin County clerk of courts in 2008. She also ran unsuccessfully for Franklin County commissioner in 1992 and 2002 and for Congress in 2000. The Ohio secretary of state, the job Husted and O’Shaughnessy are seeking, is in charge of elections in Ohio and keeps records of candidates and election results. So we checked the secretary of state’s website to see how many times Husted has been on the ballot. We also asked O’Shaughnessy’s campaign to explain its count of instances Husted appeared on a ballot. The secretary of state’s office confirmed O’Shaughnessy’s claim that Husted has been on the ballot six times. He ran for state representative – and won each time – in 2000, 2002, 2004 and 2006. Husted was term-limited after his fourth win, so he ran for state senate, and won, in 2008, according to the secretary of state’s website. In Ohio, state representatives serve two-year terms and senators serve four-year terms. His candidacy this year for secretary of state marks his sixth appearance on the ballot for his third different political office. We find O’Shaughnessy’s statement True.

pomt-13159	"We are seeing kids who are healthier."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/28/hillary-clinton/clinton-says-kids-are-healthier/	When Hillary Clinton holds a rally, it’s usually someone else who introduces her. But at an event in Winston-Salem, N.C., on Oct. 27, it was Clinton who teed up the keynoter, Michelle Obama. It was the first time the current first lady has stumped side-by-side with Clinton, and Clinton was effusive in her praise. She noted Obama’s work on behalf of veterans and young women around the world, and she highlighted Obama’s signature campaign, "Let’s Move." "She has worked for healthier childhood for our kids here at home," Clinton said. "Better nutrition, more exercise and we are seeing the results. We are seeing kids who are healthier." Are America’s kids healthier? We decided to check that out. The first thing to note is that there is no single agreed-upon measure for children’s health. The Clinton campaign pointed us to material on obesity. That’s one yardstick, and while there are some signs of improvement, so far they are limited. The latest government data show that the country has made headway among kids 11 and under, but not among older children. Obesity researcher Ashleley Cockrell Skinner at the Duke University Medical School assessed the data cautiously. "We aren’t seeing significant reductions, but there are not continued increases, especially among young children," Skinner said. The first lady has pushed for healthier eating habits, and there’s encouraging news on that front. The government has the Healthy Eating Index. It measures what people eat against the federal dietary guidelines, as in, are we eating our fruits and vegetables, the right amount of whole grains, and so on. The higher the index, the better. For children 2-17, the index has gone up from 49.5 in 2005-06 to 55.1 in 2011-12. That’s good, but Skinner said that while better diet is important, she’s "not convinced that improving nutrition alone will improve obesity rates." And in any event, Skinner said it would take a long time to see any effect on obesity nationally. By other measures, especially ones that fall outside of Michelle Obama’s work, the trends are negative. We looked at the work of the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family Statistics, a body that dates back to the Clinton administration. The forum posts a number of benchmarks. For adolescent depression, the percentage of youth ages 12–17 who had at least one major depressive episode in the past year rose from 9 percent in 2004 to 11.4 percent in 2014. The fraction of kids 5-17 who had their activities limited due to a chronic condition went from 7 percent in 2000 to 9.3 percent in 2014. Asthma for all children 17 and under increased slightly from 12.3 percent in 2000 to 13.5 percent in 2014, although that could be due to better reporting of the disease. On the other hand, because there is no single measure of children’s health, some researchers see longer term gains. Janet Currie is director of the Center for Health and Wellbeing at Princeton University. Currie looks back to how things stood in 1990. "There have been dramatic reductions in mortality rates among all children," Currie said. "The declines are even greater among poor children than among non-poor children, so that inequality in mortality has declined." Currie also noted that drug and alcohol abuse is down, as is the teen pregnancy rate. Our ruling Clinton said that "we are seeing kids who are healthier." She said that in the context of First Lady Obama’s work on nutrition and exercise, and her campaign staff drew our attention to obesity trends. The latest numbers show less obesity for kids 11 and under, but a continued rise for young teens 12 to 17. As for diet, the government’s index for healthy eating has gone up. On the flip side, several measures such as depression, asthma and curtailed activity are moving in the wrong direction. At best, in the areas that lie at the heart of the first lady’s work, the picture is mixed.

pomt-14059	"The geography of poverty has changed fundamentally in the last 15 years," with more of it concentrated in fragile and conflict states.	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/may/23/david-miliband/refugee-aid-head-worlds-poorest-increasingly-found/	Global poverty increasingly is becoming concentrated in areas torn apart by conflict and unrest, International Rescue Committee president David Miliband recently told a Washington, D.C., audience. "43 percent of the world's extreme poor now live in conflict and fragile states," Miliband said May 18, 2016, at the Center for Global Development. Speaking with World Bank president Jim Yong Kim, Miliband made the case for the World Bank to increase its economic development operations. "The mandate of the World Bank is to tackle poverty," Miliband said. "So the geography of poverty has changed fundamentally in the last 15 years." We decided to see if the shift Miliband described is truly under way. It is, though the limited data suggests it’s largely thanks to the success of fighting poverty in non-fragile countries. The clearest evidence comes from this chart in a 2013 Brookings Institution report. As you see, the number of people living in poverty in non-fragile states has declined at a much greater rate than those living in fragile states. Gary Milante, who directs the security and development program for the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, said people should be careful about what they take away from this chart. "Poverty is not becoming concentrated in fragile states because there are more fragile states," Milante said, "rather that fragile states don’t make progress the way the rest of the world does." Be cautious with the data Every expert we reached warned us that while the overall trend is clear, the precise numbers are not. When you think about it, you need two good yardsticks: one for poverty and one for fragility and conflict. And both have to be applied consistently over time. That’s not simple. "The cutoffs for poverty and the methods to estimate household income have shifted over time," said Ben Oppenheim, who co-authored the report that included the 43 percent figure Miliband used. Definitions of a fragile state may have shifted over time as well. Oppenheim and his colleagues used a list from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development which relied partly on an index from the widely cited Fund for Peace. Charles Kenny, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development, told us it’s unclear if the Fund for Peace is "measuring the same thing over time." "If Nigeria or Madagascar are added to the list one year, or taken off, you suddenly have spikes or dips of tens of millions of poor, so it would be much more difficult to discern the trends you're talking about," Milante added. The Brookings report, meanwhile, used a fixed list of countries, regardless of whether they moved in and out of state of conflict or fragility. Our ruling Miliband said that the geography of poverty has fundamentally changed in the past 15 years and is increasingly concentrated in conflict and fragile states. Broadly speaking, the numbers back that up -- because non-fragile states are doing a better job of raising people out of poverty. The biggest cautionary note from experts is that we lack consistent measures of fragility and the list can change significantly from year to year. The statement is accurate, but one has to apply it cautiously.

pomt-07342	"The people of Rhode Island don't want same-sex marriage."	pants on fire!	/rhode-island/statements/2011/may/11/christopher-plante/executive-director-marriage-group-says-most-rhode-/	Opponents and proponents of same-sex marriage are retooling after Rhode Island House Speaker Gordon Fox announced April 27 that there was not enough support to pass same-sex marriage legislation in 2011. A few days after that announcement, Christopher Plante, executive director of National Organization for Marriage - Rhode Island, which opposes gay marriage, was part of a panel on WPRI's "Newsmakers" program, which aired May 1. "I don't believe Gordon Fox had the votes. Our head count showed pretty clearly that they didn't have the votes and he had to make the decision he did," he said. "Similarly, the people of Rhode Island don't want same-sex marriage." NOM-RI has been quick to cite the polls it has commissioned as part of its campaign to press the governor and General Assembly to put the question of gay marriage to a statewide referendum. So we wondered whether any polls show that Rhode Islanders, in fact, don't want same-sex marriage. We called Plante to see if he had any updated numbers. He didn't. He said he was basing his assertion on the belief that a majority of residents had contacted their legislators to object to same-sex marriage, which is why Fox said there weren't enough votes in the House to pass a bill. People who call their legislators don't necessarily reflect the opinion of the general public, just as legislators don't always vote with the majority of their constituents. (In this case, House spokesman Larry Berman told us that the calls coming in to Fox's office "were fairly evenly divided between those in favor of same-sex marriage and those opposed." ) Even opinion polls aren't perfectly reflective because they usually only survey likely voters. But opinion polls are the best indicator we have, so we reviewed recent polls that addressed the issue. NOM-RI itself has done surveys in Rhode Island. In its most recent, in December 2009, respondents were asked: "As far as you are concerned personally, do you favor or oppose same-sex marriage in Rhode Island? And do you feel strongly about this? A majority of those with an opinion actually endorsed same-sex marriage -- 42.6 percent said they strongly or somewhat favored it. Another 32.2 percent strongly or somewhat opposed it -- clearly not a majority, even among those who responded. Just under 23 percent were undecided and the rest had no opinion. That was up from a poll the group conducted six months earlier, when support for gay marriage was 36 percent and opposition was pegged at 43 percent. (In an example of how you can get a different answer if you word the question differently, NOM-RI turned the question on its head in both surveys by asking respondents whether they supported or opposed this statement: "Only marriage between a man and a woman will be valid or recognized in Rhode Island." (In the December 2009 survey, 44.9 percent expressed support for the statement [and, by implication, opposition to gay marriage], 43.6 percent felt the other way, and 9.7 were undecided. But even that question showed a significant increase in support for gay marriage compared to the poll six months earlier, when 52 percent agreed with the anti-gay-marriage statement and 38 percent expressed opposition to it.) Supporters of gay marriage have done their own polling. In a July 2010 poll commissioned by Rhode Island Gay & Lesbian Advocates & Defenders (RI-GLAD), 59 percent of 502 likely voters said they strongly or somewhat favored "allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry legally." Thirty-one percent were somewhat or strongly opposed. In a 2008 RI_GLAD poll, 49 percent favored same-sex marriage; in 2006, 45 percent approved. However, when we looked closer at the 2010 RI-GLAD survey, we found that it initially primed respondents by telling them in an earlier question that, "Churches, clergy and other religious institutions would NOT be required to perform same-sex marriages." That reassurance might have bumped up the approval rating. The only independent Rhode Island poll we found was released by Brown University in May 2009, before the NOM-RI and RI-GLAD polls. Its survey of 593 registered voters found that 60 percent of registered Rhode Islanders expressed support when asked, "Would you support or oppose a law that would allow same-sex couples to get married?" Thirty one percent said they would oppose it. About half of the opposition was hard core - 17 percent said they would even oppose civil unions for gay couples. We mentioned those results to Plante. "Would I repeat that I believe the majority of Rhode Islanders don't want gay marriage? Yeah, I'll repeat that," he said when we spoke with him. "Can I give you a definitive poll that shows that? No." But he also said that his claim is justified because House Speaker Fox couldn't get enough votes for gay marriage in his own chamber. That, he asserted, is because people were "calling their representatives and saying 'We don't want this.' . . . I wasn't making a statistical claim." We disagree. Of course it’s a statistical claim. When you say "the people of Rhode Island don't want same-sex marriage" you're saying that more than 50 percent would oppose such legislation. The most recent polls from Brown, RI-GLAD and even NOM-RI -- Plante’s organization -- show the opposite. Not only did the trends in the NOM-RI and RI-GLAD polls show opposition to same-sex marriage evaporating, the Brown and RI-GLAD polls showed that the public wants gay couples to have the right to marry, even if you assume that every voter who didn't express an opinion was opposed to gay marriage. Plante's assertion isn't just false. It's ridiculous. We rate it Pants On Fire! (To comment or offer your ruling, visit us on Facebook.)

pomt-06707	Says Florida U.S. Reps. Corrine Brown, Alcee Hastings and Frederica Wilson are Socialists.	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2011/sep/02/blog-posting/us-reps-corrine-brown-alcee-hastings-and-frederica/	Word in the blogosphere is that scores of members of Congress are actually unabashed 'S' words. That'd be Socialists. Several bloggers have listed members of Congress by name under headlines like "Why do Americans Keep Electing These Socialist Politicians to Congress??" and "Socialist Party of America Releases The Names of 70 Democrat Members of Congress Who Are Members Of Their Congress." The list -- actually a roster of Congressional Progressive Caucus members (mostly) from Wikipedia -- includes Florida Democrats Corrine Brown, Alcee Hastings and Frederica Wilson. "I'm sure if you asked random people on the street if we had open socialists in the U.S. Congress, they would say – well only Bernie Sanders (Senate). But the right answer is much, much worse," goes an Aug. 12, 2011 post from the website Sovereign Citizens United. On Aug. 17, 2011, citing a different caucus count, Texas radio host Dan Cofall wrote, "The magic number '70' is the number of members of the 111th Congress who are members of the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA). These are not just politicians who vote left of center; these are card-carrying members of ‘The Democratic Socialists of America’." Our colleagues at PolitiFact Oregon vetted the bloggers' claim in this story, concentrating on Oregonian representatives. They pointed out that Cofall's figure is, for one, out of date because we have entered the 112th Congress. Several out-of-office House members from Florida were listed there. Still, his post targets many existing lawmakers. As our colleagues noted, the posts grabbed our attention for their blunt and far-reaching assertions. At PolitiFact Florida, we wanted to check out the claims that Brown, Hastings and Wilson are Socialists, or if it's a virtual Red Scare. Where did the list come from? Sovereign Citizens United connects the officials to socialism for their membership in the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the largest caucus (75 members) within the House Democratic caucus. Founded in 1991, the group of lawmakers supports policies that advance economic justice, civil rights and liberties, global peace and environmental protection, among other causes on its website. We reached out to Sovereign Citizens United and heard back from a Montgomery, Penn., woman named Ruth Miller. Miller sent us several e-mails to back up her blog post. "It is documented FACT that Socialist Bernie Sanders and Democratic Socialists of America created the Congressional Progressive Caucus in 1991 to further their socialist agenda in the US," she wrote. "Any member of Congress who has joined this caucus expresses solidarity with socialism." Miller sent us to a KeyWiki page about the caucus, which claims that the DSA has worked closely with the progressives and links to an old DSA Detroit group's web page. "As a national organization, DSA joins with its allies in Congress' Progressive Caucus and in many other progressive organizations, fighting for the interests of the average citizen both in legislative struggles and in other campaigns to educate the public on progressive issues and to secure progressive access to the media." Then Miller directed us to Henry Lamb, 73, who penned an undated commentary that inspired her blog post (she included an excerpt there). Lamb, founder of advocacy group Freedom 21 and retired chairman of Sovereignty International, said he wrote the essay to show "how similar the organizations were at the time." Lamb wrote: "Socialism in America is alive, well, and growing. Aided by such influential Congressmen as John Conyers, Ranking Member of the House Judicial Committee, David Bonior, the pit-bull-dog who successfully whipped Newt, Maxine Waters, the President's outspoken defender in the impeachment debates, and nearly 60 other Representatives, socialism is advancing in America behind the 'Progressive' label." He goes on to pull excerpts from the Democratic Socialists of America website that explain what the group believes. In a hot pink sidebar, Lamb listed 56 members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus. It includes Brown and Hastings but not Wilson, as she was not yet elected to the House. There's also no analysis of the Progressive Caucus. His piece contains no date, and Lamb -- to whom we spoke -- could not find it in his online archives. So are they Socialists? Neither Brown nor Wilson's office responded to calls and e-mails for comment. A spokeswoman for Hastings e-mailed only to say he was not a member of the Progressive Caucus, which is true -- this year. News accounts show he has been a member in the past. Still, all three are serving as Democrats. All three list their political party affiliation as the Florida Democratic Party on their voter registration cards. Brad Bauman, executive director of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, said none of the group's members are Socialists. "The members of Congress on our caucus are patriots who have chosen to serve," Bauman said, "and to allege that they are not is just simply ridiculous." Even the Democratic Socialists of America does not claim the caucus members. PolitiFact Oregon interviewed the party's past national director of 10 years, Frank Llewellyn, who called the list "completely fraudulent." More from PolitiFact Oregon: There is not one member of Congress who is a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. In order to join, a person must fill out a form and pay dues. Even Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, is not a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. The last member of Congress who was an actual card-carrying member, he said, was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998. In a separate interview with PolitiFact Georgia, Llewellyn said the DSA had nothing to do with the creation of the caucus and would "prefer an alternative third party that supports its values." He outlined a couple policy differences with the progressives in Congress. He said his organization wants larger cuts in military spending and federal income tax rates returned to pre-Reagan administration levels, when they were much higher for the rich. But what about Lamb, the man who wrote untold years ago that "socialism is advancing in America behind the "Progressive" label"? He said it isn't wise to generalize. The name-calling reminds him of recent comments from Rep. Andre Carson, D-Ind., who said some of his tea party colleagues would like to see blacks "hanging from a tree." "I think it would be equally silly for somebody to say that every member of the Progressive Caucus is a Socialist, even though you would have to share similar philosophies with socialist beliefs to sign up," Lamb said. "That doesn't mean necessarily that you are a Socialist." Our ruling You've heard it from the Congressional Progressive Caucus, the Democratic Socialists of America and the author of the commentary that inspired the blog activity: Just because you are a member of the Progressive Caucus does not mean you are a socialist. And none of the caucus members profess to be Socialists, including our Florida Democrats, Brown, Hastings and Wilson. The bloggers go too far in attacking them as socialists, a repeated label for liberals these days. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-14647	"Two million new jobs have been created," in California since 2011.	true	/california/statements/2016/jan/25/jerry-brown/brown-speaks-truth-about-californias-job-growth/	Near the end of his 2016 State of the State address, Gov. Jerry Brown claimed: "two million new jobs have been created," in California since 2011. That’s a lot of new employment, we thought, especially for a state ranked by some as having the nation’s worst business climate, thanks to high taxes and regulation. Brown has staked his legacy, at least during his second stint in the governor’s office, largely on what he calls the "California comeback." We decided to fact check his claim about job creation, which is a big part of that comeback. From 2007 to 2010, California lost more than a million jobs when the state’s housing and construction sectors collapsed. The loss of tax revenue and past skimpy savings meant multi-billion dollar budget shortfalls for California. It also meant heavy cuts in services for the poor, shuttering state parks and allowing levees, bridges and highways to crumble. In his speech at the state Capitol, Brown took some credit for the financial turnaround, noting that he’s helped pay down huge debts and create the state’s Rainy Day Fund. He didn’t take all the credit for the new jobs. "Two million new jobs have been created and unemployment has dropped in half," since 2011, he said in his record 14th State of the State address. "Of course, the global recovery has a lot to do with that. So, we should applaud, but we can’t control it, too." We’ll leave the global impact on California’s recovery as a question for another day. Our focus is on Brown’s comment that "two million jobs have been created" since 2011, the year he returned to the governor’s office, and more than two decades after his initial stretch as the state’s top executive. Crunching the job numbers Sifting through jobs data can be dizzying. And there are many ways to look at the numbers. For some guidance, we turned to Chapman University economist Esmael Adibi, who tracks state employment. Adibi pointed to "nonfarm payroll jobs" tracked monthly by the state and federal governments. Economists consider that category the most reliable because it eliminates farm employment, which fluctuates considerably. Everyone in the nonfarm category is listed on a payroll and considered an employee. Data from that category show that California had 14,301,300 nonfarm jobs in January 2011, when Brown’s third term started. A report released the day after Brown’s address shows the state had more than 16,320,100 of those jobs in December 2015. That’s a growth of just over two million jobs. Experts we spoke with said this is a ‘net job creation’ total. And because many jobs were also lost during this period, the gross number of positions created would have been well over two million. "I believe the governor is correct," Adibi told us. "The economy actually has done pretty good during his leadership." For some perspective, the two million jobs created in California accounts for about one-sixth of the nation’s net 12.4 million jobs added during the same period, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor statistics. It’s also roughly 600,000 more jobs than Texas added during the same period, the federal labor data show. Texas officials, including former Gov. Rick Perry, have made repeated efforts to siphon jobs away from the Golden State. Asked for the source of information for the California governor’s job creation claim, the Brown Administration pointed to the same non-farm payroll data as Adibi. Our ruling In his State of the State address, Gov. Jerry Brown said "two million jobs have been created" in California since 2011. The most reliable data used by both independent economists and the Brown Administration show California had about 14.3 million nonfarm payroll jobs when the governor returned to office in January 2011 and just over 16.3 million jobs last month. That’s a net growth of more than two million jobs. We rate the governor’s claim True.

pomt-01067	The state covered a smaller percentage of the cost of K-12 education in 2013 than it did in 2002.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/jan/20/claire-suggs/analyst-target-education-spending/	Years of state austerity cuts have forced many of the state’s 180 local school districts to furlough or cut employees, increase class sizes and shorten their school years. But they’ve also contributed to a shift in the costs for K-12 education, Claire Suggs, an education policy analyst with the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, said Jan. 9. The state was picking up 56 percent of those costs in Fiscal Year 2002, the year before the austerity cuts began, and only 51 percent in Fiscal 2013, Suggs told reporters at the Georgia Partnership for Excellence in Education’s Media Symposium. "We are relying much more on local and federal dollars," she said. We decided to fact-check Suggs’ statement, given Gov. Nathan Deal’s announcement last week that he expects a major overhaul of the state’s 30-year school funding formula, the Quality Basic Education (QBE) Act of 1985, to be completed and in place for the 2016-2017 school year. Education funding was one of the hot topics of last year’s governor’s race, largely because of those austerity cuts, which started in 2003 under Gov. Sonny Perdue, continued through the recession and Deal’s first four-year term and have cumulatively amounted to more than $8 billion across all school systems. Jason Carter, the Democratic nominee for governor, said the cuts devastated schools and blamed Deal. Deal’s comeback was that Carter voted for three, back-to-back $1 billion austerity cuts and against the 2015 budget with the smallest cut to education in years. With that background, we delve into the numbers. Records from the state Department of Education shows that K-12 education costs totalling about $10.4 billion in Fiscal 2002 were split three ways: with 56 percent covered by the state, 38 percent by locals and 6 percent by the federal government. Fast forward to the Fiscal 2013, the costs for K-12 education were $14.2 billion, and the split was 51 percent state funds, 41 percent local and 8 percent federal. That means Suggs was on target when she said the state’s share of school funding was down 5 percent to 51 percent in 2013, compared to 56 percent in 2002. We also examined K-12 spending for the years in between and saw plenty of fluctuation. For example, the state’s share fell to 51 percent as early as 2004 and to 43 percent at one point. The budget was propped up for a time by $1 billion in federal stimulus and held steady at 51 percent in Fiscal 2013 and 2014. Data isn’t yet available for Fiscal 2015 to see whether the percentage will change based on the decision by Deal and the General Assembly to reduce the current austerity cut to $749 million. That reduction was celebrated by local school districts, a majority of which qualify for extra state money each year as "low wealth" districts. Joe Martin, a longtime education advocate who helped develop the current funding formula, said that, when state funding declines, locals are usually left, with two options: make up the difference or cut instructional programs. "This isn’t easy for any school system, but the systems with a low tax base per student are left in a terrible predicament," said Martin via email from Macedonia, where he’s currently serving in the Peace Corps. These districts "never had much to begin with, compared with the systems that have much greater resources, but they are simply unable to close the gap," Martin said. Mike Griffin, senior policy analyst with the Education Commission of the States in Denver, said state funding generally decreased for public education nationally during the Great Recession as it did in smaller economic downturns in the 1980s and 1990s. Some states swapped out federal stimulus dollars for state dollars when they became available to fund education, although they shouldn’t have, Griffin said. "When those federal dollars started to fade, some states weren’t in good enough shape to replace them," he said. Our conclusion: Suggs was accurate to say that the percentage of state funding for K-12 education was higher in 2002 than it was in 20013. To her larger point, the federal and local governments also have been paying larger shares through these years. But several factors were at play: the recession, the austerity cuts, the stimulus money. The austerity cut is smaller this year than in several years. That’s needed context.

pomt-12027	"African Americans in Missouri are 75 percent more likely to be stopped and searched by law enforcement officers than caucasians."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2017/sep/18/derrick-johnson/naacp-president-partially-accurate-stops-and-searc/	The first travel advisory in the history of the NAACP was issued Aug. 2 for the state of Missouri over concerns about the safety of African Americans, and once again tensions between law enforcement officers, state officials and minorities were thrust into the spotlight. The advisory, originally set to expire Aug. 28, was renewed, according to The New York Times. Missouri NAACP President Rod Chapel said it will remain in effect until at least late September. When NAACP Interim President and CEO Derrick Johnson announced the organization’s travel advisory, he cited statistics that depict racial disparities in Missouri. "The numerous racist incidents, and the statistics cited by the Missouri Attorney General in the advisory, namely the fact that African Americans in Missouri are 75 percent more likely to be stopped and searched by law enforcement officers than Caucasians, are unconscionable, and are simply unacceptable in a progressive society," Johnson said in the statement. The advisory was issued largely in response to SB 43, which requires employees who claim workplace discrimination prove bias is an explicit reason for being fired, rather than just a contributing factor. It was also in response to a "series of questionable, race-based incidents occurring statewide recently." We wanted to look into Johnson’s statement about racial disparities in Missouri. Are law enforcement officers a full 75 percent more likely to pull over and search an African American? Stops versus searches When we reached out to the NAACP, communications director Malik Russell said Johnson may have gotten some of his numbers mixed up, since he didn’t have the data in front of him. But he emphasized the larger point, saying the difference between the numbers that he might have mixed up is small. Russell didn’t give any additional evidence, but the statement announcing the advisory cited data from the attorney general’s office. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In 2000, concerns from both Missouri residents and the legislature prompted the passage of a law that requires law enforcement officers collect specific information, including race, for every traffic stop. Each agency must provide this data to the attorney general, who in turn sends it to the governor. A team of researchers has been compiling this information for the attorney general since 2001. The 2016 Vehicle Stops Report Executive Summary from the attorney general’s office breaks down the data related to vehicle stops last year. There were 21 agencies that did not submit the data by the required date and 58 agencies that reported no stops out of 682 law enforcement agencies in the state. Blacks represent 10.9 percent of the driving population and 18 percent of all traffic stops, while whites represent 82.8 percent of the population and 78 percent of stops. Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, has been on the research team since 2001. Rosenfeld said the researchers divided stops made by the number of people 16 years and older in the state to come up with a "stop rate." A value of one means there is no disparity, values greater than one mean there is overrepresentation, and values below one mean there is underrepresentation. The disparity index, which is the proportion of stops divided by the proportion of the population, was 1.65 for blacks last year, overrepresenting the black population by 65 percent. Whites, on the other hand, were stopped at a .94 rate, underrepresenting the white population by 6 percent. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Researchers divided 1.65 by .94 to get 1.75, or a 75 percent higher stop rate for blacks than whites. This is the number Johnson used in his statement. But stops and searches are different things. Blacks are 57 percent more likely to be searched than whites. (Formula: 8.77 percent search rate for blacks divided by 5.57 search rate for whites = 1.57.) Our ruling Johnson stated that African Americans in Missouri are 75 percent more likely to be stopped and searched by law enforcement officers than caucasians. Blacks in Missouri are 75 percent more likely to be stopped by law enforcement officers than whites, which is reflected in the attorney general data. That’s not true about searches. Blacks are 57 percent more likely to be searched than whites. The discrepancy in searches is huge, but it’s not 75 percent. We rate Johnson’s statement Half True.

pomt-00070	Says Tony Evers wants to give in-state tuition and drivers licenses to "illegal aliens."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2018/nov/02/scott-walker/walker-scores-illegal-aliens-claim-against-evers/	In a TV ad launched days before the Nov. 6, 2018, election, Republican Gov. Scott Walker went after his Democratic opponent on immigration. The spot — released Oct. 23 — dings Tony Evers on taxes before saying the longtime state schools superintendent "wants to give in-state tuition to illegal aliens … and driver’s licenses, too." The ad includes clips of Evers taken from the Oct. 19, 2018, debate sponsored by the Wisconsin Broadcasters Association. They show Evers saying he would support legislation "that would allow DACA students … to have in-state tuition," and that he supports driver’s licenses "for undocumented folks." Do those clips justify the ad’s summary that Evers supports tuition and licenses for "illegal aliens?" Let’s take a closer look. Defining the terms The truth of this claim hinges on the definition of a few different immigration terms, notably "illegal alien." That’s the preferred verbiage by many on the right for undocumented immigrants. Whatever the term, it refers to people who entered or reside in the country in violation of the law -- such as without visas or passports. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas found the term "illegal alien" crops up a few times in federal law, mostly in section headings, but it is never officially defined. Similar terms are used -- and defined -- by the federal government, however. For instance, the IRS defines "undocumented alien" as one "who entered the United States illegally without the proper authorization and documents, or who entered the United States legally and has since violated the terms of his or her visa or overstayed the time limit." Meanwhile, the tuition question focuses specifically on DACA, or Deferred Action Childhood Arrivals, a program that has been in the news since President Donald Trump’s administration took steps to end it a year ago. Federal courts have so far halted that effort. Those protected under DACA are often referred to as "Dreamers." The U.S. Department of Homeland Security program launched DACA in 2012 under President Barack Obama to allow certain people who came to the country illegally as children to request a two-year deferral of immigration action. It also allows them to legally work. DACA status, which is granted at the discretion of prosecutors, is open to people who: Were under age 31 as of June 2012 Came to the U.S. prior to their 16th birthday Have lived in the U.S. continually since at least June 2007 Were in the U.S. in June 2012 and had no lawful status then Are currently in school, have graduated from high school, have obtained a GED or have been honorably discharged from the Armed Forces Have not been convicted of a felony, significant misdemeanor, or three or more other misdemeanors With that background, let’s look at the two parts of the claim in more detail. Evers on in-state tuition In the debate, Evers was asked whether DACA students should get in-state tuition. Evers’ response: "I would propose or support legislation that would allow DACA students to be a part of, to have in-state tuition." Former Gov. Jim Doyle signed a measure in 2009 allowing undocumented students to pay in-state tuition at public universities if they graduated from high school here, but Walker repealed that in 2011. As noted, those with DACA status have met certain criteria to be recognized by the government and, as such, would not face immediate deportation. But DACA students by definition are those who are in this country without proper documentation, even if they were brought here by their parents as young children. DACA allows the person to defer immigration action but "does not provide lawful status," according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. And that’s not a position unique to the present administration. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, under Obama, defined DACA immigrants as part of the group that should be counted as "unauthorized resident immigrant population." Evers on driver’s licenses This statement is pretty clear cut. From Evers during the debate: "Do I think that we should have permits, driver permits for undocumented folks that are working in the state of Wisconsin? The answer is yes. Undocumented folks are working hard at jobs all across the state of Wisconsin, paying taxes, paying Social Security. They should have the opportunity … to have permits." Evers said an added benefit is that requiring a permit means undocumented residents "have to learn how to drive safely in Wisconsin." Evers uses "undocumented" instead of the "illegal aliens" term the Walker ad invokes, but the terms are substantially similar in common usage. Currently, someone in the country illegally cannot get a driver’s license in Wisconsin, though immigrants who have obtained the DACA designation can, said Davorin Odrcic, a Milwaukee immigration attorney. Our rating Walker claims in a TV ad that Evers supports granting driver’s licenses and in-state tuition for "illegal aliens." Walker is clearly on point on the driver’s license issue. As for in-state tuition for DACA students, Evers backs that, too. There is a wrinkle though, in that those with DACA status have met certain criteria to be recognized by the government and, as such, would not face immediate deportation. That said, by definition they are not in the country legally. Their DACA status delays official action against them, but it doesn’t change the lack of legal status. So the statement is accurate, but it requires some clarification and detail on DACA status. That’s our definition of Mostly True.

pomt-11069	"There's been a 1,700 percent increase in asylum claims over the last 10 years."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jun/21/donald-trump/1700-percent-increase-asylum-claims/	President Donald Trump argued that immigrants entering illegally are gaming the American immigration system, citing a remarkable rise in asylum applications. He said some asylum seekers are actually abusing the process with criminal intentions. "There's been a 1,700 percent increase in asylum claims over the last 10 years," Trump said in a June 19 speech. "Think of that. Think of that. We're a great country but you can't do that. Smugglers know how the system works. They game the system; they game it." Has there been a 1,700 percent increase in asylum claims? The numbers stack up. But the claims of gaming the system are less supported. Trump is talking about "credible fear" cases, which is spelled out in the Refugee Act of 1980. It's available for people unable or unwilling to return to their home country "because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion." Migrants who are apprehended or unable to enter the country legally can claim "credible fear" in order to get a hearing before an immigration court. The Homeland Security Department tracks cases in which a decision to grant a hearing has been made, which differs only slightly from the number of all claims made. In 2007, 5,171 people claimed credible fear and had their cases reviewed. In 2016, it was 91,786. That represents a 1,675 percent hike, basically as Trump claimed. Between 60 and 80 percent of those cases were approved for further court review. Overall, 20 percent of applicants were ultimately granted asylum in fiscal year 2017, the Homeland Security Department told us. Not necessarily gaming the system But that doesn’t mean asylum seekers are gaming the system. The majority have valid claims of fear in their home countries, experts told us. Louis Desipio, a University of California Irvine political science professor who specializes in immigration, told us that while more people are affirmatively expressing their right to apply for asylum, their claims are not necessarily without merit. "Initially, a lot of migration was single males from Mexico coming for work, and now you’re seeing a shift to Central American families fleeing record levels of violence in the northern triangle" of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, said Joshua Breisblatt, a senior policy analyst at the American Immigration Council. "There is no indication that that’s an increase in fraud, that’s just something that is happening in the United States’ backyard." Asylum requests by citizens of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras made up 72.9 percent of total claims in fiscal year 2016. "Our laws are clear," said Kate Voigt, associate director of government relations at the American Immigration Lawyers Association. "If you express a fear of returning to your home country, you have a right to a credible fear screening. If the asylum officer finds you have a credible fear of persecution in your home country, then you have a right to have an immigration judge hear your case." Under the last several administrations, Customs and Border Protection increased its use of expedited removal, according to Lenni B. Benson, a law professor at New York Law School. Given the only way to stop an expedited removal order is to seek a credible fear review, Benson said this might explain the hike in numbers. As we noted, the overall grant rate for all asylum applications nationwide was 20 percent in fiscal year 2017, a percentage hasn’t changed much since 2012. But Guadalupe Correa-Cabrera, a professor at George Mason University’s Schar School of Policy and Government who has interviewed hundreds of migrants for immigration research, said the variation in numbers between case approvals and asylum application approvals does not prove fraud, either. In order to get their cases of asylum initially approved, immigrants arriving illegally must fill out a survey to show whether their conditions qualify under the definition of persecution. In order to prove they merit asylum, they must show evidence they often lack before a court. The United States has also narrowed its standards for asylum under Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Desipio said, precluding victims of domestic abuse and gang violence from qualifying for asylum. "It’s very complicated for these people," Correa said. "How, if they are in the United States after that very difficult journey, are they going to prove they have been extorted, show that their kids have been recruited by gangs?" Correa said there are definitely cases of fraud by smugglers who attempt to reunite children with their parents. But there are also families fleeing situations of extreme insecurity. Our ruling Trump said, "There's been a 1,700 percent increase in asylum claims over the last 10 years." There was a 1,675 percent increase in asylum claims reviewed by the Homeland Security Department from 2008 to 2017. But that does not evidence fraud, as Trump suggested. Record levels of violence and persecution abroad largely explain the rise in asylum claims, experts told us. While the percentage of individuals whose asylum claims are approved by the Justice Department is relatively low, it might be explained by the much higher bar set by a court appearance than the completion of a survey. We rate this claim Mostly True. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2018-06-21T10:05:55	2018-06-19	['None']
pomt-03039	Because of the 2011 debt ceiling fight, "the stock market lost 2,000 points."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/08/charles-schumer/charles-schumer-says-dow-jones-lost-2000-points-af/	If the nation hits the debt ceiling later this month without it being raised by Congress, economists predict a wide spread of economic harm: higher interest rates, lower economic growth and plunging consumer confidence in the United States and overseas. One particularly high-profile sign of economic distress would be a plummeting Dow Jones Industrial Average. During an appearance on ABC’s This Week With George Stephanopoulos, Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., cited that scenario as one of the reasons why Congress should take action soon. Stephanopoulos asked Schumer whether both sides were "posturing" and "playing with fire" on the debt ceiling, which is the legal limit to how much debt the government can shoulder. Schumer said, "You don't negotiate over something like the debt ceiling because --" at which point Stephanopoulos interjected, "Other presidents have done it." Schumer responded, "No. The one time that it was really done in this kind of way, (when it wasn’t just) a deadline and you had to decide (on) abortion or something else, was in 2011. We went right up to the deadline. The stock market lost 2,000 points, $18 billion was lost by the American people." We wondered whether Schumer was right about the stock market losing 2,000 points. So we looked at historical data for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the most popular measure of the stock market. On July 21, 2011, the Dow reached 12,724 -- its high point in the months immediately preceding the debt ceiling fight. For the next 10 days, Congress squabbled over raising the debt ceiling. Then, between July 31 and Aug. 2, the White House and congressional leaders reached and implemented a deal that became known as the Budget Control Act of 2011. By Aug. 2, when the crisis was effectively over, the Dow stood at 11,866, a drop of 858 points. That’s less than the 2,000 points Schumer cited. However, the Dow continued to tumble for another two months, due in large part to repercussions of the debt ceiling debate, particularly the downgrading of the United States’ credit rating by Standard & Poors on Aug. 5. By Oct. 3, the Dow had bottomed out at 10,655 -- a decline of 2,069 points from its pre-debt ceiling peak, and its lowest level in about a year. So if you include the aftershocks of the debt ceiling fight, Schumer is correct that the Dow fell by 2,000 points. (You can see the decline as a line chart here.) That said, it’s also worth noting that the recovery was almost as quick as the decline. It took only until Jan. 25, 2012 -- about three and a half months after the low point -- for all of the pre-debt ceiling losses to be recouped. By Jan. 25, the Dow hit 12,758. And as Schumer was speaking on This Week, the most recent Dow close was 15,072 -- an 18 percent increase over the pre-debt ceiling high, which had been about two years and three months earlier. Matt House, a spokesman for Schumer, said the Dow’s subsequent recovery is irrelevant. "Of course (the Dow) came back, but that is of little comfort to anyone who was at or nearing retirement during those several months," he said. "With 10,000 baby boomers retiring a day, that drop is incredibly important, and not to be trivialized. .... And this is all from a default that didn’t happen." Still, we think it’s important to note that the 2,000 points the Dow lost didn’t stay off for years, or even permanently, as some viewers might assume. Our rating Schumer said that because of the 2011 debt ceiling fight, "the stock market lost 2,000 points." If you count the aftermath of the deal that avoided a debt ceiling breach, which included a historic downgrade of the United States’ creditworthiness rating, then Schumer is right that the Dow fell by 2,000 points. Still, Schumer makes it sound as if the drop happened right away. Actually, it dropped at the time of fight and continued to drop for another two months after the United States' credit rating was downgraded. We rate Schumer’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-00560	Says Hillary Clinton's "been very clear where she stands on trade."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/14/john-podesta/hillary-clinton-has-been-very-clear-trade-campaign/	One might expect that as a former secretary of state, Hillary Clinton would have well-defined views on the ongoing fight over President Barack Obama’s trade agenda. But critics of the Democratic presidential candidate -- even within her own party -- have chastised Clinton for taking a vague position on the debate over the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement. Democrats are deeply divided over the deal, primarily over whether Congress should accept legislative procedures that would make it easier to approve a deal amid concerns regarding American workers and the environment. "Surely, a person who was secretary of state understands something about American leadership," said Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., on Fox News Sunday June 14. "And to refuse to even take a position (on TPP) is just sort of mystifying to me." Clinton’s supporters, meanwhile, say there’s nothing mystifying about Clinton’s position. Here’s how Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta explained it to Meet the Press’ Chuck Todd. "She’s been very clear on where she stands on trade," Podesta said, noting that Clinton has said a trade agreement must protect workers and national security. "But the agreement’s not final, so when it is final, she’ll render a judgement on that. She’s stated her concerns, but she’s got a clear standard that it’s got to be good for American workers or she thinks the United States should walk away from it." We decided to take a look at Clinton’s comments on trade from the campaign so far and see if she has expressed a "very clear" stance -- a sentiment echoed by Clinton campaign hands Robby Mook and Karen Finney, also on the June 14 political talk shows. Recent comments To a certain extent, Clinton has laid out where she stands on trade in general in recent months, but she has avoided saying whether she definitively supports the pending deal and the fast-track trade authority many believe is necessary to make the deal happen. Here’s a selection of her recent comments, starting with the most recent: June 14 at an Iowa rally: Just a few hours after the morning shows, Clinton said Obama should "work with his allies in Congress" to ensure better protection for workers and "to make sure we get the best, strongest deal possible." Even though she urged them to make some changes to the deal, she didn’t specify the exact changes, nor did explicitly express overall support or disapproval. May 22 at a New Hampshire press conference: Clinton said she has some questions about the TPP, regarding the potential for currency manipulation and the controversial investor-settlement-dispute mechanism, as well as health and environmental concerns. "I've been for trade agreements, I've been against trade agreements, voted for some, voted against others, so I want to judge this when I see exactly what exactly is in it and whether or not I think it meets my standards," she said. May 19 at a small business lending roundtable: "I've said over and over again any trade deal that I will support must increase jobs, must increase wages, must give us more economic competitive power around the world to sell our products and must be good for our national security." April 17 statement: A campaign spokesman said Clinton would be watching the TPP "closely" to make sure it meets her standards. He said, "Hillary Clinton believes that any new trade measure has to pass two tests: First, it should put us in a position to protect American workers, raise wages and create more good jobs at home. Second, it must also strengthen our national security. We should be willing to walk away from any outcome that falls short of these tests. The goal is greater prosperity and security for American families, not trade for trade’s sake." So Clinton has said she supports trade under certain conditions, though she hasn’t really said anything that shows how she would vote if she was still a member of the Senate today. Namely, she hasn’t said whether or not she would vote to grant Obama fast-track trade promotion authority, the legislative maneuver that would make it easier to pass a trade deal -- currently the main source of Democrat infighting over trade. Speaking about TPP in a 2014 Council on Foreign Relations interview, Clinton briefly talked about fast track, saying only that she thought it was "not likely" that Congress would grant Obama the authority. But she said that she hoped the administration would be able to convince Congress and the American people that it’s critical for the American economy to address "border barriers to our products" so that the deal could pass even without fast track. Before the campaign Before Clinton’s 2016 campaign officially launched -- and also before the trade fight heated up -- Clinton made statements that showed general support for TPP, even saying that the deal as it stood then satisfied many of her concerns. In her 2014 memoir Hard Choices, Clinton wrote that she didn’t want to definitively give support for the trade deal before the details are all hammered out -- but she still called it the "signature economic pillar of our strategy in Asia." She said the deal lowered "trade barriers while raising standards on labor, the environment, and intellectual property. ... It was also important for American workers, who would benefit from competing on a more level playing field. And it was a strategic initiative that would strengthen the position of the United States in Asia." Speaking in Australia in 2012, she said the "TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements to open free, transparent, fair trade, the kind of environment that has the rule of law and a level playing field. And when negotiated, this agreement will cover 40 percent of the world's total trade and build in strong protections for workers and the environment." It’s also interesting to note Clinton’s 2008 campaign position on pending trade deals -- much more defined than her current position on TPP -- and how they changed when she joined the Obama administration. For example, in an April 2008 speech where she discussed a proposed trade agreement with Colombia, she said, "As I have said for months, I oppose the deal. I have spoken out against the deal, I will vote against the deal, and I will do everything I can to urge the Congress to reject the Colombia Free Trade Agreement." But as secretary of state in 2010, she said of the same deal: "First, let me underscore President Obama's and my commitment to the Free Trade Agreement. We are going to continue to work to obtain the votes in the Congress to be able to pass it. We think it's strongly in the interests of both Colombia and the United States." Our ruling Podesta said Hillary Clinton has been "very clear on where she stands on trade." While you can argue that clear is a bit of a subjective term, it’s hard for any neutral person to say Clinton has been clear about trade, particularly in the context of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Clinton has avoided answering whether she supports grants Obama fast-track trade promotion authority, which is seen as the linchpin to cutting a trade deal in Asia. Clinton has said what she would like in an ideal trade deal in terms of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But she has yet to say definitively whether or not Obama’s pending trade deal meets her standards -- though she has admitted some provisions could use improvement. This is a change from just a couple years ago, when she seemed more supportive than not of the pending trade deal. Does any of this sound "very clear" to you?

pomt-06813	Says GOP recall challenger Kim Simac "was delinquent paying her property taxes eight of the last nine years."	true	/wisconsin/statements/2011/aug/12/greater-wisconsin-political-fund/greater-wisconsin-political-fund-says-recall-candi/	In July 2011, when allies of state Sen. Jim Holperin (D-Conover) hit his recall challenger, Republican Kim Simac, for failing to pay income taxes, Simac punched back -- metaphorically speaking, of course. Simac accused her foes of believing that struggling small-business owners such as she are "too poor to run for public office." She blamed the troubles of her horse-training business, Great Northern Adventure Co., on the poor economy, and said she had no tax liability to pay. The tax attack on Simac, a party activist and founder of the Northwoods Patriots, continued a few weeks later, when a union-backed group, the Greater Wisconsin Political Fund, launched a TV ad. That ad says Simac, who has campaigned for a property tax freeze, had no credibility on the topic of taxes given her personal record. In addition to other taxes, the ad focused on property tax payments on the home Simac co-owns on the 22-acre horse ranch, saying she was "was delinquent paying her property taxes eight of the last nine years." To get to the bottom of the deliquency claim, we first asked the Greater Wisconsin Political Fund and the related Greater Wisconsin Committee to provide their basis for the claim. Greater Wisconsin is funded by labor and Democratic Party groups and wealthy individual donors. The Greater Wisconsin Committee has been running a pro-Holperin ad in the district in northern Wisconsin. The group referred us to a WAOW-TV online story July 28, 2011 that reported a pattern of delinquencies. The story said Simac "paid all outstanding property tax bills in June." After organizing the recall against Holperin, Simac announced her intention to run in early May. Simac campaign spokesman Matt Capristo told us Simac was never behind on her payments under Wisconsin law. Let’s take a look. We turned to the Vilas County treasurer’s office, which has the detail on tax payments on two properties Simac owns: a Town of Lincoln home on the horse ranch, and an undeveloped property in the City of Eagle River. On the home and ranch -- valued at $242,000 and co-owned with her husband, Arthur -- Simac was delinquent in 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009 and 2010, according to records reviewed for us by Deputy Treasurer Peggy Cleveland. She paid on time in 2008. The late payments typically involved missing the January 31 deadline. That’s when, under state law, taxes are due in full or the first of two installments must be made. In most cases, Simac paid up later in the same year. The exception was 2002 and 2003, which Simac didn’t pay until May 2004, Cleveland said. Simac was charged -- and paid -- interest on the delinquent payments. On the second property, the frequency of delinquent payments was exactly the same. In 2006, she paid taxes that were due in 2004 and 2005. In Simac’s defense, Capristo said the cash flow of her tourist-related business made it impossible for her to pay in January. "She pays it when she gets it," he said. As for the timing of her payments, Capristo said property taxes are really not due in full until July 31 -- the legal deadline for the second installment payment. He added that he understood that Simac paid her taxes in time to meet that July 31 date. But according to Vilas County tax officials, the legal deadline to pay all or at least the first installment is Jan. 31. That point is clearly backed up by state statutes and other treasurer’s offices and is stated on homeowners tax bills. Here is a typical warning, this from a City of Milwaukee property tax bill: "WARNING: If the first installment payment is not paid by the due date, the installment option is lost. The total tax becomes delinquent and is subject to interest and penalty charges." Beyond that, the records show it’s not nearly the case Simac that made her payments in every instance by July 31 of the given year, as her aide claimed. On the property containing her home, which is the focus of the TV ad, she was two years late at one point, and made other second installments in August and November, Cleveland said records show. Three times, she made a timely January installment but was late on the second. Five times, she missed January altogether. Records show Simac is all paid up for 2010, though she missed the January deadline on her main property. She paid in full on June 14, 2011. Her bill was $1,992 in taxes and $99 in interest. The bottom line? The Greater Wisconsin Committee went after recall challenger Kim Simac for having delinquent property taxes in eight of the last nine years. Public records backed that claim. Indeed, Simac’s own understanding of the law, as articulated by her campaign, was off. We rate the group’s claim True.

pomt-06420	"In 2008, when Flint had 265 sworn officers on their police force, there were 35 murders and 91 rapes in this city. In 2010, when Flint had only 144 police officers, the murder rate climbed to 65, and rapes … climbed to 229."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/25/joe-biden/update-joe-biden-says-murders-and-rapes-increased/	Editor’s note: When we first examined this statement from Vice President Joe Biden, we rated his statement Mostly True. We noted in that report, published Oct. 20, 2011, that the numbers he gave for rapes seemed questionable. Shortly afterwards, we explained why our original report was at odds with other independent fact-checkers in a story, "When fact-checkers disagree." We also asked for reaction from readers. Since then, we found more definitive evidence that Biden's numbers on rape are wrong. We have re-reported this item and given it a new rating of Half True. We have also archived our original report with the Mostly True rating. If Congress doesn’t pass President Barack Obama’s jobs plan, crimes like rape and murder will go up as cops are laid off, says Vice President Joe Biden. It’s a stark talking point. But Biden hasn’t backed down in the face of challenges during the past week, citing crime statistics and saying, "Look at the facts." In a confrontation with a conservative blogger on Oct. 19, Biden snapped, "Don’t screw around with me." We were intrigued by comments Biden made in Flint, Mich., on Oct. 12, 2011: "In 2008, when Flint had 265 sworn officers on their police force, there were 35 murders and 91 rapes in this city. "In 2010, when Flint had only 144 police officers, the murder rate climbed to 65, and rapes, just to pick two categories, climbed to 229. "In 2011, you now only have 125 shields. God only knows what the numbers will be this year for Flint if we don't rectify it. And God only knows what that number would have been had we not been able to get a little bit of help to you." We looked at Biden’s crime numbers and turned to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's Uniform Crime Statistics to confirm them. But the federal numbers aren’t the same as the numbers Biden cited. (Several of our readers did the same thing; we received several requests to check Biden’s numbers.) What’s going on here? We asked Biden’s office, and they said they got the numbers from the city of Flint. For the sake of clarity, we’ll look at the murder numbers first and then turn to the rape numbers. Murders in Flint Our research showed murders are an acknowledged problem in the city of Flint. The Flint Journal reported that murders in the city reached a historic high of 66 in 2010, with homicides happening so often that one officer deemed the city a "killing field." That same year, the city laid off 66 officers, bringing the total number to about 120. In May 2011, Flint voters approved a tax renewal to prevent more layoffs. But they rejected a separate tax increase to fund the city jail. The jail has been shuttered since 2008. When when we looked at the FBI’s crime statistics, we found that Flint reported 32 murders in 2008 and 53 murders in 2010. (The Michigan State Police reported the same numbers.) Biden said 35 and 65 -- not exactly the same, but in the ballpark. After Biden’s remarks garnered attention, the city of Flint released a statement to several news organizations saying that the 2010 data reported to the FBI was incorrect, due to a clerical error, and that the number Biden used was accurate. Rapes in Flint For rapes, though, the numbers seemed seriously off. The FBI showed 103 rapes in 2008 and 92 rapes in 2010 -- a small decline. The numbers Biden cited were 91 rapes in 2008 and 229 in 2010 -- a dramatic increase. At first, we wondered if the differences were the result of the FBI’s more restrictive reporting requirements for what constitutes rape. The FBI definition -- "the carnal knowledge of a female, forcibly and against her will" -- is particularly restrictive, excluding male victims and other types of sexual assaults. (The New York Times recently published a detailed report on the problems of the rape definition.) However, it now seems clear that numbers the city of Flint gave Biden were wrong, that someone in the city used numbers for rape alone in 2008 but all categories of criminal sexual misconduct in 2010. (Our friends at Factcheck.org noted this discrepancy in several of their ongoing reports on the topic.) We checked numbers for rape with the Michigan State Police. They found that the Flint Police Department reported that rape, using the most restrictive definition, declined from 108 in 2008 to 92 in 2010. The state police also provided us numbers reported by the Flint Police Department for all sexual crimes, and those too declined, from 262 incidents in 2008 to 219 incidents in 2010. We should note that the city of Flint e-mailed us one statement in defense of the numbers Biden used. But the city’s spokesperson has not answered repeated phone calls and e-mails from PolitiFact to further explain discrepancies. Do more police officers mean less crime? So Biden is largely correct on murder in Flint going up, but wrong about the increase in rapes. Still, how would Obama’s jobs bill increase the number of police? It does not directly fund police positions. Rather, it sends additional money to the states, primarily for education. Biden is likely making the assumption that additional money in one area could prevent layoffs in another, as many states are required to balance their budget on an annual or biannual basis. Then there’s the question of whether fewer cops equals more crime. Generally speaking, most of the evidence we reviewed said that the number of police is one factor among several in preventing crime. James Alan Fox, a criminologist at Northeastern University, said he agreed with Biden’s general point. The primary problem with reducing force strength is that there are fewer officers to staff special units that target a community’s particular problems, such as gangs or sexual assaults, he said. Large-scale reductions like Flint’s are particularly problematic, because rebuilding a force when the economy improves will take time, according to Fox. "It’s not like a light switch you can turn off and on," he said, because it takes so much time to hire and train new officers. "I’m always concerned when police force numbers are cut drastically. In the long run, it’s very problematic." We then turned to the peer-reviewed literature to see if social scientists have been able to isolate the effect of the size of the police force on crime. We found several recent studies concluded more police did reduce crime. But we also found at least one study that questioned the previous research, saying they did not control for other factors, such as public intolerance of crime. Our ruling Biden cited statistics saying that as Flint reduced its police force, the number of murders and rapes increased significantly. We find good evidence that the number of murders increased, but the number of rapes actually declined. Experts we spoke with and research we reviewed suggest that police force size has some bearing on crime but that it is only one of several factors. In ruling on Biden’s statement, we rate his statement Half True.	None	Joe Biden	None	None	None	2011-10-25T18:43:34	2011-10-12	['Flint,_Michigan']
pomt-02837	Florida "remains the top travel destination across the world."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2013/nov/21/rick-scott/rick-scott-declares-florida-top-travel-destination/	Florida Gov. Rick Scott is our salesman-in-chief when it comes to recruiting tourists. His office blasted a press release chock full of statistics about tourism in Florida that made us nod off like a lazy tourist on the beach -- until we came across this phrase: "As we move toward our third consecutive year of record tourism growth, it is clear why the Sunshine State remains the top travel destination across the world," stated the Nov. 15 press release. The "top travel destination across the world"? Is the home state of Mickey Mouse kicking the derriere of tourist hot spots like France? We went on a virtual trip to find out. Florida tourism stats We asked a spokesman for Scott for an explanation as to how he arrived at his claim. John Tupps said Scott was simply expressing a personal opinion that Florida is the best place to visit in the whole world, not making a quantitative statement. "The governor truly believes Florida is the ‘top travel destination’ in the world," Tupps said in an email. "It’s his personal view." We thought Scott’s wording went further than a personal opinion, though, so we decided put his statement on the Truth-O-Meter. We soon found that comparing tourism stats is tricky, because various states and countries use different methodologies to count visitors. Visit Florida, a quasi-state agency, counts out-of-state, overnight visitors. By that measurement, Florida had 91.5 million visitors in 2012. In California in 2012, there were 61 million out-of-state overnight trips. New York had about 62 million overnight out-of-state visitors in 2011, the most recent year available. So in state-to-state competition, Florida wins on the metric that Visit Florida uses. But the picture changes when we look around the world. According to the U.N.’s World Tourism Organization, in 2012, there were 83 million international visitors to France, compared with the United States in second place with 67 million. So on the metric of international visitors, France is clearly leading Florida. "We continue to say our goal is to beat France," said Kathy Torian, a spokeswoman for Visit Florida. Still, the comparison of Florida with France is tricky, because France is a country and Florida is a state. Florida’s 19 million population is about one-third the size of France’s population of about 66 million. Also, many Europeans travel to France just for a weekend, or visitors book a short stay in France, and then move on to other European destinations. So France may not be as dominant as its visitor counts make it appear. Comparing the number of visitors is not the only way to compare tourism rankings. We could also examine the amount of money spent by visitors. And while France is No. 1 in the number of international visitors, it tumbles behind the United States and Spain when you consider spending, the AP reported: "International visitors spent more than double in the U.S. than they did in France in 2012 – $126.2 billion, compared to $53.7 billion, according to the U.N.’s World Tourism Organization. That despite the fact that France welcomed 20 percent more tourists." The U.S. Travel Association reports that travel spending was $71.5 billion in Florida in 2011. That amount lags behind California, at $105 billion in 2011. Both those numbers top France's $53.7 billion in 2012. But to Scott's point, those spending numbers still don't put Florida in the No. 1 position. Our ruling While touting Florida’s tourism numbers, Scott said, "The Sunshine State remains the top travel destination across the world." There isn’t one simple way to declare "the" top travel destination in the world. But Scott’s claim would probably elicit a "mais non!" from Scott’s counterparts in France, who can boast to being the undisputed global leader of international tourists. And if you don't consider France a fair comparison, recent data on travel spending shows that California edges out Florida. Visit Florida is clamoring to achieve that No. 1 ranking, but we didn’t find proof that we are already there. Scott is clearly a cheerleader for his own state, but the data to back up his claim is murky and difficult to substantiate. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-13456	Says "Patrick Murphy is the only candidate to have voted against every measure to fund Zika."	false	/florida/statements/2016/sep/14/marco-rubio/patrick-murphy-has-voted-against-every-zika-fundin/	While the Senate bickers over Zika funding, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio’s campaign says Democratic challenger U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy has been playing partisan politics over the issue in the House. The same day the Senate failed to approve emergency public health funding to deal with Zika for the third time in three months, Rubio spokeswoman Olivia Perez-Cubas said Murphy has been an obstructionist. "Patrick Murphy is the only candidate to have voted against every measure to fund Zika," she said on Sept. 7, 2016. (By "only," she meant the only general election Senate candidate, comparing Murphy to Rubio.) That doesn’t sound like the position a Florida congressman facing a Zika outbreak would take in an election year, so we checked the record. We should note Rubio has supported high-level funding for Zika efforts, even co-sponsoring a bill with Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson. Perez-Cubas was speaking for Rubio, so we are putting Rubio on the Truth-O-Meter. It turns out Murphy has opposed plenty of Republican-backed funding proposals, but "every" is putting it too strong. He still has voted for some measures. Funding malaise President Barack Obama first asked Congress for $1.89 billion in funding in February 2016 to deal with a potential outbreak of Zika. The virus has been linked to cases of infant microcephaly, or babies born with abnormally small heads. There is no treatment or vaccine for the disease, so focus has been on prevention. There are at least 771 cases of Zika in Florida, including several local transmissions in the Miami area. But that count may not always be the most accurate. Murphy has been involved with other Zika-related bills, including acting as a cosponsor for a Democrat-favored measure (HR 5044) that provided the full amount Obama requested. Those bills have not left committees in the House. A deeply partisan Congress, meanwhile, has fought all year over finding the money for mosquito control, vaccine development, diagnosing the disease, public education campaigns and more. There have been several measures introduced to deal with the disease, but the main focus this summer has been on some legislative wrangling over appropriations bills. House Republicans on May 18 passed a measure (HR 5243) that would have provided $622 million for Zika. With Obama threatening to veto the measure, Murphy voted no on that one with other Democrats. It was not taken up in the Senate. The next day, Murphy voted yes for a bill (HR 4974) that would have allowed the White House to repurpose leftover funding to deal with the 2014 Ebola outbreak and use it for Zika. Rubio’s campaign said this bill didn’t count, because there was no specified dollar amount, and didn’t guarantee the money would be used for Zika, only that it could. But that’s splitting hairs, because HR 4974 still would have provided at least one option to fund Zika-related programs. Now it’s time for a civics lesson, because what the House did next wasn’t covered on Schoolhouse Rock. The House then passed another bill (HR 2557) that was originally about funding for transportation and other agencies. Instead, the bill became a vehicle for Zika funding using language from HR 5243, the Republican measure. The House wanted $622 million for Zika, but cut that money from other programs in order to stay budget-neutral, a process known as recission. The House also added provisions restricting contraception services that Democrats opposed. The Senate wanted $1.1 billion in new funding. The bill went to conference in June to iron out differences. The House agreed to $1.1 billion in funding, as long as about $700 million was found through cutting other areas. Murphy voted against final passage of HR 2577, and against adopting the conference report instituting the changes. The Senate is currently battling over the bill. Senate Democrats have so far blocked a vote three times in three months, wanting a "clean" bill with no contraception provisions and the full $1.89 billion originally requested. That’s not the end of the line, however. On June 16, Murphy voted for HR 5293, a bill that would allow the administration to shift money in the Defense Department to help with Zika efforts through that agency. Again, there was no set dollar amount or guarantee that’s how the money would be used, but it was another option in the Zika toolbox. It passed the House but is stuck in the Senate. "Murphy did vote in favor of two efforts to transfer funds in support of Zika efforts and opposed the major effort in hopes of gaining more funding than the Republicans offered," said Steven Smith, a Washington University in St. Louis political science professor. Our ruling Rubio, through a spokeswoman, said, "Patrick Murphy is the only candidate to have voted against every measure to fund Zika." Murphy, like most congressional Democrats, has opposed Republican-led efforts to conditionally fund anti-Zika efforts at less than what Obama has requested. But he has offered other solutions and voted against his party for two bills that would have allowed unspecified amounts of money to be repurposed for Zika programs. So the campaign was wrong to say he voted against "every" measure.

pomt-06289	Says the state auditor found that 37 percent of the 428,000 students receiving free and reduced-price lunches are ineligible.	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/nov/20/michael-doherty/nearly-160000-students-new-jerseys-school-lunch-pr/	The school board president and two other individuals connected to the Elizabeth school district have been accused of illegally signing up their children for the federal school lunch program, but according to state Sen. Michael Doherty, that’s just the "tip of the iceberg." Standing before members of the East Jersey Tea Party, Doherty suggested the state auditor had determined that nearly 160,000 students across the state were receiving free or reduced-price meals when they shouldn’t be. "We have 428,000 kids in the state of New Jersey signed up for free or reduced-price lunch. Our state auditor checked the records, and you know what he found?" Doherty (R-Warren) said during the Nov. 3 appearance. "He found, out of 428,000, when he checked the records, 37 percent of the students that were signed up were actually ineligible." After checking the auditor’s report, PolitiFact New Jersey found that Doherty's math was a bit overwrought. Here's why. Each year, according to state and federal officials, schools are required by the federal government to audit three percent of the total number of the school lunch applications they receive. They are instructed to focus on the ones that are within $100 of the household income that qualifies children for a free or reduced-cost lunch. The logic, state and federal officials say, is that since there are 428,000 kids in the program across New Jersey, you can't check them all. So concentrate on the ones that seem close to the income limit. In 2010 the state auditor looked at the three percent analyzed by each school and found that 37 percent did not actually qualify for the program, which translated to 2,723 erroneous applications. There was never an attempt to analyze the entire 428,000 so there is no way to know what the real number of improper applications actually is. "I stand by the accuracy of my statement," Doherty told us. But the state auditor, Stephen Eells did consider what the overall number of erroneous applications might be. In his report, Eells projected that 58,000 of the 428,000 students may be ineligible, if the results of the analysis conducted by his office are reflective of all approved applications. Our ruling Doherty claimed the state auditor found that 37 percent of 428,000 students in the school lunch program were ineligible, but the 37 percent does not apply to the 428,000. The 37 percent applies to a limited number of questionable applications subject to verification, which translates to about 2,723 ineligible applications. The students behind those applications were not among the 428,000 students cited by Doherty. We rate his statement False. The abuses in the school lunch program are bad enough as they are without any fuzzy math, senator. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-01184	"We've had the lowest health care inflation in history because of Obamacare."	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/dec/05/gwen-moore/gwen-moore-says-obamacare-created-lowest-ever-infl/	A week after the mid-term elections, in which the GOP gained considerable ground in Congress, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore was asked if Americans had rejected President Barack Obama’s policies. The Milwaukee Democrat responded, in part, by saying Republicans had take many steps to "discredit" Obama, including voting more than 50 times to repeal his Affordable Care Act. "But the reality," Moore stated Nov. 11, 2014 on Wisconsin Public Radio, "is that Obamacare has lowered health care costs by $36 billion just this year. We've had the lowest health care inflation in history because of Obamacare." The bolder claim about Obamacare -- that health care inflation in the United States is the lowest ever because of the law -- is one we want to check. Inflation vs. spending Health care inflation and health care spending are sometimes used interchangeably, but they are different. Inflation refers to health care prices from one year to the next, while spending is, well, how much is spent on health care. It turns out that growth in both health care inflation and expenditures are at historic lows, at least dating back to when the federal government began tracking them in 1960. Moore’s office cited data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis that shows health care inflation, as of the end of 2013, at about 1 percent per year -- the lowest since the early 1960s. Some economists prefer to consider actual health care expenditures, since that goes to how much health care is being used and how much is being paid for it. The latest estimates from the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services put health care spending at $2.8 trillion, or $8,915 per person, in 2012. That marked the fourth straight year, dating back to 2009, that the annual increase was less than 4 percent. Again, those are historic lows dating back to 1960. (A few weeks after Moore made her claim, the 2013 figure was released, showing health expenditures rose 3.6 percent, the lowest annual increase since 1960.) So, Moore is on the right track in terms of the figures. But the thrust of her claim is that the inflation slowdown is due to Obamacare. Moore spokesman Eric Harris argued that Moore didn’t claim Obamacare is the sole cause of the slowdown in health care prices, although she believes it is an important one. But Moore made her statement while defending the law and clearly gave it singular credit for the smaller increases in medical inflation. Obamacare’s role There is not widespread agreement that the Affordable Care Act is the key factor in limiting medical inflation. The inflation rates are lowest since the law took effect in March 2010, though they were trending downward several years earlier and the law has been rolled out only in stages. Even the president’s Council of Economic Advisers, in a November 2013 report, said "the causes of the slowdown are not yet fully understood" -- although it gave some credit to Obamacare, including the law’s reduction in Medicare payments to health care providers. And the council’s chairman wrote in the Wall Street Journal that "many factors, including the recession and one-time developments like blockbuster drugs coming off patent, have contributed to the slowdown," but that Obamacare "has made a meaningful contribution." We sought out some economists, as well. Harvard University’s David Cutler, who served as the senior health care adviser to Obama’s 2008 campaign, told us "nobody has the complete answer" for the smaller increases in health care inflation but that Obamacare is "important." Others downplayed the role of the health care reform law. Charles Roehrig, director of the Center for Sustainable Health Spending at the nonprofit Altarum Institute, noted that Obamacare’s main aim is to expand health insurance coverage, not reduce prices. It is a factor in healthcare inflation, but the smaller increases in health prices are "mainly explained by slower overall price inflation," he said. And like other economists, Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, told us much of the slowing in medical-price inflation is simply due to the "unusually slow recovery from the recession." The Affordable Act, she said, has had perhaps a "small effect." Finally, the Washington Post Fact Checker arrived at a similar conclusion in rating a November 2014 claim by Obama that health care inflation "has gone down every single year" since the Affordable Care Act passed. The president, though he wasn’t as bold as Moore, was given "three pinocchios" for a statement that has "significant factual error and/or obvious contradictions." "There are certainly some cost-controls contained in the law, but it remains unclear whether those measures have really had that much impact, especially because the Great Recession clearly had affected health-care inflation even before the law was implemented," The Fact Checker wrote. "Just as growth in health-care costs have slowed because the 2009 economic crisis, so has economic growth and general price inflation overall." Our rating Moore said: "We've had the lowest health care inflation in history because of Obamacare." There’s an element of truth in her claim, given that the Affordable Care Act is given some credit for the smallest increases in health care inflation on record. But Moore’s claim gave virtually all the credit to Obamacare, when there isn’t evidence it played that large of a role. We rate Moore’s statement Mostly False.

pomt-07491	President Obama has spent over $2 million in legal fees defending lawsuits about his birth certificate.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/apr/12/donald-trump/donald-trump-claims-obama-has-spent-2-million-lega/	Among those who challenge President Barack Obama's citizenship, one claim is often raised: Why would Obama spend millions of dollars defending against the lawsuits instead of simply producing his original birth certificate? That argument took on renewed life recently when it was cited by potential GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. And the argument is almost always attached to a specific figure: $2 million. In an interview on NBC's Today show, for example, Trump said Obama "spent $2 million in legal fees trying to get away from this issue." He repeated the figure in a CNN interview on April 10, 2011. "I just say very simply why doesn't he show his birth certificate?" Trump asked. "Why has he spent over $2 million in legal fees to keep this quiet and to keep this silent?" (For some background on the underpinnings of the dispute over Obama birth certificate, start here). In a Fox News appearance on April 10, 2011, Palin echoed the figure while praising Trump's efforts. Trump is "paying for researchers to find out why President Obama would have to spend $2 million to not show his birth certificate," Palin said. "So more power to him." It's certainly true that the Obama campaign has spent some amount of money opposing an array of lawsuits brought by people who claim that Obama has failed to produce a legitimate birth certificate and is therefore ineligible to serve as president. But has the president spent $2 million? We contacted Trump's office to find out where he got the number, but we did not receive a response. Others who have used the number have cited a story from WorldNetDaily, a conservative news website that has served as a venue for news and commentary about the birth certificate controversy. In an Oct. 27, 2009, article, WND reported that, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission, the Obama campaign had paid approximately $1.7 million to the campaign's law firm, Perkins Coie, since Obama was elected. So that's where we started our research. We did our own tally of payments made to Perkins Coie, all of which were reported, as required by law, in quarterly disbursement reports filed to the FEC by his campaign organization, Obama for America. We found that in the last quarter of 2008 -- which is roughly the period after Obama was elected in early November -- and the first three quarters of 2009, which is when WND wrote its story, Obama for America did, in fact, pay Perkins Coie $1.7 million. If you add in the payments made in subsequent months, the fees paid to Perkins Coie between October 2008 and December 2010 rises to $2.6 million. But what does that $2.6 million number mean? Not what Trump and others have assumed. Specifically, the payments by Obama for America to Perkins Coie covered all sorts of legal expenses -- not just expenses related to birth certificate issues. The FEC forms do not specify what each payment specifically went for, since that degree of detail is not required by law. We also couldn't get additional details from Perkins Coie or the Democratic National Committee about how the legal fees were spent. However, DNC National Press Secretary Hari Sevugan told the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call in a March 31, 2011, story that "the campaign has incurred ordinary legal expenses related to the wind-down of its operations and other legal services, which all campaigns incur, and which are proportional to the unprecedented size of this campaign." (The Obama campaign raised upwards of $750 million -- a record.) For the sake of comparison, the Roll Call story noted that the campaign for Obama's 2008 Republican opponent John McCain -- which was a smaller operation -- had spent more than $1.3 million on lawyers since the election. In the interview with Roll Call, Sevugan confirmed that some of the legal fees were needed to defend the campaign against what he called "unmeritorious" lawsuits, including one that challenged Obama’s citizenship. And WND reported that Perkins Coie attorney Robert Bauer wrote at least one letter to challenge a plaintiff, retired military officer Gregory S. Hollister, who had filed a suit raising questions about the legitimacy of Obama's right to hold the office of president. WND reported that Bauer -- who later left Perkins Coie to serve as White House counsel -- wrote to Hollister's attorney that "the suit is frivolous and should not be pursued. Should you decline to withdraw this frivolous appeal, please be informed that we intend to pursue sanctions, including costs, expenses and attorneys' fees...." Still, there are clearly lots of other expenses incurred by the Obama campaign's legal team that have nothing to do with the citizenship question. For instance, the Republican National Committee filed a complaint with the FEC claiming that the Obama campaign had accepted donations from foreign nationals, among other alleged campaign finance infractions. All told, Roll Call reported that "the FEC has written 26 letters — totaling more than 1,500 pages — to the Obama campaign questioning its reports and outlining a flurry of compliance concerns." After we looked through court records and spoke to experts in the field, we found insufficient evidence to support the claim that Obama for America spent $2 million solely on birth-certificate-related work. Four campaign-finance experts we interviewed all agreed that after the campaign was over, a law firm in Perkins Coie’s situation would have a full plate of legal work to do that had nothing to do with birth certificate questions. Two of the experts who took this position have represented Republicans -- Trevor Potter, a campaign finance lawyer who worked for the 2000 and 2008 presidential campaigns of John McCain and the 1988 campaign of George H.W. Bush, and Robert Kelner, who has represented the Republican National Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee. A third attorney who agreed, Allison R. Hayward, is the vice president of policy for the Center for Competitive Politics, which filed an amicus brief opposing the Obama administration’s position in the landmark Citizens United Supreme Court case, which ended a broad swath of campaign finance restrictions. "FEC audits and/or enforcement matters can take several years -- most are still open from the 2008 election," said Potter, general counsel to the Campaign Legal Center. "Various criminal investigations of donors may require campaign responses. Lawsuits against the campaign, campaign staff, and/or the candidate take time to defend. Vendor disputes may exist and require settlement." "Law firms representing presidential campaigns typically are very busy in the one to two years following the campaign," said Brett Kappel, a lawyer with the firm Arent Fox LLP who specializes in campaign finance law. "First, there are all the legal issues involved in closing down the campaign –- resolving disputes with vendors, preparation for the FEC audit and so on. Second, the one to two years after the campaign is over are typically when all the FEC complaints that were filed against the campaign are resolved, and that’s certainly been the case with the 2008 Obama campaign." We should note that, since Obama was elected, a number of federal cases related to the birth certificate issue -- including several filed by or with the assistance of California attorney Orly Taitz, a leader among Obama birth certificate questioners -- have been handled by federal attorneys, including those with the U.S. Department of Justice. Several of these cases were dismissed almost immediately. Others were active for up to a year but were ultimately dismissed and then, in some cases, appealed. The case in which Bauer wrote the letter to the plaintiff was dismissed twice by the Supreme Court. We interpret the quotations by Trump and Palin to mean payments made by Obama in a personal capacity, not in cases where he's represented in an official capacity by government lawyers. For one thing, both Trump and Palin used the term "legal fees," which would be irrelevant in a case defended by government lawyers. Federal attorneys are paid a salary by the taxpayers, and they do not charge their "client" -- in this case, the president -- fees for representation. If these attorneys weren't working on birth certificate cases, they'd be working on some other case for the same salary. So that leaves the funds paid to Perkins Coie. Trump's and Palin's claims assume that the vast majority of the money paid to Perkins Coie since the election was used to defend against lawsuits challenging Obama's citizenship. We agree that some amount of money was spent in legal fees related to those lawsuits -- the letter from Bauer to the plaintiff is an example of that. But, while we don't know exactly how much the Obama camp spent on their private lawyers, there were many, many non-birth-certificate duties that a law firm typically handles in the wake of a presidential campaign, which suggests that any birth certificate work was a small percentage of the overall fees paid to Perkins Coie. When fact-checking, we think the onus is on the person making the claim to back up his statement. And the only backing we've seen in this case is that the Obama campaign's legal team spent more than $2 million on legal fees since the election ended. It's clear to us that the WND story has been twisted to wrongly assume that every dollar the Obama campaign spent on legal fees went to fight the release of Obama's birth certificate. The evidence shows that's simply not true. It's a huge, unsubstantiated leap to assume that all, or most, of that was related to lawsuits about Obama's citizenship. We rule Trump's claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/74d49c90-3e18-4dfd-9bd9-2fbde85d90cd	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2011-04-12T16:10:25	2011-04-07	['Barack_Obama']

pomt-12228	Says Ted Kennedy met "with the KGB in order to beat Ronald Reagan in 1984."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/jul/18/greg-gutfeld/fox-news-host-cites-ted-kennedy-kgb-meeting-never-/	Supporters of President Donald Trump have defended Donald Trump Jr. and his readiness to receive Russian materials on Hillary Clinton by finding examples when Democrats tried to do something similar. Fox News host Greg Gutfeld brought up the case of Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass. "Nothing will ever come close to Ted Kennedy meeting with the KGB in order to beat Ronald Reagan in 1984," Gutfeld said on his show July 15. "It was a quid pro quo. You help the Dems. We help the USSR. If it worked, we would still have the USSR." As Gutfeld spoke, a graphic appeared on the screen of a 2009 Forbes magazine article, "Ted Kennedy’s Soviet Gambit." This isn’t the first time we’ve seen a claim like this, and it’s not the first time this Kennedy-KGB story tracked back to that Forbes story. So is it true? Hardly. There’s not much to back up the tale under any circumstances, but Gutfeld went overboard even relative to the Forbes article. He said Kennedy met with the KGB, something the Forbes piece doesn’t even mention. The Forbes article describes a 1983 memo from Viktor Chebrikov, then head of the Soviet spy agency, to Yuri Andropov, the then-general secretary of the Communist Party. Chebrikov wrote that Kennedy’s trusted friend John Tunney, a former senator from California, had passed along Kennedy’s interest in meeting with Andropov. So even if you take the memo from KGB agent as gospel, there was no actual meeting between Kennedy and the KGB. But what about the rest of the details and the memo? Was Kennedy looking to undermine Reagan? That’s murkier than you might expect. Step back to 1983 In early 1983, Reagan’s plan to place medium-range nuclear missiles in Western Europe generated great concern among voters in the West and also within the leadership of the USSR. The KGB memo detailed a proposal, ostensibly from Kennedy via Tunney, to de-escalate tensions. Those steps included Andropov inviting Kennedy and Sen. Mark Hatfield, R-Ore., for a meeting in Moscow. The purpose "would be to arm Soviet officials with explanations regarding problems of nuclear disarmament so they may be better prepared and more convincing during appearances in the USA." In addition, Kennedy’s middleman suggested that Andropov come to the United States where he could do interviews on the big three broadcast networks and speak to the "peaceful intentions of the USSR." According to the memo, Kennedy’s goal was to "root out the threat of nuclear war, and to improve Soviet-American relations, so that they define the safety of the world." The memo does mention Kennedy’s interest in the presidency, but the idea was for Kennedy to run in 1988. (Kennedy never ran and supported then-Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis.) The memo said, "Because he (Kennedy) formally refused to partake in the election campaign of 1984, his speeches would be taken without prejudice as they are not tied to any campaign promises. Tunney remarked that the senator wants to run for president in 1988." Having served two terms, Reagan would not be on the ballot in 1988. To believe or not believe the memo The memo gained attention when it was the basis of a news report published in the London Times in 1992, after the Soviet Union dissolved. When the report came out, Tunney told the London Times that it was "bull----." We reached Tunney in 2015, and he emphatically repeated that. "The idea that I would be handling contacts with Andropov is preposterous," Tunney said. "This memo is completely false." At the time, Tunney was a private businessman, but his friendship with Kennedy dated back to law school. He said that while he had made many trips to Moscow over the years and knew people in the KGB, the only political topic Kennedy ever asked him to broach with the Soviets was a deal to release dozens of dissidents. In exchange, Kennedy would make a speech at a university in one of the USSR’s republics in Central Asia. That took place several years earlier. Tunney said that some time after the memo emerged, Kennedy asked him if he knew anything about it, and Tunney said, "this is crazy." In 1992, a Boston Herald reporter reached Kennedy spokesman Paul Donovan. Donovan said Kennedy’s office had made other efforts to meet with Andropov, but nothing ever came of it. According to the Herald, Donovan said, "The rest of the memo is KGB fiction." Denials from anyone tied to Kennedy might be expected, but Kennedy does have a sort of character reference in the arena of foreign relations from a Reagan insider, the administration’s disarmament negotiator Max Kampelman. In his memoirs Entering New Worlds, Kampelman wrote that the Soviets liked working with Kennedy as a back-door conduit of information, and Kampelman welcomed the arrangement. "I learned that the senator never acted or received information without informing the appropriate United States agency or official," Kampelman wrote. In 1985, Reagan himself approved using Kennedy this way, and a working relationship grew between Kampelman and Kennedy. While it is possible that the administration never caught wind of any contacts Tunney had with the KGB, it is worth noting that when the archivists at the Reagan Library searched the White House files on Kennedy, no episode involving the USSR in 1983 popped up. Smoke, but no fire? In the Reagan years, Kenneth Adelman served as deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. and then director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. In 2015, we asked Adelman what he made of the KGB memo, and he dismissed it. He had no idea if an overture might have been made, but even it had, Adelman said it didn’t matter. "We knew senators were doing this sort of thing all the time, and we ignored it," Adelman said. "We didn’t think it was important, and it wasn’t. The administration didn’t care about it." Stephen Cohen, a political scientist at Princeton University and New York University, suggested that KGB memos shouldn’t be taken at face value. "As someone who has worked for years in once closed Soviet-era archives, I can tell you that many false documents can be found there," Cohen told PunditFact in 2015. "As the saying goes, rubbish in, rubbish out." Paul Kengor, a political scientist at Grove City College who included the memo in his book about Reagan, The Crudasder, takes the memo seriously. "The memo is absolutely accurate," Kengor said. "No question." It is worth noting that the memo does not say how Tunney conveyed Kennedy's message beyond "through confidential contacts." In other words, the memo's author was relying on someone else and not speaking from his own experience, which introduces another level of uncertainty. Our ruling Gutfeld said that Kennedy met with the KGB in order to defeat Ronald Reagan in 1984. There is certainly evidence that Kennedy attempted to meet with Soviet officials, but it was with the approval of the Reagan White House. The validity of a specific KGB memo saying Kennedy wanted to de-escalate tensions with Moscow over a U.S. plan to install nuclear missiles in Western Europe is widely questioned. But more to the point, Gutfeld reached one conclusion that doesn’t add up. There is no evidence of Kennedy "meeting with the KGB." The evidence Gutfeld used on screen doesn’t support that contention. We rate this claim False. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com	None	Greg Gutfeld	None	None	None	2017-07-18T13:30:41	2017-07-15	['Ronald_Reagan', 'KGB', 'Ted_Kennedy']
pomt-06438	"We cut property taxes by one-third in the state of Texas while I’ve been governor."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/21/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-they-cut-property-taxes-one-third-/	On the campaign trail in New Hampshire earlier this month, Texas Gov. Rick Perry repeated what has become a common battle cry in his campaign for the Republican nomination for president. "We cut property taxes by one-third in the state of Texas while I've been governor," he told a crowd Oct. 1, 2011 at a "We the People" forum in Hampton, New Hampshire. Perry has repeated the claim several times during his presidential run, and he also used it during his 2010 re-election campaign in Texas. PolitiFact Texas checked it at the time, coming up with a ruling of Barely True, now known as Mostly False. But has anything changed in the years since? We decided to check it out. As we discovered in early 2010, Perry is referring to House Bill 1, a tax law approved by the Texas Legislature in 2006. In 2005, five years into his tenure as governor, Perry created the bi-partisan Texas Tax Reform Commission, which developed the proposal. And the following year, he signed into law the overhaul, intended to reduce property taxes paid to local school districts. The overhaul did decrease a portion of the state’s school tax rate. It effectively lowered the maintenance and operation segment of the school tax, which makes up most of the school taxes, from $1.50 to $1.00 per $100 of assessed property value. That number met Perry’s claim of a one-third cut. But it didn’t translate to 33 percent lower bills for taxpayers, which is what we think most voters would infer from the claim. In 2007, the first year the tax changes were fully implemented, the total amount of tax dollars paid to local schools, fell about 6.4 percent from levels in 2005, before the tax overhaul, according to the state Comptroller’s office. Yet, when including county, city and school taxes, among others, the total amount of taxes paid increased by about 5 percent from 2005 to 2007, reaching $35.1 billion. Both the school tax levy and total property taxes continued to rise in 2008 and 2009. The amount of total tax dollars paid reached $40 billion in 2009. But the school and total taxes took a nose dive last year. In 2010, the most recent data available, school taxes dropped about 1 percent to $21.6 billion, but that number is 6.8 percent higher than 2005, before the tax overhaul was implemented. Total property tax dollars dropped back to $33.7 billion in 2010, roughly even to the $33.5 billion paid in 2005. Adjusting for inflation, however, the total amount of taxes collected fell by 9 percent, which is a little closer to Perry’s statement. Still, these numbers don’t show the picture of tax relief that Perry paints on the campaign trail. Nor do they tell the full story either, according to Texas policy analysts. Much of the tax increase can be attributed to factors including population growth and rising property values, analysts said. And voters and local school districts have contributed, as well, electing to restore higher local tax rates to better fund schools, according to Dick Lavine, a senior analyst with the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank in Austin, Texas. The 2006 overhaul legislation left room for local school boards for a one-time restoration of up to 4 cents to the operations and maintenance tax without an election. Voters could return up to 17 cents to the tax rate, Lavine said. "The vast majority (added to the rate) almost immediately," he said. "About a quarter are now at $1.17. They’re back in the same situation they were before." From the beginning, these factors have clouded some of the impact the overhaul has had on the state’s taxpayers, other analysts suggest. The tax reform may not have lowered homeowners’ property tax bills, but, in 2007, it did shave $7 billion off what Texans would have paid without the rate cut, according to the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, an Austin-based business group. "That means the average Texan’s total property tax bill in 2007 was 20 percent lower than what it likely would have been had there been no tax relief initiative," the association wrote in its 2008 report "Property Tax Relief: The $7 Billion Reality." The group said that number was a "rough" estimate. "I don't think there's any question, it represented a net tax decrease for the state of Texas." echoed Joshua Trevino, a spokesman for the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a right-leaning free market group. "I don’t think that’s in question." Our ruling Perry was correct if you only look at school tax rate, but his comment referred to all property taxes. If you look at total property tax revenue, Texans paid about the same amount in 2010 as they did in 2005. If you adjust for inflation, he's closer (it's about 9 percent less) but it's still far short of one-third. We find his claim Mostly False.

pomt-08255	Georgia's high school graduation rate topped 80 percent in 2010.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2010/nov/12/sonny-perdue/perdue-touts-states-rising-graduation-rates/	With the announcement that Georgia's high school graduation rate topped 80 percent, Gov. Sonny Perdue took a celebratory tour of the state's standout schools. Perdue thanked students and staff at schools across North Georgia and along the South Georgia coast for their hard work. He promised he'd reach the 80 percent mark by 2010. With their help, he kept his word. Or did he? Other measures say Georgia's rate is lower by as much as 15 points. And while the state Department of Education reports it's making great strides, one group said last year that Georgia's graduation rate is so low Georgia's children are in "crisis." The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has uncovered multiple problems with how the rate is reported. Is Georgia's graduation rate really 80 percent? We went to the Georgia Department of Education to sort the issue out. Raising the rate to 80 percent by 2010 has been one of Perdue's major education initiatives. In 2005, he signed on to a national effort by the National Governors Association to standardize how states determine the graduation rate and improve the figure's accuracy. Under the new method, which the state will report for the first time this school year,school officials expect the rate to drop. Perdue also created the position of "graduation coach," and he announced at a 2008 national education convention that it helped reduce dropouts by 10 percent in one year. The coaches identify high school and middle school students at risk of dropping out, find them mentors, organize tutoring programs, and help them sign up to retake classes they failed. Now, back to the graduation rate. There are lots of ways to calculate it. Each has its own strengths and weaknesses. They can vary greatly. For instance, some count only students who graduate on time. Others count graduates who take longer. Georgia uses what's commonly called the "leaver rate," a method used by 32 other states. The Education Department puts the exact graduation rate at 80.8 percent. It includes students who take more than four years to graduate. The leaver rate is not the actual percentage of students who graduate. Until recently, the state Education Department lacked a record keeping system that could track that. Instead, it's an estimate. To calculate it, you take the number of students who receive regular graduation diplomas and divide it by the following: the number of regular diploma recipients, plus the number of students who receive special education diplomas and certificates of attendance, plus the number of dropouts from grades 9-12. State officials acknowledge the measure is imperfect. The new method will be more accurate. Still, it's a fair accountability measure, they said. Since the state has used the same method to calculate graduation rates since Perdue took office in 2003, a year-to-year comparison is valid. Those numbers show the graduation rate surged from about 63 percent to 80 percent, said Perdue spokesman Bert Brantley. Another advantage of Georgia's leaver rate is it's the most current data around. Graduation rates calculated with other measures have yet to be updated with numbers from two or three years ago. That means they don't measure the impact of the graduation coach program, Brantley said. But AJC PolitiFact Georgia thinks there are other shortcomings with the leaver rate that should be acknowledged, and which cast Georgia's apparent success in a different light. The most perplexing is that the state's calculation misses thousands of students. In 2008, the state Department of Education could not account for nearly 20,000 students they marked as transfers, although it's not clear they went. The state's 2010 graduation numbers raise similar questions. Georgia's Class of 2010 entered high school in 2006 at about 146,000 strong, according to the state's figures. But when the state calculated its 2010 graduation rate, it pegged the combined number of Georgia students who graduated plus those who didn't make it at about 113,300. That means this year's graduation calculation does not include about 33,000 of the Class of 2010's original members. A portion likely went to private school or are being home schooled, but given the department's past problems, it's far from clear that that's where all of them went. Another problem is that while Georgia's leaver rate soared during Perdue's term, other widely used measures did not. Consider the public high school averaged freshman graduation rate, which is collected and published by the National Center for Education Statistics, the U.S. Department of Education's main data clearinghouse, and graduation calculations from Editorial Projects in Education, a nonprofit education research center. The averaged freshman graduation rate uses the number of on-time graduates with regular diplomas and an estimate of the freshman class size four years earlier to come up with its rate. The Editorial Projects in Education rate multiplies together how many students were promoted on time each year to get its rate. According to Editorial Projects in Education, Georgia's graduation rate grew between 2002-2003 and 2006-2007, the most recent school year available, by about 1.4 points to 57.8 percent. During that same time period, the U.S. Department of Education's averaged freshman graduation rate for Georgia grew by 3.3 points to 64.1 percent. In those same years, Georgia reported its graduation rate grew by 9 points to 72.3 percent. These discrepancies may occur because the rates count different things, said state Department of Education spokesman Matt Cardoza. Georgia's leaver rate includes five-year graduates, but the other two measures count only those who finish on schedule. Georgia officials think it's important to count students who take extra time, because it shows schools are committed to students who need more help. "If we keep them [high school students] five years instead of four, and that helps them graduate, we're all for it," Cardoza said. Still, it's difficult to tell which measure is more accurate, said John Robert Warren, a University of Minnesota sociologist. He was part of a major effort by the National Academy of Education that studied how to improve the reliability of graduation rates. "They're all sort of in the ballpark of not being that good," Warren said of the measures. In the case of leaver rates, experts agree they often inflate graduation figures. That's because the formula depends so heavily on a state's dropout rate. Experts agree dropouts are easy to undercount. A typical dropout doesn't bother to tell his school he no longer intends to show up, and schools often don't have the resources or incentive to track down missing students. Another problem is shared by all measures. They're only as accurate as the data used to calculate them. In Georgia, there's evidence that at least some of this data has serious problems. In June 2009, an Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation found the state couldn't locate nearly 20,000 students who local districts said transferred to other Georgia schools during the 2008 school year, but who never re-enrolled. In April, the U.S. Department of Education rebuked the state Department of Education and Clayton County and determined the county's 2006-2007 dropout rates were undercounted. A state Education Department spokesman said they enhanced their procedures, but did not correct older data. In August, another Atlanta Journal-Constitution investigation found that thousands of Atlanta Public Schools students vanished from its rolls during the past eight years, and this may be the primary reason behind the system's rising graduation rates. Many students were marked as transfers, even though there was no evidence they re-enrolled elsewhere. So what does all of this information say about Georgia's graduation rate? If one thing is clear, it's this: No one knows the state's true graduation rate. Although the state Education Department said it has improved its reporting methods, the way the agency calculates the rate and the data's quality still have enough unresolved problems that it's hard to say whether the state actually met Perdue's goal. It's also not clear how much the state graduation rate has improved. Georgia said its rate has soared during Perdue's term, but one measure said it's flat and another said it rose by a few percentage points. Those other rates don't measure the exact same thing. They also use old data, so it's possible that fresh calculations will show a spike in rates. But at this point, it's doubtful they'll register a 17-point change as Georgia's leaver rate did. This means that while the high 2009-2010 graduation rate may be an encouraging sign, it's not quite a cause for celebration. Perdue's statement is accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. By PolitiFact's standards, it rates a Half True.

pomt-15350	"There’s now been three independent investigations (into the bridge scandal) all of which have said" that Christie did not have prior knowledge of or involvement in the lane closures.	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jul/09/chris-christie/chris-christie-bridgegate-investigations-back-my-s/	Aside from the national media, no one cares about Bridgegate, says New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. On MSNBC’s Morning Joe July 6, host Joe Scarborough said he generally hasn’t noticed New Hampshire voters asking the Republican presidential candidate about the September 2013 bridge-closing scandal. "Nobody cares," Christie responded. "They don't care because they know that there’s now been three independent investigations all of which have said exactly the same thing I said the day after it happened. And so, at some point people just say well, you know, after three investigations -- two of them run by folks who were Democrats, Democratic legislature and Democratically appointed U.S. attorney -- you know, after a while people just say, ‘Okay, I guess he's telling the truth.’ " Multiple New Jersey officials close to Christie have been accused of devising a scheme to close parts of the George Washington bridge, under the guise of conducting a traffic study, causing a week of massive traffic jams in September 2013. The maneuver is widely believed to have been political retribution against officials in Fort Lee, N.J., which was most impacted by the lane closures. Since the week of the closures, Christie has consistently denied that he knew anything about the lane closures until after the fact. In the first few weeks after the lane closures -- before many details came to light -- Christie said the extensive press coverage was overblown. "I had nothing to do with this: No knowledge. No authorization. No planning," he said in a radio interview in February 2014, adding that he learned about the closures from media reports afterward. Have three investigations agreed with him? Christie’s campaign did not respond to our requests for comment. But we have a good idea who conducted the three investigations: A Manhattan law firm, the New Jersey legislature and the U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey. One of these investigations has shut the door -- saying Christie had no involvement -- but the other two left the question open-ended. Gibson Dunn and Crutcher Christie’s administration commissioned law firm Gibson Dunn and Crutcher to conduct an internal probe in January 2014, soon after it came out that members of Christie’s senior staff knew about or were involved in the lane closures. The results of that investigation support the contention that Christie himself had nothing to do with the scandal. "Our investigation found that Gov. Christie did not know of the lane realignment beforehand and had no involvement in the decision to realign the lanes," the report said. "He does not recall becoming aware of the lane realignment during the period the lanes were closed, but would not have considered a traffic issue memorable in any event." A Port Authority official -- who later pleaded guilty to charges stemming from the scandal -- said he told Christie about the closures while they were happening, when the two were together at a Sept. 11 memorial event. Christie said he didn’t remember the conversation. "Gov. Christie’s account of these events rings true," the report continued, noting that document reviews and witness interviews fully corroborated Christie’s story. According to the Wall Street Journal, Gibson Dunn attorney Randy Mastro said, "Our findings today are a vindication of Gov. Christie." New Jersey Legislature A December 2014 report out of the New Jersey Legislative Select Committee on Investigation came to a much less definitive conclusion on Christie’s involvement. The investigation found "no conclusive evidence" as to whether Christie knew about the lane closures in advance or while they were happening. The report said a lack of information from some key witnesses "leaves open the question of when the governor first learned of the closures and what he was told." The inquiry found no smoking gun implicating Christie, but the committee concluded that it is "not in a position currently to conclude what Gov. Christie himself knew about the lane closures or when and how his knowledge of these events developed." U.S. Attorney investigation A U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey investigation, made public in May 2015, did not find evidence that Christie was criminally involved in planning or concealing the bridge scandal. The investigation resulted in charges of conspiracy and other crimes against three state officials: Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie’s former chief of staff; Bill Baroni, a Christie-appointed executive at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey; and David Wildstein, another Port Authority executive and one of Christie’s political allies. Wildstein pleaded guilty. But the U.S. Attorney’s Office didn’t indict Christie. "Today’s charges make clear that what I’ve said from day one is true, I had no knowledge or involvement in the planning or execution of this act," Christie said following the indictments against his former staffers, according to the Wall Street Journal. Some critics have suggested that because still more evidence could come forward, Christie is not yet fully in the clear. It’s possible that now under the pressure of criminal charges, Kelly and Baroni could reveal information that implicates Christie, wrote Tim Moran, editorial page editor of New Jersey’s Star-Ledger newspaper. At the time, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said, "We’re always going to be receptive to new evidence, what I will say is this though: Based on the evidence currently available to us, we’re not going to charge anyone else in this scheme." Fishman also declined to comment on whether others (including Christie) will continue to be investigated for involvement. Our ruling Christie said, "There’s now been three independent investigations (into the bridge scandal) all of which have said" that Christie did not have prior knowledge of or involvement in the lane closures. Christie has said since day one that he had no knowledge of the scandal before or during the closures themselves. Three investigations -- a law firm commissioned by Christie, the state legislature and the U.S. attorney’s office -- found no evidence to suggest otherwise. However, only the law firm investigation expressly stated that Christie had no knowledge of the lane closures. In contrast, the legislature’s investigation suggested that it’s still a possibility if more evidence emerges, and the U.S. attorney didn’t say the case is definitively closed. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context, so we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2d659490-7a00-4208-9747-2a9f204e6f8e	None	Chris Christie	None	None	None	2015-07-09T11:31:52	2015-07-06	['None']
pomt-11803	"80 percent of the (individual mandate) tax falls on those who make $50,000 a year or less."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/17/john-thune/sen-thune-individual-mandate-fine-falls-mainly-peo/	Senate Republicans’ surprise move to repeal the requirement to have health insurance into their tax reform bill revealed numbers that few people had noted before. (The mandate says that everyone must have coverage or face a fine.) "80 percent of the tax falls on those who make $50,000 a year or less," Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., told Fox News Nov. 15. "We’re taking a failed policy that punishes people with taxes -- low-income people. (We’re) taking that tax away, giving them tax relief there, and then ploughing that back into tax relief for middle-income families." This was no throw-away line. Thune is the third-ranking Republican in the party’s Senate leadership, and his colleagues delivered similar versions of the talking point throughout the day. In 2016, the fine for not having insurance stood at $695 for adults. The formula has a few wrinkles that brought the maximum penalty to $2,085 for a family, or 2.5 percent of income, whichever was larger. Going forward, it rises with inflation (unless of course, Congress repeals it). Not everyone without insurance has to pay the fine. The list of exemptions is long. It includes a family with income under $20,800; people who have suffered domestic violence in the household; anyone who has suffered the death of a close family member; someone who has received a utility shut-off notice, and more. Thune’s office said he got his information from 2015 data from the Internal Revenue Service. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In one key sense, Thune is correct. Out of all the tax returns sent to the IRS that included a payment of the fine, 79 percent came from households making $50,000 a year or less. (Technically, the income is adjusted gross income, which understates actual income. But on average, the adjustment makes little difference for this check.) However, Thune didn’t specify that he was talking about the number of people. His description of the tax could just as equally refer to the dollars paid. The government collected a little over $3 billion from about 6.6 million households. Of that, about $1.8 billion, 60 percent, came from households with incomes under $50,000. So in dollar terms, about 60 percent of the tax fell on people in that income range, not the 80 percent that Thune said. Thune’s communications staff told us he was talking about the number of people and the number of returns. Paying by mistake We reached several health care and tax researchers, and none of them challenged the core numbers. Gordon Mermin with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center ran the numbers and found that as a percentage of income, the tax fell heaviest on the $25,000 to $50,000 group. On average, that group paid 3.1 percent of income. Mermin told us households in this range are more likely to lack insurance, and due to their incomes, are less likely to be able to claim an exemption from the fine. "People shouldn’t be surprised the $25,000 to $50,000 group is affected the most," Mermin said. But researchers found it odd that people making less than $25,000 had paid as much as they did. The $10,000 to $25,000 group accounted for 22 percent of the payments, and about 36 percent of the households. "Folks are just making a mistake," said Jonathan Gruber, one of the architects of Obamacare and an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "Given the exemptions, there is no way such low-income folks should be paying." The IRS knows this has happened. It’s been sending out letters since 2015, telling filers "it appears that you may have reported owing too much Health Care Shared Responsibility Payment," the penalty’s formal name. "The IRS has reached out to some taxpayers to let them know they’ve overpaid the penalty, but they don’t have the capacity to do that in all cases," said Tara Straw at the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning think tank. Straw said the IRS targets people who automatically qualify for an exemption because of their income, a factor that is stronger in states that did not expand Medicaid to people making 138 percent of federal poverty. Where the IRS effort falls short, she said, relates to personal circumstances such as a death in the family or a utility service cut-off notice. Larry Levitt at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a neutral source of health care data, also agreed that "there certainly appear to be some low-income people paying the penalty who could be claiming an exemption." A just-released study from Kaiser suggests the number could be large. The report found that about 5 million uninsured people could get coverage for less than the cost of the penalty. Thanks to the subsidies in Obamacare, the lowest-level plans would be free to many of those people, or if not free, available at a very low cost. If everyone took advantage of those subsidies, the 6.6 million households paying the penalty because they lack coverage would fall significantly. We don’t know how the numbers would shake out because about 4 million people neither paid the fine nor told the IRS that they had coverage. Republicans offer the repeal of the penalty as a boon to working Americans, and for some it would be. But the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan analytic arm of Congress, has found that removing the penalty makes it less likely that people will seek out insurance, even if it would be free or very affordable. Our ruling Thune said that 80 percent of the individual mandate penalty falls on those who make $50,000 a year or less. In terms of the number of returns in which people paid the fine, that figure is correct. In terms of the dollars collected, it overshoots the mark. People in that income range account for about 60 percent of the payments. Still, an independent analysis showed that households in the $25,000 to 50,000 income range paid the highest percentage of income on the penalty. There’s strong evidence that many lower income people are paying the fine by mistake, and millions could both avoid it and gain health coverage for less than the cost of the fine. But as far as who is paying the fine, we rate this claim Mostly True. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com	None	John Thune	None	None	None	2017-11-17T12:03:04	2017-11-15	['None']
pomt-06280	Says Barack Obama said, "If we keep talking about the economy, we’re going to lose."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/22/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-obama-said-if-we-keep-talking-abo/	On the eve of a presidential trip to New Hampshire on Nov. 22, 2011, Mitt Romney’s campaign released an ad targeting President Barack Obama. In the ad, the Romney campaign used a quote that prompted an immediate counterattack from the Obama camp, which argued that it had been taken out of context. The 60-second ad, called "Believe in America," is designed to contrast "candidate Obama from 2008 with President Obama of today," highlighting "his failures in between," according to the Romney campaign. The ad contrasts a 2008 campaign speech by Obama with text on the screen that criticizes Obama’s economic record, including, "Greatest Jobs Crisis Since Great Depression," "Record Home Foreclosures" and "Record National Debt." The ad then has a clip of Obama saying,"If we keep talking about the economy, we’re going to lose." The clear implication is that Obama believes that his economic record is so bad that he will lose in 2012 unless he can steer the conversation away from the economy. But the Obama camp, among others, immediately charged that the clip was taken out of context. Was it? Here’s what Obama said in the October 2008 speech, which came about two weeks before he defeated Sen. John McCain: "Even as we face the most serious economic crisis of our time, even as you are worried about keeping your jobs or paying your bills or staying in your homes, my opponent's campaign announced earlier this month that they want to ‘turn the page’ on the discussion about our economy so they can spend the final weeks of this election attacking me instead," Obama said in the speech. "Sen. McCain's campaign actually said, and I quote, ‘If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.’" So the comment is drastically different than the way it's portrayed in the Romney ad. Obama was actually saying that his opponent’s campaign three years earlier had said, "If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose." That context is not included in the Romney ad -- and leaving it out sends a profoundly different message. The Romney camp seems to have anticipated this complaint. In a blog post published around the time the ad was released, Romney spokeswoman Gail Gitcho acknowledged that, "Three years ago, candidate Barack Obama mocked his opponent’s campaign for saying, ‘If we keep talking about the economy, we're going to lose.’" She went on to say Obama is trying to distract voters from his economic record. Our ruling We certainly think it’s fair for Romney to attack Obama for his response to the economy. And the Romney camp can argue that Obama’s situation in 2011 is ironic considering the comments he made in 2008. But those points could have been made without distorting Obama’s words, which have been taken out of context in a ridiculously misleading way. We rate the Romney ad’s portrayal of Obama’s 2008 comments Pants on Fire.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-11-22T13:34:24	2011-11-21	['None']
pomt-05760	Says there’s no proven instance where hydraulic fracking has polluted groundwater.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2012/feb/29/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-theres-no-proven-instance-groundwa/	Before he suspended his candidacy for president, Texas Gov. Rick Perry gave a spirited defense of fracking, a process that extracts natural gas from thousands of feet underground. "You cannot show me one place where there is a proven – not one – where there is a proven pollution of groundwater by hydraulic fracking," Perry told a college student who raised the topic at a December 18, 2011, stop in Decorah, Iowa, according to the Texas Tribune. Not one? Perry’s sweeping claim tracks with the November 2011 release of preliminary findings of a study by the University of Texas Energy Institute. A November 10, 2011, Austin American-Statesman news article quoted the study’s leader, UT geologist Charles "Chip" Groat, saying hydraulic fracturing "doesn’t seem to be of concern to groundwater." Groat said the study had looked at regulatory violations and frameworks in states with major shale drilling operations, including Texas, Louisiana, New York and Pennsylvania. "The violations that we've seen are of no, minor or small impact," he said. Perry’s claim also echoed more than 25 others made by regulatory officials, as compiled by a pro-drilling group, as well as a May 2011 assessment by the head of the Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA’s administrator, Lisa Jackson, was asked at a May 24, 2011, hearing of the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform whether hydraulic fracturing can affect aquifers and water supplies. Jackson replied: "There is evidence that it can certainly affect them. I am not aware of any proven case where the fracking process itself has affected water." The "fracking process itself"? Fracking might be fun to say, but it’s a little slippery to define. Both Jackson and Perry were using a very specific definition of fracking, their spokeswomen told us by email, referring only to the step in the process where the shale rock is fractured. In high-pressure hydraulic fracturing for natural gas, a mix of water, sand and chemicals is shot down into the well, bursting out of holes in the pipe lining the well and cracking the gas-bearing shale rock. Gas then flows from the cracks back up the pipe for collection. The immense increase in fracking since the mid-2000s came about because companies began to use this process in horizontally drilled wells, which cost more but also reach more of the layer of shale that lies as deep as two miles below the earth’s surface. But the energy industry and environmental groups use the term fracking in very different ways. Fracking expert Terry Engelder, a professor of geosciences at Pennsylvania State University, mapped out the two positions for us. "Industry likes to restrict the use of the term hydraulic fracturing to just that process taking place underground during which time high-pressure water opens natural cracks or creates new cracks at the depths of the reservoir rock," Engelder told us by email. Conversely, Engelder said, opponents of drilling "consider fracking to encompass the entire process from leasing land through drilling and sending natural gas to market." PolitiFact Ohio acknowledged as much in a July 14, 2011, article. Evidence supported an Ohio lawmaker’s claim that state agencies had no proof of groundwater contamination from fracking, though the statement was rated Mostly True because in one case, a state panel found that a well’s cement casing allowed gas to seep into water wells (and up into homes, causing an explosion). Even by the narrow definition, some environmentalists say that EPA reports from 1987 and 2011 prove that fracking has contaminated water. The 1987 report (unearthed last year by the national nonprofit Environmental Working Group) said that "residual" fracking fluid "migrated" into a private water well after a nearby gas well had been fractured in West Virginia. The Dec. 8, 2011, preliminary report found fracking was a possible cause of groundwater contamination in Pavilion, Wyo., where a company was fracking inside an aquifer -- an unusual case, according to the report. EPA spokeswoman Betsaida Alcantara offered us no comment on the 1987 report, though an Aug. 4, 2011, news story by an independent nonprofit news organization, ProPublica, quotes an unidentified EPA official as saying the agency was reviewing that case. The 2011 report, Alcantara told us, "tentatively found a link between groundwater contamination in an aquifer with hydraulic fracturing. The report is not final and it will now go through independent scientific review." Also using the narrow definition, other regulatory officials said they did not know of groundwater pollution by fracking. The Texas Railroad Commission regulates fracking in Texas. Commission spokeswoman Gaye Greever McElwain told us, "Commission records do not indicate a single documented water contamination case associated with the process of hydraulic fracturing in Texas. Similarly, an official with the National Groundwater Protection Council told us in a telephone interview that fracking has not been proven to contaminate groundwater. Mike Paque, executive director of the council comprising groundwater regulators and oil/gas regulators from state agencies, said the depth at which shale is fractured makes contamination by fracking itself practically impossible. "There’s no water down there to drink," Paque said. "Private wells go a couple hundred feet down, and these are 11,000 feet down. So the fact that people say that, and that my state regulatory agencies say that, and the drinking water agencies say that, is correct, period." To get our own fix on possible water pollution by fracking, we examined lists of incidents that were described as fracking-related by EarthJustice, a nonprofit law firm; the National Resources Defense Council, an environmental advocacy nonprofit group; and ThinkProgress, a blog run by the American Progress Action Fund, a liberal think-tank. Because we were seeking "proven" groundwater contamination, we first eliminated claims not related to water pollution and accounts that did not include independent evidence, such as a state investigation or newspaper story. Of the remaining 56 claims of groundwater contamination, not a single one fit the "industry" definition of fracking -- the one Perry was using, his spokeswoman, Lucy Nashed, told us. Yet how close to that step in the process were they? We identified 11 incidents that appeared to be both substantiated by outside evidence and linked to an essential part of the process of hydraulically fracturing a well. The 11 included events such as fracking fluid leaking from wastewater pits or from pipe lining a fracked well. Several were "blowouts," which Engelder defined for us as the (normally controlled) process in which "high pressure gas blows fracking water out of the well to clear the way for natural gas production." A few examples: February 2008, Parachute, Colo. -- A ProPublica news story says a state agency confirmed a 200-foot frozen waterfall of fracking fluid that melted into the Colorado River. August 2008, Dimock, Pa. -- A Vanity Fair news story says that after fracking began nearby, the state shut down water wells and fined a company $360,000 for "contaminating Dimock’s groundwater and failing to fix the leaks that caused the problem." April 2010, Caddo Parish, La. -- A ProPublica news story says parish residents were evacuated and told not to drink their water after a blowout at a nearby fracking well. November 2011, Leroy, Pa. -- A (Wilkes-Barre) Times Leader news story says an energy company confirmed that equipment failure allowed a 30,000-gallon spill of fracking fluid, some into a tributary of the Susquehanna River. The two views of fracking seem irreconcilable. Jason Pitt, a spokesman for the Sierra Club, told us by email: "Fracking is just one small part of an overall industrial process to extract natural gas. When speaking about ground water contamination, it is very misleading to refer back to just the fracking process." He said there are many cases of water contamination "that have occurred as a result of natural gas extraction across the country." Engelder, the Penn State geologist, disagreed. "Anti-drillers," he said, "have lots of proof of spills and leaks and other stuff including noise pollution and so forth because they consider fracking to be the all-encompassing, creeping industrialization of rural areas." Attempts to tie events such as surface spills to hydraulic fracturing miss the point, he said. "Fracking is such a toxic word in the English language that Americans are blaming all sorts of bad things on it when, in fact, Governor Perry was using the term hydraulic fracturing correctly in his comment." Our ruling Perry’s comment, focused on "proven" incidents of groundwater polluted by the specific step of breaking the shale rock, holds up. However, the definition of fracking is debated -- and if we rope in all incidents that take place at such wells, there have been more than a few reported incidents of groundwater contamination. We rate the claim Mostly True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2012-02-29T15:28:19	2011-12-18	['None']

Strategists like Karl Rove, whose two Republican-allied super PACs -- American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS -- were among the biggest spenders in the campaign season just ended, suggested that their spending kept a number of races closer than they otherwise might have been. Among the races, and one of the 10 Senate contests in which Crossroads GPS invested, was the match between Democratic incumbent Sherrod Brown and the Republican state treasurer, Josh Mandel. Crossroads GPS contributed nearly $6.4 million to the unsuccessful effort to defeat Brown, making it the biggest third-party spender in a race that was one of the nation's costliest, according to figures gathered by the nonprofit Sunlight Foundation. Mandel, in an email thanking his supporters, said one of them had pointed out "that our race was the closest U.S. Senate race in Ohio in 36 years -- when Howard Metzenbaum defeated Robert Taft in 1976." True? PolitiFact Ohio couldn't resist an excuse to dig into history. We looked first at current unofficial election results from Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted. They show Brown defeated Mandel by 278,052 ballots, or 50.35 percent of the vote to Mandel's 45.06 percent. Then we checked the official record on the secretary's website. Of the 11 Senate races going back to 1976, none was as close as the Brown-Mandel match. Most were comparatively lopsided, in fact, including Brown's victory margin of more than 12 percent in 2006. In 1976, Metzenbaum defeated Robert Taft Jr., the Republican incumbent, by a margin of 117,339 votes, or 3 percent of the vote. Not only closer than the Brown-Mandel race, it was a reverse rematch of the 1970 election in which Taft reached the Senate, defeating Metzenbaum by a margin of 70,420 votes, or 2 percent. Taft was a congressman, father of the former governor and son of the famed three-term senator who was nicknamed "Mr. Republican." Before his two tight contests with Metzenbaum, he lost his first bid for the Senate in an even closer race. In 1964, the year of Lyndon Johnson's presidential landslide over Barry Goldwater, Taft lost to incumbent Democrat Stephen Young by just 0.5 percent. It was Ohio's closest Senate election of the last half century. PolitiFact Ohio found the history interesting. On the Truth-O-Meter, Mandel’s statement rates True.

Patrick Kennedy is not a product of one campaign or the other; it comes from a little-known political organization known as Americans For Common Sense Solutions. On its website, the group describes itself as a local operation run out of downtown Providence. Christopher Stenberg, named on the website as the group's executive director, did not return multiple calls, nor could we find any office affiliated with his name at several Westminster Street addresses. The group registered in July with the Internal Revenue Service as a 527 non-profit organization. It has not registered with the Federal Election Commission which would be required if it were supporting a particular candidate. But its strongly worded advertisements on TV and radio leave no doubt about the organization's disdain for Democrat David Cicilline, who is running for the seat against Republican John Loughlin. In the radio spot, a woman's voice says: "Even though Republicans and Democrats fight about almost everything, they didn't fight about this. Except David Cicilline. As a state representative, David Cicilline argued against Megan’s Law and voted against mandatory registration of sex offenders. "We don't know why David Cicilline took a position to protect sexual predators and we don't know if he will argue or vote against other common sense legislation if he becomes a congressman." Megan's Law is the colloquial name for state laws that require the police to provide information to the public about sex offenders. That includes mandatory registration of sex offenders and notification to residents when a sex offender moves into the neighborhood. The law was named for Megan Kanka, a 7-year-old who was raped and murdered in 1994 in New Jersey by a convicted sex offender who moved to her neighborhood after being released from prison. The statutes governing Megan's Law differ from state to state. In 1996, Rhode Island lawmakers took the existing sex offender registration law, which required convicted offenders to register with local police departments, and added language requiring police to notify the community. That vote took place while Cicilline, now the mayor of Providence, was still a state representative. So how did he vote? The short answer is, he was one of three representatives who voted against it. But Cicilline's campaign now says the candidate opposed the bill because it applied to teenagers as well as adults. In other words, "if a 13-year-old touches another 13-year-old, he could be required to register as a sex offender for the rest of his life," Eric Hyers, a Cicilline spokesman told us. To say Cicilline "argued against Megan's Law" is "a disgusting and vile claim" if you don't explain that his objections were limited to one particular section, Hyers said. It's difficult to verify what prompted Cicilline's no vote nearly 15 years ago. A Providence Journal story on the issue indicated that Cicilline indeed spoke up about his concerns that adolescent offenders would face long-term consequences. He was quoted as saying "I don't know that it will do anything to protect our children" from molesters. The General Assembly did not start videotaping its sessions until several years later and the legislative Journal from that day merely says Rep. Cicilline engaged in a debate about the bill, without providing details. The bill's journey did not end there. Three years later, in 1999, Megan's Law was amended to limit community notification to adult offenders, thereby carving out an exception for teenage offenders, the group Cicilline had concerns about. This time, the Providence representative voted in favor of it. When the law was further altered in small ways two more times during Cicilline's tenure in the legislature, in 2000 and 2002, he again voted in the affirmative. The record shows that Cicilline voted against Megan's Law when it first passed. But his later votes suggest that he either had a change of heart, or, as his spokesman tells us, he found the bill more palatable once teenagers were excluded. The ad from Americans for Common Sense Solutions is misleading. It doesn't mention what Cicilline's objections were to the original law, nor that he subsequently voted in favor of it three times. PolitiFact's definition of a Barely True statement says it "contains some element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression." That sounds right to us. Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.

pomt-07966	Says the first word spoken from the moon was "Houston."	false	/texas/statements/2011/jan/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-first-word-spoken-moon-was-houston/	Gov. Rick Perry praised Texans for their "resilience" and "resourcefulness" during his Jan. 18 inauguration speech, saying that "if something has never been done before, it's just because we haven't tried it." Among the accomplishments Perry credited to Texans was pioneering space. "Matter of fact," he said, "the first word spoken from the moon was 'Houston.' " That statement drew shouts and applause from the crowd — and our attention. We'd heard the boast before. Last year, for instance, Reagan Outdoor Advertising placed this message — "Houston" First Word Spoken On The Moon — on billboards in the Salt Lake City area. We saw them in Austin, too. We also read the statement in several articles, including a 2001 Philadelphia Inquirer travel story about Texas' largest city. All refer to the instantly historic line uttered July 20, 1969, by NASA astronaut Neil Armstrong to a worldwide television and radio audience and the folks in mission control at the Johnson Space Center in Houston after he and fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin landed the lunar module, Eagle, on the moon: "Houston, Tranquility Base here. The Eagle has landed." At first, we were confident that Perry had it right. However, research raised doubts — especially after we saw YouTube posts of video and audio from the landing that suggested some technical communications by the astronauts took place after the landing and before Armstrong said "Houston." We turned next to experts both in and out of NASA, including two authors of books on the Apollo 11 mission and the editor of the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal, an online resource that's featured on NASA's website. The Journal includes a transcript of everything said by the astronauts and NASA officials on the ground. What was the first word said by man on the moon? The experts' answers differed, with most agreeing it was not "Houston." David Harland — author of The First Men on the Moon: The Story of Apollo 11 — told us by e-mail: "Technically, the first utterance would have been Aldrin saying 'contact light,' which occurred when one of the probes projecting from ... the landing legs made contact with the surface." The light alerted the astronauts when the lunar module had touched the moon. According to the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal, the next word spoken — after "contact light" — was "shutdown" by Armstrong, who was alerting Aldrin that he had turned off the engine. Andrew Chaikin, author of A Man on the Moon: The Voyages of the Apollo Astronauts, told us that he considers "shutdown" to be the first word uttered on the moon. Eric Jones — editor of the Apollo Lunar Surface Journal — agreed. He told us that after consulting the transcripts and the November 1969 NASA report on the Apollo 11 mission, he concluded that "shutdown" was the first word spoken after the lunar module landed. The next words came from Aldrin, according to the Journal transcript: "Okay. Engine stop." At NASA, spokesman Joshua Buck said this was the key moment. "After checking online, it seems that the very first word on the moon was seconds after landing and said by Buzz Aldrin. It was 'OK,'" Buck told us in an e-mail. After "engine stop," there was a brief technical exchange between Armstrong and Aldrin that Jones said was part of the post-shutdown process. Next, mission control in Houston chimed in: "We copy you down, Eagle," said Charles Duke, who was Apollo 11's capsule communicator, the only person authorized to talk directly to the crew. According to the Journal's transcript, Armstrong then said to Aldrin, "Engine arm is off," before addressing mission control directly with: "Houston ..." About 20 seconds passed — and about 30 words were spoken — between Aldrin's "contact light" and Armstrong's "Houston." Facing all these different answers to the first-word question — none of which were "Houston" — we sought clarity from Bill Barry, NASA's chief historian. No luck: Barry told us that there are "a range of right answers." He said "contact light" was one possibility because those words were uttered the moment that the module touched the surface of the moon. "The next option," he said, is the first word spoken after all four of the module's foot pads came to rest on the moon. It's not clear exactly when that happened, Barry said, but it probably occurred as the astronauts were running down their post-shutdown "checklist" — "like the one you do every day, but probably don't say aloud, when you park your car." But Barry said that because the checklist was part of a long-rehearsed procedural script, he is "inclined toward saying that the first 'intentional' words spoken on the moon were Armstrong's report to Houston that they had landed." Keeping score? That's one vote for "Houston" and four for some other words. Barry offered yet another take on the issue, saying that if you start from the moment humans stepped on the lunar surface for the first time, the first words spoken on the moon would be Armstrong's most famous statement: "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." We had one more question for Barry: How much of the procedural exchange between the astronauts did the millions of people hear as they listened to the moon landing on radio and television? Barry told us that they would have heard everything said by Aldrin, including "contact light" and "Okay. Engine stop," because he was making all his checklist calls and observations over the radio. Armstrong's communications were captured by the on-board recorder, Barry said, but were not broadcast on the radio unless he pushed a button — as Armstrong did when he announced, "Houston ... The Eagle has landed." We laid out our research for Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier, who responded by saying: "We stand by the governor's inaugural remarks." Now, to the Truth-O-Meter. We understand the everlasting appeal of Houston as the first word flung from the moon. However, we were surprised to learn, it's not so. Armstrong's call from the moon to mission control was preceded by various other and easy-to-overlook words. We rate Perry's statement as False.

pomt-10919	Says Sherrod Brown "votes 97 percent with Chuck Schumer, almost 95 plus percent with Elizabeth Warren."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2018/jul/31/jim-renacci/ohio-senator-sherrod-brown-votes-elizabeth-warren-/	Ohio Republican U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci says his Democratic opponent Sen. Sherrod Brown votes in step with Democratic leadership and liberals. Renacci held a July 10 press conference in Cincinnati to call for term limits. "People start voting not for their state anymore but they start voting for their leadership," Renacci said. "And we have seen that with our Sen. Sherrod Brown who votes 97 percent with Chuck Schumer, almost 95 plus percent with Elizabeth Warren." Renacci was referring to the voting records of Schumer, who is the Democratic Senate leader and represents New York, as well as Warren, who represents Massachusetts and is a potential 2020 presidential contender to challenge President Donald Trump. We found that Renacci is largely correct on the numbers but we will add some context. In recent years, the average senator voted with his or her party about 90 percent of the time when a majority of Democrats took a position different from a majority of Republicans, said Steven S. Smith, Washington University political science professor. "In this context, a serious look at a senator’s record requires more digging. On what issues did the senator introduce legislation, offer amendments, address in public statements, or pursue on committee or in conference?" Brown’s voting record Renacci’s campaign pointed to vote data compiled by Congressional Quarterly, which showed that Brown voted with Schumer 96 percent of the time between 2007 and 2018. For the comparison with Warren, who joined the Senate in 2013, the Renacci campaign pulled CQ data showing Brown voted the same as Warren about 94 percent of the time. We used ProPublica’s public database which provides head-to-head comparisons, and found similar results. So the numbers aren’t in dispute. We have fact-checked several previous claims that Democrats voted with former President Barack Obama or their party the vast majority of the time and generally rated them Mostly True if the numbers were on target. Most Democrats and Republicans largely vote with their respective party, but using only the statistic doesn’t tell the full story about a senator’s record. The straight-up vote comparisons here between three Democratic senators don’t tell the full story about Brown’s voting record, either. Brown’s campaign spokesman Preston Maddock pointed to some key votes on which Brown opposed Warren. For example, in 2014, Brown voted to adopt the conference report on the farm bill and was tapped by leadership to reconcile differences between the House and the Senate. Warren was among Senate Democrats who opposed any cuts to food stamps and voted against the legislation. In 2015, Brown voted to adopt the conference report to reauthorize federal transportation programs and renew the charter of the Export-Import bank. Under the bill, Brown said Ohio was set to receive an increase in money for highway and transit projects. Warren opposed the legislation because she said it rolled back rules that protect consumers and our financial system. In 2016, Brown voted for the 21st Century Cures Act, which authorized $1 bill to states to combat the opioid crisis. Warren said the bill was "hijacked" by the pharmaceutical industry and opposed it. Brown also voted for some of Trump’s nominees in 2017 whom Warren opposed, including Ben Carson to head up Housing and Urban Development and Wilbur Ross for commerce secretary. Brown supported U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer's confirmation, while Schumer opposed him. While Brown has criticized Trump on several fronts, Maddock pointed to some examples on which the Democratic senator has been in agreement with the president. For example, Brown supported the Interdict Act to make it easier for customs officials to block fentanyl from getting into the U.S. The law passed the Senate by unanimous consent. Trump signed the House version into law, while Brown was a cosponsor of the Senate version. U.S. Sen. Rob Portman, Ohio’s Republican senator, also backed the bill, and both Portman and Brown attended a signing ceremony for the new law at the White House. Brown and Trump also share some views on trade. Brown has said Trump’s order on raising imported steel will help stabilize steel jobs in Ohio. Experts say members often vote along party lines Experts told us that it’s no surprise that senators from the same party often vote the same. "Democrats tend to vote with fellow Democrats, just as Republicans tend to vote with their party. The existence of parties and winner-take-all congressional primaries incentivizes party-line voting," University of Akron political science professor David Cohen said. The vote comparison among Democrats omits that the Senate reaches bipartisan consensus on some issues, for example, the recent unanimous vote in the Senate to express opposition to allowing the Russians to interrogate American diplomats, said University of Miami political science professor Gregory Koger. "There may be a lot of issues on which Brown disagrees with Schumer and/or Warren that do not come to the Senate floor, so their roll call voting record may overstate their actual policy agreement," Koger said. Using the ProPublica database of votes, we found that Renacci voted the same as House Majority Leader Paul Ryan about 89 percent of the time. Our ruling Renacci said Brown "votes 97 percent with Chuck Schumer, almost 95 plus percent with Elizabeth Warren." The numbers are largely correct and not in dispute. But it’s not unusual for members of the same party to vote together, and it doesn’t tell the full story about their voting record. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-06468	Between 2000 and 2010, the illegal immigrant population of Texas increased by 60 percent, while California and Florida had "no increase."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/18/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-illegal-immigrant-population-rose/	During the Oct. 18, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Las Vegas, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney sparred with one of his rivals, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, over immigration. Over the last 10 years, Romney said, California and Florida have had "no increase in illegal immigration. Texas has had 60 percent increase in illegal immigrants.... If there's someone who has a record as governor with regards to illegal immigration that doesn't stand up to muster, it's you, not me." We’ll start our analysis by noting that counting illegal immigrants is a notoriously tricky task. The U.S. Census Bureau doesn’t ask for the legal status of the people it interviews, so independent groups need to approximate the numbers of foreign-born individuals who are believed to be unauthorized, based on factors such as gender, age, country of origin and year of entry into the U.S. According to experts we contacted, there are two sources that produce credible estimates: the Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Immigration Statistics and the Pew Hispanic Center. Both of these organizations have produced numbers that are broadly similar to Romney’s claim. First, the numbers for Texas. The DHS estimated that Texas had 1,090,000 unauthorized immigrants in 2000, rising to an estimated 1,770,000 by 2010 -- an increase of 680,000, or about 62 percent, over the decade. Meanwhile, Pew estimated the numbers to be 1,100,000 in 2000 and 1,650,000 in 2010 (the midpoint of a range between 1,450,000 to 1,850,000). That’s an increase of 550,000, or exactly 50 percent. The difference between 50 percent and 62 percent is "well within the margin of error of any of these estimates," said Jeffrey S. Passel, a senior demographer at Pew who helped assemble the estimate. So the 60 percent increase Romney cited is broadly supported by the best estimates available. What about the numbers for California and Florida over the same period? According to the DHS figures, California had a 2 percent increase, while Florida had a 5 percent decrease. So Romney’s slightly off when he claims that California had "no increase," but he has a point that both states were broadly stable over the period. Meanwhile, when rating promises of these sort, we always try to look not only at whether the facts are accurate, but also whether the public official being credited or blamed for the statistic has significant authority over the issue. In the case of immigration, governors have limited influence. "There are certain trends with respect to illegal immigration that are beyond the ability of any single state policymaker to counteract," said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications for the Migration Policy Institute, which studies immigration issues. In addition, she said, "border enforcement is almost entirely in the federal realm, and only federal policymakers can set the parameters for who has legal status in this country." Still, Mittelstadt added, some states in recent years "have taken on a greater role in immigration enforcement and policymaking, and state and local executives play a significant role in determining how welcoming or hostile their jurisdictions are perceived to unauthorized immigrants." For instance, she said that under Perry, Texas has "asserted a growing role for itself at the border." Meanwhile, Ira Mehlman-- the media director for the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that seeks to stop illegal immigration -- added that while Perry has focused on border enforcement in Texas, he has not gone as far as, say, Arizona in "removing incentives to come [il legally]," including access to jobs and benefits -- "the most important factors in controlling illegal immigration." Our ruling Romney is essentially correct on the numbers, but his strong implication that Perry is responsible is a significant stretch. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.

pomt-03246	Says Matt Bevin has repeatedly failed to pay his taxes.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/aug/14/mitch-mcconnell/mitch-mcconnell-tags-kentucky-primary-opponent-tax/	The 2014 Kentucky Senate race will ultimately be a referendum on Republican versus Democratic policies, but before we get to that point, the state’s senior senator, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell must first get through the GOP primary. He faces a challenge from well-to-do businessman and tea party activist Matt Bevin. In a state that elected Sen. Rand Paul, a magnet for the libertarian wing of the Republican Party, McConnell is treating this as a real challenge. McConnell’s latest ad is called "Delinquent" and it casts Bevin as a man who repeatedly fails to pay his taxes and then denies the habit. Here’s the key text from the ad: Announcer: Bevin says (video clip) "I have no tax delinquency problem, nor have I ever." Announcer: But Bevin’s business failed to pay taxes at least eight times. And was the No. 1 tax delinquent. Bevin also failed to pay taxes on his million-dollar home in Maine. Despite official documents, Bevin says (video clip) "I have no tax delinquency problem nor have I ever." Announcer: Bailout Bevin. How can you believe him on anything? We contacted the McConnell campaign, and they told us that the business that didn’t pay taxes is Bevin Brothers Manufacturing in East Hampton, Conn. Bevin Brothers makes bells -- cow bells, brass hand bells, door bells, sleigh bells and so on. It’s been making bells since 1832 and on its website, it speaks with pride of being the "only remaining company manufacturing just bells in the United States." The Bevin family has overseen the firm for six generations. Matt Bevin became wealthy managing the portfolios of institutional investors. An uncle in Connecticut owned and ran Bevin Brothers. According to a letter provided by the Bevin campaign, the factory foreman, Doug Dilla, contacted Matt Bevin in 2008 and asked him to intervene to save the company. The uncle was ill, and the firm "was in debt and not meeting its obligations," Dilla wrote. Dilla wrote that letter in July 2013 at the Bevin campaign’s request. The McConnell campaign sent us copies of tax records showing the bell maker had fallen behind on paying taxes eight times. The amounts ranged from $21 to over $74,000. That big bill was owed to the Internal Revenue Service, and the record shows that the company failed to pay what it owed in 2008 and in the second quarter of 2009. The question is, as our colleagues at the Washington Post Fact Checker pointed out in their analysis of this ad, can Matt Bevin be held accountable for those unpaid taxes? The IRS lien document is consistent with the storyline of a company facing hard times around 2008. There is no record of Matt Bevin having managerial control of the firm before that point and the extent of his involvement afterward is unclear. According to the Bevin campaign, he began putting money into the bell maker starting in 2008. His uncle remained in charge, at least formally, until August 2011 when the board elected him president and treasurer. The campaign provided an unsigned copy of the shareholder resolution; the signed original, they said, was lost in a major fire at the plant in 2012. The East Hampton town manager, Mike Maniscalco, told us that from what he and other town officials can tell, all those details are accurate. "The company was definitely struggling, and we are grateful that Mr. Bevin got involved," Maniscalco said. "After the fire, the company had offers from other communities to reopen elsewhere and thankfully, they made the decision to stay and are cranking out bells today." Maniscalco also affirmed that he wrote a letter to the campaign in which he described Bevin’s successful efforts to pay all back taxes. The ad’s claim that Bevin Brothers Manufacturing had become the area’s top tax delinquent is accurate but is due mainly to the town’s tax base. Residential property taxes account for over 90 percent of revenues; when the bell maker fell behind, the amount it owed stood out. The house in Maine The ad’s final assertion is that Bevin failed to pay taxes on his million-dollar home in Maine. That is accurate but incomplete. In 2007, Bevin did not pay $5,761.07 in property taxes on a home he bought for $1,250,000 in 2001. The house is in the town of Greenwood, Maine. The town’s tax collector, Kimberly Sparks, told us that Bevin had paid his taxes on time every year before 2007 and afterward as well. When Bevin bought the house in 2001, the lender was American Bank and Trust. Typically, along with a mortgage comes an escrow agent that pays the tax bill. Sparks said that sometime around 2007, the lender and escrow agent changed to National City Corporation. "A lot of times we see that when there’s a change in escrow agents," Sparks said, "property taxes don’t get paid. That’s a common occurrence." Sparks said the town sends the tax bill to the property owner, and it is up to the owner to forward it to the escrow agent. The McConnell campaign provided a copy of the tax notice sent to Bevin’s Louisville address and noted "the lien was sent to his house in Louisville, so it would have been hard to miss." In 2008, National City was collapsing in the sub-prime mortgage debacle and was purchased by PNC Financial Services. The extent to which that was a factor is unclear. According to a letter Sparks wrote at the request of the Bevin campaign, Bevin contacted the town in 2009 "concerned that his accounts were paid by his new mortgage company" and "was surprised to learn of two tax liens." By February 2009, National City Mortgage paid the back taxes. Our ruling The McConnell campaign ad paints a picture of Matt Bevin as a man with a track record of unpaid taxes. The claim is based on back taxes owed by a bell-making company in Connecticut that was owned by members of the Bevin family, and Bevin’s failure to pay taxes on a vacation house in Maine. With the bell maker, based on the paper trail and interviews, it’s reasonable to conclude that the company was in financial trouble before Bevin was deeply involved. We don’t know all the details of Bevin’s management role, but the town credits him for helping the firm pay its tax bills and later, keeping the business afloat. McConnell’s team says this was Bevin’s business and he was responsible for its failure to pay taxes. But the weight of evidence says he inherited the tax liabilities; the town doesn’t hold him responsible for the nonpayment of taxes, and in fact, regards him in exactly the opposite light. This makes it difficult to see where the McConnell claim holds up. As for the house in Maine, Bevin showed a lapse in overseeing the property tax payments, but the change in mortgage companies at a time when the lender was headed toward bankruptcy is a significant factor. According to local officials, Bevin took the initiative to correct the problem. In both cases, there is a slim element of truth but the rest of the facts paint a very different picture. We rate the claim Mostly False.	None	Mitch McConnell	None	None	None	2013-08-14T10:42:06	2013-08-05	['None']

pomt-03094	If the government shuts down, "all military personnel will continue to serve and accrue pay but will not actually be paid until appropriations are available."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/sep/24/cw-bill-young/rep-young-says-military-pay-would-be-delayed-durin/	U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young, R-Fla., and other House Republicans oppose Obamacare and recently approved a measure to fund the government only if President Barack Obama’s signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, is defunded. But while addressing the House on Friday, the longest-serving Republican in Congress called the House plan a "painful and inefficient way to govern," and cautioned his peers against a government shutdown. Young included impact on the military in his list of examples of what would happen should the shutdown come to pass. "All military personnel will continue to serve and accrue pay but will not actually be paid until appropriations are available," he said. We wanted to see how soldiers’ wallets would be impacted if the government shuts down. First, let’s review shutdown logistics. If the president and Congress can’t agree on funding for the new fiscal year, federal agencies can’t operate, except in emergencies. The last shutdowns were in 1995 and 1996. In November 1995, the shutdown lasted five days, which was not long enough to affect military pay. From mid December 1995 to early January 1996, a 21-day shutdown occurred, which would have affected paychecks, if not for defense appropriations enacted on Dec. 1 that made funding available. This time around, however, no such budget appropriations have been passed, or at least not yet. Cmdr. Bill Urban, a U.S. Department of Defense spokesman, said there is still enough time for the government to pass them. Back in January, Sens. Mark Udall, D-Colo., and Jerry Moran, R-Kan., introduced legislation that would allow both troops and civilians to get paid in the event of a shutdown, but the bill never made it out of committee. Urban said the Defense Department was making plans based on its past experience with government shutdowns. In April 2011, before Congress narrowly avoided a government shutdown, the department announced that the military would continue to work but would be paid retroactively. That would likely be the same plan this time around. If the government shutdown does occur on Sept. 30, military members would receive their Oct. 1 paychecks on time, but Oct. 15 paychecks would be delayed. We should note that civilians who work for the Defense Department wouldn’t fare as well, based on the 2011 report. Many would go on unpaid furlough during a shutdown. "It would put a good bit of stress on an already stressed workforce," Urban said. Our ruling Though Young supported a House measure to defund Obamacare, he’s now urging the House to avoid a government shutdown, reminding fellow members of how that affects military pay. A Defense Department official said the department’s plan will be similar to plans from past threats of government shutdowns. That means the military would delay paychecks. Young’s claim is that the military cannot be paid without appropriations is correct. We rate his statement True.	None	C.W. Bill Young	None	None	None	2013-09-24T17:12:38	2013-09-20	['None']
pomt-05588	"Last year, we produced 14 percent less oil on public lands than we did the year before."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/apr/02/rob-portman/rob-portman-says-oil-production-public-lands-was-d/	Everyone complains about gasoline prices. President Barack Obama says he’s trying to do something about them, including making the country less reliant on foreign oil. Republicans say he should do a lot more to spur domestic oil and gas production. PolitiFact has reviewed some of Obama’s energy measures before, including his claim that U.S. energy production is at an eight-year high. But there’s a counter-claim by many Republicans that was ripe for exploration when Sen. Rob Portman mentioned it on March 26, 2012. During a radio interview with Fox News Radio, Portman said: "The president says, you know, ‘we're doing more.’ Well, on public lands, we're doing less. Last year, we produced 14 percent less oil on public lands than we did the year before. We should be doing more on public lands, and that's the outer continental shelf and what's going on in Alaska and so on." Portman’s press secretary, Christine Mangi, steered us to an article published online by Greenwire, a news service that covers energy issues. The article, posted on March 14, was on the state of energy exploration and was based on testimony and statements U.S. Bureau of Land Management director Bob Abbey made before a panel of Senate appropriators. The article made its point in the first paragraph: "Energy firms face fewer costs and regulatory obstacles when drilling on state and private lands than they do on public lands, where oil production fell last year, a top Obama administration official said today," Abbey also told the lawmakers, according to the article, that oil exploration and drilling companies have migrated to nonpublic lands for economic reasons, not because of Obama policies. The article noted that, according to Interior Department statistics, oil production fell by 14 percent in fiscal year 2011 on federal lands and waters. That’s exactly what Portman said. "The dip in production occurred mostly in the Gulf of Mexico, where a moratorium on deepwater drilling stunted exploration for much of 2010 in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon disaster," Greenwire reported. We wanted to drill down beneath the article. So we turned to transcripts of Abbey’s recent testimony in both the House and the Senate. There is no need to repeat it all here because Greenwire summed it up well, but we’ll point out one important part of the BLM chief’s testimony before Senate appropriators on March 14. From a transcript: "But no doubt the statistics would show that the U.S. oil and gas production is up and last year it's more -- last year more oil is produced in this country than any time since 2003 according to... (CROSSTALK) And the, you know, no doubt the aggressive development of shale gas and shale oil has led to a shift to private lands in the east and to the south where there is less amount of federal mineral estate in those sections of the country." He added that where oil and gas companies decide to develop "is up to them. For example, we have approved 7,000 applications for permits to drill that are not being drilled. We have over 25 million acres of lands that we've leased that are not being developed. So it's a decision that's being based and (CROSSTALK) by the market." As for the Gulf of Mexico, Abbey acknowledged the effect of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon explosion, and of safety measures taken that slowed the issuance of new permits. But he said permitting has speeded up -- that trend, too, has been documented -- and added that the "administration must strike the proper balance between the speed of processing and ensuring that industry is drilling responsibly and safely especially in the context of the largest oil spill in our nation's history which we saw with the Deepwater Horizon incident." Putting aside the reason for the decrease, it appeared that Portman was accurate when he said oil production was down on public lands last year. But there was one more thing we wanted to check: The actual number. For that, we turned to the Interior Department’s Office of Natural Resources Revenue and the U.S. Energy Information Administration. ONRR tracks royalties to the government for oil, gas and coal produced on federal lands, including oil from offshore wells. Using online records of royalty revenue, it is possible to estimate the amount of oil, gas and coal produced onshore and offshore on federal property in any fiscal year. Much more easily understood, and with similar results, is a recent report from EIA titled, "Sales of Fossil Fuels Produced from Federal and Indian Lands, FY 2003 through FY 2011." EIA worked with ONRR to produce the report. These numbers go directly to Portman’s claim. In 2010, EIA data show, 726 million barrels of oil came from federal lands, including offshore wells. In 2011, it was 626. That’s a drop of 13.77 percent, which can be rounded to 14 percent. This data, as well as a more complex measure (it involves royalties and British thermal units of energy, but we’ll spare you), would appear to render Portman’s statement accurate. Yet it’s worth noting that oil statistics can be used to make a somewhat different argument about drilling and exploration. From 2009 to 2010, offshore oil production rose by 14.9 percent. Prior to that, before Obama’s presidency, the offshore volume fell for several years, and it was erratic even during a phase in which it rose, EIA figures show. Yet onshore oil production generally rose on federally owned land -- and did again in 2011, by 3.7 percent. What does this say? To the White House, it says oil production on all public land is up; that it’s getting better and better on private land, where oil companies are chasing the boom in horizontal fracking; and that even last year’s drop on federal property, chiefly in the Gulf of Mexico, shouldn’t be regarded as a lack of commitment to offshore drilling Making this case more forcefully, the White House on March 15 issued a blog post (to which we were pointed by the Interior Department) that broke the figures for oil production on public lands and water into annual averages over three-year periods. The most recent average, during the Obama presidency, was 661.7 millions of barrels of oil. That compares with an annual average of 585.3 million barrels during President George W. Bush’s last three years. The point of presenting it this way? The White House was able to show a 13 percent improvement over the previous administration. So did the United States produce 14 percent less oil on its public lands last year, as Portman said? Yes. Was his statement made in a context of needing to do more, or more specifically, of this president not doing enough? Yes. He lent his voice to the ongoing debate of whether to allow more drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, in Alaska, and off the intercontinental shelf of the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. Fair enough. The White House points to the broader measure of all oil production, including on private land, to show an improvement. That, too, is fair. But experts agree that most big boosts in production come from years of earlier exploration and drilling. Much of the current success was seeded under a different administration, just as Obama’s actions are expected to bear fruit later. And at least part of the drop on public lands last year was due to the Deepwater Horizon disaster and oil spill and, according to BLM, an apparent shift by oil companies to private lands ripe for fracking. That leaves us here: Portman’s fact was accurate: There was a 14 percent drop on public lands. Everything else can be teased out and spun for either party’s purposes. Under PolitiFact guidelines, when a statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, it rates a Truth-o-Meter rating of Mostly True.

When the cuts were first proposed in 2001, McCain joined Democrats in voting against them. At the time, he said the tax breaks didn't do enough for the middle class, and because of a need for increased defense spending. In 2003, the phased-in cuts of 2001 were accelerated but McCain again voted no, saying taxes shouldn't be cut in time of war. But in 2006, when the cuts were extended, McCain voted yes because he said opposing the extension of cuts already in place would amount to a tax increase.

pomt-04138	The so-called doc fix in the fiscal cliff deal will cut payments "for treating illnesses disproportionately impacting minorities, including end stage renal disease and diabetes."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2013/jan/04/marcia-fudge/marcia-fudge-claims-fiscal-cliff-deal-included-cut/	If you read about the fiscal-cliff deal Congress made on New Year’s Day, one fact above others stood out. Through compromises -- more unsavory or unprincipled to some than to others -- America’s economy did not topple over. Neither side got everything it wanted, noted U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge, a Warrensville Heights Democrat who voted for the deal. One compromise in particular still leaves Fudge uneasy: the funding measures used to keep Medicare from cutting its pay to physicians by 26.5 percent. To avert the physician pay cuts, Congress diverted money from several other medical programs, Fudge said in a Jan. 1 news release. This took care of the so-called Medicare doc fix -- but it also happened to take money from programs that pay for "treating illnesses disproportionately impacting minorities, including end stage renal disease and diabetes," Fudge said. She said this must be addressed in the new session of Congress. Did Congress really get the money to keep paying doctors for treating seniors (via Medicare,) by cutting what it pays hospitals and others for treating diabetes and other diseases? PolitiFact Ohio took a look. It turns out that Fudge, who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, was correct on the funding. Whether this will harm patients is a matter of debate. Government accountants have wanted some of these changes for some time. Hospitals say the bean counters miss the big picture -- the real cost of treating patients -- by focusing too narrowly on line items. To understand this, let’s start with a quick explanation of the doc fix. It is a remnant of laws, the most recent in 1997, designed to hold down federal spending by linking the nation’s rate of economic growth to government payments for providers in Medicare, the 1965 program that brought federal health insurance to retirees. The problem is, medical costs often rise much faster than the overall economy (measured by the gross domestic product). In recent, low-inflation years, the formula linking the two would automatically require payment cuts to doctors. Some doctors who serve seniors say they might get paid so little that they would stop accepting new patients or quit practicing. So Congress halts these reductions every year, though it keeps the law. This year’s cut would have been particularly deep because of the cumulative build-up of past deferrals. But as we said, Congress found a fix. It required coming up with about $30 billion to pay. Where did the money come from? According to the Kaiser Health News blog, Congress decided to cut the amount that Medicare pays to hospitals for inpatient or overnight care by reducing annual base payment increases. This would save $10.5 billion over 10 years, the Kaiser news service said. Congress found another $4.2 billion by reducing what are known as ‘disproportionate share" payments made by Medicaid, the government’s program for low-income Americans, to hospitals that treat an unusually high share of the poor. And it got $4.9 billion by changing the way it bundles payments for treating end-stage renal disease starting in 2014 There are other changes, including a requirement that companies start competing with bids to sell diabetes test supplies, ending what government auditors say are over-payments. But you get the idea. These and other cuts are detailed in reports by the medical trade press, including The Medicare NewsGroup and Becker’s Hospital Review. If this sounds like Congress took from Peter to pay Paul, the president and CEO of the Federation of American Hospitals, Chip Kahn, might agree. He put it that way to Kaiser Health News: "It is not in the best interest of patients or those who care for them to rob hospital Peter to pay for fiscal cliff Paul." The American Medical Association also expressed its concerns. Outrageous? Consider the rationale: Congressional watchdogs maintain these programs were overpaid or abused in the past, and could function in the future with less money. According to several studies and audits by the Government Accountability Office, an investigative agency that reports to Congress, hospitals were overpaid while Medicare transitioned toward paying them a bundled sum for treatment based on a patient’s disease or diagnosis. The old system paid for individual services, treatments and tests, some of them poorly coordinated and duplicative. Overpayments occurred during the transition that started in 2008. Additionally, some ambulance services were overpaid for emergency transport of diabetes patients who did not need emergency or ambulance services, according to examinations by the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services. By cutting such payments by 10 percent, starting next October, Congress freed up additional money for the doc fix. And the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services paid for more dialysis-related drugs -- as much as $880 million in 2011 -- than patients with kidney failure actually used, according to a December, 2012, GAO report. This was due to a bundled-payment calculation that did not account for a significant drop in the usage of certain drugs -- 23 percent lower in 2011 than in 2007, the GAO found. The GAO specifically recommended that Congress tweak the law so CMS had clear authority to alter its dialysis payment calculations. Congress did so as part of the fiscal cliff and doc fix deal. But the medical industry is unhappy about this and the other cuts. It says that the GAO failed to factor in costs for which it is never reimbursed. "Making cuts of the magnitude GAO is recommending would impose great financial strain" on smaller dialysis organizations "and could lead to fewer choices and access to care problems for patients," Katrina Russell, president of the National Renal Administrators Association, told American Medical News in December. Fudge, too, does not like this change. Her district not only includes every major hospital system in Cuyahoga County, as her communications director, Belinda Prinz, told us, but also has a significant black population. African-Americans have a disproportionately high incidence of diabetes and are 1.8 times more likely to have diabetes than non-Hispanic whites, according to the American Diabetes Association. One in four African-American women over age 55 has diabetes, Prinz said in an email, citing this and other American Diabetes Association figures. Complications can cause blindness, kidney disease, heart attacks and strokes, and amputations sometimes result -- with African-Americans 2.7 times as likely to have lower-limb amputations, the association says. So where does that leave us with Fudge’s claim? Fudge did not specifically say minorities will be harmed by the spending cuts. Her statement was factually accurate. But she suggested that harm will result, saying that cuts will be made to programs that treat diseases disproportionately affecting minorities, including end stage renal disease and diabetes." The impact is unsettled for now. The GAO and inspector general have called out some of these programs for waste or unnecessary spending. Yet Fudge is in good company -- namely, the American medical community, although like any constituency, it too has its interests to protect. Because her claim requires this additional information to fully understand, we rate it Mostly True.	None	Marcia Fudge	None	None	None	2013-01-04T06:00:00	2013-01-01	['None']

pomt-12894	Miami-Dade is "the first community in the world to break the cycle of local transmission of the Zika virus."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2017/jan/24/carlos-gimenez/miami-dade-no-1-leader-breaking-local-zika-transmi/	Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said that in 2016 the county became a global leader in fighting the mosquito-borne Zika virus. "We were the first community in the world -- let me repeat that -- the first community and I believe the only community in the world to break the cycle of local transmission of the Zika virus," Gimenez said during his State of the County speech Jan. 18. However, Gimenez didn’t declare Zika dead forever -- he warned that the county must remain vigilant: "We may be in the off season, but that does not mean that our work is over." Gimenez, a Republican re-elected to his last term in November, has a point about local transmission. The last of the four local transmission zones were cleared in Miami-Dade by mid December 2016. However, he omitted some caveats about Zika transmission and Miami-Dade’s special circumstances compared with the rest of the world. Zika in Miami-Dade Zika has been around for decades. But the current outbreak started in 2015, when Brazil reported cases of more babies being born with abnormally small heads, a condition called microcephaly. That condition was connected to mothers infected with Zika. The Centers for Disease Control defines areas of active Zika virus transmission as having two or more locally acquired cases of Zika virus infection, within two weeks, within 1 square mile. Those cases must be in separate households, with travel and sex ruled out as potential causes. Using those guidelines, the Florida Department of Health declared active Zika transmission zones and then lifted them when 45 days passed without any new local cases in those zones. In July, the first local Zika cases were reported in Miami-Dade County. Over the next few months, the state declared four local Zika transmission zones. The state lifted the first zone, in Wynwood -- a trendy area near downtown Miami -- Sept. 19. That was the first community in the world to break local transmission, CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said. The state lifted the last of the four zones, in part of South Beach, on Dec. 9. But officials didn’t declare Zika entirely kicked to the curb forever; Miami-Dade remained a "cautionary area" according to the CDC. Officials warned that isolated cases could continue to appear -- the most recent one was Dec. 15. Let’s look at how Miami-Dade compared with some other areas in curbing Zika. In addition to Miami-Dade, only one other area in the United States had local Zika cases: Brownsville, Texas. Miami-Dade reported 257 cases of local transmission, while Brownsville reported six. The Texas Department of Health never declared a local transmission zone in Brownsville, but the CDC called it a "cautionary area." It’s difficult to compare Miami-Dade to other places where the Zika virus has been far more widespread. Brazil has had more than 128,000 cases and continues to battle Zika. Local transmission continues in Puerto Rico, which had more than 100 new cases this month and more than 37,000 since 2015. In Singapore, the government designated "Zika clusters" and announced that it had no more Dec. 15 after its last new case was reported Dec. 10. However, the "only place it really stopped is in Florida," said Daniel Epstein, a spokesman for the Pan American Health Organization. There were other areas in the world where Zika dropped off before it hit Miami-Dade. For example, the outbreak in French Polynesia affected an estimated 28,000 people and lasted until 2014, said Monika Gehner, a WHO spokeswoman. Some caveats While Miami-Dade got kudos from the CDC for efforts to curb Zika, experts caution that it can return, particularly when the temperature rises. It’s too early to claim elimination, said Duane J. Gubler, an emerging infectious disease expert at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. "The absence of reported cases for a few months does not confirm the transmission cycle is broken," she said. "After a year with active surveillance, I would probably accept it." Florida also has certain advantages compared with other places of the world that have been struck by Zika, including better access to testing patients to verify that the virus is actually Zika. Also, in South Florida, with air conditioning and screens and modest mosquito density levels, transmission is less likely than countries that have less of that protection, University of Florida biostatistics professor Ira Longini said. "There is no cycle to break," he said. "Sustained transmission is impossible, but you do get small outbreaks when introductions occur." Our ruling Gimenez said Miami-Dade is "the first community in the world to break the cycle of local transmission of the Zika virus." The CDC says that Wynwood, an area in Miami, was the first to break local transmission in September. The last of four local transmission zones was lifted Dec. 9. There are some caveats about Gimenez’s claim, including that only one other county in the United States had local cases, and a far smaller number. Some other places took a far greater hit from Zika than Florida did. Experts caution that Zika cases could return to South Florida, a point Gimenez also acknowledged in his speech.

pomt-04545	"Had the online change of address been in place in 2008 an estimated 130,000 voters who cast provisional ballots could have changed their address online and voted a regular ballot."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2012/sep/28/jon-husted/jon-husted-says-online-address-tool-would-have-cut/	Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted has found himself in the crosshairs of Democrats and concerned voting groups in recent months who worry the Republican officer wasn’t doing enough to open up greater access to voting. But there was one move Husted did this summer that pushed his critics back on their heels for a fleeting moment of agreement: when the secretary announced on Aug. 9 that his staff had made it possible for registered Ohio voters to now update and change their home addresses online through his office’s web site. The goal is ultimately have fewer Ohio voters using those sometimes unreliable and uncounted provisional ballots. People who want to vote on Election Day can be turned away if their address does not match the information in polling books. The backup plan for those people is to use provisional ballots, which are set aside for verification and don’t always end up being counted later. "If voters take advantage of this new tool and update their address online, it is likely that a lot fewer of them would have to vote a provisional ballot," Husted said at a news conference at his office the day he announced the change. Aside from a few reports of glitches in using the system, the news went over well. But at the news conference that day, Husted sought to sell his idea even more by declaring that had this system been in place during the 2008 presidential election about 130,000 Ohioans who used provisional ballots might not have had to. He backed it up by blasting a news release to the masses from his office later that day. "Had the online change of address been in place in 2008 an estimated 130,000 voters who cast provisional ballots could have changed their address online and voted a regular ballot," he said in the news release. He made an identical claim in another news release Sept. 17, 2012. That seemed like a fairly bold claim to PolitiFact Ohio. Consider that the state secretary of state’s office didn’t start tracking "wrong address" as a reason for having to use a provisional ballot in its routine post-election reports until 2011. So Politifact Ohio asked the Husted’s staff for an explanation. How can you say how many people would have changed their addresses and avoided a provisional ballot in 2008 had this online address change been in effect? After all, voters have always had the chance to change their addresses in-person. The answer is Husted’s office doesn’t know — for certain. Husted’s spokesman Matt McClellan noted that the key word in the statement uttered in August by the secretary and plopped in the the news releases is "estimated". "It is just an estimate assuming that voters would have taken advantage of the opportunity to change their addresses online," McClelland said. OK, so how did you arrive at such an "estimate"? Here’s McClelland’s explanation. Pay close attention or this might feel like a confusing mathematical equation. First, the office determined what percentage of voters using a provisional ballot in this year’s primary were forced to do so because they had a wrong address. That’s 11,912 wrong addresses out of 20,062 total provisionals for a rate of 59.4 percent. Second, the office determined what percentage of voters using a provisional ballot in the November 2011 general election were forced to do so because they had an incorrect address. That’s 51,404 out of 76,525 for a rate of 67.2 percent. Next, the office looked at the number of provisionals cast in November 2008 (206,859) and multiplied that number by 67.2 percent and 59.4 percent, for totals of 139,009 and 122,874 respectively. Lastly, the office then took the average between 139,000 and 123,000 and came up with its 130,000 estimate. Follow that? "I feel pretty good about it," McClelland said, after explaining the unscientific statistical analysis applied by the secretary’s office. We at Politifact Ohio have been called a lot of things, but brilliant statisticians isn’t one of them. We asked Case Western Reserve University professor and chair of the mathematics department, Daniela Calvetti, to please weigh in. "I think it is a reasonable way of estimating how many voters would be able to take advantage of this if everyone who had a provisional ballot due to incorrect address indeed went online and changes the address electronically we would have about 130,000 voters," Calvetti said. "There is no reason to believe that the percentages would vary much because 67 percent and 59 percent are not very far (apart) in particular since one was a primary and one was a general," she said. "I think it is a sound way of making the projection." So where does that leave Husted’s claim? An independent expert backed the methodology Husted used to come up with the figure of 130,000, and the statement describes that as an estimate. But the figure assumes all people would have taken advantage of the online address change, which is not certain. That’s additional information that provides clarification.. On the Truth-O-Meter, Husted’s claim rates Mostly True.	None	Jon Husted	None	None	None	2012-09-28T10:00:00	2012-09-17	['None']

pomt-02281	"By a two-to-one margin, Rhode Islanders want to ban assault weapons and we have a very small percentage of gun owners in this state, less than 13 percent."	mostly true	/rhode-island/statements/2014/apr/06/linda-finn/rhode-island-legislator-linda-finn-says-large-majo/	During debate on any contentious issue, advocates will argue that the public is on their side. That was the case during a March 18, 2014, State House rally designed to encourage the Rhode Island General Assembly to adopt stronger gun-control laws. Rep. Linda Finn, D-Middletown, used that strategy at the end of her speech. "By a two-to-one margin, Rhode Islanders want to ban assault weapons and we have a very small percentage of gun owners in this state, less than 13 percent," she said. We decided to see whether support for an assault weapons ban is really that high and the level of gun ownership in Rhode Island is really that low. PolitiFact has looked at the issue nationally, giving a Mostly True to Sen. Dianne Feinstein's 2013 comment that "No poll done this year . . . shows less than a majority to reinstate a federal ban on assault weapons." But Finn is claiming a much larger margin of support. When we contacted Finn, she sent us the results of a poll released in February 2013 in which 64 percent of Rhode Islanders said they supported banning assault weapons, 27 percent were opposed and 9 percent were not sure. Even with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percent, that's a 2-to-1 margin. The 24-question survey of 614 voters covered a wide range of issues and was done by Public Policy Polling, a Democratic-leaning survey firm based in North Carolina. Unlike most other polling services, PPP collects its data through robocalls, in which people hear a recorded message and are asked to respond by pressing a button on their telephone. That means a lot of people -- typically 9 out of 10 -- hang up without responding. After checking with area pollsters, we couldn't find a more traditional survey of Rhode Islanders on the assault weapons issue. Finn said she thought the PPP results were similar to the results of national polls. They're not. We found a compilation of assault weapons polls at PollingReport.com and discovered that the degree of support for a ban on assault-style weapons was much less pronounced. The split was 54-42 in a May 2013 Pew study, 56-42 in an April 2013 ABC News / Washington Post survey, 51-48 in an April 2013 CNN / ORC poll, and 59-36 in a March 2013 Quinnipiac University survey. Those national results don't come close to the 2-to-1 margin of support seen in the PPP Rhode Island poll, but that shouldn't be surprising when other parts of the United States have very different attitudes toward firearms. And what about Finn's statement about the rate of gun ownership in Rhode Island? A direct state-by-state tally of gun owners is not available. In fact, it is illegal in Rhode Island for the state to maintain a gun registry. We do know that in 2013, 3,280 active concealed carry permits were issued by the Rhode Island attorney general's office. But that's only a small fraction of owners. Also last year, Rhode Island gun dealers reported doing 21,793 BCI background checks for the purchase or transfer of at least one firearm. All but 145 were approved. But that number doesn't tell you how many gun owners there are in Rhode Island because that's only for one year, each purchase might involve more than one weapon, and the same owner might be counted multiple times if he or she makes more than one purchase throughout the year. So the best information comes from surveys. Finn sent us to a webpage at About.com which reports that 12.8 percent of Rhode Island's population owns guns, and the only states where gun ownership was lower were Massachusetts, New Jersey and Hawaii. About.com says the source is the website USACarry.com. But it’s actually from a from a survey done six years earlier -- in 2001 -- by the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, which tracks health risks in the United States and is billed as "the world’s largest telephone survey." In addition, that wasn't the percentage of the population owning guns. It was the percentage of adults who said there was at least one weapon in their household. We were unable to get more recent data from the BRFSS, which asked the question in 2002 and 2004. But we found it in two studies. A 2005 paper in the journal Pediatrics reported that the 2002 rate in Rhode Island was 13.3 percent, slightly higher than what Finn reported. A 2013 paper in the American Journal of Epidemiology looked at the data from 2004, reporting a rounded-off rate of 12 percent, which conforms with what Finn said. Our ruling Rep. Linda Finn said, "By a two-to-one margin, Rhode Islanders want to ban assault weapons and we have a very small percentage of gun owners in this state, less than 13 percent." Finn's statement about how Rhode Islanders feel about the issue comes from a recent robocall poll that has not been confirmed by any other Rhode Island polls. Her statement on the rate of gun ownership in Rhode Island is based on very outdated studies. But we have not been able to find any more recent data to suggest the number has changed. Because Finn's statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.

pomt-03038	"For the first time since the Korean War, total federal spending has gone down for two years in a row."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/08/dennis-ross/rep-dennis-ross-says-us-spending-has-fallen-two-st/	U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Lakeland, is one of a small group of Republicans calling for an end to the government shutdown. After all, Republicans have succeeded in reining in government spending, Ross wrote in an op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times (the parent of PolitiFact), on Oct. 7, 2013. "In the few years since I was elected to Congress in 2010, we have achieved huge savings and taken monumental steps. For the first time since the Korean War, total federal spending has gone down for two years in a row," Ross wrote, adding, "That is why I would support a continuing resolution that funds the government at sequestration levels for one year." A reader asked us whether Ross was correct that, "for the first time since the Korean War, total federal spending has gone down for two years in a row." We thought the claim was interesting, and we decided to check it out. By the most basic measure we found that Ross is right. The Korean War was an active conflict through the signing of a truce on July 26, 1953, so we counted starting in 1953. Between 1953 and 1955, federal spending fell each year, from $76.1 billion to $70.9 billion to $68.4 billion, according to the Office of Management and Budget. By 1956, spending had edged up again, to $70.6 billion. After that, spending almost always went up every year, at least until recently. It fell for one year between 1964 and 1965, and then once again between 2009 and 2010. But the only time it fell two years in a row was between 2011 and 2013. In 2011, federal outlays were $3.60 trillion. Outlays fell to $3.54 trillion in 2012, and the Congressional Budget Office projects the figure to fall to $3.46 trillion in 2013. We should note that this is not the only way to measure a claim like this. Sometimes, raw dollars aren’t an especially useful measurement for analyzing long periods of history, especially when talking about things that are growing. Inflation, population growth and economic expansion almost inevitably make the most recent year the largest ever. However, in this case, we think that using raw dollars is an acceptable measurement. That’s because reductions in spending mean swimming against the tide of inflation and growth. Our rating Ross said that, "for the first time since the Korean War, total federal spending has gone down for two years in a row." Since the 1950s, spending fell one year between 1964 and 1965, and then once again between 2009 and 2010. But the only time it fell two years in a row was between 2011 and 2013. We rate the statement True.	None	Dennis Ross	None	None	None	2013-10-08T16:20:17	2013-10-07	['None']

pomt-03992	Says "right now, we have more military spending than the next 10, 11, 12 countries combined."	true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/feb/10/cory-booker/cory-booker-says-us-military-spending-greater-next/	The United States must have a prepared military, but it’s not unpatriotic to say the country is spending too much money on its defense, according to Newark Mayor Cory Booker. How much money? It’s more than the military spending of up to the next 12 countries combined, the Democratic mayor said. Booker made that point on the Feb. 1 episode of HBO’s "Real Time with Bill Maher" during a panel discussion about the recent Senate hearing on Chuck Hagel’s nomination to be U.S. Defense Secretary. "The reality is we have to make sure that we have a military that’s prepared, but right now, we have more military spending than the next 10, 11, 12 countries combined, and we’ve got to start realizing that we can secure and protect ourselves, but also be responsible in the way that we do that," Booker said. "And it’s not unpatriotic to say that we’re spending too much money," the mayor added. "In fact, to me, that’s the patriotic thing to say." Booker’s claim is on target: The United States spent more on defense in 2011 than the combined total of other high-spending nations, according to data from two organizations considered to be leading authorities on worldwide military spending. The first set of figures comes from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, an independent institute dedicated to research into conflict, armaments, arms control and disarmament. The institute maintains an online database of military expenditures since 1988 for 172 countries. In 2011 -- the most recent year available -- the United States led the world in military spending at $711 billion, marking 41 percent of the world total, according to the institute. The next top 12 spending nations accounted for a combined total of $670.9 billion, according to the institute. U.S. expenditures were nearly five times higher than China, the second-highest nation with an estimated $143 billion in military spending. Russia was in third place with estimated spending of $71.9 billion. We found similar results when we reviewed the data released by The International Institute for Strategic Studies, a London-based think tank which tracks military spending in 170 countries for its annual "Military Balance" report. According to IISS figures released last year, the United States’ defense budget in 2011 was $739.3 billion, making it the largest in the world. The combined total of the next top 9 nations was $486.7 billion, according to IISS figures. Referring to U.S. military spending, Michael O’Hanlon, a defense expert with the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, explained in an e-mail: "It is large because we have overseas interests all over the world, and we put a high premium on responsiveness and qualitative superiority." But the United States is poised to restrain its defense expenditures in the coming years. In addition to reduced costs from winding down the war in Afghanistan, the Budget Control Act of 2011 contains provisions that limit spending increases in defense and other areas over the next decade. It’s worth noting that calculating military expenditures for worldwide comparisons is inherently challenging, in part because there is no single definition of what constitutes military spending. As the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute points out on its website, "the lack of sufficiently detailed data makes it difficult to apply a common definition of military expenditure on a worldwide basis." Our ruling In a panel discussion on HBO’s "Real Time with Bill Maher," Booker claimed that "right now, we have more military spending than the next 10, 11, 12 countries combined." The mayor’s statement is accurate, according to data from two leading authorities on worldwide military spending. One set of figures shows that, in 2011, military spending by the United States exceeded the combined total of the next 12 highest nations by roughly $40 billion. We rate the statement True.

pomt-00053	Says Texas U.S. Rep. John Culberson "was caught using campaign cash on collectibles, including Civil War memorabilia and fossils."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/nov/03/environmental-defense-fund-action/did-texas-us-rep-john-culberson-use-campaign-money/	As the 2018 campaign comes to a close, the political arm of the Environmental Defense Fund has sent a mailer to homes in Texas’ 7th Congressional District saying that John Culberson, a Republican congressman, is "wrong for Houston." As partial proof, it said he was "caught using campaign cash on collectibles, including Civil War memorabilia and fossils." "Caught" is an interesting word, since the nine-term incumbent, now challenged by Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, disclosed the memorabilia purchases, which he says he gave as gifts from his campaign. As for the fossils, his campaign insisted there were no such purchases -- and said it only bought books and maps from a business that happens to also sell fossils. Critics have made a false assumption, the Culberson campaign told us initially. We’ll look at both parts of the claim but will give away a bit of what we found right here: He bought fossil replicas. If you wonder why an environment group would care about fossils and Culberson, the group noted that Culberson said in late summer that his purchases were for research into such things as paleoclimatology, or the study of climates before instrumental records were widely available, to help him better understand climate change. Environmental Defense Fund Action says that for all this studying, Culberson still refuses to accept scientific research on the matter. Culberson has said humans played a role in climate change but, as he told the Los Angeles Times in 2015, "We just don’t have enough data or accurate data to say with certainty what that effect has been." Fossils Let’s take fossils first. The congressman’s critics based their claim on a mention in a 2012 campaign finance report that Culberson’s campaign made two purchases from a South Dakota organization, the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research. The institute sells fossils, replicas and other things, and Culberson spent $309.66 altogether there, Federal Election Commission records show. The purchase was part of a broader set of Culberson expenses being questioned by Texas Democrats -- a set of questions we are not addressing fully here because we are looking specifically at campaign ads and claims. But for a bit of perspective, the Houston Chronicle wrote in August that Texas Democrats were challenging nearly $50,000 in Culberson campaign spending since 2004. Focusing just on fossils, PolitiFact asked Culberson’s campaign what it bought from the Black Hills Institute. We were told it bought books and maps, not fossils, the same explanation the campaign has given since August. "Only in politics does a person get attacked for trying to be better at their job," Culberson campaign spokeswoman Catherine Kelly said. "The mailer from the Environmental Defense Action Fund is factually wrong. The congressman never bought fossils with campaign contributions and all other purchases are acceptable under House and FEC rules." Culberson is a voracious reader, and has spent thousands of dollars from his campaign account for books and materials, including some on paleoclimatology, that his campaign says were related to his job. In just the 2011-12 campaign season, Culbserson’s campaign spent $9,848 on "research" or "research materials," most of it from vendors such as Amazon.com and Barnes & Noble, FEC records reviewed by PolitiFact show. Culberson chairs the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees spending on science and such agencies as the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The research material helps him better understand the changing levels of carbon dioxide in the climate, his campaign says. Asked about records that would show he was buying books and maps, not fossils, from the Black Hills Institute, his campaign said the 2012 records for such specific purchases no longer exist. We’ve got the receipts PolitFact, however, called the Black Hills Institute. They pulled the invoices from Culberson's two separate orders and sent us copies. This is what the campaign paid for, excluding shipping charges: Three large wall charts showing extensive histories of the Earth and matter, dating back 4.5 billion years. The charts have columns showing tectonic maps, changes in the earth such as mountain formation, major volcanic eruptions, glacial epochs, craters from asteroids and comets and extensive information on fossils, invertebrates and vertebrate lifeforms, as well as their extinction. These cost $19.95 apiece. One desktop model of a Triceratops. It cost $84.05. Two lage -- 4.5 inches -- fossil replicas of a Tyrannosaurus Rex tooth. Each cost $40. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com The FEC gives "pretty wide latitude" to the purchase of books and other materials that a candidate or officeholder might use in his or her official capacity, Brendan Fischer, an expert on campaign finance law at the Campaign Legal Center, told us. But what about a Triceratops model and replicas of a Tyrannosaurus Rex tooth fossil? "I’d like to hear their explanation for it," he said. "It’s hard to see how it would pertain to their official duties." We told the campaign what we found, and it asked what our proof was. So we sent the campaign the invoices for the congressman’s purchases. The response from Kelly, the spokeswoman: "The invoices confirm that the congressman never bought actual fossils, and every purchase from the Black Hills Institute is considered acceptable under House and FEC rules." Asked why the congressman bought the replicas and the model at all, Kelly said, "While these purchases were more than six years ago and now being used as part of a coordinated partisan hit job, the congressman believes these particular purchases were gifts, which is completely acceptable under FEC and House rules." Collectibles The mailer from Environmental Defense Fund Action also mentioned Culberson’s use of campaign money to buy collectibles and Civil War memorabilia. This, too, originated from the Democrats’ complaint referenced in the Houston Chronicle. Culberson is a Civil War history buff, collector and sometime-seller of memorabilia. But when it comes to his campaign funds, the purchases were for items such as stamps and coins the congressman got in order to give out as gifts, his campaign said. Congress members frequently use campaign money to buy gifts for constituents and volunteers, and the Culberson campaign said the Texas Republican was doing nothing different from what House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has done when buying white orchids. The FEC allows candidates and officeholders to buy and give as gifts items of nominal value as long as they are not given to family members, Fischer said. FEC reports show only what a candidate or officeholder pays, not the value of the each item. For example, in 2014, Culberson’s campaign spent $3,631 on coins from an antique coin seller. In 2009 and 2010, the campaign spent $4,181 on antiques and coins for gifts, including hat stars (an emblem worn on soldiers’ hats) and Texas Centennial and Republic of Texas coins, FEC records show. Culberson’s campaign said the value of each coin was about $25, and the value of stamps was about $10. For a broader view, we downloaded FEC data showing all federal candidate purchases -- those for everyone with a federal campaign account -- of items listed as "gifts" just since January 2017. The total reached $1.8 million, for everything from model airplanes to a quilt to gift baskets. Our ruling Environmental Defense Fund Action said Texas U.S. Rep. John Culberson "was caught using campaign cash on collectibles, including Civil War memorabilia and fossils." "Caught" seemed strong to us at first, given the campaign’s denials. But with a phone call and email, it turned out that Culberson had in fact used campaign funds -- not for fossils, but for replicas and a desktop model. Our ruling comes down to perspective. The mailer’s spin seemed a little strong at first, especially knowing that gift purchases, whether for Civil War trinkets or not, are allowable if considered of nominal value. But the insistence of the campaign that Culberson did not buy fossils -- and that he had only bought books and maps -- is a factor as well. OK, he didn’t buy fossils. He bought fossil replicas. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-06641	"The majority last quarter of Sherrod Brown's campaign contributions came from outside of the state of Ohio."	false	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/15/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-chides-sen-sherrod-brown-out-state-con/	If you’re looking for fun with numbers (and who isn’t?), you could do a lot worse than download campaign finance data from the Federal Election Commission and sort it on a spreadsheet. But you won’t have to. Josh Mandel’s campaign has done it for you. We’ve done it too, and can confirm that the Republican U.S. Senate candidate’s staff knows its stuff. It also knows that Mandel got something wrong. During an interview with WKYC in Cleveland on Sept. 1, Mandel was asked about some campaign contributions that have raised some eyebrows. The generous contributions were from employees of a Canton direct mail firm, Suarez Corporation. Bloggers, the Ohio Democratic Party and news reporters have asked how those employees could afford to write such campaign checks. There has been no proof that someone else actually provided the money, which would be illegal. But the unusual appearance has led reporters to ask questions.. Thus, the question to Mandel by WKYC reporter Tom Beres: What do you say to people who are disturbed by these contributions? Mandel, who is currently Ohio’s treasurer, sidestepped the question, responding with a swipe at Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Democratic incumbent he hopes to defeat in 2012. "Well, the majority last quarter of Sherrod Brown's campaign contributions came from outside of the state of Ohio," he said. "The majority of ours, came from inside of the state of Ohio." That provoked a new question: Really? There’s nothing improper about going out of state to raise campaign cash, unless an office holder is neglecting his duties. But while sidestepping the question, Mandel indirectly opened a new line of criticism: that Brown doesn’t have the faith of Ohio voters and contributors. The Mandel campaign says it intends to continue that line, saying it believes it is true. But Mandel was wrong in his statement. His spokesman, Joe Aquilino, shot us an e-mail while we were still sorting the data, saying, "Josh misspoke and meant to say that the majority this year of Sherrod Brown's campaign contributions have come from outside the state of Ohio. ("last quarter" vs "this year"). We'll keep using this talking point and it's actually much worse than what Josh said during the interview. We'll be using this statistic a lot to show Senator Brown's lack of support from people here in Ohio who actually know him and know his record." This brings us to the numbers. We downloaded data from CQMoneyLine, a subscription service that sorts FEC data, and then turned to the original FEC records to do more crunching, factoring in itemized contributions (those of more than $200, which by law must list the donor’s name and address) and donations from political action committees. The Mandel campaign sent us its numbers, too, and they too came from an FEC download. The numbers matched. They show that Mandel was wrong about the most recent quarter, which ended June 30. Brown got the majority of his contributions from Ohioans: $623,049 in state, compared with $609,506 out of state. The previous quarter, however, more money came to Brown from out of state. Putting the two quarters together, the totals tipped the balance to the out-of-state side: $1,098,899 from Ohio, compared with $1,225,202 from out of state. Does that make Mandel wrong in a narrow sense -- but right in a broader way? His campaign sees it that way. Yet data that includes Brown’s current term but also goes back to his days in the House of Representatives, crunched on a regular basis by the Center for Responsive Politics for every member of Congress, shows that a majority of Brown’s donations have always been from Ohio. That could change in the future, as it could for Mandel, who has only raised money during a single quarter so far in this race (and the majority of his donations were from Ohio). Both candidates must raise millions more. Both will look for deep pockets throughout the United States. But Mandel was wrong on his specific claim. And if adding in one more quarter renders him sort-of right, a long history involving years of Brown elections renders Mandel wrong. On the Truth-O-Meter, Mandel’s statement is simply False.

pomt-07998	TriMet is "spending 4.2 million in fed funds to save $168K per year."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/jan/15/lars-larson/larson-accuses-trimet-investing-too-much-prospecti/	Federal cash giveaways always get close attention from pundits and politicians -- and PolitiFact Oregon. More often than not, the funds that go toward research in the form of scientific and technological grants (and particularly odd-sounding grants) usually get labeled as wasteful spending. (Does anybody remember the great ant debate?) Well, we’re on the case of another wasteful-spending accusation; this time radio personality Lars Larson is accusing TriMet of a particularly poor investment choice. On Dec. 21, 2010, he sent out a mighty tweet proclaiming: "(T)he brain trust at Tri Met just announced they are spending 4.2 million in fed funds to save $168K per year." To add a little insult to injury he also asked a question: "(C)an anyone down there do math?" By our calculation, anyway, an investment of $4.2 million being paid back at $168,000 a year wouldn’t be cleared for some 25 years. That’s a ways off, to be sure, so we figured it was worth looking into whether TriMet was investing wisely "in these hard economic times." First off, we needed a little context. What, exactly was this $4.2 million going to fund? We gave TriMet a call and Bekki Witt, the agency’s spokeswoman, e-mailed us a release. Here’s how it starts out and where Larson gets his $4.2 million figure: "TriMet has received a $4.2 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to expand the use of regenerative braking on MAX trains. The grant will allow TriMet to install 20 energy storage units on light rail vehicles, capturing much of the energy generated by the trains’ braking systems and storing that energy for immediate and future use." Sounds good. Now how about that $168,000 annual savings? Just read a little further: "The new units will release the stored energy to help power those trains as well as other trains on the system. The storage units, or energy capacitors, will capture and use nearly 100 percent of the power generated by braking trains, saving $168,000 a year in energy costs." Based on those two paragraphs, it seems Larson is on to something. TriMet is spending more than $4 million to upgrade its regenerative braking systems so that they can store the saved energy. That energy adds up to a savings of about $168,000 annually. But, as with most research, sometimes dollars are just the beginning when it comes to the returns. So, we gave Witt a call and asked her what she thought about Larson’s comments. The figures sound, right, we said. What gives? First, she said, it’s important to understand the scope of the grant program from which TriMet received the funds. According to the FTA website, the program was created when "The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (the federal stimulus) provided $100 million to be distributed as discretionary grants to public transit agencies for capital investments that will assist in reducing the energy consumption or greenhouse gas emissions of public transportation systems." Witt elaborated: "TriMet is the first in the country to try this technology out. … We're kind of part of that research and development aspect of it." As it stands now, TriMet does recoup some of the energy the trains create while braking, but that energy must be used almost immediately, either by the train itself or by a nearby train (the rescued energy can be transferred short distances). With this new technology, that saved energy can be stored and used for broader purposes, she said. "It gives us that flexibility that we don't have right now," Witt said. "This is something we see as a valuable project that will pay off in the long term. it's kind of a pilot, if you will, to see how it might work for us and for other transit programs throughout the country." When we contacted the Federal Transit Administration, the director and an engineer there echoed Witt’s remarks. "In time, we’re confident this regenerative braking will reduce transportation costs significantly around the country — while also reducing our dependence on oil," wrote administrator Peter Rogoff in an e-mail comment. We wondered if any of this might convince Larson that the trade-off was not as stark as he initially believed. No, he said, it didn’t. TriMet’s press release was clear, $4.2 million to save $168,000 a year. "You don’t know what the value of research will be," Larson said. It’s clear then, that there are two competing views here. Larson is looking at this grant in the Portland vacuum. TriMet and the Federal Transit Administration are looking at it in a broader, national context: TriMet is spending $4.2 million to refine technology that might, eventually, offer a significant return. So what about the ruling? Well, it would be premature to offer up a figure for the return on research, just as Larson argued. That said, he certainly simplified the grant and the expenditure. To say it’s a simply case of spending ‘x’ to save ‘y’ seems somewhat disingenuous. As with most political statements, this one needs some context. We rate this claim Mostly True.

pomt-04228	Says because of Hurricane Sandy in Atlantic City "much of that boardwalk no longer exists -- just the pillars where the boardwalk used to be."	mostly false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/nov/25/frank-lautenberg/frank-lautenberg-says-after-hurricane-sandy-much-b/	Hurricane Sandy washed iconic Jersey Shore landmarks into the sea, but despite what you may have heard -- from social media, television or maybe even a United States senator -- the historic boardwalk fronting Atlantic City’s casinos survived. Two weeks after the monstrous storm swept through New Jersey, devastating large swaths of the state’s coastline, Frank Lautenberg, a Democrat, took to the Senate floor to describe the destruction and push for funding for recovery efforts. In his Nov. 13 speech, the senator mentioned damage across the state, but said, "the seashore community was hit especially hard." "The boardwalk is the defining image of the New Jersey shore. Many of us remember walking on that boardwalk in wonderment of the attractions. The boardwalk has been a constant in the lives of those who live there or visit the shore. But for communities like Belmar, Seaside Heights, the Atlantic City, and others, much of that boardwalk no longer exists -- just the pillars where the boardwalk used to be, as we see it here," Lautenberg said as he showed a photograph of damage to a section of boardwalk in Atlantic City. "It was a magnificent boardwalk and had people in cars that were -- in wagons that were pushed along, and you would view the sea and the attractions on the other side. And it was painful to see the destruction of the part of the boardwalk in Atlantic City firsthand that day." Lautenberg’s spokesman, Caley Gray, pointed out the senator did reference "part" of the boardwalk in his speech, but the senator omitted a critical detail: the section of boardwalk in Atlantic City that the storm washed away was in disrepair and much of it had been scheduled for demolition. The main promenade that runs in front of the city’s casinos remains intact and open for business. "It is factually accurate that a portion of the boardwalk was destroyed by Sandy," said Jeff Guaracino, chief communications and strategy officer for Atlantic City Alliance, but "it’s not the boardwalk that the average person would typically associate with a visit to Atlantic City." Atlantic City Alliance, a nonprofit group focused on increasing tourism, has launched a campaign to dispel the rumor that the city’s famed boardwalk was destroyed. Guaracino said some media outlets, particularly television stations, cut from stock images of the oceanfront boardwalk to the destruction of the dilapidated promenade, leaving viewers with the impression the commercial section of the boardwalk had washed away. But the walkway destroyed by Sandy stood in a primarily residential neighborhood near the Absecon Inlet. That area of the boardwalk had been deteriorating for decades. Portions of it had collapsed well before the storm and were closed to pedestrians. Now, Keith Mills, the city’s director of planning and development, said what remains are a "couple of ramps, couple of stairways, but at this point they are ramps and stairways to nothing but a series of pilings in the water." But that’s not the case for the commercial stretch of the city’s boardwalk. Gray said in a statement that Lautenberg walked the boardwalk after the storm and surveyed the damage in the inlet section. "The main drag in Atlantic City was fortunate to not have sustained more damage," he said, adding that Lautenberg is working to secure federal funding to fully restore the state’s coastline. Our ruling Lautenberg said that because of Hurricane Sandy in Atlantic City, "much of that boardwalk no longer exists—just the pillars where the boardwalk used to be." The storm washed away a dilapidated section of Atlantic City’s boardwalk -- much of which had been scheduled for demolition -- that runs along the Absecon Inlet. So there’s an element of truth to Lautenberg’s claim. But the stretch of the boardwalk in front of the casinos -- the area most tourists associate with Atlantic City -- fared the storm well. Lautenberg’s speech ignored those important details, so we rate this claim Mostly False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-01963	Says 11 soccer players on the U.S. Men’s National Team are immigrants.	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/jun/19/nancy-pelosi/are-there-immigrants-2014-us-mens-world-cup-team/	The United States is officially overcome with World Cup fever, and its inhabitants are showing support for the red, white and blue in many ways. Of course, for congressmen and women it means backing America with their thumbs by tweeting pro-U.S.A. rally cries to their followers and constituents. While the quadrennial event has generally united Democrats and Republicans, not all the social media cheering was free of politics. After the United States’ thrilling 2-1 victory on June 16, 2014, over Ghana, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi made an immigration reform push by invoking the U.S. Men’s National Team. She tweeted: "Immigrants help drive America's success, even in the World Cup! Look at what #USMNT would be without them. #TimeIsNow." By Thursday evening, it had been retweeted and favorited almost 1,000 times. The below picture was included: As you can see, the graphic shows 11 U.S. players with minuses next to their pictures and names. Pelosi’s tweet reads that those 11 players are immigrants who would likely not be on the roster if they weren’t allowed in the country. Much has been made about the number of United States players who have dual citizenships, but is the U.S. World Cup team powered by immigrants? We went through the roster and researched the backgrounds of the 11 players highlighted in the graphic. Six of the players were actually born in America. So even though they may have parents who are from other countries, they are very much considered citizens, not immigrants. Jozy Altidore: Born in Livingston, N.J., to two Haitian-born parents. Alejandro Bedoya: Born in Englewood, N.J., to two Colombian-born parents Julian Green: Born in Tampa, Fla., to an American serviceman father and a German mother; moved to Germany with his mother as a young child. Tim Howard: Born in New Brunswick, N.J., to an African-American father and his Hungarian mother. Aron Johannsson: Born in Mobile, Ala., to Icelandic parents. Omar Gonzalez: Born in Dallas, Texas, to Mexican parents. The other five were not born in the United States but have at least one parent who is an American. (In four of the cases, their fathers were in the United States military serving abroad.) That entitles them to all to U.S. citizenship, meaning they did not have to go through the immigration process noncitizens do. John Brooks: Born in Berlin, Germany, to an American serviceman father and a German mother. Timmy Chandler: Born in Frankfurt, Germany, to an American serviceman father and a German mother. Mix Diskerud: Born in Oslo, Norway, to a Norwegian father and an American mother. Fabian Johnson: Born in Munich, Germany, to an American serviceman father a German-born mother who had an American father. Jermaine Jones: Born in Frankfurt, Germany, to an American serviceman father and German mother. So not only are none of these 11 individuals considered immigrants by the United States, they're all actually natural born citizens. Pelosi’s office told us the source of the graphic is a story posted on Business Insider from Global Post. The story noted that a number of far-right nationalist parties with anti-foreigner sentiments seem to be on the rise in Europe. Some countries are also considering anti-immigration legislation that would put stricter quotas on new inhabitants. Therefore, the author wanted to imagine what these teams would look like without immigrants. To do this, he singled out players with at least one foreign-born parent. As Vox’s Dara Lind points out, "That might make sense for other countries, where parentage is more important to citizenship. But it doesn't make any sense for the U.S., where nearly everyone has some sort of immigrant heritage, and where everyone born on U.S. soil is a citizen from birth." Basically, in some countries, it doesn’t matter if you were born there; citizenship is more closely tied to lineage. That’s not the case in America, one of a small number of countries that grants citizenship at birth. We took all of this to Pelosi’s office. Spokesman Drew Hammill said they weren’t claiming these players were immigrants, rather, "We’re merely echoing the point made by the creators of the graphic about the contributions of these sons of immigrants." But not even all of the foreign-born parents are actually immigrants. Timmy Chandler, for example, stayed in Germany with his German mother after he was born. So by no definition is the United States represented by immigrants at the World Cup in Brazil. That’s not to say immigrants or immigration aren’t important to the makeup and heritage of the team. The United States is a country built on immigrants, and every player on the team can trace back at least half their lineage to another country (there is one half Native American on the team, forward Chris Wondolowski). But that’s not the message Pelosi was trying to give with her tweet. If it was, you could have whited out the entire team. Our ruling In a tweet pushing immigration reform, Pelosi posted a picture of the U.S. Men’s National Team missing 11 of its players and tweeted "Immigrants help drive America's success, even in the World Cup! Look at what #USMNT would be without them." In this instance "them" means immigrants. But none of those 11 players are immigrants. Some aren’t even the children of immigrants.

pomt-14788	The Milwaukee County executive can sell the public "museum, the airport and the zoo" -- all on his own, without County Board approval	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2015/dec/03/chris-larson/can-milwaukee-county-executive-sell-airport-zoo-an/	The two Milwaukee Democrats sparring in the race for Milwaukee County executive are both busy talking about the incumbent, Chris Abele. The millionaire philanthropist, elected in 2011 to succeed Scott Walker, is touting his accomplishments -- claiming he balanced the county budget "without raising taxes five years in a row" (Half True), and that 1 million route-miles have been added to the bus system without a fare increase (Mostly True). Meanwhile, the leading challenger, state Sen. Chris Larson, has cast Abele as out of touch -- and too powerful. Larson, who was a member of the county Board of Supervisors before Abele took office, won election to the Senate in 2010 after defeating a Democratic incumbent. On the Nov. 22, 2015 "Upfront with Mike Gousha" public affairs TV show, Larson decried the power Abele he has gained at the expense of the County Board, which is essentially moving to part-time status as a result of a 2014 voter referendum. With the referendum, which Abele supported, salaries for the 18 County Board supervisors will be cut in half following the April 2016 elections. In addition, the supervisors’ health insurance will end and no additional pension benefits will be accrued. Gousha asked Larson whether a full-time County Board is better than a part-time board. Larson answered by making a claim we want to check, as well as a reference to rapper-producer Kanye West. "I do understand that there’s a lot of people who don’t like the County Board. I’d also understand that there’s people who don’t like Congress," Larson said. "The difference I have is that I don’t think we should abolish Congress, or abolish the legislative check and balance that we have in American-style democracy." Then Larson alluded to a recent change in state law that gives more power to the Milwaukee County executive, saying: "If anything, I think we've erred too far in giving all this power to one individual, including land sales. He has unilateral authority over the County Board -- or, the County Board has no oversight over land sales, including the museum, the airport and the zoo. That's just scary to think what he could do with that. And to paraphrase Kanye West: No one man should have all that power." So -- not that it's likely -- but does the Milwaukee County executive have the power, on his own, to sell the Milwaukee Public Museum, General Mitchell International Airport and the Milwaukee County Zoo. All without approval from the County Board? The law In July 2015, while making final adjustments to the 2015-’17 state budget, GOP lawmakers inserted a provision to eliminate the Milwaukee County Board’s oversight of sales of county-owned properties that are not zoned for park use. County Board members made power-grab allegations against Abele who, despite being a Democrat, has forged alliances with some Republicans. The budget provision helped clear the way for Abele to sell 10 acres of land that is envisioned as part of a downtown Milwaukee development coinciding with a new arena for the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team. Now to Larson’s claim. Under the change in state law, any sale of non-park land owned by Milwaukee County requires the approval of only one other person besides the county executive -- either the elected county comptroller or a real estate expert who lives in the community where the land is located and who does not hold public office. That expert is appointed by the Milwaukee County Intergovernmental Cooperation Council, which is made up of elected representatives from the various cities and villages in the county. In other words, the County Board doesn’t have a say, although the county executive alone couldn’t sell non-park land, such as the museum, the airport or the zoo. The county’s top attorney, Corporation Counsel Paul Bargren, confirmed in a memo to the County Board that county-owned land that isn’t zoned for parks can be sold without the board’s OK. "Specifically, the executive could lease, sell or convey any non-park county property regardless of board policy and without board approval," he wrote. Either the comptroller or the appointed real estate expert would have to determine that the sale "is in the best interests of the county." Bargren noted that counties are considered an arm of the state. And that the state Legislature can delegate or remove powers from county boards in all 72 counties and can, as it did in this case, treat one county differently than the others. "In effect, the Legislature has inserted itself in place of the (Milwaukee) County Board and, as a matter of county policy, has delegated administration of land sales and contracts and procurement to the executive," his memo says. Our rating Larson said the Milwaukee County executive can sell the public "museum, the airport and the zoo" -- all on his own, without County Board approval. A recent change in state law that applies only to Milwaukee County allows the executive to sell any county-owned land not zoned as park land without approval of the County Board. However, such sales would need the OK of at least one other person -- either the elected county comptroller or a real estate expert appointed by elected municipal officials who lives in the community where the land is located. We rate Larson’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-13758	"Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/22/donald-trump/trump-nearly-180000-illegal-immigrants-have-crimin/	Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump told the American public that beginning Jan. 20, 2017, safety will be restored. That means putting an end to violence and crime afflicting the nation, he said. There are immigrants in the country illegally who are out endangering communities, Trump added. "Nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens," Trump said in his nomination acceptance speech Thursday. We looked into that number to find out if that many convicted immigrants with deportations are out on the streets. Trump’s campaign said his statement came from a June 2016 report from the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors more strict immigration policies. The Center for Immigration Studies, in turn, relied on data obtained by the Senate Judiciary Committee. According to CIS, there were more than 925,000 immigrants who had been ordered removed but were still in the country as of July 2015. And an estimated 20 percent of them had at least one criminal conviction — nearly all of whom were at large. So Trump’s numbers are correct. But experts say there is some important context. Ana Gonzalez-Barrera, a senior researcher at Pew Research Center, said the figure includes immigrants from countries that won’t accept them back. "In these cases, the immigrants have to be released after they have completed their sentences," Gonzalez-Barrera said. And in yet other instances, state and local jurisdictions have passed policies limiting cooperation with immigration authorities so they don’t notify them when a deportable noncitizen has completed a jail term or prison sentence, said Michelle Mittelstadt, communications director of the Migration Policy Institute. Jennifer Elzea, spokeswoman for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, says ICE makes custody determinations on a case-by-case basis, "considering all the merits and factors of each case while adhering to current agency priorities, guidelines and legal mandates." "Those who are not subject to mandatory detention and do not pose a threat to the community may be placed on some form of supervision as an alternative to detention while awaiting their immigration court hearing," Elzea said. Still, Center for Immigration Studies points to a February 2016 ICE report showing that from fiscal year 2010 through July 21, 2015, 124 criminal immigrants released from ICE custody were subsequently charged with homicide-related crimes. Our ruling Trump said "nearly 180,000 illegal immigrants with criminal records, ordered deported from our country, are tonight roaming free to threaten peaceful citizens." According to federal data, 925,000 immigrants had been ordered removed but were still in the country as of July 2015. And an estimated 20 percent of them had at least one criminal conviction — nearly all of whom were at large. However, immigration officials say they make custody determinations on case-by-case basis and those who do not pose a threat to the community may be placed on some form of supervision as an alternative. Trump’s statement is accurate, but needs additional information, we rate it Mostly True. Update: We've added information from ICE saying they make custody determinations on a case-by-case basis. We also added a report showing that from fiscal year 2010 through July 21, 2015, 124 criminal immigrants released from ICE custody were subsequently charged with homicide-related crimes. Correction: A previous version of this post incorrectly said people seeking asylum and who do not appear before immigration judges are considered deported for criminal behavior. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/aa2fc627-324a-45ec-be8b-7632680d76c6	None	Donald Trump	None	None	None	2016-07-22T02:36:58	2016-07-21	['None']
pomt-12176	"Corporations have NEVER made as much money as they are making now."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/aug/01/donald-trump/have-corporations-never-made-much-money-now-donald/	In what has become a regular occurrence, Donald Trump took to Twitter to tout the nation’s economic performance on his watch. In a tweet on the morning of Aug. 1, 2017, Trump praised some of the commentary about the Trump-era economy on Fox & Friends: " ‘Corporations have NEVER made as much money as they are making now.’ Thank you Stuart Varney @foxandfriends Jobs are starting to roar,watch!" See Figure 4 on PolitiFact.com We thought the remark about corporate profits was worth a closer look. The White House did not respond to an inquiry. Are corporate profits higher now than ever? The details of this are a bit complicated given the fact that Trump is implying he deserves some credit. That’s because the most recent data is from January 2017, which predates Trump taking office. In January 2017, corporate profits totaled $1.81 trillion on an annualized basis, according to the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis. That’s the highest in history in raw dollars. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com But the high profits Trump is touting came during President Barack Obama’s tenure. And as we always point out in these cases, this is not due solely to Trump (or Obama). For better or for worse, presidents have a modest impact on the economy. Cyclical factors, the international economy, demographics and technology all play important roles, and they tend to be beyond the control of any president. Second, experts say measuring raw dollars is not as illustrative as analyzing corporate profits as a percentage of overall gross domestic product. That analysis, it turns out, paints Trump’s claim in a less impressive light. Corporate profits as a share of gross domestic product As the chart below shows, the January 2017 data point, while impressive, is far from unprecedented. That’s due in large part to the reality that the economy tends to grow over time, with corporate profits not necessarily outpacing the overall growth level. The current level of corporate profits as a share of GDP was exceeded once during Harry Truman’s presidency, five times under President George W. Bush, and a 14 times under President Barack Obama. In fact, that’s almost half of the quarters during Obama’s tenure (44 percent). See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com How important are corporate profits as an economic indicator? Now let’s take a step back. What do these numbers actually mean? Economists say that measuring corporate profits is useful -- up to a point. On the one hand, "prosperity is ordinarily good news for both business owners and workers," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. "It is certainly fair to cite high business profits as an indicator the economy is doing well." However, Burtless added that when corporate profits are historically high, they might be crowding out wage or salary increases for workers, which ends up curbing how widely the prosperity spreads through the rest of the economy. Economists offer divergent views on how stark this tradeoff is. Dan Mitchell, a scholar at the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed that "capital and labor compete for shares of income in the short run." Over the long term, however, "there is no tradeoff between corporate profits and labor income," he said. But Dean Baker, an economist with the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, countered that "high corporate profits are good for people who own lots of stock -- that’s about it." In fact, Baker said, the historical record suggests that high levels of investment -- in people and otherwise -- doesn’t necessarily move in tandem with high profits. Either way, one conclusion does seem clear: The share of the economy devoted to wages has been decreasing over the long term. Here’s a chart showing employee compensation as a share of gross domestic product since the end of World War II. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Trump tweeted that "corporations have NEVER made as much money as they are making now." In raw dollars, corporations are making more money as of January 2017 than ever before. It’s worth noting that the data isn’t in for a Trump-only quarter. And as a share of the broader economy, corporate profit levels are not unprecedentedly high -- in fact, for almost half of the quarters under Obama, the share was even higher.

pomt-12991	"Taxes for every New Yorker are lower today than when I started"	half-true	/new-york/statements/2016/dec/16/andrew-cuomo/most-taxes-are-lower-cuomo-was-elected/	Andrew M. Cuomo targeted high taxes when he announced his candidacy for New York governor. "We’re tired of seeing New Yorkers leave the state because they can’t pay their taxes anymore," Cuomo said at his May 2010 announcement. Now, more than halfway into his second term, Cuomo says he’s kept his promise to lower taxes. "I’ve spent less than every other governor and when you spend less you can cut taxes. Taxes for every New Yorker are lower today than when I started," Cuomo said during a recent speech in Fishkill. "Corporate taxes are down to the level they were at in 1968. Middle-class taxes are down to the level they were at in 1947. Manufacturing taxes are down to the level they were at in 1917." Is Cuomo right? Are taxes for every New Yorker lower? Personal income taxes Income taxes are lower for earners at all wage levels compared with 2010, according to the state Department of Budget. From the highest-income residents to couples earning less than about $40,000 annually, tax rates are lower, though not dramatically for the highest earners. A married couple making more than roughly $2.1 million is taxed at an 8.82 percent rate, down from 8.97 percent. In 2010, married couples making $500,000 were taxed at 8.97 percent. Now, married couples making between roughly $320,000 and $2.1 million are taxed at 6.85 percent. For couples earning less than about $40,000 annually, the tax rate has stayed the same since 2010, ranging from 5.9 percent to 4 percent for the lowest earners. The Department of Budget says deductions have increased for those earners despite the flat rate. Deductions have been indexed to inflation since Cuomo and the legislature passed new tax law in 2011. That means deductions should be larger for anyone in this wage category who earns the same amount in 2015 as in 2011. The same is true for single filers. The tax rate has decreased for anyone making more than about $20,000 annually. The rate has stayed the same for anyone making less than that, though deductions are indexed to inflation for these filers as well. Business income taxes Manufacturers were taxed on income at a rate of 5.9 percent in 2010. That same tax has now been reduced to 0 percent according to the Department of Budget. Manufacturers also receive a 20 percent real property tax credit if they own or lease property. Corporate taxes are also lower. In 2010, the corporate net income tax was 7.1 percent. Now, it’s 6.5 percent. Property taxes Property taxes statewide continue to rise despite a state imposed cap. Most municipalities are not able to raise property taxes more than 2 percent without voter approval. The Department of Budget says the property tax bill for a typical taxpayer is more than the state income tax amount. A report from the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy shows a resident's income level determines which tax hits the hardest. School taxes rose in the four years following the cap’s implementation in 2012, according to the Empire Center for Public Policy. School taxes are usually the largest part of a municipality’s property tax bill. The level of state aid to schools affects how much districts raise in property taxes. The rate at which these taxes increased is lower now than it was four years ago. Before the tax cap, the average property tax increase was 5.3 percent a year. The average increase was 2.2 percent in the first three years after the cap took effect, according to a report from the state. Sales tax The first 4 percentage points of sales taxes are levied by the state. Anything beyond that is levied by counties or cities. Increases in the local portion beyond 3 percent must be approved by the state Legislature and signed by the governor. The state portion of sales taxes has been unchanged since Cuomo took office. But the local portion has increased in seven counties, each time with state approval. The Essex County sales tax rate, for example, increased from 3.75 percent to 4 percent in 2013. Our ruling "Taxes for every New Yorker are lower today than when I started," Cuomo said during an event in Fishkill. If Cuomo had said income taxes for every New Yorker are now lower, he would have been right. It’s true that income taxes for individuals, corporations, and manufacturers are lower than when he took office in 2011. Although the Cuomo administration has slowed property tax growth through a state-imposed cap, property taxes continue to increase for residents. And the property tax takes a bigger bite than the income tax for many residents. Also, the state has also approved some sales tax increases at the county level since Cuomo took office.

pomt-04070	"Wind powers nearly 13 million homes across the country."	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2013/jan/23/jennette-gayer/environmental-group-makes-powerful-claim-about-win/	While some complained about the fine print in the fiscal cliff deal, a local environmental activist was pleased with one portion of the bill and said something about it that seemed worthwhile to fact-check. Environment Georgia policy advocate Jennette Gayer sent out a news release thanking federal lawmakers for continuing key tax credits for wind power. "Wind powers nearly 13 million homes across the country and states like Texas, the number one wind energy producer in the country, generate a little over 30 million (megawatt hours per year)," Gayer wrote. PolitiFact Georgia wondered about Gayer’s claim that wind powers nearly 13 million homes in the United States. Is that true? Gayer pointed us to a couple of websites she used to back up her claim. PolitiFact Georgia was on its way down the windy road of wind energy. The development of wind energy, harvested by wind turbines, began in the 1970s. It’s grown in the decades since, but it is still a very small amount (3 percent) of the energy that’s produced in the United States, federal officials and researchers say. President Barack Obama talked energetically about wind power on the campaign trail last year, saying it’s creating jobs and it is an important alternative energy source. Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney had no plans to continue the tax credits. In 1992, the federal government began offering tax credits to individuals and companies for wind energy production as part of the Energy Policy Act. For every kilowatt hour of power from wind, the government gives the producer a tax credit worth 2.2 cents. At the time, the U.S. had 1.5 gigawatts of installed wind capacity. A gigawatt is the equivalent of 1 billion watts of electricity. A standard light bulb uses 100 watts. Most of the nation’s wind energy is produced in Texas, the Plains states and the West Coast, analysts say. Very little comes from the South. "It’s less windy in the Southeast, so there’s not a lot of technology to generate that energy," said Eric Lantz, a research analyst with the federal government’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Some organizations, such as the Institute for Energy Research, call the tax credits a "boondoggle." The institute, citing a study by the American Tradition Institute, says the costs of wind power is more expensive than other forms of energy generation, such as coal, natural gas and nuclear energy. By 1999, federal officials say they saw an increase in wind capacity. The American Wind Energy Association, a prominent group that supports the expanded use of wind energy, reported this past August that the U.S. had reached the 50-gigawatt milestone. The association’s estimate is, Lantz said, about a year ahead of the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Lantz said he reviewed the EIA’s most recent numbers and believes the association’s 50-gigawatt claim is on target. So how many homes can 50 gigawatts power? Lantz looked at U.S. census data and other information on the EIA website. He concluded about 12 million homes. "I think their number is reasonable," Lantz said of Gayer’s estimate. EIA spokesman Jonathan Cogan agreed. The federal agency estimated the nation was on pace to generate anywhere from 125 million to 140 million kilowatts of wind energy in 2012. The average American home uses about 11,000 kilowatts of energy a year, Cogan said. "It seems to check out," Cogan told us. We wondered, though, whether that meant 12 million or so homes in the U.S. were actually being powered through wind energy. Lantz said there is no data detailing the number of homes that actually use wind energy. Some of that energy could be powering commercial or other nonresidential facilities. It’s not possible to say for sure how many homes actually use wind-generated electricity. But it is clear that there is enough produced to power millions of homes. To sum up, Environment Georgia analyst Jennette Gayer said wind powers about 13 million homes across America. From the people we interviewed and research we’ve seen, this claim seems to have some juice. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Jennette Gayer	None	None	None	2013-01-23T06:00:00	2013-01-02	['None']
pomt-13633	"In Catherine Cortez Masto's last term as attorney general, Nevada murder went up 11 percent, robbery went up 28 percent, rape 51 percent. When Cortez Masto left office, Nevada ranked as America's third most dangerous state."	mostly false	/nevada/statements/2016/aug/10/national-republican-senatorial-committee/ad-blaming-cortez-masto-crime-upticks-ag-too-narro/	Democratic Senate candidate Catherine Cortez Masto is taking fire from a new ad claiming crime increased in Nevada under her watch as attorney general. A new National Republican Senatorial Committee television ad (in both English and Spanish) blames the former state attorney general for increases in crime during her time in office. "In Catherine Cortez Masto's last term as attorney general, Nevada murder went up 11 percent, robbery went up 28 percent, rape 51 percent," the ad says. "When Cortez Masto left office, Nevada ranked as America's third most dangerous state." The ad seeks to undercut part of Cortez Masto’s résumé that her Senate campaign relies on, invoking her tough-on-crime record in tv ads and referring to herself as the state’s former "top law enforcement officer." The numbers are technically accurate, but the ad fails to prove what Cortez Masto had to do with them. Crunching crime stats The claims about increased mayhem trace back to a 2014 report of state crime numbers over the last decade, which overlaps with Cortez Masto’s eight years in the Attorney General’s office. The ad correctly reflects the statewide percentage increases over Cortez Masto’s last term (2011 to 2014): Reported murders increased from 151 to 168 (11.2 percent) Reported robberies increased from 4635 to 5,951 (28.4 percent) Reported rapes increased from 895 to 1,351 (50.94 percent) Cortez Masto’s campaign said focusing on the back half of her tenure as attorney general was misleading, and that crime actually went down during her time in office. Total crime decreased from Cortez Masto’s first year in office (116,814) to her last (92,376), and most major reported crimes with the exception of rape decreased over that eight-year period. (A spreadsheet of the cited crime figure is here) Bill Sousa, director of UNLV’s Center for Crime and Justice Policy, cautioned that criminologists should take heed of any crime upticks. However, he said, year-to-year crime statistics can be unreliably "volatile." "In terms of a couple of decades, a few years looking up isn’t evidence of a general trend," he said. The increase in reported rape is concerning, but there may be another explanation — the FBI broadened its definition of rape in 2012 (read more about the revision here). The bureau’s Uniform Crime Report saw subsequent increases in reported rape both nationally and in Nevada. Reported accounts of rape in Nevada have increased since the change in definitions, which was previously defined as "carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will." Plus, these figures only count the total crimes committed and aren’t adjusted for the roughly 300,000 population increase during Cortez Masto’s term. UNLV sociology professor Dr. Andrew Spivak said rates of murder, robbery and the previous "legacy" definition of rape per 100,000 people decreased under Cortez Masto’s tenure in office. Generally, experts say, Nevada’s crime numbers likely trend higher because of the state’s heavy reliance on the tourism industry bringing large numbers of people, which isn’t reflected in the state’s population. "If you could somehow control for tourism population, I’d expect that Nevada would drop on that list," Sousa said. NRSC spokesman Greg Blair said in an email that the ad focused on Cortez Masto’s second term to highlight her apparent political ambition outweighing other duties. That’s a serious charge, and there’s no concrete proof she had anything to do with the decline in crime in her first term or the subsequent increase in her second. Crime was at an historical low in 2011, and it’s hard to say why. The crime report itself cautions police agencies against drawing any conclusions about a specific department given the variety of factors that can affect crime trends. "Because of other assigned duties, the peculiar cycle of crime and clearances, and different community factors that normally affect crime statistics, no conclusions regarding individual departments should be made without consulting directly with the agency being analyzed," the report states. Spivak was more blunt. "I cannot even begin to imagine how states' attorneys general have much influence over crime rates," he said in an email. "I suppose some might think that an AG who establishes a culture of harsh prosecution and various law enforcement initiatives will theoretically deter future crime ... but the kind of data to establish such a link is just impossible to generate." Sousa said state-level crime policy is important, but changes in the raw numbers are more reliant on policing in individual neighborhoods and precincts. "A lot of what we know about crime occurs at a local level," Sousa said. "It points to the idea that what state-level policies do can have influence, can have an impact, but the impact is minimal." Danger, danger (High voltage!) Similarly, there is some truth that Nevada took the third spot in a ranking of the 10 most dangerous states. Again, however, it’s not proven what Cortez Masto had to do with it, and the source is not as credible as the FBI. The NRSC cites a list published in January 2015 from 24/7 Wall Street, a website that covers financial news. The list indeed ranks Nevada third, but the data relies on both crime data and socioeconomic factors, such as the poverty rate and the percentage of adults with a high school diploma. No attorneys general, in Nevada or elsewhere, play much of a role in setting educational policy or promoting programs to get people out of poverty. Other rankings of dangerous states are somewhat of a mixed bag, mainly due to differing methodology. Another list by Law Street called Nevada the second most dangerous state, but that blog based the ranking on violent crimes per 100,000 people. Another ranking from WalletHub puts Nevada as ninth most dangerous of 51 states (including Washington, D.C.) but with a more involved methodology than other surveys. Spivak said reading into the rankings to determine which states were dangerous is "utterly absurd," given variances in methodology and no standardization or weighted use of crime or socioeconomic indicators. Our ruling The NRSC ad says Nevada was ranked as the third most dangerous state by the time Cortez Masto left office, and that "murder went up 11 percent, robbery went up 28 percent, rape 51 percent" during her second term. The NRSC cherry-picks a handful of short-term crime statistics to portray Cortez Masto as weak on crime enforcement. But the argument is flawed. Experts agree that crime statistics are a crude way to measure safety, and Nevada has several quirks that inflate the numbers. The ad claims that Cortez Masto "couldn’t keep us safe," but crime statistics have more to do with local law enforcement agencies than the state's attorney general. The NRSC offers no proven link connecting her actions as attorney general to a swing in murder, robbery and rape. The statement contains an element of truth but leaves out important details.

pomt-09004	"Forty percent of the undocumented workers in this country" entered the U.S. legally and "overstayed their visa."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/jul/12/luis-gutierrez/democratic-rep-gutierrez-says-40-percent-illegal-i/	On the July 11, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, Rep. Luis Gutierrez, D-Ill. -- a champion of immigration legislation that includes a path to citizenship -- faced off with Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., a leading lawmaker who favors prioritizing immigration enforcement. At one point, Gutierrez said, "Here's the problem, and here's the fact that Mr. Bilbray leaves out of this debate. The fact is that 40 percent of the undocumented workers in this country didn't cross that border. They came here legally to the United States. They came on a tourist visa. They came on a student visa. They came on a temporary worker visa, and they overstayed their visa." We thought that statistic was worth a fact-check. Quantifying the number and nature of illegal immigrants is tricky -- precisely because they are evading law enforcement. But we located estimates made by the Pew Hispanic Center which the experts we interviewed consider credible. In a 2006 report, the center estimated that "nearly half of all the unauthorized migrants now living in the United States entered the country legally through a port of entry such as an airport or a border crossing point where they were subject to inspection by immigration officials." Specifically, the estimate ranged from 38 percent to 50 percent. The report split the difference by proposing a figure of 45 percent. So based on this measure, Gutierrez is accurate. In fact, he's being cautious, sticking to the low end of the spectrum. However, we'll offer two caveats. First, the data in this report, in addition to being an estimate, is several years old, so it's possible that the figures have changed. Second, the data for overstaying visas varies quite a bit between nationalities. The Pew report noted that only 16 percent of Mexican illegal immigrants who arrived prior to 1996 were in violation because they overstayed their visa. The comparable number for Central American immigrants was 27 percent, while the percentage for immigrants from the rest of the world was 91 percent. Granted, these statistics are even older than the ones cited above. However, the underlying reason for the disparity has not changed: Compared to other nationalities, it is still "easier for Mexicans to make illegal entries and harder for them to get visitor visas," as the report put it. A big reason, said Judith Gans, an immigration specialist at the University of Arizona, is that burden of proof is on visa-seekers to demonstrate to U.S. consular officials overseas that they won't be overstaying their visa, through such indicators as having a large family, a job and significant assets in their native country. As a result, she said, "Mexican middle-class people can get temporary visas such as tourist visas fairly easily. The same holds for middle-class Central and South Americans. Mexican poor people generally can’t obtain visas, nor can poor Central and South Americans." So one can argue that Gutierrez's decision to use the 40 percent figure in a televised discussion that focused on the U.S.-Mexico border is somewhat misleading, since viewers could be led to conclude -- incorrectly -- that 40 percent of Mexican or Latin American immigrants were simply overstaying their visa. But when we contacted Gutierrez's staff, they said that the distinctions across nationalities highlight exactly the point they were trying to make -- that politicians and the media are putting a disproportionate focus on U.S.-Mexico border crossings when in fact the illegal immigrant population, and the issues that follow, are much more diverse. "The opponents of immigration reform would like to keep the immigration issue focused on Latin America, the U.S.-Mexico border, and those who enter the U.S. without inspection, but that is only part of the story," said Gutierrez spokesman Douglas G. Rivlin. "The congressman's point when using this statistic was that the problem is bigger than the U.S.-Mexico border, bigger than Latin America, Latinos, or Arizona and therefore requires a more comprehensive, federal, national solution." In fact, Gutierrez made precisely that point on the show. Immediately after the quote we checked, he said, "So what we do is we continue to focus on the border as if that were the exclusive problem that we have with our immigration system and those staying here." Rivlin added that Gutierrez is sponsoring a bill (H.R. 4321) that would, among other things, establish an entry-and-exit system to track who enters on a temporary visa and whether they leave when they are supposed to. Reasonable people can disagree over whether Gutierrez is justified in arguing that the U.S.-Mexico border shouldn't be the focus of policymakers' attention on immigration. But the fact that he raised this issue when mentioning the visa-overstay statistics mitigates the potential for confusion. When that is weighed against the uncertainties over the age of the data and the need to use estimates rather than hard statistics, we rate his statement Mostly True.

pomt-08144	In Wisconsin, "6.2 percent of the population is black yet 24 percent of all state abortions are on African-Americans."	half-true	/wisconsin/statements/2010/dec/06/pro-life-wisconsin/pro-life-wisconsin-says-african-americans-make-abo/	Using 13 billboards in Milwaukee, Pro-Life Wisconsin says it wants to raise awareness of what it calls the disproportionate abortion rate among African-American women in Wisconsin. According to the organization, which works to outlaw abortion, the billboards appeared Nov. 29, 2010, and will stay up for 30 days. They feature one of two messages: "Black children are in danger" or "Black & Beautiful." Each billboard shows a picture of an African-American infant and lists a website -- TooManyAborted.com/WI. That website, and an announcement about the billboards issued by Pro-Life Wisconsin, make the same claim: In Wisconsin, "6.2 percent of the population is black, yet 24 percent of all state abortions are on African-Americans." On the face of it, that seems like a large disparity. And it suggests race is a determining factor in abortion rates. We decided to take a look. Pro-Life Wisconsin’s claim is based on figures cited by the Georgia-based Radiance Foundation, which is co-sponsoring the Milwaukee billboards. The foundation accurately cites U.S. Census figures on the percentage of Wisconsin’s population that is African-American, and the state’s annual abortion report on the percentage of Wisconsin abortions that are performed on African-American women. But in doing so, it is setting up a false comparison. It compares the number of abortions obtained by black women to the entire black population. Obviously, only females in a certain age range can become pregnant. Nationally, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looks at abortions by comparing the number each year per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44. The most recent CDC figures show the national rate abortion rate generally declined between 1997 and 2006. But the 2006 rate of 16.1 abortions per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44 was up 3.2 percent over the previous year. The abortion rate for black women, meanwhile -- 33.4 abortions per 1,000 black women ages 15 to 44 -- was more than twice the overall rate. Abortion rates for black women have been higher for years, "and have been attributed to high unintended pregnancy rates," according to the CDC. In making its claim, Pro-Life Wisconsin is suggesting that race is somehow the determining factor in people seeking an abortion. Experts say there are many other factors at play. Like the CDC, Jacquelyn Paykel, an OB/GYN at the Medical College of Wisconsin, points to the higher unintended pregnancy rate among black women. She said unintended pregnancies tend tend to occur among women with less education, lower socioeconomic status and less access to reproductive health care. And those factors are more likely to be present among black women, she said. So, the construction of the statement can lead to another false impression. Now, on to the Wisconsin figures, which are more current than the national ones. In Wisconsin, the estimated overall abortion rate for 2009 was seven abortions per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44 -- less than half of what national figures have shown. The rate was the same in 2008, according to the state’s annual abortion report. That report doesn’t provide statistics by race for the 15-to-44 age group. But we were able to make calculations, for 2009, using abortion and population statistics from the Wisconsin Department of Health Services: 88.3 percent of the women ages 15 to 44 in Wisconsin were white and white women accounted for 69 percent of the abortions performed in the state. 7.5 percent of the 15-to-44 women were African-Americans and African-Americans accounted for 24 percent of the abortions. Using this approach, which focuses on child-bearing years, the disparity among black women isn’t quite as large as what Pro-Life Wisconsin stated. We asked the group, which is based in the Milwaukee suburb of Brookfield, the purpose of the billboards. They are located mainly on Milwaukee’s north and northwest sides, the areas of the city where the largest numbers of African-Americans live. Spokeswoman Virginia Zignego said the organization wants to publicize the disparity in the abortion rate among black women and highlight abortion alternatives such as adoption. The website listed on the billboards, which is run by the Radiance Foundation, mentions adoption, but most of the material criticizes Planned Parenthood and other organizations. Zignego said the campaign also aims to show that Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin is racist because it locates many of its facilities -- some of which perform abortions -- in areas with the heaviest concentrations of African-Americans. Amanda Harrington, spokeswoman for Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, said its services are geared toward pregnancy prevention -- and its sites are in areas where women need access to health care. Let’s return to the claim itself. The group accurately stated cited census and abortion numbers. But it used an approach that takes in the entire African-American population, not just women between age 15 and 44 -- the approach used by federal and Wisconsin authorities. By that measure, the actual disparity is smaller than what Pro-Life Wisconsin claimed. The group’s claim also leaves out important details -- namely, that socioeconomic factors, rather than race, have been identified as key contributors to the higher abortion rate among black women.

pomt-10802	"I don't think that Rudy or Fred or John McCain support the marriage amendment."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/oct/05/mitt-romney/hes-right-that-others-have-hedged-/	In an interview on MSNBC, Romney tried to turn the tables on his Republican rivals -- who have accused him of flip-flopping on various issues -- by saying he was more consistent on gay marriage than they have been. He said, "I don't think that Rudy (Giuliani) or Fred (Thompson) or John McCain support the marriage amendment. And I think they're in error on that one." Indeed, Romney is the only Republican front-runner unequivocally backing a constitutional gay marriage ban. Giuliani, Thompson and McCain share his opposition to same-sex marriage but they vary in how they would address the issue at the federal level. Romney is the only Republican front-runner to support an amendment to the Constitution, such as the one that failed in Congress last year, which would limit marriage to male-female unions. McCain, who actively opposed the 2006 amendment attempt on the grounds that it was unnecessary and would violate states' rights, says that he would only support such an amendment if the Supreme Court began to strike down state-level gay marriage bans. Thompson has proposed a constitutional amendment that would not ban gay marriages, but would free states from the obligation to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. That provision was included in the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which Thompson and McCain both supported, but it is still being challenged in the courts. A constitutional amendment would preempt any judicial challenge to the existing law. A spokesman for Giuliani said the former mayor "does not support a federal marriage amendment at this time." Giuliani told CNN's Larry King in February 2007 that he would not support a constitutional amendment, "unless all of a sudden lots of states do what Massachusetts does and kind of come at it from the other side and decide that the Constitution says that -- that you cannot have marriage between a man and a woman. If it stays the way it is, you don't need one." We find Romney's statement on his opponents to be True because he is accurately describing their positions.

pomt-15375	Texas has "the nation's highest rate and highest number of uninsured."	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/jul/01/donna-howard/donna-howard-says-texas-no-1-uninsured-residents-a/	An Austin legislator stressed the number of Texans who lack health coverage after applauding the U.S. Supreme Court for upholding federal subsidies under the Obamacare law. On a positive note, Democratic state Rep. Donna Howard said in a June 25, 2015, press release that the share of uninsured Texans has decreased thanks to more people buying insurance, some with help from the subsidies written into Affordable Care Act of 2010. Now, she said, the Republican-led state should act to draw more federal money to insure more residents—perhaps a reference to Texas’ refusal so far to expand Medicaid to more adults with the federal government initially picking up costs. Inaction, Howard said, "has only left Texas with the nation's highest rate and highest number of uninsured." Whatever the reasons, does Texas lead the nation in its uninsurance rate and its count of uninsured residents? That wasn’t so before. In 2013, we rated Mostly False a declaration by Rep. Garnet Coleman, D-Houston, that Texas had the nation’s most uninsured people, 6 million. As of 2011, then the latest year of survey data, Texas led the nation with its 24 percent share of uninsured residents. But more-populous California was home to about 1 million more uninsured residents. Also in 2013, we found True a claim that Texas had the most uninsured children. In 2012. According to federal survey results, Texas ranked first nationally with 1.1 million uninsured children, followed by California with 891,000. California is among states, unlike Texas, that expanded Medicaid access in accord with the Obamacare law. It stands to reason its uninsured population consequently shrunk. Another post-2013 factor: Key provisions of the Obamacare law—including the mandate that most Americans obtain coverage and the offer of subsidies for individuals to buy insurance—took effect in 2014, likely affecting who has a policy. Texas No. 1 in rate of uninsured Texas has evidently continued to rank No. 1 for its share of uninsured residents. To our inquiry, Scott Daigle, Howard’s chief of staff, noted by email a June 23, 2015, Austin American-Statesman story citing a national survey by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stating Texas had a higher percentage of uninsured adults in 2014 than any other state. Nearly 26 percent of Texas adults were uninsured, the story said, down from about 28 percent in 2013. We wondered about all residents of the states at issue. Separately, the Kaiser Family Foundation, drawing on U.S. Census Bureau survey results, keeps up with how many residents of each state have health coverage. Its latest charts indicate that per the bureau’s 2013 Current Population Survey, Texas and Nevada were tied for No. 1 that year with 20 percent of residents lacking coverage. At the time, according to the survey, 15 percent of California residents lacked coverage. In raw numbers, 5,769,600 Californians were uninsured, compared with 5,357,700 Texans, according to the survey. We also reached out to bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein who suggested by email we consider its American Community Survey results for 2013, the latest available, indicating 22 percent of Texans and 17 percent of Californians were uninsured that year. According to this survey, Nevada had the nation’s No. 2 uninsurance rate, nearly 21 percent. In raw numbers, the survey suggested, 6.5 million Californians lacked coverage compared to more than 5.7 million Texans. California vs. Texas in uninsured residents In question: Whether California kept its raw-total lead in uninsured residents through 2014. Doesn’t seem so, experts told us, because far fewer Californians continued to lack coverage through the year, causing Texas to end up No. 1 for its uninsured rate and total residents without insurance. However, we fell short of landing governmental confirmation of such a shift. Responding to our request for backup information, Daigle in Howard’s office emailed us a link to a September 2014 Rice University press release stating Texas "has now surpassed California to become the state with the highest number of uninsured residents." But the related report, from Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy and the Episcopal Health Foundation, said only that Texas has "potentially surpassed" California in its uninsured count. According to quarterly surveys of Texans undertaken by the researchers, an additional nearly 379,000 Texans aged 18 to 64 had health coverage after the first Obamacare enrollment period, reducing uninsurance rates among such adults from 25 percent in September 2013 to 22 percent in May 2014. An April 2015 follow-up report by the institute and foundation said that thanks to more adults obtaining coverage, the share of uninsured Texans aged 18-64 as of March 2015 had dropped even more to 17 percent. The report said: "Despite this progress, Texas remains the state with the highest percentage of uninsured residents and, for the first time, Texas now has the largest number of uninsured residents." That report did not say how the researchers decided California no longer had the most uninsured. By email to our inquiry, co-author Elena Marks told us an undated web post on Wallethub.com, a personal finance website, fueled the conclusion. After the Obamacare law took effect, she noted, WalletHub projected that 14.26 percent of Californians and 24.81 percent of Texans lacked coverage. WalletHub also said its estimates were limited to beneficiaries under 64 years of age. Those state-by-state percentages, according to WalletHub’s post, were calculated in part from a June 2014 Kaiser Family Foundation look into insurance sign-ups during the first Obamacare enrollment period, which WalletHub described as "the best estimate to date of the proportion of private health plan enrollees under Obamacare who previously lacked health insurance and therefore would be gaining coverage under the new law." Marks told us the Texas researchers multiplied the WalletHub projections by each state’s population to estimate that more than 6.8 million Texans and 5.5 million Californians were uninsured once the Obamacare law had rolled into place. Other analysts Seeking other perspectives, we queried experts including Paul Fronstin of the Washington, D.C.-based Employee Benefit Research Institute, which says its mission is to enhance the development of public policy through objective research and education. In 2012, Fronstin wrote that the year before, California had the largest number of people under age 65 without health insurance of any state, at 7.1 million. But he also wrote that with Obamacare taking effect, the western state’s share of uninsured adults would likely drop. As it was, Fronstin told us at the time, his analysis of bureau research released in March 2012 showed more Californians than Texans were lacking coverage. That also held in Fronstin’s latest analysis, published in 2013, which said that nationally in 2010-12, Texas and California were among 14 states with 20 percent or more of residents lacking insurance. California had an average of 7 million uninsured non-elderly residents, according to a chart in the report, outpacing other states including No. 2 Texas, which averaged 6.1 million uninsured non-elderly. Still, those counts reflected conditions before the Obamacare law took fuller effect. By email, Fronstin told us this month that he believes California no longer leads the nation in uninsured residents, likely due to more people there taking advantage of coverage options thanks to the state expanding Medicaid and residents otherwise buying insurance with the subsidies offered thanks to the Obamacare law. Fronstin pointed out Gallup polls taken through 2014 indicating Texas that year had the nation’s greatest share of uninsured adults (24.4 percent) for the seventh straight year. That was a slight improvement from the 27 percent rate Gallup gauged in 2013. From 2013 to 2014, per Gallup’s results, California’s adult uninsurance rate fell from 21.6 percent to 15.3 percent. We considered multiplying the 2014 Gallup percentages by federal population estimates to approximate the number of uninsured adults in each state. But Howard referred to all uninsured residents. We sought the same broad focus. On this front, Anne Dunkelberg of the Austin-based Center for Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for programs serving low-income Texans, guided us to a June 23, 2015, report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention stating that according to its surveys undertaken through 2014, 11.5 percent of all Americans were uninsured. Also, a chart in the report indicates 19.4 percent of all Texans were uninsured at the time they were interviewed while 12 percent of Californians reported no coverage. We multiplied these percentages over July 2014 Census Bureau population estimates for each state, reaching estimates of 5.23 million uninsured Texans in 2014 and 4.66 million uninsured Californians. Next, we reached Gerald "Jerry" Kominski, director of UCLA’s Center for Health Policy Research, who said by phone that results of its 2014 survey indicating the number of uninsured Californians at that time were to be released later this summer. Kominski otherwise said our calculation using the CDC study and federal population estimates seemed reasonable. "California has been very successful in reducing the number of uninsured," Kominski said, "because of its aggressive promotion of the Affordable Care Act." We also ran our calculation by the Kaiser foundation. Researcher Rachel Garfield cautioned by phone against reaching conclusions by making calculations using figures from different sources. Generally, she said, data is not yet available to assess how many people were uninsured in each state in 2014 though the census bureau is expected to release relevant survey results in September 2015. Our ruling Howard said Texas is No. 1 in its uninsurance rate and its total uninsured residents. Texas leads the nation in its percentage of uninsured. Also, it newly looks like Texas has the greatest raw number of uninsured residents, though that’s evidently backed up only by rough calculations like our own, a clarification missing from this claim. We rate Howard’s claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-01055	"Our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/21/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-unemployment-rate-now-lower-fina/	A significant theme of President Barack Obama’s 2015 State of the Union address was that the United States economy has come back from the brink. One of the metrics he used to make this claim was unemployment rate. During his address, Obama said that "our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis." We decided to check whether that’s correct. The most recent reported monthly unemployment rate was 5.6 percent for December 2014. The last time it was that low was in June 2008, when it was also 5.6 percent. The financial crisis occurred after June 2008 -- it’s generally dated to the implosion of the Wall Street firm Lehman Brothers in September 2008. So Obama clearly has a point. That said, there are a few caveats. First, while we have no quarrel with Obama using the most basic version of the unemployment rate, it’s worth mentioning that there’s another version of the unemployment rate, known as U-6, that isn’t as favorable to the president’s case. The U-6 statistic tries to capture a broader picture of labor-market weakness than the more familiar unemployment rate. It takes into account not just people who are unemployed but also people working part-time who would rather have full-time work, as well as people who have stopped looking for work but would begin to look again if labor-market conditions improved. Because it includes these additional factors, the U-6 rate tends to track the official unemployment rate but is usually a few points higher. As it happens, the U-6 rate -- unlike the more basic unemployment rate -- hasn’t returned to its pre-financial-crisis level. The December 2014 U-6 rate was 11.2 percent, which is higher than the 11 percent rate in September 2008 and the 10.8 percent rate one month earlier in August 2008. Second, while economists cheer the clear improvement in the basic unemployment rate, they also fret that a portion of that improvement stems from Americans leaving the labor market rather than finding jobs after experiencing joblessness. (The unemployment rate can improve either if someone goes back to work, or if they leave the labor market entirely.) A way to measure this is by looking at a statistic called the labor force participation rate, which measures the number of people in the labor force divided by the civilian, noninstitutionalized population. The labor force shrinks whenever someone retires, voluntarily gives up working (such as when they become a full-time parent or go back to school full-time) or because they simply give up hope of finding a job. The labor force participation rate has decreased markedly since 2008. In September 2008, it stood at 66.0 percent, but that fell to 62.7 percent by December 2014, the most recent month available. It’s now at its lowest point since the late 1970s, a time when fewer women were working. Part of this is explained by the retirement of the large Baby Boom generation, but not all -- and the trendline worries many economists. So Obama has justification for celebrating the unemployment rate’s decline, but it’s worth remembering that that’s not the only important labor-market statistic out there. Our ruling Obama said "our unemployment rate is now lower than it was before the financial crisis." He’s correct when using the basic unemployment rate -- the most commonly cited figure -- but it’s worth noting that other measures of the labor market are not quite so rosy. The unemployment rate may be dropping, if only in part, because people have stopped looking for work. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2015-01-21T01:16:44	2015-01-20	['None']

pomt-12404	"I’m proud to say that under my administration, as you just heard, we will be building the first new heavy icebreakers the United States has seen in over 40 years."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/may/24/donald-trump/trump-goes-bit-overboard-icebreaker-claim/	President Donald Trump told new graduates of the Coast Guard Academy that his administration is working hard to make the military branch’s job easier. In his speech at the academy’s commencement on May 17, Trump said his administration will be investing in icebreakers in a way the country hasn’t done in a while. "I’m proud to say that under my administration, as you just heard, we will be building the first new heavy icebreakers the United States has seen in over 40 years," Trump said. Trump’s statement suggested his administration was the driver behind this project. He’s right about the four-decade gap, but it takes a long time to build a big ship (it’s just one -- not plural as he said) and the plan for this ship has been underway for some time. Assessing the fleet An icebreaker can carve a path through thick sheets of ice in frozen regions of the world or to access research stations in the Arctic. The bigger the ship, the thicker the ice it can handle. The United States has just one active heavy polar icebreaker, the Polar Star, which entered service in 1976. At a speed of 3 knots it can break through ice as thick as 21 feet. A similar ship was mothballed after its engined died in 2010 In addition to the Polar Star, the country has medium icebreaker, Healy, and the National Science Foundation operates a small icebreaker named Palmer. The construction of a new, heavy icebreaker would indeed be the first for the United States in four decades, said Magnus Nordenman, director of the Transatlantic Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council’s Brent Scowcroft Center on International Security. In the works for a few years Trump left out a key fact: The process of building a new heavy icebreaker for the Coast Guard began before he took office. The U.S. Coast Guard told us the work began in earnest during President Barack Obama’s second term. "The time needed to build a new icebreaker can anywhere be between 5 to 10 years," said Sherri Goodman, a former defence official and senior fellow with the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. The Coast Guard included it in its 2012-13 budget submission, according to the Congressional Research Service. The project received about $15.6 million through FY 2016. In FY 2017, Congress gave the Coast Guard $25 million to manage the project and $150 million went to the Navy to start the design and construction process. Right now, actual building is slated to start in 2020 and if all goes well, the ship will launch in 2023. Our ruling Trump said, "I’m proud to say that under my administration, as you just heard, we will be building the first new heavy icebreakers the United States has seen in over 40 years." He has a point that the heavy icebreaker being built is the first since the 1970s. If all goes according to schedule, construction will begin in 2020 with delivery in 2023. That puts the building phase within his first term, but as with any large project, the timeline can slip. Regardless, this has been an ongoing project that has been receiving funding from the government since 2013. Trump’s statement implied that the efforts to build the icebreaker came from his administration when in fact it was already in progress before he took office. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-00668	"Once again, a police officer has been killed with an illegal gun from Georgia – a state that last year did the NRA’s bidding and weakened its already lax gun laws."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2015/may/12/everytown-gun-safety/advocacy-group-overreaches-claim-nypd-shooting/	The fatal shooting of New York City police officer Brian Moore has the advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety again taking aim at Georgia and its gun laws. "Once again, a police officer has been killed with an illegal gun from Georgia -- a state that last year did the NRA’s bidding and weakened its already lax gun laws," Megan Lewis, the group’s vice president, said in a May 6 press release.. Moore, 25, was shot in the face May 2 and died two days later. Police took a convicted felon into custody 90 minutes after the shooting and later said the suspect’s weapon was one of 23 guns reported stolen in a break-in at Little’s Bait, Tackle & Pawn in Perry, south of Macon, in October 2011. Nine of those 23 stolen guns have since turned up at New York crime scenes, including the silver Taurus .38-caliber revolver seized in connection with Moore’s slaying, NYPD officials said. But have there been other police officers killed by illegal guns traced to Georgia as Everytown for Gun Safety’s statement suggests? PolitiFact decided to check. First a little background. Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and gun-control advocate Shannon Watts, contends that stolen and illegally trafficked firearms are making their way to cities such as New York from Georgia and other states, especially in the South, that have lax gun laws via the so-called "iron pipeline." Erika Soto Lamb, the group’s communications, said Everytown for Gun Safety can back up the statement. As evidence, she pointed to the killings of two NYPD police officers last December in a rampage by a convicted felon. The suspect was using a gun that was first sold legally by Arrowhead Pawn Shop in Jonesboro, she said. We asked: Is it fair to say that’s "an illegal gun from Georgia?" "The shooter in that event was a convicted felon -- which means he should not have been in possession of a gun and which makes that an illegal gun," she wrote in an email.. Tracing and tracking firearms The job of tracing guns falls to the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the only agency authorized to track firearms made in the United States and abroad when law enforcement agencies request help. Police recover guns in various ways – as part of a criminal investigation, during regular patrols and even in buyback events. They can submit requests to the ATF’s National Tracing Center to track a weapon’s history, said ATF Agent Charles J. Mulham, the public information officer for the Bureau’s New York field division. Because a gun’s history can become evidence in a trial, the records are not public unless the requesting agencies disclosing them. The New York Police Department submitted such a request following the shooting of Moore in Queens. It later made the findings public in a press conference. Without required public disclosure of the trace records, the question of whether additional illegal guns from Georgia were used in the shooting deaths of other New York City cops becomes fuzzy to answer. Federal law requires only that guns stolen or lost from licensed gun dealers be reported to the ATF. The District of Columbia and another 10 states – including New York and neighboring New Jersey and Connecticut – require private citizens to report the theft or loss of at least some handguns or weapons. Georgia has no such requirement. That means those who aspire to make money by selling hard-to-come-by firearms in New York City for profit could, in theory, not even bother to steal them in Georgia. They could buy them here, sell them for high mark-ups in New York and, if the trace came back to a legal purchase, possibly face no penalty if they claimed the weapons had been stolen but not reported, Mulham said. In other words, it’s a tricky definition to term a gun "illegal" given the patchwork of state laws that govern their purchase. That complicates the definition of the gun used in the December shooting deaths of New York City officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos That gun, a Taurus 9 mm, was bought legally in 1996 from the Jonesboro pawn shop, said NYPD Lt. John Grimpel. The weapon’s history then becomes murky before convicted felon Ismaaiyl Brinsley ended up with it and shot the officers as they sat in their patrol car. It was illegal for Brinsley to have the gun, given restrictions on ownership by felons as well as New York law making it illegal for anyone to have a handgun without a permit. But the gun itself was officially legal because it was legally purchased. That history was uncovered when NYPD requested the gun be traced after the shootings. "After 1996, the whereabouts of the gun were unknown, until December 2014 when it was used in the murders of officers Ramos and Liu," Grimpel said. Our conclusion Police have seized a gun stolen from Georgia nearly four years ago and believe it was used in the recent, tragic shooting death of a young NYPD officer. But Everytown For Gun Safety overreaches in suggesting that an earlier fatal shooting of two officers involved an "illegal gun from Georgia." That weapon was sold according to federal law and therefore legal, until it found its way to someone who used it to commit a horrific crime. Such overreaches allow political debate to shape facts. We rate the statement Mostly False.	None	Everytown for Gun Safety	None	None	None	2015-05-12T00:00:00	2015-05-06	['Georgia_(U.S._state)']
pomt-07862	Foreign Trade Zones allow U.S. "land to be inhabited by Chinese communists -- communists straight from China! They are to set up little towns and live here."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/feb/09/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-foreign-trade-zones-are-chines/	In recent weeks, we’ve received a number of requests from readers to check a chain e-mail about Free Trade Zones. The full chain e-mail is too long to print, but you can read the full version here. Following is an excerpt: "This is an urgent message! Read this and spread the word! Subject: Foreign Trade Zones. This is unbelievable at first, but you will soon realize that there are several motives for the global communists to physically weave our United States territory together with communist China. Read On! Here's what is going on! "Each and every one of our state governors has approved and allocated a certain amount of acres of their U.S. state land to be inhabited by Chinese communists -- communists straight from China! They are to set up little towns and live here, supposedly for the purpose of producing Chinese products for sale in the U.S.A. The land the states are giving them for their little towns will be considered "foreign territory"!!! We are told that the laws of the state (in which these Chinese communists dwell) will apply to the communist Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ). Comment: If so, why are they allowed in here!??! Isn't the whole set up unlawful??? There are 257 of these little communist towns to be built all over the United States." There’s a lot to check in this excerpt, and even more in the parts we didn’t reprint. To keep to a reasonable length, we will only look at one part of it -- the idea that Foreign Trade Zones allow "land to be inhabited by Chinese communists -- communists straight from China! They are to set up little towns and live here." First, a little background about Foreign Trade Zones. In the United States, foreign-trade zones, or FTZs, date to a 1934 act of Congress. FTZs are secure areas located in or near U.S. Customs ports of entry but legally considered to be outside the Customs territory for the purpose of tariff laws and Customs entry procedures. Certain types of merchandise can be imported into the zones without paying import duties or excise taxes. Once there, the merchandise can be stored, assembled, sorted, processed or otherwise manufactured. But duties are paid only when the merchandise is transferred outside the zone and into the U.S. for sale or use. According to the federal board that oversees FTZs, the idea is to improve U.S. competitiveness by encouraging companies to maintain operations in the U.S. FTZs give foreign companies a good reason to locate here and thus use U.S. labor, services and materials. (U.S. companies, for their part, can use FTZs in many other countries around the world, with similar benefits.) So now let’s look at some of the claims in the e-mail. The idea that these "little towns will be considered ‘foreign territory’" is false. Aside from tax and tariff rules, FTZs must conform to U.S. laws, not those of the foreign country of the companies operating within them. Meanwhile, the notion that the "motive" behind FTZs is to "physically weave our United States territory together with communist China" is ridiculous. Not only are FTZs part of U.S. territory rather than that of a foreign country, but they were signed into law a full 15 years before the Communist Party took over the Chinese government. Most important for our fact check, it is false to say that Chinese communists "are to set up little towns and live here, supposedly for the purpose of producing Chinese products for sale in the U.S.A." If you look at the act governing FTZs, it reads: "No person shall be allowed to reside within the zone except Federal, State, or municipal officers or agents whose resident presence is deemed necessary by the Board." Nothing has changed that portion of the law in the nearly eight decades since. A fact sheet from the U.S. Commerce Department confirms that the "FTZ Act prohibits residence within a zone." So let’s sum up. Whatever one thinks of the policy benefits of FTZs, the idea put forth by the chain e-mail -- that Foreign Trade Zones allow "land to be inhabited by Chinese communists -- communists straight from China! They are to set up little towns and live here" -- is wrong. FTZs are U.S. territory, and subject to U.S. laws, in every way except for certain tax and duty laws, and in any case, "Chinese communists," and almost everyone else, are barred by law from residing in them. The e-mail takes a longstanding part of U.S. law and turns it into a communist plot to take over the country. We consider that ridiculous, and rate it Pants on Fire!

pomt-11770	The GOP tax plan "Sabotages the health care of 13 MILLION Americans."	half-true	/california/statements/2017/nov/29/nancy-pelosi/pelosis-problematic-claim-gop-tax-plan-sabotages-h/	Many Democrats in Congress describe the GOP tax plan as a scheme to benefit the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. In recent weeks, their attacks have been expanded to say it would take away or damage health care for millions of Americans. That particular criticism started after Senate Republicans added a provision to their tax overhaul bill that would eliminate the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate — the requirement that Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty. GOP Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has expressed concern over the inclusion of this provision in the tax bill, which needs approval from nearly all Republican senators to pass. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was the latest Democrat to lodge a comparable criticism of the bill. The GOP tax plan "Sabotages the health care of 13 MILLION Americans," Pelosi’s political team wrote on Twitter on Nov. 27, 2017 as part of a longer list of criticisms of the bill. PolitiFact New York and The Washington Post have fact-checked similar statements by Democratic leaders about the bill's impact on health care. They found those claims were partially accurate but ignored key facts. We’ll take a look at those and rate Pelosi’s statement. Similar claims Earlier this month, PolitiFact New York rated Half True the claim by Democratic New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo: Congressional Republicans "want to take health care from millions of Americans in order to pay for" a tax bill. It found Cuomo had a point: Ending the individual mandate would result in an estimated 13 million fewer Americans with health coverage by 2027, according to the Congressional Budget Office analysis. Pelosi’s spokesman pointed to the same CBO report when PolitiFact California asked for evidence backing up the congresswoman’s claim. In its analysis, however, PolitiFact New York pointed out that ending the individual mandate isn’t the same thing as stripping away health insurance for a large number of Americans. While some would lose access to health insurance due to increased premiums, many others would drop their coverage voluntarily. The Washington Post Fact Checker, meanwhile, gave Two Pinocchios — which it describes as its Half True rating — to Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer when he said, "We’re kicking 13 million people off health insurance to give tax cuts to the wealthy." The Post described the first part of Schumer’s statement as "problematic." "CBO, in estimating the impact of repealing the individual mandate, is mostly describing a voluntary action of people choosing not to buy health insurance. That’s not the same as "kicking off" 13 million people. Granted, some people may feel they don’t have a choice because their premiums increased. Senate Democrats need to more accurately describe the CBO report," the Post concluded. Sabotage? Pelosi, through her political team’s tweet, claims the GOP tax plan "sabotages" the health care of 13 million Americans. We took this to mean it intentionally strips health care from millions. If healthy people leave the individual market, premiums will go up for the remaining and sicker enrollees. That could force some people to drop their plans due to cost. But, as with the claims from Cuomo and Schumer, the statement from Pelosi and her staff ignores the fact that a large portion of the 13 million people would voluntarily drop their plans and would not see a direct health impact. PolitiFact New York cited research from RAND Corp. that estimated roughly two-thirds of disenrollment would stem from voluntary choices and one-third would be involuntary. Other research has put the percentage at about 50-50, said Linda Blumberg, a health policy specialist at the Urban Institute. Our ruling Nancy Pelosi recently claimed the GOP tax plan "Sabotages the health care of 13 MILLION Americans." She has a partial point: Senate Republicans have proposed eliminating the ACA’s requirement that all Americans have health insurance or pay a penalty. By getting rid of this, the CBO estimates 13 million fewer people would have insurance a decade from now. Many would voluntarily leave the individual health care marketplace, driving up premiums for those who remain, forcing some who want to keep their insurance to drop it. But like other top Democrats, Pelosi left out much of the story. "Sabotaged" just doesn’t fit for the two-thirds of those researchers say would leave voluntarily. PolitiFact New York and The Washington Post examined similar claims and rated them the equivalent of Half True. They were partially accurate but omitted key information. We agreed with their assessments. We also rate Pelosi’s claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

pomt-13642	Says in 2012 "Obama won in every state that did not require a photo ID and lost in every state that did require a photo ID in order to vote."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/aug/09/viral-image/viral-post-claiming-voter-fraud-2012-election-errs/	A viral post shared on several websites claims to offer evidence that President Barack Obama benefited from voter fraud during his 2012 reelection race against Mitt Romney. Headlined "Ever Wonder Why Republicans Want Voter ID?" the post offers factoids that seem to point to voter fraud in critical states. We've rated the Florida claims Pants on Fire! PolitiFact is also looking at the claims about Pennsylvania and Ohio in separate fact-checks. For this item, we'll look at the "fun fact" at the end of the meme: "Obama won in every state that did not require a photo ID and lost in every state that did require a photo ID in order to vote." It's clear from the context that the post is talking about the 2012 election, because it mentions Republican Mitt Romney twice. So did voter ID determine whether Obama won or lost in a state? Not at all. We checked with the National Conference of State Legislatures, the nonpartisan Washington-based organization that keeps track of which states have voter identification laws and rates the rigidity of those laws. The group made a tally of the mandatory photo ID laws in effect for the 2012 election. It's true that Obama lost in the states that had a strict photo-only ID requirement in 2012, but merely four states — Georgia, Indiana, Kansas and Tennessee — had that requirement, a salient fact the post neglects to mention. (A few more states have added a strict photo ID requirement that apply in the 2016 elections.) That a Democrat would lose in those states, regardless of a photo ID requirement, is not surprising. Georgia and Indiana have voted for Republican candidates in seven of the last eight presidential elections since 1984, Tennessee has done it in six out of eight, and Kansas has done it in eight out of eight. This trend pre-dated the photo ID laws, the first of which was implemented in 2008. The post is ridiculously wrong when it says Obama won in every state that did not require a photo ID. Obama lost in 20 of the 46 states without a strict photo ID requirement. If you include the seven additional states that asked for a photo ID but allowed other types of identification as well, such as a credit or debit card in the voter's name, Obama won four (Florida, Hawaii, Michigan and New Hampshire) and lost three (Idaho, Louisiana and South Dakota). The post does not identify who created it. Our ruling An anonymous, viral post claims that in 2012, "Obama won in every state that did not require a photo ID and lost in every state that did require a photo ID in order to vote." Obama did lose in the four states that had such a law in effect in 2012, but those states historically vote Republican in presidential elections anyway. The post is flat wrong about Obama winning states that do not require a photo ID. He lost in 20 states that lacked the requirement. On the whole, we rate the statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ae22eaa3-6b2d-4ae8-b909-e0b3d8f543fd	None	Viral image	None	None	None	2016-08-09T10:00:00	2016-08-05	['Barack_Obama']
pomt-03674	On allowing a vote on universal gun background checks in the U.S. Senate.	no flip	/georgia/statements/2013/apr/26/johnny-isakson/senator-consistently-favor-vote-gun-background-che/	The recent legislation in the U.S. Senate to expand background checks on guns was one of the highest-profile votes this year. The measure eventually failed on a 54-46 vote. Senate rules required it to get at least 60 votes in order to succeed. But some gun advocates were angry the measure even came up for a vote. Some PolitiFact Georgia readers wrote to us, asking whether U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., flip-flopped on an earlier position when he voted to allow that vote to go forward in the Senate. Isakson voted against the actual background check bill. PolitiFact Georgia wanted to know whether Isakson staked out one position on a background-check filibuster and then reneged. President Barack Obama called for several new measures aimed at limiting access to guns to criminals and the mentally ill after the horrific killings in December at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. One proposal was universal background checks. Federal law currently requires federally licensed gun dealers to conduct background checks, commonly known as "universal background checks," before selling a firearm. There is no federal law that requires private gun dealers to do such background checks. A handful of states (Georgia is not one of them) require private dealers to conduct background checks. Gun control advocates want to require private dealers to conduct such a check. Earlier this month, two senators who’ve received high marks from the National Rifle Association (Democrat Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Republican Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania), proposed an amendment they hoped would receive wide bipartisan support from their colleagues. The amendment would subject nearly all gun buyers to background checks. Isakson said during an interview April 9 with "CBS This Morning" that he had concerns about such legislation, including that background checks may "violate rights to privacy in terms of mental health." Isakson received an "A" rating from the NRA in his last campaign, The Atlanta Journal Constitution reported. But the senator, unlike many of his GOP colleagues, indicated he didn’t want a filibuster on the proposal. A filibuster allows unlimited debate continued on the grounds that any senator should have the right to speak as long as necessary on any issue. "I think it deserves a vote up or down, " Isakson said in the CBS interview. On April 11, the Senate voted 68-31 in favor of the "motion to proceed" on the gun bill, allowing it to come to the floor and have amendment votes. Isakson voted in favor of moving forward. So, too, did Georgia’s other U.S. senator, Saxby Chambliss, a Republican. But Republicans could still have blocked the bill after it was amended by setting up another 60-vote hurdle to end debate. As a vote on the Manchin/Toomey amendment and others drew closer, the thinking on Capitol Hill was that the measure could not get 60 votes once the NRA announced its opposition. The Washington Post reported that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, decided to allow votes on nine amendments, requiring a 60-vote majority in order for them to pass. Any of those amendments could have been filibustered on their own if the vote threshold was set at 51. In addition, it allowed Reid to control the action. "So, why didn’t Reid try to get the unanimous consent agreement to set all amendment votes at a 51-vote threshold?" The Post wrote. "Because to do that would have opened the bill up to the very likely possibility that amendments favored by gun rights advocates would be added to it." On April 17, Isakson and Chambliss voted against the actual amendment. The Senate voted 54-46 in favor. Again, it did not receive the 60 votes necessary for it to more forward. Georgia Gun Owners, a group that claims about 10,000 members, held a protest in front of Isakson’s home after he voted in favor of bringing the amendment to a floor vote. "He certainly didn’t flip-flop on the filibuster," said Patrick Parsons, the group’s executive director. "He never said he wanted to (support a filibuster)." Jerry Henry, executive director of Georgia Carry, a 7,300-member gun advocacy group, said he was not aware of Isakson supporting a filibuster on the amendment. "He voted to kill the filibuster and allowed it to get on the floor and then he voted against the bill," Henry said. "As far as I know, (Isakson) said he would not support a filibuster." To sum up, Isakson voted against a filibuster on the background check amendment, backing up his talk of desiring an up-or-down vote on the measure. Isakson did eventually vote against the legislation. The senator receives a rating of No Flip. Atlanta Journal-Constitution staff writer Daniel Malloy contributed to this article.

pomt-05831	On resigning from the Texas Railroad Commission.	full flop	/texas/statements/2012/feb/17/elizabeth-ames-jones/did-elizabeth-ames-jones-flip-flop-resigning/	Elizabeth Ames Jones’ resignation from the Texas Railroad Commission on Feb. 13, 2012, came weeks after state Sen. Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio began claiming that she was violating the Texas Constitution by remaining in her post while also running against him. A day after she resigned, Austin American-Statesman reporter Jason Embry on Twitter pointed to a January 2011 blog post he wrote in which Jones is quoted as saying that she would "never" leave her post on the commission, which regulates the oil and gas industry in Texas. We put Jones’ change of heart to our Flip-O-Meter. Embry’s Jan. 25, 2011, blog post was written as Jones was traveling the state to announce her candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by Kay Bailey Hutchison after this year. The post quotes Jones as saying outside the Texas Capitol: "The days of backroom deals, secret earmarks, wasteful pork-barrel spending will come to a screeching halt when I am elected." According to the post, Jones also said she would not resign her commission seat to concentrate on her campaign, though she wouldn’t seek re-election in 2012. Next, the post points out that Michael Williams, then Jones’ colleague on the commission and an expected Senate candidate, had already announced his resignation from the three-person commission, effective April 2, 2011. "I would never leave my post," Jones was quoted as saying. The Quorum Report’s Texas Energy Report included the same "never" statement from Jones in its story about her Austin campaign stop. "She’s not following colleague and fellow hopeful Michael Williams’ lead by resigning her seat on the three-member panel," says the story, before quoting Jones as saying she would "never" leave her post. About nine months later, Jones switched races, jumping into the Republican primary contest against Wentworth for this state Senate seat. Fourteen weeks after that, she quit the commission. We searched — on the Internet and in newspaper archives — and talked to representatives of the Wentworth and Jones campaigns for evidence that Jones had otherwise vowed not to leave the commission. We found no additional "never" proclamations from Jones, though the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and the Dallas Morning News reported her saying during her January 2011 announcement tour that she would not resign from the commission. On Dec. 9, 2011, Wentworth, who faces Jones and Donna Campbell of New Braunfels for the Republican nomination, issued a statement suggesting that Jones could not legally fulfill a constitutional requirement that statewide elected officials live in the capital and also qualify as a resident of the San Antonio-rooted Senate district. Jones disputed his analysis, saying she had legal advice indicating that she could continue on the commission while pursuing the Senate seat. In a statement announcing her resignation, Jones noted that she had tried to resolve the legal dispute by asking Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott "to issue an opinion vindicating my right to finish my term on the Texas Railroad Commission." However, her statement suggested, that hope was dashed by a Feb. 6, 2012, lawsuit, which sought to stop Jones from receiving her state paycheck. She said any such suit would prevent the attorney general from issuing an opinion until its resolution. As we closed out this look, we asked Jones for an interview. She wasn’t immediately available. In an earlier telephone interview, Jones’ political consultant, Todd Olsen, argued that Jones had not flip-flopped by resigning from the commission after previously saying she would not quit it. Olsen noted that Jones’ January 2011 comment that she would "never leave" her post was made when she was running for a different office and under different circumstances. Olsen said that Jones spoke after Williams had announced his resignation and that if she had followed suit, the Railroad Commission would have been left inoperable with only one commissioner (until the governor named a replacement). Olsen also noted that Jones clearly could not have been speaking to whether she’d stay on the commission while running for the Texas Senate. Another facet, in Olsen’s view: In late 2010 and early 2011, lawmakers were discussing how to restructure the Railroad Commission, possibly reducing it to a single position from three, a proposal that Jones did not support. Olsen speculated that if the question Jones was answering related to that possible shrinkage, Jones would make the same "never" vow today. Our ruling Jones initially said she would never leave her post, meaning resign. She later did so, nearly 11 months before the term ends. It’s believable that the commission’s circumstances and other factors changed in the intervening year. Regardless, Jones’ resignation after saying she’d "never" quit the commission amounts to a Full Flop.

pomt-12430	Says "Karen Handel’s office budget increased a whopping 42 percent."	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2017/may/17/dccc-lgo/georgia-dem-attack-gops-handel-falls-wide-mark/	The race in Georgia’s 6th Congressional District tests whether Democrats can turn anger toward President Donald Trump into votes, and whether Republicans can transcend that anger in a district that has long been safe GOP territory. With a little over a month before the June 20 special election, the Democratic ad campaign went on the attack. Both the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee -- the electoral arm of House Democrats -- and the campaign to elect Jon Ossoff ran commercials targeting Republican Karen Handel. The DCCC ad cast Handel as a politician who enjoyed the comforts of office. "Georgia experienced the worst budget crisis since the Great Depression," the ad said. "For years, we saw cuts to education, cuts to law enforcement, and rising college tuition. Yet Secretary of State Karen Handel’s office budget increased a whopping 42 percent." Is that true? The answer depends on what you think when you hear the term "office budget." State budget experts at Georgia State University and the Georgia Budget and Policy Institute helped us work through the official budget documents. There was general agreement that the first budget Handel helped shaped was in early 2007. She stepped down as secretary of state in December 2009, so the last budgets she worked under fell in 2009 and 2010. We compared both to 2007. We found the administrative cost of running the secretary of state’s office rose by nearly 39 percent from 2007 to 2009, or 47 percent from 2007 to 2010 -- which is close but not quite what the ad claimed. However, the cost of the department overall actually fell by about 8 percent from 2007 to 2009, or 10 percent from 2007 to 2010. Here are the numbers: 2007 2009 Change from 2007 2010 Change from 2007 Office Admin. $4,882,454 $6,782,167 +38.9% $7,167,144 +46.8% Total $30,762,868 $28,381,868 -7.7% $27,730,509 -9.9% The key here is the distinction of administration costs versus the budget of the entire department. Evan Lukaske, DCCC spokesman, told us his group pulled the 42 percent figure from a 2010 Associated Press article, which said, "During her three years as secretary of state, the office's administration budget jumped by about 42 percent, according to state records." More recently, a local television station confirmed that figure. (The slight difference in numbers stems from the more conservative budget assumptions we used following the guidance of budget experts.) More to the story There’s an important backstory to the spending increase that puts the number in a different light. Between 2008 and 2009, there was a reshuffling of activities within the secretary of state’s office. It had investigators spread across three separate programs. Handel consolidated them. Handel spokeswoman Kate Constantini said the easiest way to do that was to add that work to an existing line in the budget. "That line item was part of the front office budget, which necessarily showed an increase, but was the result of moving personnel that were accounted for in other parts of the budget," Constantini said. The state budget brief for 2008-09 backs up Handel’s account. The rise in the administrative budget was offset by decreases in certain activities of other divisions within the department. As such, the spending increases are largely only on paper. In reality, money was shuffled around. Our ruling Democrats say Handel saw her office budget rise 42 percent. While some viewers might not spot the distinction between the administrative budget and the budget for the entire office, the raw numbers support the claim. But most of that increase came from moving around work -- and the money to pay for it -- inside the department. The rise in the administrative budget was offset by cuts elsewhere. The ad’s statement contains an element of truth, but leaves out critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.

pomt-12263	"Western New Yorkers pay some of the highest property taxes in the state."	half-true	/new-york/statements/2017/jul/07/raymond-walter/where-are-property-taxes-highest-new-york/	New York state has some of the highest property taxes in the country. But where in the state are property taxes highest? Assemblyman Ray Walter, R-Amherst, says Western New York ranks high. "Western New Yorkers pay some of the highest property taxes in the state," Walter said in a recent press release about Republican efforts to replace Obamacare. He supports a part of a congressional bill designed to reduce property taxes in New York state by shifting Medicaid costs from counties to the state. Walter said he was talking about property taxes as a percent of home value in Western New York. He defines the region as the eight counties west of the Finger Lakes: Erie, Niagara, Chautauqua, Allegany, Cattaraugus, Orleans, Wyoming and Genesee counties. "It’s off the charts as a percentage of home value," Walter told PolitiFact New York. "In real dollars it’s not as high just because our home values are not as high as other places in the state." Is Walter right that Western New York has some of the highest property taxes in the state? Percent of home value U.S. Census Bureau data shows how property taxes compared with home values in each county in 2015, the latest figures. It’s a better apples-to-apples comparison because some counties have higher home values but similar property tax bills. The home value in Brooklyn is more than triple that of Sullivan County, for example, but the property tax bills are within a few hundred dollars of each other. All eight counties in Western New York rank among the 18 highest counties in the state for property taxes as a percent of home value. • Orleans County ranks first out of the state’s 62 counties. Its median property tax of $3,055 is 3.35 percent of its $91,300 median home value. • Allegany County ranks second. The $2,320 median property tax bill is 3.3 percent of the $70,300 median home value. • Erie County ranks lowest in the region, but 18th highest in the state. Its median property tax bill is $3,499, which is 2.69 percent of its median home value of $130,000. The data is only reported for owner-occupied housing units. It does not include property taxes on businesses or rented units. Property taxes in dollars The ten counties with the highest median property tax in dollar amounts are in New York City, the lower Hudson Valley and on Long Island. Western New York counties are lower in this category. Four of them rank in the bottom half. • Erie County has the highest property tax in the region. The county ranks 21st in the state. • Niagara County, where the median property tax bill is $3,255, is second highest in the region but 26th in the state. • Allegany County has the lowest median property tax in dollars in Western New York. Only five other counties in the state are lower. Three counties tie for highest property taxes in the state — and the country. Nassau, Rockland, and Westchester counties each have median property tax bills that exceed $10,000. That’s the highest amount in the country as well. The Census Bureau does not report exact dollar amounts when the median tax exceeds $10,000. Percent of income Property taxes can also be measured as a share of median household income. The eight counties in Western New York rank in the middle in this category. • Wyoming County, where the tax bill is $2,871, is lowest in the region. Residents spend 5.29 percent of the median income of $52,564 on property taxes. Fifteen counties have lower property tax bills as a percent of median resident income. • Erie County is again highest in the region. Residents there pay 6.83 percent of the median income of $51,247 toward property taxes. Twenty-one counties are higher. Nassau, Rockland, and Westchester counties tie for first in this category. At least ten percent of the median income in each is spent on property taxes. Our ruling Walter said "Western New Yorkers pay some of the highest property taxes in the state." His statement might come as a surprise to homeowners on Long Island and other counties near New York City, where median property tax bills exceed $10,000. To them, Erie County's median property tax bill of $3,499 doesn't look too high. So, no, Western New Yorkers do not pay some of the highest property taxes in the state. But Western New Yorkers shoulder a heavier burden paying the property tax. Walter said he was talking about property taxes as a percent of home value. And in that sense, he’s right about the tax. Two Western New York counties lead the state in this category and all eight counties in the region are among the top third. We rate his claim Half True.

pomt-12883	"Here in Philadelphia murder has been steady — I mean — just terribly increasing."	false	/pennsylvania/statements/2017/jan/26/donald-trump/donald-trump-falsely-tells-gop-philly-homicides-ar/	Donald Trump made his first visit to Philadelphia as president today and at the beginning of his speech at the GOP Retreat said it was "great" to be in the city. Then things went south. Trump said, "Here in Philadelphia, murder has been steady — I mean — just terribly increasing." So what’s really happening with homicides in Philadelphia? In 2016, according to year-end data from the police department, 277 people were killed in the city. That number is down from 2015, when 280 people were killed; and up from 2014, when 248 people were killed. Homicides since the mid 2000s, however, are way down. In 2007, Philly had 391 murders. Go back to the 1990s, and Philadelphia’s murder rate was even higher. Five hundred people were killed in 1990. The murder rate decreased throughout the 1990s before going back up in the early 2000s and falling since then. The 277 people killed in 2016 is the third-lowest amount since 1990 and down about 45 percent from the 1990 peak. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com We reached out to White House spokesperson Steven N. Cheung for comment. We’ll update if we hear back. Mayor Jim Kenney released a statement Thursday afternoon saying the president’s comments were "insulting" to police. "Our police officers have worked tirelessly and with great personal sacrifice to get Philadelphia’s crime rate down to its lowest point in forty years, while also successfully implementing reforms to strengthen police-community relations and uphold the rights of all our residents," he said in the statement. He continued: "Our homicides are, in fact, slowly declining, and while we are not satisfied with even our current numbers, we are handicapped by Republican refusal to enact any kind of common sense gun control and by their obsession with turning our police officers into ICE agents — which will prevent immigrants from coming forward to report crimes or provide critical witnesses statements that can put dangerous criminals behind bars." Our Ruling President Donald Trump, while addressing the GOP Retreat at the Loews Hotel, said, "Here in Philadelphia murder has been steady — I mean — just terribly increasing." The murder rate was higher last year than it was in 2014 and 2013, but it was lower than in 2015 and the third-lowest it has been since 1990. The murder rate in 2016 was about 45 percent lower than in 1990, when 500 people were killed. We rule the claim False.

pomt-05003	Says Debbie Wasserman Schultz "has these offshore accounts" like Mitt Romney.	mostly false	/florida/statements/2012/jul/18/mary-matalin/debbie-wasserman-schultz-had-offshore-accounts-mit/	So Mitt Romney had a Swiss bank account. Big deal! That's the argument Republican pundit Mary Matalin deployed about Romney’s finances on ABC’s This Week with George Stephanopoulos. Responding to comments from fellow panelist George F. Will that Romney needed to be more forthcoming about his finances, Matalin said, "With deference and respect to my esteemed colleague here, people don't care where his bank accounts are. They care that they don't have much left in their bank accounts. ... "They don't care about his taxes. They care about their own taxes," she continued. "He's released 2010. He's releasing 2011. He has full disclosure. "There's no tax advantages to being offshore," she said. "Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the handpicked Democratic chairman by Barack Obama, has these offshore accounts." The mention of Wasserman Schultz -- the head of the Democratic National Committee and one of Florida’s more high-profile members of Congress -- caught our attention. Does Wasserman Schultz have offshore accounts similar to Romney’s? Before Romney became governor of Massachusetts in 2003, he had a long career managing Bain Capital, a private equity investment firm, and that work made him wealthy. We fact-checked whether Romney had a Swiss bank account and found that accurate. The trustee for the Romney family’s investments -- Brad Malt of the law firm Ropes & Gray -- set up the account in 2003. There were no tax advantages to holding the Swiss account, said Malt in a conference call with reporters in January 2012, when the campaign released Mitt and Ann Romney’s 2010 tax returns. The account contained approximately $3 million, and it was held by Union Bank Switzerland, or UBS. "The tax is fully paid, just as if this were a U.S. bank account, nothing more complicated than that," Malt said then. And in our review, we found nothing to indicate Romney did anything illegal or improper with the account, just as Matalin said. Now, let’s look at Wasserman Schultz’s finances. As we researched, we found similar claims about Wasserman Schultz and offshore accounts that pointed back to the conservative magazine and website the Weekly Standard. The Weekly Standard combed through Wasserman Schultz’s financial disclosures, which are required from all members of Congress. It found several 401(k) funds listed there, then cross-referenced the funds with their published holdings. The Davis Financial Fund "is invested in the Julius Baer Group Ltd. and the State Bank of India GDR Ltd., as well as other financial, insurance, bank institutions," the Weekly Standard noted. Julius Baer is a Swiss private banking group. We went through the disclosure statements and found what the Weekly Standard described. To refresh your memory on 401(k) funds: They’re retirement savings accounts where workers can sock away money and defer paying taxes on it. Money managers then invest the savings in all sorts of ways, both in the U.S. and abroad. In some ways, the Weekly Standard’s point is fair and relevant: It’s a global economy, and many Americans have investments overseas through their own 401(k)s and pension funds. Some of the attacks on Romney suggest that his Swiss account had some nefarious function, and we haven’t seen any evidence to support that. Matalin sent us this statement, emailed from a spokesperson, that reiterated that point: "The attack from Obama wasn't about the size of the account but the very existence of it. There is nothing illegal or unique about these accounts. My response was two-fold: Obama is a hypocrite since his own appointees have the same arrangements and using a distraction tactic because he can't run on his record." Still, with all due respect to the globally interconnected economy, Wasserman Schultz’s "offshore accounts" have little in common with Romney’s. For one thing, the amounts of money in the accounts are of staggeringly different size. Wasserman Schultz’s 401(k) fund had less than $15,000. Romney had up to $3 million. Wasserman Schultz’s money was in a 401(k) account, the Davis Financial Fund, which is based in Massachusetts. It was purchased April 15, 2010, and sold on April 23, 2010. So it wasn’t held for very long. Romney’s money was in a cash savings account held from 2003 to 2010, according to his attorney. After hearing Matalin’s comments, we also wondered whether Wasserman Schultz and Romney are in the same league financially. They’re not. Wasserman Schultz’s net worth -- all her assets minus all her liabilities -- was somewhere between $235,000 and negative $290,000 in 2010, according to the most recent disclosure. In fact, Wasserman Schultz was one of the least wealthy members of Congress that year. The Center for Responsive Politics ranked her at No. 422 out of 440 House members. (The list is slightly larger than 435 seats in the House due to special elections.) Romney’s wealth, on the other hand, is somewhere between $85 million and $264 million. The Romney campaign told the Washington Post that a more accurate range would be between $190 million and $250 million. Our ruling Matalin said that Romney might have offshore accounts, but so do others. "Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the handpicked Democratic chairman by Barack Obama, has these offshore accounts," she said. Actually, Wasserman Schultz had a 401(k) account of less than $15,000, managed by an American company, that included some foreign investments. Romney’s account was a savings account of approximately $3 million held by a Swiss bank. Matalin does have a point that Romney’s account was entirely legal and he paid taxes on the earnings. It’s also true that many Americans have foreign investments through 401(k)s and pension funds. But Wasserman Schultz’s investments are not similar to Romney’s, neither in size nor in type.

pomt-03762	Says 90 percent of Americans and 74 percent of National Rifle Association members support background checks of gun purchasers.	true	/texas/statements/2013/apr/04/lee-leffingwell/lee-leffingwell-says-polls-show-90-percent-america/	Joining calls for criminal background checks prior to every U.S. gun purchase, Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell said the idea is widely popular. Ninety percent of Americans and 74 percent of National Rifle Association members support universal background checks, Leffingwell said, the Austin American-Statesman reported in a news article posted online the day he spoke, March 28, 2013. Currently, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers but not for gun sales by private sellers. President Barack Obama wants to require criminal background checks for all gun sales. The National Rifle Association, which opposes universal background checks, has suggested that an expansion would fail to rope in criminals. As noted in a January 2013 fact check by our colleagues in Washington, Republican pollster Frank Luntz’s organization, Luntz Global, conducted a May 2012 poll of 945 gun owners nationwide, half of whom were gun owners who were "current or lapsed" members of the National Rifle Association and half of whom were non-NRA gun owners. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Leffingwell aide Amy Everhart said by email that the mayor based his NRA reference on the same poll, as cited by the group that commissioned it, Mayors Against Illegal Guns. Everhart said Leffingwell also drew his conclusion about other polls from the group, which consists of city mayors concerned with illegal guns and gun violence as helmed by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, a Democrat. Its five Texas members include Leffingwell as well as the mayor of neighboring West Lake Hills, Dave Claunch, and Houston Mayor Annise Parker. A week before Leffingwell spoke, Everhart pointed out, Bloomberg delivered remarks in New York noting that polls in 41 congressional districts suggest an average of 86 percent to 89 percent of likely voters support universal background checks. "That’s in line with other recent polls that have found that more than 90 percent of Americans support background checks for all gun buyers," Bloomberg said before revisiting the May 2012 poll that reached current and former NRA members. That poll found that 82 percent of gun owners were in favor of required background checks, including 74 percent of individuals with current or former memberships in the NRA. Contacted previously by PolitiFact, the NRA offered no comment on the poll. But the group previously reacted to a 2009 poll taken by Luntz for the mayors’ group by noting that Luntz could not have had access to the association’s confidential membership roll. It also criticized Luntz, a widely quoted communications consultant for Republican politicians and Fortune 100 companies, with decade-old criticism from two polling organizations. The association did not directly challenge the poll results. PolitiFact identified two other 2013 polls of gun owners. A Pew Research Center poll taken of 1,502 adults from Jan. 9-13, 2013, found 85 percent of some 529 polled gun owners in favor of making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks — nearly identical to the Luntz poll. The gun-owner results had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points. A CBS/New York Times poll conducted of 1,110 adults from Jan. 11-15, 2013, showed that 85 percent of respondents living in a household with an NRA member supported universal background checks. More recently, according to the results of a national January 2013 poll presented in the March 21, 2013, New England Journal of Medicine, 84 percent of gun owners and 74 percent of NRA members supported requiring a universal background-check system for all gun sales. The poll was conducted by GfK Knowledge Networks for researchers led by Colleen L. Barry, an associate professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. And what of Americans in general? The January Pew poll found 85 percent of all respondents in favor of making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks, with comparable support from Republicans, Democrats and independents, Pew said. The margin of error for the entire sample was 2.9 percentage points. The CBS/New York Times poll indicated that 92 percent of all the respondents favor background checks for all potential gun buyers. The poll had an overall margin of error of three percentage points. PolitiFact Georgia, looking into a similar claim about support for universal checks, noted a Fox News poll conducted Jan. 15-17, 2013, of 1,008 registered voters. Ninety one percent of respondents said they favor "requiring criminal background checks on all gun buyers, including those buying at gun shows and private sales." A Quinnipiac University national survey of 772 registered voters, taken Jan. 30 through Feb. 4, 2013, found 92 percent supporting background checks for all gun buyers. The survey, pointed out by Everhart, had a margin of error of 2.3 percentage points. A subsequent Quinnipiac University survey, taken of 1,944 registered voters from Feb. 27, 2013 through March 4, 2013, found 88 percent in favor of background checks for all gun buyers. The poll had a margin of error of 2.2 percentage points. Our ruling Austin’s mayor said 90 percent of Americans and 74 percent of National Rifle Association members support universal background checks for gun purchases. Polls taken in 2012 and 2013 support both figures, though one taken closest to Leffingwell’s press conference indicates support among all Americans possibly slipping a bit below 90 percent. Also, the 2012 poll he cited for NRA members rolled together responses of current and former/lapsed members. Then again, a 2013 poll similarly suggests that 74 percent of NRA members favor universal background checks. We rate this claim as True.

pomt-11746	Says the concealed carry bill would allow residents of certain states to "travel to your community and walk right into a school zone with a loaded weapon, no matter what local laws say."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/dec/07/brendan-boyle/no-gop-concealed-carry-bill-does-not-block-states-/	The House passed a bill Dec. 6 that would make permits to carry a concealed weapon issued in one state valid in all other states, similarly to how driver’s licenses are recognized across state lines. Republicans attached the concealed carry measure to a bipartisan bill to strengthen the national background check system, causing House Democrats to sour on the legislative package. On the eve of the vote, one Democratic lawmaker warned the expansion of concealed-carry rights would prevent states from keeping guns away from schools. "There are 12 states that don’t require permits for carrying guns. Under #HR38, someone from one of those states could travel to your community and walk right into a school zone with a loaded weapon, no matter what local laws say," Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Pa., tweeted Dec. 5, referring to House Resolution 38. "This bill is a nightmare. #StopCCR." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com As the House-passed bill moves to the Senate, we decided to look at whether Boyle’s claim about the effects on state gun laws was correct. It turns out his read on the bill is misleading. Concealed-carry reciprocity Historically, each state has determined its own scheme for regulating concealed carry, which led to the current patchwork of varying laws and standards across the country. Thirty-eight states require gun owners to obtain a state-issued permit before than can lawfully carry a concealed weapon in public. A dozen states — as Boyle noted — require no permit. Traditionally, states have decided for themselves whether to honor out-of-state permits, a legal concept known as "reciprocity." Under the broad strokes of the House-passed Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act, having a concealed-carry permit issued by one state makes it legal to carry in any state. And according to Boyle, the Republican measure would supersede state and local laws concerning the carry of concealed weapons in school zones. But a close reading of the interplay between the House-passed bill and state gun laws shows that’s not the case. The Gun-Free School Zones Act Before discussing what Boyle gets wrong, it’s worth noting that his claim would have been more accurate if he’d taken aim at federal law, not state law. The federal Gun-Free School Zones Act generally prohibits concealed carry in a school zone, which is defined as a distance of 1,000 feet from the grounds of a public, parochial or private school. But the law makes an exception for people who hold a concealed carry permit from the state in which the school zone is located, according to David Kopel, a policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. So under the Gun-Free School Zones Act, a permit issued by State A would allow you to legally carry in a school zone located in State A, but not a school zone in State B, Kopel said. But the bill the House voted on says that people with concealed-carry permits aren’t subject to the restrictions in the Gun-Free School Zones Act. In other words, Kopel said, if you had a permit from State A, and carried a gun into a school zone in State B, you would face no penalty under the Gun-Free School Zones Act. So Boyle would have been accurate to say the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act overrides federal law concerning the carry of concealed weapons in a school zone. But his claim was about state and local laws. Bill does not supersede state law Boyle specifically said the bill would allow residents of one of the dozen states that allow permitless concealed carry to "walk right into a school zone with a loaded weapon, no matter what local laws say." A large majority of states prohibit non-school employees from carrying in schools, even with a concealed carry permit. So if Boyle were correct, the House bill would stand to cancel out a great deal of gun regulation at the state level. But the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act clearly states that it does not supersede state law — the opposite of Boyle's claim. Under the bill, permit-holders would still be subject to any state or local laws that restrict the carry of a gun in a school or a designated zone around it. The bill reads: "This section shall not be construed to supersede or limit the laws of any state that permit private persons or entities to prohibit or restrict the possession of concealed firearms on their property, or prohibit or restrict the possession of firearms on any state or local government property, installation, building, base, or park." So if the bill becomes law, states would still be free to ban the carry of guns in school zones — and the federal law would also yield to any future laws passed by the minority of states that now generally allow concealed-carry permit holders to carry in schools. "That’s precisely the opposite of Boyle’s point, which was local laws are irrelevant," said Adam Winkler, law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles. Joseph Blocher, a law professor at Duke University who specializes in federal and state constitutional law, agreed that Boyle’s statement is misleading. "If the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act passes, someone from a permitless state could walk into a school zone without violating any federal law, since HR 38 basically rescinds the Gun Free School Zones Act," he said. "But the part about ‘no matter what local laws say’ isn’t right." Our ruling Boyle said the concealed carry bill would allow residents of certain states to "travel to your community and walk right into a school zone with a loaded weapon, no matter what local laws say." While the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act would override a federal law concerning the carry of concealed weapons in a school zone, Boyle is wrong about how the bill would affect state and local gun laws. Concealed carry permit-holders — and residents of the dozen states that allow permitless concealed carry — would still be subject to any state or local laws that prohibit or restrict the carry of a gun in a school or a designated zone around it.

pomt-05092	"New Jersey's citizens are working at the highest rate in three years."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jul/01/jennifer-beck/ennifer-beck-claims-new-jersey-residents-are-worki/	Legislators armed themselves with job statistics before dueling over tax cut proposals in the state budget last week. Some Democrats argued that the responsible course of action was delaying any tax cuts considering the state’s high unemployment rate. Gov. Chris Christie wanted a 10 percent income tax cut. Democrats had offered two plans focused on reducing the property tax burden but passed a budget that tied any tax cut to the state meeting Christie’s revenue projections. State Sen. Jennifer Beck, a Republican from Monmouth County, pointed to other labor data to show New Jersey’s economy is starting to recover. "New Jersey's citizens are working at the highest rate in three years. That's good news," she said in her June 25 speech on the state Senate floor. "We have more businesses expanding their footprint in this state. We've seen almost $8 billion in public-private investment over the last two and a half years. All of those are good signs and today in delivering this budget without a tax cut I think we’re giving a kick in the shins to our citizens because we have the revenue now to be able to deliver that relief and it should be our foremost and top priority." PolitiFact New Jersey checked Beck’s claim that residents are "working at the highest rate in three years." Beck cited labor data showing that roughly 4.17 million New Jersey residents were employed in May. "The last time that New Jersey had this many people employed was in February of 2009, more than 3 years ago," Beck said in an e-mail. PolitiFact New Jersey confirmed that’s accurate. But raw numbers are not a rate. Joseph Seneca, a professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University, agreed that the number of New Jerseyans working is the highest in three years, but said "the confusion would be the word rate." "Usually a rate is expressed per unit of something," Seneca said, as in per thousand or per unit of time. And when comparing the number of employed people to the labor force, the statistics tell a different story. The employment rate is essentially the opposite of the unemployment rate. The unemployment rate is calculated by taking the number of people who are unemployed but looking for work and dividing it by the labor force. The labor force includes employed people and people who are unemployed but looking for work. People who are unemployed but aren’t looking for work are not included in the labor force. New Jersey’s unemployment rate -- and therefore the employment rate -- has fluctuated some in the past three years, but overall has remained relatively even. In May of 2009 the unemployment rate was 8.9 percent and the employment rate was about 91 percent. Since then both rates have varied, but in May of this year, the unemployment rate was 9.2 percent and the employment rate was 90.8 percent. So, as a rate, fewer New Jerseyans are working now than three years ago. In response, Beck pointed to the rate of employment compared to the total state population, but that includes individuals who are younger than 16, as well as people who are institutionalized and active duty service members. Excluding those groups of individuals, as the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics does, about 61.4 percent of New Jersey’s population was employed in May 2009. In May 2012, roughly 60 percent of the population was employed. "What is unassailably true is that the employment level is the highest in 3 years. It is my belief that New Jersey is moving in the right direction," Beck said. Our ruling Beck said that "New Jersey's citizens are working at the highest rate in three years." To support her claim, Beck pointed to the number of employed residents, which is at the highest level since more than three years ago. But Beck said rate and the percent of employed residents ticked down slightly from May 2009 to May 2012. We rate this statement False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.

pomt-11275	"I am still waiting for someone to produce pieces of the alleged plane" that caused the Twin Towers to collapse.	pants on fire!	/north-carolina/statements/2018/apr/25/lawana-mayfield/charlotte-city-councilor-pieces-911-planes-havent-/	Never mind that TV stations aired live footage of a plane striking the World Trade Center on 9/11. Or that there are thousands of witnesses who also saw the planes strike the Twin Towers. Or that Osama Bin Laden took credit for the attack. LaWana Mayfield, a Democratic Charlotte city councilwoman, is apparently unconvinced that planes struck the towers and caused them to collapse. In fact, she’s skeptical that pieces of the plane exist at all. On Facebook, Mayfield recently posted a link to an obscure website promoting the idea that the towers in New York City may have fallen on Sept. 11, 2001, for some reason other than being struck by airplanes. "I am still waiting for someone to produce pieces of the alleged plane that opened the doors for US Citizens to loose all privacy rights (from the conspiracy theorist in me)," she posted. Mayfield later apologized for posting comments that caused "hurt and pain," but has declined to acknowledge that planes were responsible for the collapse of the Twin Towers. She appeared on the WCNC show "Flashpoint" to discuss the post. When asked directly about the post – "Do you believe the planes took down those towers?" – Mayfield dodged the question. "What I believe is that we lost Americans during this event. What I believe is that after this event, our nation identified a segment of our community and said this community is now terrorists. And from that moment, we have been saying 'terrorists, terrorists, terrorists,' " Mayfield said. But, she added, "white Americans who have committed mass killings since that time" were not called "terrorists." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com It’s unclear what, exactly, Mayfield believes happened on 9/11. She didn’t respond to an email seeking comment. When reached by phone Wednesday, Mayfield said the email likely went into a folder she created for 9/11-related emails and that she hadn’t seen it. She then declined to comment on her Facebook post, saying she was walking into a meeting. The "three-day news cycle" has passed, Mayfield said, adding "I’m trying to tackle this housing crisis." It is clear, however, that planes hit the Twin Towers and caused them to collapse. Let’s break this down as simply as possible. The plane There are eyewitnesses who saw the planes hit the towers. News cameras also captured footage of the second plane hitting the south tower. Large pieces of the airplanes were found around Ground Zero, as documented by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security in 2002. A piece – part of a plane wing – was found nearby in 2013. CNN uploaded video of the wing removal. A fragment of one of the planes is on display at the 9/11 Memorial and Museum in New York. Researchers at Popular Mechanics Magazine published a book debunking theories that the planes weren’t actually planes, but missiles or something else. The collapse Conspiracy theorists have argued that jet fuel can’t melt steel beams, so the Twin Towers couldn’t have fallen over due to the impact of a plane alone. But the fuel doesn’t need to melt the beams in order to damage their structural integrity. Furthermore, the World Trade Center was built with a load-bearing core in its center (as opposed to concrete columns). But that center, the Washington Post pointed out, was surrounded by a "thin exterior shell — a density of eight to nine pounds per cubic foot. That’s lighter than balsa wood." The Facebook post Mayfield paired her comments about 9/11 with a link to an obscure website, AwarenessAct.com. The site boasts about a feature in the July-August 2016 issue of Europhysics News magazine examining the likelihood that the Twin Towers collapsed as a result of a controlled demolition. According to fact-checking website Snopes.com, the article was written by "a group of scientists who have long been involved with the promotion of 9/11 conspiracy theories." EDP Sciences, which produces Europhysics News, later released a statement on Twitter that downplayed the scientific legitimacy of the article. "EDP Sciences follows the most rigorous peer review standards for its journals of which [Europhysics News] is not one," the statement reads. "As a magazine, the editorial policy of EPN is to publish news and views, which are sometimes controversial. EDP Sciences recognizes that the article discusses some speculative and controversial issues," the statement continues. "However EPN and EDP Sciences believe that the best (and the most scientific) way to settle such issues is to publish them and have an open discussion with all due arguments in which the truth will finally emerge." Our ruling Mayfield described the planes that hit the World Trade Center on 9/11 as "alleged" planes and said pieces of the planes had yet to be revealed to the public. Eyewitness accounts, video, plane debris and most credible science points to the fact that airplanes struck the Twin Towers on Sept. 11, 2001, causing them to collapse.

pomt-02976	"Half of all CEOs say that the shutdown and the threat of shutdown set back their plans to hire over the next six months."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/21/barack-obama/half-all-ceos-say-shutdown-hiring-setback-six-mont/	After a Senate deal brought the 16-day government shutdown to a close, President Barack Obama wanted to make sure the impact of narrowly avoiding a default wasn’t lost on the nation. "These last few weeks have inflicted completely unnecessary damage on our economy," he said in a public address Thursday. As proof, he offered up specific claims including, "Half of all CEOs say that the shutdown and the threat of shutdown set back their plans to hire over the next six months." PolitiFact wanted to know whether Obama’s CEO statistic was accurate. The White House pointed us to a recent Business Roundtable survey. "Fifty percent of responding CEOs indicated that the ongoing disagreement in Washington over the 2014 budget and the debt ceiling is having a negative impact on their plans for hiring additional employees over the next six months," the report reads. On its face, that’s in line with what Obama said, but we wanted to see how Business Roundtable acquired their results. They would not disclose their exact question wording to us. Their report notes, "Responses were received from 134 member CEOs, 63 percent of the total Business Roundtable membership." Business Roundtable’s membership tends to be larger companies. Spokeswoman Amanda DeBard told us CEOs are invited based on revenue, industry and market capitalization, so it’s safe to say the poll responses don’t reflect a random sample of U.S. businesses. Since Obama often speaks to the Business Roundtable, we wanted to see what his relationship with the group was like. University of Kansas political science professor Burdett Loomis, who specializes in lobbying, said there’s not much of a connection. "Many of them have long-term relationships with government (simply because of their size and the government’s size), but probably only a handful have any kind of even semi-close relationship with Obama," he said. We ran the poll results by another business group, the National Federation of Independent Businesses. Senior policy analyst Holly Wade said she saw a similar sentiment among the smaller business owners that the federation represents. "In September, there were more small business owners that were feeling pessimistic about business conditions six months out," she said. There wasn’t much opinion voiced about delaying employment specifically, though. But Wade said that could be because small businesses were already hiring less during the economic recovery compared to bigger corporations. Why would CEOs want to delay hiring? With another possible debt ceiling default looming Feb. 7, University of Maryland finance professor David Kass said it’s likely that a budget deal will lead to tighter fiscal policy, which would slow down the economy and cause CEOs to put off hiring decisions for a few months. Another factor that would contribute to CEO anxiety is consumer behavior. While day-to-day spending probably won’t change post-shutdown, consumers will likely postpone higher ticket purchases, like homes and cars. "On the demand side, there’s uncertainty on the consumers’ part, which in turn will have an impact on CEOs," Kass said. "They’re trying to predict their future sales and what the environment will look like. It’s a lose-lose situation for everyone." In any case, Obama is trying to communicate that the shutdown had a significant financial impact on the nation, and he’s not wrong there. Independent forecasts agree that the shutdown was a setback for the U.S. economy, though they differ on exact figures. Our ruling Obama said 50 percent of CEOs are delaying hiring due to the shutdown, which accurately cites the results of a poll sponsored by the Business Roundtable. The survey’s limited sampling, though, means the responses aren’t necessarily representative of all U.S. businesses. But the idea that the shutdown affects how businesses think about hiring is more broadly applicable. Experts said it’s reasonable that CEOs would be hesitant to hire, given that uncertainty about government fiscal policy can affect consumer confidence.

pomt-06380	Says Measure 3-386 will cost a fortune for elections while Measure 3-388 will cost less.	false	/oregon/statements/2011/nov/02/ann-lininger/will-countywide-vote-urban-renewal-cost-taxpayers-/	Voters love to save money. They also probably don’t want to spend "a fortune" on unnecessary elections. These are precisely the points being made by supporters of a Clackamas County board-backed measure on the Nov. 8 ballot. A campaign mailer in favor of Measure 3-388 urges voters to say no to county Measure 3-386, a competing proposal that would require a county-wide vote on future urban renewal project areas. "There are two measures on the ballot having to do with Urban Renewal. In one way they are the same: both require a vote of the people before any Urban Renewal Area can be established in unincorporated Clackamas County. But there are two very important differences:" The mailer says that 3-386 "Costs MORE money. An Urban Renewal Area affecting only a few hundred people would trigger a county-wide election covering over 200,000 voters, costing taxpayers a fortune." The mailer also urges a yes vote on Measure 3-388, which would require approval from a smaller number of voters who live in a proposed urban renewal district. This is the proposal backed by the Clackamas County Board of County Commissioners. The mailer says this measure "Costs LESS money. Smaller election = less cost." You guessed our burning question: Does the county-wide measure cost "a fortune" while smaller elections cost less? (A similar mailer went out just this week.) Measure 3-386 was put on the ballot by citizen petitioners who don’t like the county board approving new urban renewal areas without a county vote. If this measure passes, any new plan or substantial change to an existing plan would need to be approved by a majority of county voters in a primary or general election. In other words, commissioners would have two opportunities every two years. The competing measure put forth by the county board, Measure 3-388, would send the issue only to voters who live in a proposed or existing district. So there would be fewer voters voting, but this election could happen during one of four authorized elections a year. That’s eight opportunities every two years. At first blush, it sounds as if a countywide election would be just as cost effective. After all, how much could it cost to add a question to a general or primary election ballot that needs to go out anyway so people can vote on federal and state offices? County elections manager Steve Kindred says that an urban renewal question on a general election ballot wouldn’t cost more if it goes to more voters. The ballots would be the same size whether the question goes to 200,000 voters or 1,000 voters. The Voters’ Pamphlet is not zoned. Turnout would be high anyway in a general election so the issue probably wouldn’t boost processing costs. On the other hand, an off-year election strictly for an urban renewal question, no matter how small the voting pool, could cost an extra $10,000. We contacted Ann Lininger, a Clackamas County commissioner serving as one of the point people on the more limited proposal. She said the county-wide measure would cost more because it would require more notice and explanation to more voters who live in disparate parts of the county. There is a requirement in the county-wide measure that the county send notice to voters before an election. The notice must explain that there is an urban renewal measure on the ballot; that it would take away from other public services for x number of years; that the maximum amount of indebtedness would be x dollars; and that the maximum amount of interest would be x amount. The measure allows the county to include that information in the 500-word explanatory statement required by state law. But Lininger said that option is not feasible, given the complexity of a development plan and the need to make sure voters understand the issue. So the county would have to spend at least $45,000 on mailers, she said, and more on staff time for public meetings. "You would want to have the opportunity to make a case in the explanatory statement," she said. But Beaverton officials had no problem including that same information in their Voters’ Pamphlet statement for Measure 34-192, which proposes a new urban renewal area. Eric Winters, the attorney who drafted the citizen-approved measure in Clackamas County, said the Beaverton explanatory statement pretty much meets his test. And there was room to explain the plan. Measure 3-386 may very well cost more than 3-388 in the end, if you factor in all the time and resources commissioners and staff would need to promote an urban renewal measure or make a significant change to one. But that’s campaigning, not just providing basic information or holding an election. The statement in the mailer zeroes in on election costs. We find that the proponents of the smaller election option have not proved their case that their version would cost less or that a countywide election would cost a fortune. In fact, special elections could cost more. The statement is not accurate. We rate it False. Return to OregonLive to comment on this ruling.

pomt-06973	"State agencies have not identified one single instance where groundwater has been damaged due to hydraulic fracking."	mostly true	/ohio/statements/2011/jul/14/kris-jordan/state-sen-kris-jordan-says-fracking-hasnt-contamin/	As public debate across the country has bubbled up in recent months over environmental concerns related to hydraulic fracturing — or fracking as it’s becoming widely known — proponents of oil and gas drilling have come rushing to its defense. The process involves pumping millions of gallons chemical-laced water and sand deep underground into horizontal wells under high pressure to crack open shale, enabling natural gas extraction. On June 15, 2011, state Sen. Kris Jordan, a Delaware Republican, defended the process in a floor speech on behalf of legislation that would throw open state parkland to oil and gas drilling. During his speech, Jordan portrayed the growing concerns of the public — which have been fanned by "Gasland," a controversial documentary on the environmental issues related to the fracking process — as overblown as he pointed to a long track record of safe fracking in Ohio. "State agencies have not identified one single instance where groundwater has been damaged due to hydraulic fracking," Jordan said. With drilling likely coming soon to Eastern Ohio where the Utica and Marcellus shale formations await possible exploration, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out Jordan’s claim. We started with Jordan, who stood by his statement. "From what I understand, none of the cases has come from fracking itself being involved in contaminating any water," said Jordan. "Any problems that have happened have been well construction issues." Jordan said he consulted with several people in Ohio’s oil and gas industry including Tom Stewart, a top official with the Ohio Oil and Gas Association for his information. Stewart and other oil and gas supporters directed us to several recent statements from state and federal EPA officials such as one made recently by Lisa Jackson, President Barack Obama’s top federal Environmental Protection Agency administrator. During a House committee hearing, Jackson said evidence was limited on whether hydraulic fracturing can affect water tables and aquifers. "There is evidence it can certainly affect them. I am not aware of any proven case where the fracking process itself impacted water although there are investigations ongoing," she told lawmakers. The U.S. EPA began a study in January 2011 of possible environmental problems caused by fracking. The first findings from that study aren’t expected until late 2012. ODNR officials also said they haven’t seen water contamination from fracking in Ohio. "ODNR’s Oil and Gas Program has not identified any instances of groundwater contamination related to hydraulic fracturing since the technology was first used here in the early 1950s," ODNR spokeswoman Heidi Hetzel-Evans said in an email. When considering these statements, however, it’s important to understand exactly what they are saying—and also what they are not saying. What they are saying is that there are no documented cases of groundwater contamination directly from the process of pumping the chemical-laced water and sand into the ground to break the rock apart. They are not talking about the actual drilling of the hole that is fracked or the construction of the drilling well that is used for the fracking process. "There is definitely a lot of misinformation out there," said Hetzel-Evans. "I don’t think the general public understands that the drilling process isn’t fracking." And while there aren’t any groundwater problems due directly to fracking in Ohio, the drilling of wells to prepare for the fracking process has lead to water contamination in at least one case in Ohio. Meanwhile, the first study of its kind in the country is turning up similar evidence. In December 2007, a home exploded in a residential neighborhood in Bainbridge Township in Geauga County, Ohio. A panel assembled by ODNR ultimately found that a poorly-constructed well casing — think of it as a cement seal around the drill hole -- allowed gas to migrate upwards along the edge of the casing and up the pipe. Ultimately, this gas seeped into the home in Bainbridge and caused the explosion. Meanwhile, there is new evidence outside of Ohio that poorly constructed drilling wells used for fracking are leading to problems with groundwater. Duke University researchers found that methane levels were 17 times higher in water wells within one kilometer of hydraulic fracking sites in New York and Pennsylvania than in water wells farther away. The methane levels in those wells showed the same characteristics as methane produced from fracking, as opposed to naturally-occurring methane. Robert Jackson, the professor of environmental sciences who headed up the research, said that the "methane migration" was likely caused by problems with the casing around the drill hole rather than from the methane migrating thousands of feet through the rock from the fracking zone. But he wonders whether the new high-pressure water treatment used in fracking could be the cause. "What I haven’t seen anyone address is whether hydraulic fracturing makes it more likely to cause well casings to leak," he said. "It may be the high pressure involved in fracking makes leaks more common and bigger." Meanwhile, the gas exploration boom in Pennsylvania has begun turning up evidence that the shale gas exploration involving the fracking process could be contaminating groundwater supplies with methane. The state’s Department of Environmental Protection ordered Houston-based Cabot Oil & Gas Corp. to provide and maintain potable water and gas mitigation for residents in Dimock, Pa., who sued over wells polluted in 2009 with methane gas and other contaminants. Another group, from Lenox Township, Pa., sued Houston-driller Southwestern Energy Co. in 2010 claiming their wells were contaminated with fracking fluids. Both suits are tied up in court. So where does that leave Jordan’s claim that "state agencies have not identified one single instance where groundwater has been damaged due to hydraulic fracking." That statement squares with ODNR’s records. But regulators in Ohio have linked water contamination problems in at least one incident to other aspects of drilling such as the construction of the drilling wells. That’s additional information that provides clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, Jordan’s statement grades out at Mostly True.	None	Kris Jordan	None	None	None	2011-07-14T06:00:00	2011-06-15	['None']
pomt-11459	"Since 1990, production of metals in the U.S. has held roughly constant, but the number of people employed in the industry has fallen steadily."	true	/punditfact/statements/2018/mar/08/noah-smith/has-automation-driven-job-losses-steel-industry/	As President Donald Trump weighed imposing tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum, some commentators have warned that this would be a misguided approach. Noah Smith, a columnist for Bloomberg View and a former finance professor, wrote a column in which he noted, among other things, that a crucial issue facing metals-producing industries isn’t foreign competition — it’s automation. Tariffs, Smith wrote, won’t "bring back good jobs at steel and aluminum factories. Since 1990, production of metals in the U.S. has held roughly constant, but the number of people employed in the industry has fallen steadily." That’s due to technological improvements, he wrote: "Productivity has improved, even as demand has stayed more or less constant. Mathematically, that means fewer jobs for steel and aluminum workers. Tariffs won’t change that equation. If anything, by hurting downstream industries like car and equipment manufacturers, the new import taxes will probably kill more factory jobs than they save." We can’t predict what will happen in the future, but we wondered whether Smith is right about the trend lines for production and employment in the American metals-producing sector since 1990. And when we took a closer look, we found that he’s on target. We found data for employment in the primary metals-producing sector, which incorporates five subcategories: iron and steel mills, steel product manufacturing from purchased steel, aluminum production and processing, production and processing of metals other than iron and aluminum, and foundries. Employment levels in this sector have declined reasonably steadily since 1990, despite a period of stable employment during the late 1990s, a sharp but temporary fall during the Great Recession, and a modest uptick over the past year or two in which metals employment growth has outpaced that of the overall economy, said Jed Kolko, chief economist at the jobs site Indeed.com. Overall, since 1990, employment has declined by about 42 percent. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com At the same time, production in primary metals has remained roughly the same since 1990 except for the Great Recession. For most of that period, production has ranged between 90 percent and 110 percent of the benchmark level (the amount produced in 2012): See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com If you put these two statistics together, the overall pattern becomes clear: As production stays roughly the same and as fewer workers make it happen, productivity rises over time. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com The idea that steel in particular has experienced a productivity revolution due to technology "is the same story I have been telling since the early 1990s," said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. "The basic story is that one person can produce a lot more metal today than he or she could produce" a few decades ago. Burtless said he has a brother who’s been working in the coke oven of a steel plant since the mid 1970s and who has "seen first-hand the dramatic reduction in person-power needed to keep integrated steel mills running at full capacity" — as well as improvements in quality. Michael J. Hicks, the director of the Center for Business and Economic Research at Ball State University, agreed that Smith’s analysis is on target. "I would agree that the most likely cause of the productivity gains are technology, though I would interpret technology broadly to include not just machinery but the way that factories organize production, such as internal logistics and the reduction of redundant operations that might be enabled by technology," Hicks said. And J. Bradford Jensen, a professor of international business at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business, added that "imports did have something to do with the loss of employment in steel and aluminum, but the more important factor is technological change and productivity growth," he said. "Tariffs won't change that, much like relaxing regulations on coal and pollution will not bring back many coal-mining jobs," he said. Our ruling Smith wrote, "Since 1990, production of metals in the U.S. has held roughly constant, but the number of people employed in the industry has fallen steadily." His numbers are solid, and experts agree that automation has done significant harm to employment levels in the metal industry. We rate the statement True.

pomt-13980	Says Bernie Sanders "wins California landslide, But ⅔ of his votes aren’t counted."	pants on fire!	/california/statements/2016/jun/10/blog-posting/pants-fire-viral-rumor-bernie-sanders-won-californ/	Polls showed Californians ‘Feeling the Bern,’ shortly before the state’s June 7 primary. Bernie Sanders had pulled even or surged slightly ahead of Hillary Clinton in the Democratic presidential race after barnstorming from Chico to Chula Vista. But early results on Election Day showed Clinton crushing Sanders by more than 20 percentage points. That gap closed steadily as officials tallied more votes (to 12.6 points as of midafternoon June 10, 2016), but remained large enough for media outlets and professional pollsters to declare Clinton the winner. Still, there are those who point to millions of uncounted ballots in the state, and say Sanders was robbed. Justice Gazette, a group that describes itself as a counter to traditional media, is one of them. "Bernie Sanders Wins California Landslide But ⅔ of his Votes Aren’t Counted," the Justice Gazette wrote in an eye-popping headline on June 7. The article added: "In view of the information from polling place workers about Sanders winning by more than a 2 to 1 margin and in view of the removal of 2/3 or more of his votes from the official results, the Justice Gazette declares Bernie Sanders the landslide winner of the 2016 California Primary Election." The Gazette article has been shared widely on Facebook and shows up prominently on web searches about Bernie Sanders and the California primary. Screen shot of Justice Gazette June 7, 2016 headline and article There’s no doubt Sanders ran a strong race in California. But the Gazette’s claim seemed outlandish and ripe for a fact check. Our research Three days after the election, Clinton had more than 2 million votes to Sanders’ nearly 1.6 million, for a lead of about 450,000 votes, according to the California Secretary of State’s website. If there’s any landslide victory, at this point, it’s by Clinton. Of course, the results are not official, as nearly 2.6 million ballots remained unprocessed as of Thursday, June 9, also according to the California Secretary of State. Most are expected to include votes in the Democratic presidential primary. Reports surfaced on Election Day about broken voting machines, incomplete voter rolls and confusion among unaffiliated voters over how to obtain a Democratic ballot. Many voters received provisional ballots that were not immediately counted. Once they are, pollsters expect the gap to narrow, but not close. Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field Poll, told PolitiFact California he does not think Clinton’s lead is in jeopardy. Clinton’s lead "might go down into the single digits, but it’s still going to be a Clinton win," DiCamillo said. The Field Poll surveyed voters who had yet to cast ballots shortly before Election Day and found Sanders had the edge, but only by one percentage point. DiCamillo estimated Sanders would have to win the remaining votes by roughly a 2 to 1 margin to overtake Clinton. "You’re smoking something if you think that’s going to happen," he added. Of the Justice Gazette claim of two-thirds of Sanders’ votes being uncounted, DiCamillo said "nobody can claim to know that." Neither during his speech in Santa Monica on election night, nor since, has Sanders protested the California results. A representative for the Sanders campaign said it had no affiliation with the Justice Gazette story. "No one’s questioning the fundamental integrity of the election," Ben Tulchin, Sanders’ national pollster, told PolitiFact California, in an interview on June 10, 2016. Tulchin added that the campaign believes California can do more to make it easier for independents to vote in a Democratic primary. The Sanders pollster said the campaign expects the California "race to close substantially," perhaps "to low single digits," once all the votes are counted. As for overtaking Clinton’s lead, Tulchin said "there’s a small chance. But it would be highly unlikely." A representative for the Gazette could not be reached. Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., speaks at a rally Tuesday, June 7, 2016, in Santa Monica, Calif. (AP Photo/John Locher) Our ruling After early California primary results showed a big Clinton lead over Sanders, the Justice Gazette posted the headline on June 7: "Bernie Sanders Wins California But ⅔ of his Votes Aren’t Counted." Three days later, Clinton continues to lead Sanders by about 450,000. There are more than two million uncounted votes. But based on polling shortly before the race, showing Sanders even or slightly ahead with voters who had yet to cast ballots, professional pollsters and news outlets say Clinton’s lead could shrink somewhat but is not in danger. Sanders would have to win the remaining votes by a huge margin, something no polls showed in advance of Election Day. There is evidence that California’s complicated voting rules led to problems. That may have prevented some Sanders supporters from voting for him and, for that matter, some Clinton supporters from voting for her. But there’s no proof to back up the outlandish claim that Sanders won California or that two-thirds of his votes were not counted. We rate the Gazette’s claim Pants On Fire.

pomt-04142	"The problem with raising tax rates on the wealthiest Americans is that more than half of them are small business owners."	false	/ohio/statements/2013/jan/03/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-half-wealthiest-americans-are-sm/	As President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner dickered over how to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff, the issue of who might pay more in taxes was a persistent stumbling block. The White House said there could be no deficit deal unless Republicans agree to raise tax rates on the wealthiest households and proposed increasing rates on incomes greater than $250,000 a year for married couples ($200,000 for individuals). Republicans wanted to focus the talks on spending and entitlements. Ultimately a deal brokered by Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, was approved. It allowed rates to rise on incomes above $450,000 for married couples. But during the negotiating, Boehner balked at increasing the maximum 35 percent tax rate on high-income taxpayers at all because of the effects for small business. "The problem with raising tax rates on the wealthiest Americans is that more than half of them are small business owners," Boehner said in a news conference. "Raising tax rates will slow down our ability to create the jobs that everyone says they want." PolitiFact has examined a similar claim Boehner made about small business owners before, and rated it False. FactCheck.org also has looked at the issue, calling it "an incorrect talking point" and a "bogus claim." But we wondered about current figures behind the claim, and several readers asked about its accuracy. We asked Boehner's office how he backed up the statement. His staff said the tax increases would hit half of all small business income, and they pointed us to a January 2012 report from the President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness. The council's report states: "About half of business income now accrues to pass-through entities such as S corporations and partnerships; although the income of such pass-through entities is subject to tax at the individual level, it is excluded from the corporate tax." In other words, Boehner's staff said, many small businesses file their taxes as individuals, not corporations, and 53 percent of all business income is taxed through the individual code. Boehner's staff also cited a report by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation in Congress which said the tax hikes would affect roughly 940,000 small business owners. It, too, found that 53 percent of business income would be reported on tax returns in the top brackets on which Obama would raise taxes. That does show that some small business owners would see taxes go up. But it falls short of supporting Boehner's statement. While the JCT report found that 53 percent of business income would be reported in the top two tax brackets, that is not at all the same as saying that half of the earners are being taxed at that rate. In fact, the JCT estimated that just 3.5 percent of taxpayers with business income in 2013 would fall in the tax brackets that would rise under Obama's proposal. And the JCT said its figures "do not imply that all of the income is from entities that might be considered 'small.' For example, in 2005, 12,862 S corporations and 6,658 partnerships had receipts of more than $50 million." S corporations and partnerships are "pass-through" businesses in which profits pass from the business to individual shareholders for tax purposes. They include sole proprietorships and such partnerships as big law firms and financial funds. Goldman Sachs was classified as a partnership before it went public in 1999. So what is a small business? The Office of Tax Analysis at the U.S. Treasury Department issued a study in 2011 that recognized the need for a clear definition. The authors acknowledge that defining a small business is a matter of setting some subjective parameters. The ones they set include a limit of $10 million in income or deductions to be counted as "small," and a minimum labor deduction of $10,000 to distinguish businesses that don’t have any employees. Other tests they applied excluded businesses on the very low end of the scale, such as those with $4,600 or less net annual income. They defined an "owner" as someone who gets at least one-fourth of income from a small business. Not surprisingly, by narrowing the definition, far fewer tax filers qualified as small businesses. The analysis found that: Only one-fifth of small businesses are employers, using their definition. Only 8 percent of small-business owners have income of $200,000 or more. So 92 percent of small-business owners wouldn’t have been affected by Obama’s proposal. Slightly more than half of small businesses reported total income of less than $50,000, and half of those businesses reported a tax loss for the year. Only 0.5 percent of small businesses reported a profit in excess of $1 million. For those businesses, investment and rental income comprised roughly half of their reported income. Of the taxpayers in the top two brackets that would be increased, only 11 percent reported any small-business income, and only 9 percent qualify as small business owners. Boehner's statement was: "The problem with raising tax rates on the wealthiest Americans is that more than half of them are small business owners." That is wrong on two points -- the "half" and the "small business owners." Of the business income reported on tax returns, half of it would have been taxed at the top two rates, the Joint Committee on Taxation found. But that doesn’t mean half of the earners are paying those rates. And it’s incorrect to call small business owners and millionaires who would see a tax increase one and the same. For top earners who report business income, it is often just a fraction of their total income. They are not the folks operating small manufacturing plants or neighborhood pizza parlors. In fact, only 0.5 percent of small businesses make that kind of money. More often, small businesses are small in every sense -- most have incomes of less than $50,000 and almost all have profits of less than $1 million -- and they wouldn’t be affected by the millionaires tax. Boehner’s statement is not accurate. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates False.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2013-01-03T06:00:00	2012-11-09	['United_States']
pomt-10256	McCain "still thinks it's okay when women don't earn equal pay for equal work."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/aug/27/hillary-clinton/no-hes-just-not-okay-with-one-bill/	Democrats continue trying to drive a wedge between the Republican presidential candidate and female voters, and the equal-pay issue continues to be a theme. The party's most prominent woman, Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, took her turn during her much-anticipated convention speech. Sen. John McCain, she said, "still thinks it's okay when women don't earn equal pay for equal work." That's flatly contradicted by statements McCain has made. On April 23 he said he is "all in favor of pay equity for women," then said in July, "I'm committed to making sure that there's equal pay for equal work." So how can Clinton argue the opposite? The answer lies in a Senate vote earlier this year on an issue involving Lilly Ledbetter, a former manager at a Goodyear Tire and Rubber plant in Alabama. Ledbetter discovered that she was being paid less than her male counterparts and sued for discrimination. The case reached the U.S. Supreme Court in 2007, and Ledbetter lost. The majority said a 180-day statute of limitations in the law had started from the first instance of discrimination, meaning that her suit about more than a decade of discrimination was untimely. Ledbetter became a folk heroine among Democrats (and spoke at the Democratic National Convention). Democrats in Congress responded quickly to the Supreme Court decision, putting together a bill that would allow employers to be sued for every paycheck stemming from a discriminatory pay system, not the discriminatory decision itself. The bill passed the House, and Senate Democrats tried to schedule a vote to pass it there, too. Under Senate rules, 60 votes were needed to consider the bill, and just 56 voted yes on April 23. Barack Obama, Joe Biden and Clinton all voted yes. McCain missed the vote, which was not unusual during his presidential campaign. He later said he would have voted no. McCain was pressed further on the issue – by a 14-year-old girl who quizzed him at a town hall meeting a few weeks later. Here's what McCain said then: "I don't believe that this would do anything to help the rights of women except maybe help trial lawyers and others in that profession." It's a stretch for Clinton to argue that McCain thinks it's acceptable for women not to get equal pay for equal work, when McCain has said the exact opposite. He doesn't support a specific piece of legislation that could make wage-discrimination suits more painful to employers. It's an important bill, it's the most significant equal-pay issue under consideration right now and there's probably a fair way to phrase this attack and make it stick. But opposing that bill is not the same as thinking it's okay if women don't get equal pay for equal work, so we rate the claim False.

pomt-04748	"A Gallup report recently said that nearly 50 percent of small business owners aren't hiring because of what they call ‘regulatory uncertainty.’"	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/29/sher-valenzuela/sher-valenzuela-says-regulation-big-factor-holding/	At the Republican National Convention, the GOP candidate for lieutenant governor of Delaware picked up a frequent complaint of Republicans -- that government regulation is hampering hiring by businesses, particularly small businesses. "A Gallup report recently said that nearly 50 percent of small business owners aren't hiring because of what they call ‘regulatory uncertainty," Valenzuela said. We wondered whether that was correct. We found a survey conducted by Gallup in January 2012 that addresses this point -- the Wells Fargo Small Business Survey, which interviewed 600 small business owners by phone. It has a sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points. Valenzuela can find some support for her comment in the poll results. One of the questions asked was, "Why are you not looking for new employees? For each of the following, please indicate if it is a reason why you are not looking to hire." When offered the option, "Worried about new government regulations," 46 percent of business owners surveyed said yes. That’s fairly close to half. However, that leaves out some important context. For starters, 53 percent -- a majority -- said they did not consider government regulations to be a barrier to future hiring. At least as important, government regulation ranked pretty far down the list of factors offered. Of the eight factors suggested (not counting "other"), concern about government regulations ranked sixth. More popular answers were "don't need any additional employees at this time" (76 percent), "worried revenues or sales won't justify adding more employees" (71 percent), "worried about the current status of the U.S. economy" (66 percent), "worried about cash flow or ability to make payroll" (53 percent) and "worried about the potential cost of health care" (48 percent). In its analysis of the survey data, Gallup took a middle-of-the-road analysis. "The debate over why U.S. small-business owners aren't hiring more aggressively tends to hinge on whether overall business conditions, including a lack of growth and revenue, are the primary culprit as opposed to the potential cost of healthcare and government regulations," Gallup wrote. "Apparently, both sides of the debate are correct. "Small-business owners hire when they need to respond to increased business activity and have the opportunity to grow. Although some small businesses in selected industries and markets have been growing, the weak economy of the past four years has limited overall small-business growth. ... "Given this difficult operating environment, it is not surprising that many small-business owners also worry about potential new health care costs and government regulations. While small businesses are always finding ways to deal with their changing operating environment, including government regulations and health care, these added challenges can be seen as exacerbating an already uncertain and difficult situation. In turn, they become additional reasons to hold back on hiring." Our rating Valenzuela is close to correct when she says that "a Gallup report recently said nearly 50 percent of small businesses owners aren't hiring because of what they call ‘regulatory uncertainty.’" (It’s a bit short of 50 percent, and it was a survey from nine months ago.) However, this claim leaves out some important context. Five other factors ranked higher on a list of eight factors that might be impeding hiring. Essentially, Valenzuela cherry-picked one of the factors to make her point, which suggested that it was the only, or main, reason for the lack of hiring. We rate the statement Half True.

pomt-00852	Says "Jeb Bush has released 10 percent of his emails."	false	/punditfact/statements/2015/mar/18/james-carville/jeb-bush-revealed-much-more-10-his-emails-governor/	Hillary Clinton might be in a bit of hot water for using a private email account for official business as secretary of state, but Democrats eagerly point to similar email issues with presumptive Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush. As governor of Florida, Bush burnished his tech and public access credentials by using a personal email account to supplement the one the state provided. Prior to Clinton’s troubles, Bush set up a special website for the public to browse any of those emails that dealt with official business. Like Clinton, Bush himself determined which ones were private and which would be made public, but the move was largely seen as a way to mark Bush as a candidate who walks the walk when it comes to transparency. This led Democratic activist James Carville to challenge how transparent Bush really is. "Jeb Bush has released 10 percent of his emails," Carville said on ABC’s This Week, March 15, 2015. "He had a private email server. He destroyed his emails." We decided to check Carville’s numbers. Carville’s assistant, Kees Nordin, gave PunditFact the underlying math. "The fact is that of Jeb Bush's 3 million emails (public and private) he's only released 275,000 or just under 10 percent," Nordin said. According to Bush spokeswoman Kristy Campbell, Bush posted nearly 280,000 emails from his personal email account on a website he set up, jebbushemails.com. Back in 2007, Bush gave an off-the-cuff estimate that during his eight years in office he received about 550,000 emails at his personal address jeb@jeb.org. We tried to confirm that number, but Campbell said "It’s immaterial as they are not subject to public records request and not required by law to be retained." In the same interview in 2007, Bush said an additional 2.5 million emails came through other email accounts run by the state. So this is how Carville gets to a grand total of 3 million emails. The question is, did Bush reveal just 275,000 -- or 280,000 -- of them? The answer is no, because most of them have been, and remain, publicly available. Under Florida law, most of Bush's emails to his government accounts are a public record and accessible to people who request them, said Barbara Petersen, president of Florida’s First Amendment Foundation. (The First Amendment Foundation advocates for government transparency and receives major support from foundations and Florida’s news organizations, including the Tampa Bay Times.) "Anything relating to public business is a public record in Florida," Petersen said. "If you comment on a policy, even if the rest of the email is personal, it will be subject to a public records request. It’s a fairly broad definition." Importantly, all of the emails sent to accounts run by the state would have been seen and vetted by state workers, not private staffers or lawyers employed by Bush. They remain the custodian of those records, and Petersen said she believes most of the Bush emails from his official accounts have been retained. The first stop for those emails would be the Citizen Services office, which fields all incoming communications to the governor. While some emails might be purely personal or otherwise exempt and would not be released, they were still part of the state’s public record. The point being, only the 550,000 emails sent to Bush’s personal account would have remained under his exclusive control. The rest remain housed with the state government. What's the point? We can confidently say that the 280,000 emails on the Bush website represent just a fraction of the total number of emails that are "public." While the precise figures are unclear, if 2.5 million emails went to one of the state-run email accounts then all of those were subject to a public records request. So in a rough sense, close to 90 percent of the universe of 3 million emails are public in some form. If you look at just Bush's private emails, about 50 percent are public. Neither number is close to the one Carville cited. We reached out to state officials to see if they can add any information about the number of official emails that are part of Bush's record. We will update this item if we learn further details. A few notes Carville said Bush had a private email server. According to press reports, Bush used a server located in the governor's office. He took the server with him when he left office. Carville also said Bush destroyed the emails he hadn’t revealed. We asked how he knew that and got no reply. Petersen had the same question and noted that Florida law presents a hurdle to destroying emails. "If you made a public record request of Jeb’s email and you thought you didn't get them all, you can file suit in civil court and request an in camera inspection by a judge," she said. Petersen said the state judges which records have archival value and which ones are trivial and can be disposed. Our ruling Carville said that Bush revealed 10 percent of his emails and he destroyed his emails. The numbers don’t add up. The numbers used by Carville himself include 2.5 million emails sent to state run accounts. Those emails are subject to a public records request. It is completely inaccurate to say that Bush only revealed 275,000 or 280,000 emails out of a total of 3 million. A more accurate reading would be that he revealed about half of the emails sent to his private account, and the rest were already available to the press, although some might be held back if they were strictly personal in nature. We rate the claim False.	None	James Carville	None	None	None	2015-03-18T17:53:10	2015-03-15	['Jeb_Bush']
pomt-03870	Florida is "second in the nation in the uninsured."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/mar/08/christopher-l-smith/chris-smith-says-florida-no-2-uninsured/	Florida Democratic Senate leader Chris Smith of Fort Lauderdale has found himself in unfamiliar territory lately: agreeing with Republican Gov. Rick Scott. "Medicaid expansion, Obamacare, teacher raises. Who is this guy?" Smith tweeted on Feb. 21 in response to Scott’s announcements that he would support Medicaid expansion and raises for teachers. Flash forward to March 5, when Scott gave his annual State of the State address. The former state budget slayer and foe of Obamacare gave a speech in which he called for helping the poor, the disabled and teachers. So how does a Democratic leader -- whose role is to attack the Republican Scott -- respond? By telling voters that while the Democrats believe Scott is now on the right track in some areas, the state still has far to go to help the middle class and the poor. Smith’s speech criticized Scott’s past education funding record and called for Scott to give state workers a raise, protect the environment and undo past changes to Florida elections law that contributed to long lines in November. Smith also called on Scott to work with the Legislature to ensure that it supports Medicaid expansion, despite opposition in the House. Scott announced his support for the expansion in February, but has said it isn’t one of his top priorities. Expanding Medicaid would give health care coverage to more of the poorest Floridians. Currently, the program is restricted to children, the elderly, the disabled and pregnant women. "We ask for you to provide true leadership, work with the Legislature and make sure that the House goes on with our Medicaid expansion. We are second in the nation in the uninsured. We need to make sure we expand Medicaid and use the federal dollars that will help our state budget," Smith said. Is Florida No. 2 in the nation for uninsured? Research ranking the number of uninsured We found there are a couple of different ways to account for the uninsured among the states. A spokeswoman for Smith cited an August 2012 article in the Huffington Post that ranked Florida at No. 2 in its share of uninsured residents based on 2010 U.S. Census data. Texas came in first with 26.3 percent, followed by Florida at 25.3 percent, and Nevada at 25.1 percent. The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation keeps track of state health facts and also draws on research from the U.S. Census Bureau. Kaiser examines state populations up to age 64, since people who are 65 and older can get Medicare. By that ranking, the states with the highest percentages of uninsured in 2010-11 were Texas (27 percent) followed by Nevada (25 percent). For third, Kaiser showed a tie between New Mexico and Florida, but Florida was a pinch higher at 24.18 percent compared with 23.85 percent for New Mexico. When looking at only the sheer number of uninsured under the age of 65, Florida was third place with 3.7 million, behind California (7.1 million) and Texas (6.1 million). Finally, the polling organization Gallup interviews residents nationwide about their insurance. A 2011 Gallup poll placed Florida in third for its percentage of uninsured, at 22.9 percent, behind Texas (27.6 percent) and Mississippi (23.5 percent). Why Florida’s rate is so high Smith’s claim about Florida’s high uninsured rate raises questions about why it is so high. John Rother, President and CEO, of the National Coalition on Health Care, which supports health care reform, sent us a list of seven reasons: • The state has many small and low-wage employers who do not offer insurance. • Florida has many seasonal workers who tend to be uninsured. • Florida attracts many pre-Medicare retirees who have lost their workplace coverage but are not yet old enough for Medicare. • Many with pre-existing conditions cannot get coverage. • South Florida is an especially high-cost area in terms of medical claims. • The state has relatively weak and underfunded safety net programs for the uninsured. • Immigrants have a particularly hard time obtaining insurance due to paperwork requirements. Our ruling Sen. Chris Smith said "We are second in nation in the uninsured." There are different ways to measure the uninsured. In terms of sheer numbers, Florida is third. We found the most useful measure is to count Floridians under the age of 65, which includes only those not eligible for Medicare. That measure shows the state in third place in the percentage of uninsured, after first place Texas and second place Nevada. Smith is slightly off on his numbers, but his point is on solid ground. We rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Christopher L. Smith	None	None	None	2013-03-08T14:21:53	2013-03-05	['None']
pomt-07912	Says there have been 50 million abortions since Roe v. Wade was decided.	true	/texas/statements/2011/feb/01/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-there-have-been-50-million-abortio/	Gov. Rick Perry marked the 38th anniversary of what he called "the tragedy" of the U.S. Supreme Court's landmark Roe v. Wade decision by speaking to fellow abortion opponents at the Jan. 22 Texas Rally for Life outside the Capitol building. Perry said that since the 1973 decision, which established abortion as a constitutional right, "50 million, 50 million children have lost their chances. That is a catastrophic number." PolitiFact Texas readers asked us to check Perry's statement. But before diving in, we noted two issues with Perry's use of "children" -- a flash point in the political, moral and scientific national debate over abortion. One, abortion rights supporters dispute calling unborn fetuses "children." Second, an unknown share of the 50 million aborted pregnancies referenced by Perry would not have resulted in live children, due to the natural risk of miscarriages and stillbirths. For our inquiry, we focused on the number of U.S. abortions since Roe was decided. The Roe v. Wade ruling, issued Jan. 22, 1973, struck down a Texas law prohibiting nearly all abortions and held that the right to privacy "is broad enough to encompass a woman's decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy." It said states could not prohibit a woman from having an abortion before viability, the time at which a fetus can survive outside a woman's body. It noted that viability "is usually placed at about seven months (28 weeks) but may occur earlier, even at 24 weeks." After fetal viability, the court said, states could limit abortions provided that their policies met certain requirements, including an exception to protect the life of the woman. Since then, other Supreme Court rulings have affirmed states' rights to approve further restrictions. During the early 1960s, every state except Pennsylvania allowed abortions when needed to protect a woman's life, according to a March 2003 article published by the universally respected Guttmacher Institute, which studies and advocates on issues related to reproductive health. At the time Roe was decided, 17 states allowed abortions in certain other situations such as when pregnancy was the result of rape or incest. In 1972, the year before the Roe ruling, about 587,000 legal abortions were reported to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to a 2005 CDC report. And since 1973? Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed us to a January 2010 report from the National Right to Life Committee, a Washington-based group that opposes abortion, that says about 52 million abortions took place from 1973 through 2009. According to the report, the group arrived at the total using figures from the Guttmacher Institute for 1973 through 2005; estimating a number for the next four years; and finally adding 3 percent to account for under-reporting. The National Right to Life publication says 3 percent is the under-reporting rate estimated by Guttmacher. Using a similar methodology, National Right to Life has since updated its numbers. The new report says that more than 53 million abortions took place from 1973 through 2010. Rachel Jones, a senior research associate at Guttmacher, told us the institute doesn't adjust its numbers — which are estimates based on surveys of facilities where abortions are performed, including hospitals and clinics — for under-reporting. She said a 1994 Guttmacher study had found that some small facilities weren't included in the institute's survey, which indicated that the number of abortions in 1992 was actually 3 percent to 4 percent more than reported. Our attempts to reach officials at National Right to Life were unsuccessful. Next, we sought the most up-to-date abortion data from Guttmacher. Spokeswoman Rebecca Wind provided us with a 2011 report that includes annual data on abortions from 1973 through 2008. The total: 49.3 million. We also sought abortion numbers from other sources. Data from the CDC indicate that there were 37.8 million abortions from 1973 through 2006. However, according to the CDC's website, states are not required to report abortion information to the agency, so in some years, the numbers are incomplete. For example, the CDC's 2006 data do not include information on abortions in California, Louisiana or New Hampshire. Representatives of abortion rights organizations Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice Texas told us that the Guttmacher Institute is the best source for this information. Summing up: Perry's statement indicating that there have been 50 million abortions in the United States since 1973 appears to be on target. The Guttmacher Institute estimates that there were 49.3 million abortions in the U.S. through 2008 — 700,000 shy of 50 million. Considering that Guttmacher says there were more than 1 million abortions in both 2007 and 2008, it's reasonable to conclude that the United States has reached the 50 million mark. We rate Perry's statement True.	None	Rick Perry	None	None	None	2011-02-01T06:00:00	2011-01-22	['None']
pomt-02641	San Antonio has seen "67% growth" in water customers "in the last 25 years, 0% more water used."	false	/texas/statements/2014/jan/17/robert-puente/san-antonio-water-customers-52-only-used-21-more-w/	San Antonio’s growth was coupled with an eye-popping statistic during the latest Texas Tribune Festival public policy conference. Robert Puente, CEO of the San Antonio Water System, said during a Sept. 20, 2013, panel discussion that the city-owned utility has seen "67 percent growth in the last 25 years, 0 percent more water used." San Antonio has been called a "poster child" for water conservation. As it has risen to become the seventh-largest city in the United States, its leadership has used multiple approaches to tackle the water worries facing all of Texas, where the population is rocketing and the future looks dry. But did 67 percent more customers settle in without using more water? By phone, Puente said the percentages he aired "need to be updated." The water system’s vice president for public affairs, Greg Flores, told us by email that Puente’s rates covered 1984 through 2009. During that period, according to a chart Flores sent us, the population served by the utility rose from 800,627 to 1.34 million while water produced fell from 191,431 acre-feet to 186,112 acre-feet (an acre-foot is the amount needed to cover an acre to a depth of 1 foot, equal to 325,851 gallons). That’s a nearly 68 percent increase in population served and a 2.9 percent decrease in water produced. Then again, the cited period wasn’t the latest 25-year time span when Puente spoke. Flores said the chart was generated from the utility’s 2008 statistics. Flores sent a web link to the most recent edition, the utility’s "2011 Stat Book," and gave us the numbers for 2012, which we used to check the six most recent 25-year spans for which data is available. The 2012 data was not available when Puente spoke at the conference, Flores said, though data through 2011 was. "Compilation of data for a particular year is typically not completed until the end of the following year," he said. The 25-year spans showed fluctuations partly explained by the weather: Flores noted that 2011 was "the single hottest, driest year in Texas" and said water use remained atypically high through the 2011-13 drought. 2007 was a very wet year for San Antonio, he said. 25-year span Population served Acre-feet used 1987-2012* Up 55.2% Up 23.4% 1986-2011 Up 51.8% Up 21% 1985-2010 Up 55.6% Up 5% 1984-2009 Up 57.6% Down 0.6% 1983-2008 Up 59.9% Up 21.5% 1982-2007 Up 69.1% Down 7.3% *2012 data were unavailable when Puente made his claim. The oldest span we checked, 1982-2007, showed more dramatic change than Puente’s statement: 69 percent growth and a 7 percent drop in water use. But the most recent span for which data was available when he spoke, 1986-2011, saw a 52 percent increase in customers alongside a 21 percent increase in water used. That’s still not bad, a long-time Sierra Club leader told us by phone. Ken Kramer, water resources chairman for Sierra’s Texas chapter, told us, "It’s still very significant. Especially as compared to other major cities around the state. … It is great that San Antonio is doing this, and it does provide a model for other cities that haven’t had that success yet." The trend statewide is toward less water use, Kramer said. State and federal standards, with such requirements as water-efficient showerheads and toilets, have reduced Texans’ per-person water use. Texas as a whole averaged out to about 151 gallons used per person per day in 2007-11, according to the Texas Water Development Board, with the state’s nearly 26 million people using 169 gallons apiece a day during hot, dry 2011. Flores said, and the utility’s stats confirm, that San Antonians reduced per-person water use from around 200 gallons a day in the 1980s (the utility’s stats show the decade averaged out at 197 gallons per day, to be precise) to about 140 gallons a day now (2007-11 average out at 137 gallons per day). Daily water use per capita for 2011 in Texas’ six largest cities shook out this way, according to the water board: Houston, 191 gallons; San Antonio, 148 gallons; Dallas, 197 gallons; Austin, 156 gallons; Fort Worth, 166 gallons; El Paso, 143 gallons. What got San Antonio saving? "A big federal hammer," Puente told us. "Back in the early 1990s, a federal judge actually was going to lay down pumping rules, limit our ability to pump water out of our aquifer, and gave us till the end of the legislative session to pass certain rules that we would impose on ourselves," he said. San Antonio and nearby areas, he said, were hit by the federal deadline because of endangered species that relied on the Edwards Aquifer. Flores outlined some of the Alamo City’s approaches: Smarter use of water pulled from the Edwards, including the nation’s largest direct recycled water delivery system, routing treated wastewater to users such as golf courses, the River Walk and local industry. Pumping all the Edwards water it’s allowed to every year, and storing what it doesn’t use in the Carrizo Aquifer -- which isn’t porous like the Edwards, but hard-packed sand, Flores said. The Edwards water sits there, in fact barely commingling with the Carrizo water, and San Antonio has been extracting it as needed for the past three years. New sources such as a $145 million desalination plant set to start tapping a deeper, saltwater aquifer in 2016. Not pumping as much water in the first place, aka conservation. The water utility educates users and subsidizes ways to use less, both in residential and commercial systems. Flores said the utility has approved conservation projects based on the $400 price to buy rights to an acre-foot of Edwards water for a year. If the project was cheaper than buying the water, the utility implemented the plan. Giving away 325,000 low-flow toilets, even hiring plumbers to help low-income residents install them, cost less than the unsaved water would have, Flores said. Same for helping Coca-Cola retool to clean bottles with pressurized air. Last year, though, mindful of the rising cost of water from the Edwards and other sources, the utility raised the ceiling: Now a project has to save more than buying the water at $1,100 per acre-foot, he said. Outdoor water usage, Puente said, is the next area of focus, with the utility offering rebates to water customers who want to convert a parched part of their lawn to a deck or patio. Our ruling Puente said San Antonio has seen "67 percent growth in the last 25 years, 0 percent more water used." Those are cherry-picked, out-of-date stats, vintage 1984-2009. Up-to-date figures available when Puente spoke, covering 1986-2011, show that as the population served grew 52 percent, water usage increased 21 percent. San Antonio may outpace other cities in water conservation. This claim still washes out as False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

pomt-01492	Says Mary Landrieu voted to fund benefits for illegal immigrants ahead of veterans.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/25/bill-cassidy/bill-cassidy-says-mary-landrieu-put-illegal-immigr/	Rep. Bill Cassidy, a Republican running for Senate in Louisiana, mixed two buzzwords of the 2014 campaign cycle — immigrants and veterans — in an ad attacking Democratic opponent Sen. Mary Landrieu. How are the two related? Cassidy said Landrieu chose to fund one but cut from the other. "What would you choose? To fund benefits for veterans or for illegal immigrants? I would never put illegal immigrants ahead of veterans. But Mary Landrieu did," Cassidy said in the ad. "Instead of fully funding veterans’ benefits, she voted to give benefits to those here illegally. No wonder she supports Barack Obama and his amnesty plan." That’s quite the charge, but is it accurate? We decided to take a look. Cassidy is referring to the budget agreement reached in December 2013 between Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash. — the top budget negotiators for their respective chambers. The bill prevented another government shutdown and provided some relief from sequestration. (Forgot about the sequester? It’s the 10-year, across-the-board budget cuts that were supposedly so deep and detested by both parties that Congress was expected to reach a grand budget compromise to avoid them, but never did.) Under the agreement, budget caps for discretionary spending are set at $1.012 trillion for fiscal year 2014 and $1.014 trillion for fiscal year 2015. For 2014, that figure is $45 billion more than it would have been under sequestration, and it’s $18 billion more for 2015. How did Congress pay for that? In part, by reducing the cost-of-living adjustments for the retirement pay of veterans under the age of 62. That provision sparked immediate blowback from veterans groups and some members of Congress. But the budget agreement passed the House on Dec. 12, 2013, overwhelmingly, 332-94. Cassidy voted for it. When the bill moved to the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., blocked any amendments so the fragile agreement could get an up-or-down vote as it passed the House (another government shutdown was looming in January). But Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., tried to reopen the amendment process so he could introduce an amendment that would have restored the pension cost-of-living reduction for veterans. To pay for increased spending caps, Sessions wanted to instead close a loophole that allowed some undocumented immigrants with children to collect the Additional Child Tax Credit. Sessions' amendment never came up for a vote. The Senate did take up a procedural vote, however, on whether to reopen the amendment process so Session’s amendment, and possibly others, could be heard. However, that vote failed on Dec. 17 largely along party lines, 54-46, with Landrieu voting with her Democratic colleagues. The next day, the bill passed the Senate on a vote of 64 to 36. Cassidy spokesman John Cummins said Landrieu in the Senate could have voted to open the budget agreement to amendments and chose not to. Cassidy did not have that opportunity in the House because Republican leadership pushed it through under structured rule, meaning no amendments were allowed. (For what it's worth, we didn't see any statements from Cassidy lamenting this.) Even if we agreed with this line of reasoning — which we don’t — it doesn’t absolve Cassidy from voting for, and defending, the same reductions to veterans benefits. As both FactCheck.org and the Washington Post Fact Checker noted, on the very day the Senate passed the budget agreement, Cassidy defended the cuts to military pensions on conservative commentator Laura Ingraham’s radio show. Ingraham: "You supported this budget deal and now we find out that military folks who have sacrificed so much are being asked yet again to sacrifice — this in terms of their pensions — and yet we can’t seem to close loopholes for welfare benefits going to illegal aliens and yet you supported this. Why?" Cassidy: "There are no benefit cuts to people who are retiring, there is an adjustment to their cost of living, which starts off not for all, but those who retire before age 62." Cassidy went on to further defend the cut to military pensions as logical reforms without really touching on the second aspect of Ingraham’s question about tax credits for undocumented immigrants. Finally, the House and Senate voted to restore those cuts to veterans benefits the following February. Under the restructured agreement, anyone who signed up for military service before 2014 would not see a change to their benefits. Both Cassidy and Landrieu voted for this, and Obama signed it into law on Feb. 15. Our ruling Cassidy said, "I would never put illegal immigrants ahead of veterans. But Mary Landrieu did." There are several problems with this statement. First is the false dichotomy that Landrieu had a choice between funding undocumented immigrants and veterans in the budget agreement. That amendment never actually came up for a vote. But even putting that aside, Cassidy suggests that his position is vastly different than Landrieu. In fact, they both voted in favor of the same budget agreement to reduce future cost-of-living adjustments for veterans benefits (they both also voted to restore them), with Cassidy going on conservative radio to defend these cuts. Cassidy ignores his own record to inaccurately criticize Landrieu’s. That extra level of hypocrisy bumps his claim to ridiculous, and we rate it Pants on Fire.

pomt-14775	A Muslim immigrant in Michigan can list his second, third or fourth wives as "extended family" and qualify for welfare.	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/dec/07/chain-email/youtube-video-says-michigan-muslims-can-list-multi/	A widely shared YouTube video makes outrageous claims about Muslims, multiple wives and welfare. The year-old video, which is based on a chain email, says polygamous Muslim men who live in Michigan can receive welfare benefits for up to four wives through a loophole. "It's official. The camel's nose is in the governmental bureaucratic tent in Michigan, feeding on our hard-earned money we pay in taxes!" the video says. "Muslim men are allowed four wives. So when they immigrate to America, they simply list wife number two, three and four as ‘extended family,’ to qualify for welfare and a myriad of other taxpayer-funded government programs." A few readers wanted to know if the video has any truth to it. Are Michigan taxpayers actually paying for Muslims to rake in welfare benefits for up to four wives? Why Michigan? Why Muslims? The video seems to have originated from cleantv.com, which claims to offer "family-friendly television broadcasting and Video On Demand services…[and] Internet-ready television sets." The site’s YouTube channel features dozens of politically charged videos. (Check out Snopes for an in-depth look at the video’s entire narrative.) We can’t be sure why the video focuses on Michigan. The state does have one of the largest Arab populations in the country, and various Michigan state government agencies offer Arabic versions of documents to accommodate those residents. But there’s nothing unique about Michigan’s applications for welfare compared to other states. As for polygamy, it is illegal in the United States. The U.S. government only recognizes one legal spouse. There are no reliable estimates for the number of American Muslims living in polygamous families, though NPR quoted experts putting it between 50,000 and 100,000. Still, the idea that a Muslim man could simply bring himself and multiple wives through the American immigration system is off-base. The immigration process for spouses is lengthy and complicated. Even if a man successfully sponsors his wife for an immigrant visa, the State Department specifically outlines that "in cases of polygamy, only the first spouse may qualify as a spouse for immigration." Any other wives would have to apply for an immigrant visa on their own. When the immigrants legally settle in the United States, they can apply for welfare programs, such as cash through Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, food stamps or Medicaid, provided they meet requirements for residency, expenses and assets. A man could only claim one wife for purposes of welfare benefits, because multiple wives is a no-no. The video suggests that a Muslim man could register his second, third or fourth wives as "extended family" for extended benefits. Is that really how it’s done? It wouldn’t exactly work like that, experts said. "For cash assistance and Medicaid, as per federal rules, only one spouse can be included in a group for determining eligibility," said Bob Wheaton, a spokesman for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. "Any other non-related members of the household can’t be included." In a polygamous home, the other wives would not be recognized as legal family members. Food stamps However, a family doesn’t face those same requirements when applying for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as food stamps. Federal rules for SNAP eligibility depend on the number of household members. So it’s theoretically possible for a Muslim man, or any man, to collect food assistance for multiple wives. "Whether those household members are related or not does not matter under federal rules," Wheaton said. "What matters is whether they live in the same household and prepare food together." Of course, that would apply to any polygamous family, not just Muslim ones. A 2008 CBS report showed how fundamentalist, polygamist families in Colorado City, Ariz., receive big welfare checks: The man marries one wife legally and then weds and has kids with multiple other wives recognized by the church. Then, the other wives register for benefits as single women with children. (For reference, the maximum monthly allotment for food stamps is $1,169 for a family of eight. Each additional person in the household brings in an extra $146.) Michael Wiseman, a research professor at George Washington University, said this is legal under SNAP rules. "The SNAP benefit formula recognizes ‘economies of scale,’ so that breaking the subfamilies apart increases total benefits paid," he said. "Thus it is not fraud, as long as any contributions to the second family from the first are reported by the second family and included in benefits calculation." The states could theoretically crack down on these loopholes in the system, but Wiseman said it might not be worth the trouble. "The problem is, of course, deciding how to write rules that prevent this and yet ensure that some groups are subject to more intense investigation than others," he said. "My guess is the fiscal impact is minimal." Our ruling A viral YouTube video said that in Michigan, a Muslim man "lists one wife as his, and signs the other two or three up as extended family on welfare." The video and the chain email its based off of is highly misleading and ignores important realities of the U.S. immigration and welfare system in an attempt to drum up anti-Muslim sentiment. For one, the rules of the immigration system make it very hard for immigrants who may have multiple wives to enter the country, as the United States does not recognize polygamy. There is also no evidence that Michigan or any other state would allow or encourage Muslims to sign up extra wives as "extended family." For most welfare programs, it would not be possible for additional wives to qualify for assistance. However, a Muslim man with multiple wives (and meets the right income and residency requirements) could theoretically benefit through food stamps because it is based on the number of people in the household, not just legally recognized family members. But this would be true for any polygamist family, not just Muslims in Michigan. Flaws in the system don’t exactly mean the government is subsidizing polygamy. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-09719	When White House communications director Anita Dunn said that Mao Tse-tung was "one of her favorite philosophers, only Fox News picked that up."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/oct/27/bill-oreilly/oreilly-accuses-media-not-following-foxs-lead-anit/	In a recent segment with conservative commentator Ann Coulter, Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly slammed other media outlets for failing to cover a story — unearthed by Fox — that a senior aide to Barack Obama had told high school students that one of her "favorite political philosophers" was Mao Tse-tung, the late Chinese communist leader who is blamed for the deaths of millions of people. The O'Reilly-Coulter exchange, aired on Oct. 23, 2009, came amid a war of words between the White House and Fox. Anita Dunn, the White House communications director and a longtime Democratic operative, emerged this month as one of the leading figures in a White House push to discredit Fox News, telling the New York Times ' Brian Stelter, "We're going to treat [Fox] the way we would treat an opponent. ... We don't need to pretend that this is the way that legitimate news organizations behave." Dunn's comments added heat to an already simmering feud, and it wasn't long before Glenn Beck — the conservative Fox host who frequently riles the White House and its allies — responded in kind. On the Oct. 15, 2009, episode of his Fox show, Beck aired a video of a speech Dunn made to high school students. In it, Dunn imparted a series of life lessons to the students, the third of which "actually comes from two of my favorite political philosophers: Mao Tse-tung and Mother Teresa, not often coupled together, but the two people that I turn to most to basically deliver a simple point, which is, you're going to make choices. You're going to challenge. You're going to say why not. You're going to figure out how to do things that have never been done before." Dunn then told an anecdote about how Mao triumphed as an underdog over his rival, nationalist leader Chiang Kai-Shek, during the Chinese civil war. Asked how he would win, Mao said, according to Dunn, "You know, you fight your war, and I'll fight mine." Dunn continued, "And think about that for a second. You don't have to accept the definition of how to do things, and you don't have to follow other people's choices and paths, okay? It is about your choices and your path. You fight your own war. You lay out your own path. You figure out what's right for you. You don't let external definitions define how good you are internally." Beck's discovery that a senior Obama White House official had said nice things about a Communist leader with a bloody place in history was catnip for Fox, and for a host of conservative bloggers. Let's explore whether O'Reilly is correct that "only Fox News picked that up. Nobody else picked that up." It's certainly true that Fox played the story to the hilt: In a 10-day span after the story broke, Fox shows mentioned the incident, either in depth or in passing, roughly two dozen times. As for other news organizations, we found they rarely treated it as a news story. But there was a fair amount of discussion about Dunn's remark, usually in commentaries or analyses of the Fox-White House feud: — In opinion columns . Two syndicated columnists based at the Washington Post wrote about Dunn's Mao comment. Kathleen Parker, a conservative with a maverick streak, wrote a pox-on-both-their-houses column, while Charles Krauthammer (a frequent panelist on Fox) penned one that was critical of Dunn and favorable to Fox. Both ran on the Post 's op-ed page and were reprinted in newspapers across the country. A handful of newspapers also wrote editorials that cited the episode. Meanwhile, Philadelphia Inquirer columnist Dick Polman published a column in the paper (and later an expanded version online) that took Fox and Beck to task. "How helpful is Beck, after all, when he morphs into Joe McCarthy on Fox News, and attempts to red-bait a top Obama aide by painting her as a communist sympathizer in thrall to Mao Tse-tung?" Polman asked. "Last week, Beck characterized Anita Dunn as a 'fan of a guy who killed millions of people.' He then aired a video clip that showed Dunn quoting Mao during a June speech. Shocking! What Beck naturally neglected to tell his credulous viewers is that politicians of all stripes have been quoting Mao for years. Such as: 'In the words of Chairman Mao, it’s always darkest before it’s totally black.' (That was John McCain). Such as: 'Mao said politics is war without bloodshed. Clearly there are some metaphors that sit nicely with politics.' (That was Christian conservative leader Ralph Reed.)" — As media criticism . The Washington Post' s media critic, Howard Kurtz, made brief references to the Mao controversy as he dissected the Fox-White House feud in two of his daily Media Notes blog posts. — In remarks by TV commentators . On the Oct. 18, 2009, edition of CNN's State of the Union with John King , commentators discussed the war between the White House and Fox. Bill Bennett, a conservative, brought up the Dunn-Mao connection. Saying it "isn't a small thing — it's a big thing," Bennett told the panel, "Now, look, I am not a right-wing nut, and when people go after Obama and say 'socialism and Marxism,' I say, take it easy, you know, calm down. But when she stands up, in a speech to high school kids, says she's deeply influenced by Mao Tse-tung, that — I mean, that is crazy." Meanwhile, Lou Dobbs, on his nightly news show on CNN, gave a brief hat tip to Beck's story (adding that Mao may have been responsible for "as many as 100 million" deaths) before proceeding into a plug for his syndicated radio show, where viewers could "hear more of my thoughts on all the president's czars and their fascination with Mao Tse-tung." On CNN (which has had its own war of words with Fox, its longtime cable news rival), the Situation Room put resident curmudgeon Jack Cafferty on the Mao story, asking viewers what they thought. "T.J." wrote to Cafferty, "Enough already. Stop reporting anything about Glenn Beck. He is an insane nut job. His opinion is of no value to anyone, except other nut jobs. Stop enabling this psychotic fraud by constantly reporting what he has to say about, well, anything." "J.R. in Idaho" wrote, "When you report on the stories you have created, you have become illegitimate. Fox is 'balloon boy.'" Others were critical of the White House for taking on a fight it was unlikely to win. — Only rarely as straight news . The day after Beck aired the video, CNN's Suzanne Malveaux and Ed Hornick posted a Web story in which Dunn said that the Mao quote "is one I picked up from the late Republican strategist Lee Atwater from something I read in the late 1980s, so I hope I don't get my progressive friends mad at me." She added that "the use of the phrase 'favorite political philosophers' was intended as irony, but clearly the effort fell flat — at least with a certain Fox commentator whose sense of irony may be missing." On Oct. 18, the Associated Press moved a story that recapped the controversy in a straightforward way. (It was written by the AP's television writer, David Bauder, not one of its national political writers.) A day later, the Los Angeles Times ' Top of the Ticket blog briefly mentioned the Mao-Dunn flap in an item about the larger Fox-White House conflict. And the New York Times ' Caucus blog took up the issue twice. The first time, on Oct. 16, 2009, Sheryl Gay Stolberg wrote a post explaining the Dunn-Mao controversy, saying that "the war of words between the White House and Fox News is intensifying — and getting personal." Two days later, the blog offered an update on the Fox-White House war, adding the following quote from Dunn: "Let it be noted that I also quoted Mother Teresa, but no one is accusing me of being a saint!" So let's recap. If O'Reilly's point is that few media outlets played the story as worthy of straight news coverage, he's probably right. With only a few exceptions, the media coverage we found consisted either of opinion columns (both pro and con), purposeful mentions of it by TV commentators or as a subject for laughs. However, if we stick to his precise wording, O'Reilly is certainly incorrect that "only Fox News" picked up the story. While Fox beat the drum more heavily than anyone — not surprising, since it was the network's story to begin with — CNN and the blogs of several major newspapers also mentioned it. In addition, syndicated versions of two Washington Post columns appeared in many newspapers around the country. We rate his statement False.

pomt-03901	Due to the sequester, "people are going to be unsafe. Homes are going to burn."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/mar/01/ami-bera/rep-ami-bera-says-due-sequester-people-are-going-b/	With an across-the-board federal cut looming, Rep. Ami Bera, D-Calif., took to the House floor to sound a sequester fire alarm. "Mr. Speaker, the American public is tired of the blame game. They want to see real solutions. Irresponsible, across-the-board spending cuts are not a real solution. If we don't act to avoid these spending cuts, we threaten the very safety of our community and our country. "There will be $50 million cut from firefighting funding. In my own district, that's $1.5 million in SAFER grants. Let me translate that. My fire chief, Kurt Henke, says that's the equivalent of one engine company and slower response times. People are going to be unsafe, homes are going to burn. We have to act. "Mr. Speaker, I urge you to lock us in a room and cut a deal. Let's figure out how to avoid sequestration. This is devastating to our economy and our country." Really? Homes are going to burn because of the sequester? Let’s recap how the sequester works. Unless a deal is struck, most types of federal spending must be cut by a uniform amount -- tentatively 7.9 percent for most types of defense discretionary funding and 5.3 percent for non-defense discretionary funding. (Certain programs are shielded from sequestration cuts entirely, including Social Security, federal retirement payments, veterans compensation, Medicaid, Pell Grants, food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, and veteran's health programs. Medicare would be cut by 2 percent.) The uniform cuts must be applied to any "program, project or activity" that isn’t otherwise exempted. We found two main federal firefighting grants programs: Staffing for Adequate Fire & Emergency Response (or SAFER) Grants, which focus on personnel, and Assistance to Firefighter Grants (AFG), which focuses on non-personnel expenditures such as equipment. The Sacramento example The Sacramento Metropolitan Fire District, the one headed by Chief Henke, won grants from both in December 2012. including a $5.6 million SAFER grant for "hiring." (It also won an AFG grant worth $370,277 for "wellness and fitness programs," but we won’t factor that in since Bera didn’t mention it.) If all SAFER grants nationally were to be cut by an equal amount, then a 5.3 percent reduction in Sacramento’s SAFER funding would be roughly $300,000. That’s less than the $1.5 million Bera cited, and Bera’s office acknowledged to PolitiFact that the congressman may not have given the correct figure. Here’s a fuller explanation. In an interview, Henke said his department has lost millions of dollars because of a decline in property tax receipts. The fire department closed three firehouses and sidelined six engine companies, which led to "significantly longer response times," Henke said. To improve its response to calls, the department sought SAFER grants to cover the cost of two additional engine companies. Henke said they would help the department meet the "two in, two out" rule, which requires that two firefighters remain outside a burning building before two can enter it. Because $1.5 million is the ballpark estimate for the cost of one engine company, that’s where Bera got his number. But that’s speculation; that’s five-times the proportionate cut we calculated. So Bera’s number was a significant exaggeration. The national outlook Beyond Sacramento, is it accurate for Bera to say that, due to the sequester, "people are going to be unsafe. Homes are going to burn"? We spoke with experts who said there is some truth to that. They said cuts to firefighting grants will put more pressure on existing fire services and, on the margins, could result in greater damage or casualties, though the extent is certainly speculative. "In some cases, response will be affected," said James Pharr, a professor in the Eastern Kentucky University College of Justice and Safety who previously served as a firefighter, fire investigator, fire chief, fire marshal and emergency management director. "Slow or inadequate response can reduce the ability to prevent death or serious injury." Thomas J. Cova, director of the Center for Natural and Technological Hazards at the University of Utah, emphasized that sequester comes on top of budgetary strains caused by the recession. "Budgets have already been reduced in the last four years at all levels -- local, state, and federal -- to the point that more cuts could noticeably compromise response capabilities," Cova said. "All the obvious corners have already been cut, and that means, unfortunately, that further cuts could result in structures burning that otherwise wouldn’t, due to reduced response times, personnel, and equipment." Shawn S. Kelley, the director of strategic services for the International Association of Fire Chiefs Kelley, said rural departments stand to be hurt more than big cities because the rural agencies are more dependent on federal grants. Still, we see several reasons why Bera’s claim is exaggerated. • Federal funds are a small portion of most fire departments’ budgets. In Sacramento’s case, this year’s total budget is $153 million, meaning that the SAFER grant accounts for 3.6 percent of the budget. That means the sequester could hold back two-tenths of 1 percent of the department’s entire budget. We were unable to find specific data nationally, but several experts agreed that Sacramento’s case is not unusual. "Most municipal fire departments are locally funded," said William John Siembieda, who heads the city and regional planning department at California Polytechnic State University. "Federal dollars are not a large part of annual budgets." In other words, Bera didn't have enough justification to sound such a strong alarm. The kind of rhetoric Bera used "been rejected" by firefighter organizations in trying to fend off proposed cuts, said Anthony Brown, an Oklahoma State University professor who specializes in fire and emergency management. • Not every locality will be losing federal firefighting money due to the sequester. Both programs are competitive grants, meaning that a locality will apply for federal funds and, if it’s lucky, it will get a grant. Many localities will either decline to apply for the grants or fail to receive them. So while Sacramento may lose money due to sequester cuts, not every local fire department in the country will. Those departments that didn’t receive grant money in the most recent round won’t be directly affected by such sequester cuts at all. • It can be difficult to determine whether local cuts or sequester cuts are at fault for personnel decreases. SAFER funds are, in effect, responding to what is happening at the local level. If a firefighter is laid off, or is about to be laid off, and then sees his job restored by a SAFER grant, then sees that funding taken away due to the sequester, is that all the fault of the sequester, or is it partially the fault of the local budgetary situation? We think it’s a mixture of both, and thus it’s a stretch for Bera to blame the sequester. • The Obama administration proposed even bigger cuts for these programs in its fiscal year 2013 budget proposal. In its 2013 budget, the Obama administration proposed an amount 17 percent lower than its level two years earlier, an average of more than 8 percent per year. That’s a bigger cut than the sequester itself. So if the administration or its allies are going to cry foul at sequester cuts, the same charge could be leveled at the administration’s own policies. Our ruling Bera said that due to the sequester, "people are going to be unsafe. Homes are going to burn." The precise impact of sequester cuts on firefighting is speculative, but it’s safe to assume there will be some impact on the margins, at least in places that receive federal firefighting grants. Still, Bera’s language is overheated, both on Sacramento’s case in particular and in the overall picture. In the communities lucky enough to receive SAFER grants, such funds typically account for a small portion of the total departmental budget. In addition, firehouse woes do not begin and end with the sequester; local budgets and policies also deserve some blame. Finally, blaming the sequester obscures even larger cuts the administration itself proposed prior to the sequester. On balance, we rate Bera’s claim Mostly False.

pomt-05215	"In Galveston, Texas, they have allowed people to privatize part of their Social Security. And people are building wealth."	true	/virginia/statements/2012/jun/08/ew-jackson/ew-jackson-says-galveston-has-privatized-plan-lieu/	When Republican E.W. Jackson extols free markets, he points to the gulf coast in Texas. "Right now, in our own country, in Galveston, Texas, they have allowed people to privatize part of their Social Security. And people are building wealth," he said in a recent debate between the four Republicans running in the June 12 primary for the U.S. Senate. We decided check out Jackson’s statement. It required two determinations: 1) Does Galveston have a private retirement plan in lieu of Social Security taxes and; 2) If so, how does the system build wealth? The Galveston Plan Greg Aldridge, a spokesman for Jackson’s campaign, pointed us to a number of news stories about Galveston’s alternative to Social Security. The plan has been considered as a potential model for changing the federal entitlement. The program is an oddity in American retirement-security policy. In 1981, municipal employees of three adjoining Texas counties -- Galveston, Matagorda and Brazoria -- voted to withdraw from Social Security and initiate a system of individual accounts to provide retirement, survivor and disability benefits. In 1983, the federal government barred any more such moves by local governments. Today, there are about 10 million Americans in the workforce who do not contribute and will not benefit from Social Security. Most of them are employees of school districts and higher education institutions that opted out before the ban. Here’s how the Galveston plan works: Instead of paying into Social Security, county government workers contribute a similar amount to their investment accounts. The General Accounting Office wrote in 1999 that the plan made "very conservative" investments in bonds and preferred stocks. The investments are made through fixed annuity contracts with private firms that guarantee minimum annual rates of return. While each worker is assigned an individual account, the employee does not control all investment decisions. The interest earned on investments is deposited in each worker’s account. Employees can put extra money beyond the required amount into their accounts. The required retirement contribution is 9.7 percent of gross pay -- of which 6.1 percent is paid by the employees and 3.6 percent by the county. Social Security traditionally collects 12.4 percent in payroll tax on up to $106,800 in total salary, with workers and employers evenly splitting the levy. But under President Barack Obama’s FICA tax cut over the last two years, the federal government has collected only 10.4 percent -- of which 4.2 percent is paid by the worker. Social Security invests the contributions in government securities. When the Texas county employees retire, they may choose to take the entire account’s earnings in lump sum, take monthly payments for a specified number of years, or accept smaller monthly payments in a lifetime annuity. The Galveston plan does not offer cost-of-living increases to those receiving monthly checks. Social Security provides a lifetime annuity with annual cost-of-living adjustments. And, unlike the Galveston system, it also provides increased payment to beneficiaries with spouses and dependents. Does it build wealth? Jackson supports a Republican proposal that would create individual Social Security accounts and phase in investment options. He says on his website that the proposal would "allow participants to obtain better returns on the market" than they do under the current system. But Jackson, while extolling the Galveston plan during the debate, did not claim that it was outperforming Social Security. Aldridge said that Jackson, in saying the program was "building wealth," simply meant that individuals have ownership and some control over their retirement account. Galveston plan designer Rick Gornto, who is president of First Financial Benefits Inc., claimed that as the major advantage to the plan. "The key thing is you don’t have ownership in Social Security or a right to that except the right that they decide to give you, which can change," he said. Gornto could not provide an average annual return for plan investors because each chooses a mix of mutual funds to go along with the more stable bond investments in the fund. But, he said, retirement funds must, by contract, increase annually by at least 3.75 percent or 4 percent. During good times, Gornto said employees have seen annual returns of 10 percent or better. Does the Galveston plan outperform Social Security? The most recent studies of this question are 13 years old and provided a complicated answer. The GAO and the Social Security Administration each analyzed the Galveston plan in 1999. They generally agreed that the higher an employee’s salary, the more he or she would benefit from the counties’ system. But middle- and low-income earners would likely collect less from Galveston plan than they would from Social Security. We spoke to Eric Kingson, professor at Syracuse University’s School of Social Work and co-chairman of Strengthen Social Security, a group that wants to maintain benefits from the federal entitlement. He said the Galveston program is a "savings plan, not a retirement insurance plan" that best serves a small group of workers. "The only people who might do better are single persons who have higher incomes," he said. "Particularly for low and moderate income persons, they are not better off. If you are not married, not going to drop dead early, not leave widows or survivors and don’t want automatic life insurance for children, then it could be better." Our ruling Jackson is correct that Galveston, Texas, has a privately run retirement plan in lieu of Social Security. The program benefits municipal workers in Galveston County and two neighboring counties. It’s debatable whether the Galveston plan, overall, offers workers a superior financial alternative to Social Security; in some cases it does, in others it doesn’t. But, as Jackson said, the plan does build wealth because it allows workers to create individual retirement accounts that are guaranteed to earn interest each year. The employees have some control over their accounts and can leave them to their survivors. So we rate Jackson’s claim True.	None	E.W.

pomt-06379	Says "Essex County residents suffer the second highest property taxes in the nation."	half-true	/new-jersey/statements/2011/nov/02/joseph-chiusolo/essex-countys-property-taxes-among-highest-nation/	Essex County residents have a second-place finish to marvel at -- only it’s not one they may be too happy about. In his bid to unseat county Freeholder Leonard Luciano, Republican candidate Joseph Chiusolo pointed to the county’s high property taxes in an Oct. 25 press release. In fact, according to Chiusolo, "Essex County residents suffer the second highest property taxes in the nation." PolitiFact New Jersey found that Chiusolo’s statistic was accurate to some degree. In terms of property taxes paid as a percentage of the median household income, Essex County ranks second in the nation. But when two other types of measurements are considered, Essex County is up there, but not second. "The bottom line is, if you’re sixth or two, the taxes are high," Chiusolo told us. "People out there are hurting." Let’s explain where Chiusolo received his numbers. Chiusolo, the deputy mayor of Cedar Grove, referred us to data compiled by the Washington, DC-based Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax policy. The data represents five-year averages for the period between 2005 and 2009. For that time period, the Tax Foundation ranked property taxes in owner-occupied homes in counties according to three measurements: median property taxes paid; taxes as a percentage of the median home value; and taxes as a percentage of the median household income. Each statistic comes with a margin of error. On that last measurement, Essex County ranked second among 2,922 counties with property taxes representing about 8.04 percent of the median household income. The only county above Essex was neighboring Passaic County, where property taxes were about 8.44 percent. So, Chiusolo is right on that point, but according to those two other measurements, Essex County didn't score as high. Essex County’s median property tax bill was about $7,489, ranking it sixth in the nation. At about 1.9 percent of the median home value, Essex County ranked 92nd. Thomas Ammirato, a consultant working on Chiusolo‘s campaign, pointed out how an earlier press release specified that the ranking refers to the percentage of income. But we told Ammirato that this fact-check is based on the Oct. 25 press release. Still, Chiusolo’s overall point is accurate that Essex County has some of the highest property taxes in the nation -- and as far as other New Jersey counties, it’s not alone. Among the top 10 counties for the five-year average of median property taxes paid, seven of them are in New Jersey: Hunterdon, Bergen, Essex, Somerset, Morris, Union and Passaic. One of the major factors behind the rankings is the high property values in New Jersey, according to Mark Robyn, an economist with the Tax Foundation. Kim Rueben, who directs the state and local program of the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, added that part of the reason for high property taxes in the Garden State is that a lot of money to pay for local schools comes from property taxes. New Jersey also has more generous government services than other states, Rueben said. "It’s a high government-service state," Rueben said. "New Jersey has relatively high taxes and relatively generous public spending." Our ruling In a press release, Chiusolo claimed "Essex County residents suffer the second highest property taxes in the nation." That’s true if you’re looking at property taxes as a percentage of the median household income. But Essex County’s property taxes rank sixth and 92nd according to two other measurements.

pomt-04674	"The auditor [for the city of Providence] was not locked out" of access to the city's finances.	mostly false	/rhode-island/statements/2012/sep/07/david-cicilline/u-s-rep-david-cicilline-says-when-he-was-mayor-pro/	U.S. Rep. David Cicilline is facing a tough reelection campaign, in part, because by the time he finished his tenure as mayor of Providence, the city was in horrible financial shape and Cicilline, during his 2010 congressional campaign, had characterized the city's fiscal status as "excellent." Making matters worse are allegations that Cicilline tried to hide the problems from Providence's internal auditor. Not surprisingly, the issue came up Sept. 4 when he debated his opponent in the 1st District Democratic primary, Anthony Gemma, on WPRO radio. "The fact of the matter is he locked out the city auditor," Gemma said of Cicilline. "So why would you lock out the city auditor, when the auditor needs to file for a Freedom of Information request to get in to do the very job that he was supposed to do, when you're not trying to hide something?" Cicilline called the allegation "absolutely false. The auditor was not locked out and so that is absolutely untrue." Cicilline's emphatic denial seemed ripe for an audit of its own. At the center of this dispute is James J. Lombardi III, who served as Providence's internal auditor and, as an employee of the City Council, had a sometimes contentious relationship with the Cicilline administration. He is now the city's treasurer. (The city also has an external audit done every year by an outside company. That report, dated January 2011, confirmed the financial problems.) In the fall of 2010, when Cicilline was winding down his tenure as mayor and in the middle of a tough race for the U.S. House, Lombardi was complaining that Providence's finances were in trouble and he was having trouble getting access to information. We found some justification for Gemma's assertion that Lombardi was "locked out." Two Providence Journal stories by two different reporters in March 2011 reported that Lombardi said the administration had canceled his computer access when he began to ask questions about the city's finances, forcing him to seek information by filing formal requests under the Rhode Island Access to Public Records Act. Lombardi now says that he was never locked out of his computer. His computer access to city financial records was never canceled, he said, because he never had such access in the first place. Nor was he ever physically locked out of his office or anywhere else where he tried to get records. That would mean Cicilline is correct in the strictest sense of the phrase "locked out." But you can still be figuratively locked out if you are denied access to something you're legally entitled to. Providence's City Charter requires the City Council to appoint an internal auditor who "shall have access to the books and records of all offices, department and other agencies of the city." That section of the charter offers no limitation. The auditor reports to the council, not the mayor. Lombardi, whose complaints about his inability to get information from the mayor's office go back to 2004, told us that in this case the problem wasn't that he was denied the information. The problem was the timeliness of the responses he was getting. A key issue was whether the city's reserve fund -- sometimes called the rainy-day fund -- was being severely depleted. City records show that on Jan. 11, 2010, Lombardi had requested copies of all authorization forms transferring money in and out of the reserve fund in January 2010, which the Cicilline administration was tapping because of its budget problems. Three days later, he wrote to the city solicitor's office asking it to assist with the request because, if that request was treated like other requests he had made in the past, "I will never see it." Lombardi said if that couldn't be done, he would request the data under the state open records law, adding that he thought it was "ridiculous" that he would have to do such a thing. He did not get the information until October 2010, according to a report he filed with the City Council. That's nine months. When we asked the Cicilline campaign about the delay, spokesman Eric Hyers said "there was absolutely not any plan to delay him, to do anything secretly or to stonewall him." Hyers said Lombardi "had access to whatever he needed. He oftentimes had very unrealistic expectations as to what the turnaround time should be and how soon he should be provided with certain information. At times he assumed that City Hall officials were his own personal staff; they had their own jobs to do." Hyers said "this constant tug of war over what he was entitled to and when he should have it was not unique to 2010. It started several, several years ago." We saw two other examples. In May, according to city records, Lombardi requested a cash flow analysis and was told by the Cicilline administration that (a.) one didn't exist and (b.) the administration was not obligated to generate one just for him under the open records law. Also in May, he asked Bruce Miller, the city's finance director, for a schedule detailing how the Cicilline administration planned to balance the city's budget. He was told that, until the plan was finalized, he wasn't entitled to see it under the open records law. Lombardi said he ultimately received the information he wanted in October 2010. That was after the Democratic primary, where Gemma was one of Cicilline’s opponents, and before the general election, where Cicilline ran against Republican John Loughlin. Loughlin was able to use that information in a Channel 12 debate, during which Cicilline, while touting his accomplishments as mayor, made the now-infamous declaration that Providence was in "excellent financial condition." That record would become seriously tarnished after the election when an independent audit made the full extent of Providence's financial problems painfully clear. Our ruling Former Providence Mayor David Cicilline said that the internal auditor for the city "was not locked out" of access to the city's finances. The auditor now says that he was not locked out in the usual sense of the word. But there's a fine line between being locked out and stonewalled. Cicilline's spokesman emphatically says that "neither of those happened." But the record shows that Lombardi faced many months of delay in getting information he was entitled to by the City Charter. He was forced to use the state’s open records law to get information and waited months for it. And key information -- that Cicilline had been tapping the rainy day fund -- wasn’t provided until October 2010, after Cicilline’s primary victory. Whether it was part of a long-running political wrangle between the mayor and the City Council, which hires the internal auditor, is irrelevant. Open record laws require the release of information regardless of the motives of the person seeking it. The auditor was not locked out in the strictest sense. But the inability of the internal auditor to get information that might have led to a timely disclosure of the city's serious financial problems had the same effect. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

pomt-13786	"Hillary Clinton invented ISIS with her stupid policies. She is responsible for ISIS."	false	/florida/statements/2016/jul/20/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-blames-hillary-clinton-creati/	Donald Trump and his vice presidential candidate Mike Pence gave their first joint interview to 60 Minutes and used the show to point the finger at Hillary Clinton for ISIS. Trump told CBS’s Lesley Stahl that the United States will have to declare war against ISIS -- and he vowed to do it with very few troops on the ground to wipe out ISIS. "Hillary Clinton invented ISIS with her stupid policies," Trump said in an interview that aired July 17. "She is responsible for ISIS." Trump has made this claim repeatedly. It’s wrong, and we’ll explain why. The roots of ISIS Trump was referring to Clinton’s actions related to Iraq, Libya and Syria, said Trump spokesman Stephen Miller, who referred us to a previous Trump speech on the topic. The sources of ISIS are complex and interconnected, said John Pike, an expert on defense and director of GlobalSecurity.org, a website that provides information on defense. "She may ‘share some of the blame’ but there is more than enough share to go around. She was in no sense the singular author of the thing," Pike said. For starters, the terrorist group’s roots pre-date Obama’s presidency and Clinton’s role as secretary of state. It has gone by several names since 2004, when long-time Sunni extremist Abu Mus‘ab al-Zarqawi established al-Qaida in Iraq (AQI), also known as the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) and more recently the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), according to the National Counterterrorism Center. After he was killed in a 2006 U.S. airstrike, the group became the Islamic State of Iraq. In 2013, the group was referred to as the Islamic State of Iraq and al-Sham and then just the Islamic State in 2014. Given the timing, Democrats blame President George W. Bush for the creation of ISIS, because al-Qaida flourished after the overthrow of Saddam Hussein. Obama’s decision to leave Iraq after 2011 contributed to the security vacuum that gave ISIS the chance to put down roots there, said Michael O’Hanlon, a security expert at the Brookings Institution, a centrist-to-liberal group. (O’Hanlon is one of hundreds of voluntary advisers to the Clinton campaign but has a minor role.) You could say the blame touches both Bush, for creating a strong space for al-Qaida in Mesopotamia, and Obama, for giving the group a chance to regroup. As for Clinton, Trump’s campaign points to her vote as a senator to authorize force in Iraq in 2002. She later said she regretted that vote. Republicans have blamed Obama for not keeping 10,000 troops in place in Iraq, which they say could have deterred the opening for ISIS. However, Obama inherited a timeline to exit Iraq from Bush, and there was no agreement to leave a large force behind. Trump’s campaign also points to Clinton’s positions on Syria and Libya. In 2011, she echoed Obama’s support for regime change in Syria in 2011. "The transition to democracy in Syria has begun, and it's time for Assad to get out of the way," she said while secretary of state in August 2011. Regime change in Libya also gave ISIS an opening, said Christopher Preble, a defense expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. "Clinton's enthusiasm for regime change in Libya in 2011, which Obama endorsed, resulted in the collapse of order there, which ISIS and others have exploited," he said. "That is a fair criticism, in my opinion." It’s possible to argue that these factors -- withdrawing from Iraq, the administration’s lack of support to anti-Assad rebels in Syria and the decision to intervene in Libya -- contributed to the power of ISIS, said Austin Long, a Columbia University international and public affairs professor. "Then Sen. Clinton's vote for the Iraq war could also be seen as contributing the preconditions for the emergence of al-Qaida in Iraq," Long said. "So Trump's argument cannot simply be dismissed out of hand." However, Clinton was in favor of supporting Syrian rebels and was overruled by Obama and advocated strongly for maintaining a moderate troop presence in Iraq after 2011. "So on both of those points, I don't think it was Clinton leading Obama -- rather, it was the reverse," Long said. "The Libya intervention and the vote for the Iraq war are thus the only points in the argument that actually stand up to scrutiny." On her vote related to the Iraq war, Clinton was many of many in both parties who supported the intervention advocated by Bush. "On Libya while this clearly appears to have been a mistake in hindsight it was a fairly minor contribution to the emergence of ISIS, which grew out of the Iraq and Syrian conflict," Long said. Our ruling Trump said "Hillary Clinton invented ISIS with her stupid policies. She is responsible for ISIS." There were several factors that contributed to the growing power of ISIS, but it’s misleading to pin the responsibility solely on Clinton. For starters, the roots of ISIS trace back to 2004, when Bush was president and before Clinton was Obama’s secretary of state. She did vote to authorize force in Iraq in 2002 while a senator, but that was advocated by the Bush administration and the vast majority of senators. The intervention in Libya, which she supported, did give ISIS an opening, but Trump is overstating her role by saying she is responsible for ISIS. This claim is inaccurate.

pomt-06885	Says that when he was governor of Utah, he worked with the state Legislature to create a flat tax that "cut income taxes by 30 percent."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/jul/28/jon-huntsman/jon-huntsman-touts-record-enacting-flat-tax-how-ac/	Every Republican candidate claims to be a tax-cutter, but former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman says he's done something that few other Republicans can claim: he simplified the state's income taxes and passed a flat tax. During a recent house party in Belmont, N.H., Huntsman responded to a voter's question about whether the aim of the federal tax system should be to raise revenue or influence behavior. "That's one of those trick questions, right?'' Huntsman asked. "Possibly,'' said Bill Goetz, a retired, manufacturing executive living in Belmont. Huntsman went on to describe his philosophy and pointed to his record in Utah. "We got a flat tax out of it, we cut income taxes by 30 percent, it was a cost-neutral affair where we took out the deductions, we took out the biases almost completely, some we didn't get out, and you know what? The state came to life in part because of that.'' Republicans frequently talk a good game about supporting a flat tax, but they often have difficulty getting political support to change the complicated tax laws. So we wondered if Huntsman and the Utah legislature had succeeded in overhauling the state law to the point where it can be considered a flat tax -- and whether they cut income taxes by 30 percent. The Huntsman campaign pointed us to published reports this spring and in 2007 that explained how Huntsman began pushing for the changes soon after he took office in January 2005. "We need a tax policy that is not only friendly to our citizens, but also creates a competitive environment for business. Business as usual will leave us behind our neighboring states," he said during his first State of the State speech in January 2005. Huntsman and the Legislature achieved their goal with two changes in tax law over two years. When Huntsman took office, there were six income tax brackets ranging from 2.3 percent to 7 percent. Ultimately, Huntsman and the Legislature approved a single rate of 5 percent. They created a much flatter tax, stripping away most of the deductions and credits. Utah taxpayers still adjust their income in ways such as counting interest earned on bond income or deducting from income the withdrawals they make from medical savings accounts. The research arm of the Utah Legislature maintains it was not a flat tax in the purest sense. "Although the new system has a single statutory rate of 5.0 percent, it is not a proportional or 'flat' income tax system. Rather, Utah’s new income tax system remains progressive through tax credits,'' said a January 2010 report of the Utah Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel. (A progressive tax system is one in which richer people pay a higher percentage of their income in taxes than poorer people do.) Roughly 90 percent of taxpayers get to claim as a credit from state taxes some of what they claim as deductions and tax exemptions under the federal tax code. The credit phases out and goes away from those making very high incomes in the state. This makes the effective tax rate about 3 percent for Utah taxpayers earning $70,000 a year in 2008 and 4 percent for a household with $100,000 in taxable income, according to the legislative group's analysis. "There's no question this is a single rate tax -- but with the credit, the overwhelming majority of taxpayers do not pay 5 percent of their income,'' said Phil Dean, the policy analyst who authored the 2010 study. Conservative groups give Huntsman high marks for the overhaul and have said they consider it to be a flat tax. The libertarian Cato Institute gave Huntsman the highest score of any governor on tax policy in 2006. Likewise, the Club for Growth praised Huntsman's tax reform while adding there were some "minor blemishes"' that included other tax increases during his tenure. (It's worth noting that both groups fault Huntsman for increases in state spending that occurred under his watch.) In general, most taxpayers ended up paying less in taxes. The Office of Legislative Research and General Counsel estimated that about 97 percent of taxpayers were paying the same or less compared to the 2005 system. As for Huntsman's claim that they "cut income taxes by 30 percent," we find that is a significant exaggeration. He is close to correct if you compare the statutory rate in the top tax bracketbefore and after the tax system changed. The top rate declined from 7 percent to 5 percent, which is a decrease of 28.6 percent. But there are two problems with this measurement. First, it doesn’t address the lower tax brackets. Remember, the lowest rate went up from 2.3 percent to 5 percent. So Huntsman’s 30 percent decrease in the statutory rate didn’t apply to them. That said, it’s worth noting that residents in the lowest tax brackets didn’t necessarily end up paying more in taxes, because under both approaches they got credits that reduced their tax bill. (In fact, about 97 percent pay the same or less in taxes than they did under the old system.) Which brings us to the second problem with Huntsman’s 30 percent description -- that just looking at the drop in the statutory rate, as Huntsman does, says very little about how a taxpayer actually fared after the change. Even after the imposition of the new system, a Utah resident’s tax bill is heavily dependent on their specific circumstances. The 2010 report found that very few taxpayers saved more than $300 on their tax bill, and those who did were mostly in the top 10 percent of earners. Instead, for the bottom 70 percent of earners, the typical savings was between zero and $200. And a $200 savings for someone earning $55,000 is about four-tenths of 1 percent. That’s a much more modest in-pocket savings than a listener would assume from hearing Huntsman’s 30 percent figure. "In dollars and cents, for single taxpayers the annual income tax cut worked out to between $25 and $100,'' Dean said. "Most married taxpayers got a tax cut of $50 to $200." Dean added that a cut in the sales tax effectively doubled the overall tax cut for most families. But even that wouldn’t make the savings approach a 30 percent tax-bill reduction for the vast majority of taxpayers. Our ruling Huntsman said he passed a flat tax and "cut income taxes by 30 percent." On the flat tax question, the changes under Huntsman certainly made it a flatter tax than the one it replaced, since the changes he oversaw combined several tax brackets into one. But the tax remains more complicated to calculate than a pure flat tax would be. In fact, Utah’s system of tax credits make the tax somewhat progressive in practice, which is something a true flat tax would not be. Meanwhile, Huntsman’s 30 percent claim is more misleading. It’s true that the statutory rates in the top bracket declined by almost that much, but the actual reduction in tax dollars paid was far smaller for the overwhelming majority of taxpayers -- usually less than 1 percent of a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income. We think most people hearing Huntsman's comment would believe he was touting a 30 percent cut in what people actually pay at tax time, and the numbers aren’t close to that. So we rate his claim Mostly False.	None	Jon Huntsman	None	None	None	2011-07-28T17:20:24	2011-07-04	['Utah']
pomt-08445	Says gas pumps in different parts of Texas are missing state inspection stickers and/or their inspections are out of date--and that's cheating consumers.	half-true	/texas/statements/2010/oct/16/hank-gilbert/hank-gilbert-says-gas-pumps-every-texas-department/	Hank Gilbert, Democrat for state agriculture commissioner, stood outside a Tyler gas station in September, saying the station's pumps hadn't been inspected by the state to make sure they're working properly since July 1997. "All over the state, we found stations in every (Texas Department of Agriculture) region that either haven't been inspected in years or they have no inspection stickers on them," Gilbert said, according to the Sept. 16 video his campaign posted online. "If this was inspection stickers for vehicles and you had 20 percent of all the vehicles on the road without inspection stickers, it would be in the news media every day and the state would raising all kinds of Cain because of the revenue being lost to the state. But the revenue is not being lost to the state here, the only people here that are getting cheated are the consumers." Sticker-gate? Roll in the Truth-O-Meter. Background: State law requires each gas pump to be inspected at least every four years by a Texas Department of Agriculture inspector, or more often if a consumer makes an inquiry. The department says an inspector "will place an 'out of order' tag on any pump not dispensing the correct amount of fuel within the allowable tolerance." The pump must be repaired, then re-tested by a TDA inspector who will place a new seal on the pump before it can be used again. Agency spokesman Bryan Black told us in an e-mail that from 2007 to Oct. 4, 2010, the agency inspected 390,837 fuel pumps, with the time between inspections averaging 2.6 years, meaning some pumps have been inspected more than once. So, how often are inspection stickers missing from pumps? Also, how often does the state fail to inspect them in the required time? We came up empty on those questions, though a list of inspected stations posted online by the agriculture department shows that in each of the department's five regions, some pumps flunked inspections in the latest review period. From Aug. 5 to Oct. 4, 2010, the agency found 190 stations (including four in Austin) with pumps out of compliance. When we inquired about the number of stations around the state with pumps that have not been inspected, Black replied that the burden to seek inspections is on retailers that sell gas. He said in an e-mail that fuel retailers are required by law to register annually with the department and that violators are investigated and held accountable. Black said in an e-mail: "Since 2007, TDA has quadrupled the penalty for noncompliance with our state's weights and measures laws, created new consumer protections for fuel quality, begun posting violators on the agency website, implemented unprecedented market blitz inspections for those not complying with our laws, and heavily published a toll free hotline for all Texas drivers to use to report noncompliance to TDA." Next, we sought to interview Gilbert about the pumps he says lack inspections or have out-of-date inspection stickers. Gilbert's campaign manager, Vince Leibowitz, said in an e-mail that Gilbert wouldn't talk to PolitiFact Texas, which he said Gilbert considers slanted toward Republicans. Later, Leibowitz sent us e-mails listing 15 stores where he said Gilbert identified pumps out of compliance with the inspection law. In Amarillo, according to Gilbert, seven stores had pumps with no inspection stickers. In the Tyler area, the list shows two stores with pumps having expired stickers and two with pumps lacking inspection stickers. Gilbert's campaign says a store in Trinity has a sticker indicating it was last inspected in the second quarter of 2004 and most pumps at two stores in Round Rock, north of Austin, lacked stickers, meaning they had no proof they'd been inspected. Leibowitz said Gilbert also spotted a store in Weslaco with out-of-date pump stickers. Using a map of agriculture department districts, we confirmed that the identified stations are spread among all the agency's regions, as Gilbert said in Tyler. We lacked travel resources to eye most of Gilbert's proclaimed sightings, but Austin American-Statesman colleagues stopped by the two Round Rock stores. On an Oct. 9 visit by Jay Godwin, a Quix convenience store at Highway 79 and Interstate 35 in Round Rock had 2007 inspection stickers posted on three pumps, with seven pumps lacking stickers. Roger Ingram, general counsel for Strasburger Enterprises, Inc., which owns the store, later told us he didn't know why the pumps lack stickers. "They can be peeled off by just about anybody," Ingram said. On Oct. 11, the newspaper's Miguel Liscano checked a Wag a Bag store noted by Gilbert, on Interstate Highway 35 South; none of its six pumps had an inspection sticker. Cary Rabb, president of Wag a Bag, later told us the pumps were changed out about three months ago, and the company expects the state to inspect the replacement pumps. Separately, Black guided us to an agency website that displays the inspection status of stations county by county. On the site, we tried to check the inspection status of the stations identified by Gilbert, finding several--including the Round Rock stores--with inspections within the past four years, as the law requires. In other parts of Texas, five stores named by Gilbert had their pumps inspected within four years, according to the site, and two Tyler stores had pumps inspected after Gilbert aired concerns there, with some pumps not passing. We found no record on the state site of six Gilbert-identified stores. Gilbert's camp responded to our findings with a statement from Gilbert: "A pump that does not bear a current inspection sticker is, as far as the consumer knows when he or she fills up with gas, uninspected. If it was inspected at some point in the last four years and doesn't bear seals, it is still non-compliant." In an e-mail, Black confirmed that every gas dispenser should have a state inspection seal on it. Possible reasons a pump lacks a sticker, he said, include a flunked inspection, a replaced or refurbished "pump cabinet," someone peeling off the state sticker, a station shifting its pumps without notifying the state and a station opening pumps without registering them with the state. In a later e-mail, Black cautioned against concluding a pump without a sticker has not been inspected, saying any such claims would need to be verified in the agency's database. Scott Fisher, vice president for policy for the Texas Petroleum Marketers and Convenience Store Association, told us that it's "unrealistic" to think all of the hundreds of thousands of pumps across the state would always show inspection stickers. And Chris Newton, the association's president, pointed out in a subsequent e-mail that big ol' Texas leads the nation in pumps subject to regulation. Another factor in pumps lacking stickers, he wrote, is that "many pumps are re-manufactured devices that feature an older façade with an older (state) sticker. The device may in fact be properly registered, but may not have a new sticker." Our call? We're persuaded there are pumps in every TDA region missing inspection stickers, as Gilbert says. However, the absence of stickers doesn't always means pumps haven't been duly inspected, our peek into the state database suggests. Gilbert's grab-your-pocketbook punch line--that consumers are being cheated--isn't proved out. We rate Gilbert's statement Half True.

pomt-14977	The gun industry is "the only business in America that is wholly protected from any kind of liability."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/oct/16/hillary-clinton/clinton-gun-industry-wholly-protected-all-lawsuits/	At the first Democratic debate of the 2016 presidential race, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton criticized opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., for supporting a 2005 law that shields the gun industry from certain lawsuits. Clinton voted against this law when she was a senator, and she has lambasted it several times on the campaign trail this month. "Probably one of the most egregious, wrong, pieces of legislation that ever passed the Congress when it comes to this issue is to protect gun sellers and gun makers from liability," she said in Iowa Oct. 7. "They are the only business in America that is wholly protected from any kind of liability. They can sell a gun to someone they know they shouldn't, and they won't be sued. There will be no consequences." Is Clinton right? Are gun makers and dealers "wholly protected" against any kind of lawsuit, and do no other industries have similar immunities? Short answer: No. The gun industry is susceptible to some lawsuits, and there are federal laws restricting liability for a number of other types of businesses. As support, Clinton’s staff sent us a public health journal article that argues the gun industry’s "broad immunity" against litigation inhibits safe manufacturing and distribution of firearms, though it does not directly address her claim. Exceptions The law at issue is the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which was signed into law by President George W. Bush and seen as a victory for gun rights advocates. The purpose of the law is to protect gun dealers and manufacturers from lawsuits when their products are misused. For example, if a person buys a gun legally and then uses the gun to intentionally kill someone, the gun dealer and manufacturer cannot be held liable for the crime under the law. While opponents argue that the law stops some victims from having their day in court, supporters say the law protects gun dealers and manufacturers from frivolous and expensive legal proceedings. In any case, Clinton goes too far in saying the gun industry is "wholly protected from any kind of liability." The law lists several situations that are not protected from liability. It does not protect gun dealers who transfer a gun knowing it would be used for criminal purposes, nor those who knowingly break state or federal law if the violation results in harm. Gun manufacturers can also be sued if the gun, when used properly, causes injury because the product is defective. "The statement is incorrect insofar as it suggests that gun makers are totally free from liability," said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles who specializes in gun law. Some opponents of the law argue that the liability protection is so broad and ambiguous, and the exceptions so narrow, that some legitimate lawsuits won’t have a chance to appear in court. But this is different from saying the gun industry is wholly immune to all lawsuits. Clinton also said the gun industry is the "only" business in America with this total liability protection. We know that it doesn’t have total protection, but do other sectors have something similar? Not the only one The act "is not the first federal law to grant a particular industry immunity from tort liability," said Timothy Lytton, a law professor at Georgia State University, who edited a book on gun industry litigation. Possibly the most analogous rule -- in that it protects a specific group of potential defendants from a specific liability theory -- is one that offers some immunity to online service providers, said John Goldberg, a law professor at Harvard University and an expert in tort law, in an email to PolitiFact. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act blocks victims of online defamation from suing service providers (like Comcast) and content providers (like YouTube) for failing to monitor or remove defamatory posts uploaded by customers. In a prior interview with NPR, Goldberg called the gun industry law particularly "aggressive" in terms of the liability protections granted. Most of the experts we surveyed also mentioned a vaccine manufacturer liability law passed in the 1980s. Under the law, victims of injuries that they say were caused by defective vaccines are not allowed to sue vaccine manufacturers. This differs from the gun legislation, however, because it established the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program, through which alleged victims can make a claim and receive compensation. "By contrast, (the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act) simply prohibits certain kinds of tort claims against the gun industry without providing plaintiffs any alternative means of pursuing their claims," Lytton said. There’s also some liability protection in the medical devices and airline industries, noted Walter Olson, senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute and expert in tort law. For example,the 1994 General Aviation Revitalization Act said small aircraft manufacturers cannot be sued for accidents involving aircraft more than 18 years old. "It’s not at all unique to the gun industry. It’s a version (of liability law) Congress developed for an industry that was under very heavy attack," Olson said, referring to the slew of litigation against gun sellers and makers that prompted Congress to pass the law. Our ruling Clinton said the gun industry is "the only business in America that is wholly protected from any kind of liability." Clinton is talking about a law that says the gun industry is protected from liability in certain instances, but the law also specifies several situations in which the gun industry is susceptible to lawsuits. Further, Congress has passed a number of laws that protect a variety of business sectors from lawsuits in certain situations, so the situation is not unique to the gun industry. We rate Clinton’s claim False.	None	Hillary Clinton	None	None	None	2015-10-16T11:22:53	2015-10-07	['United_States']
pomt-09668	The Senate health care bill "would leave 24 million people without insurance coverage."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/20/mike-enzi/se-mike-enzi-says-senate-health-care-bill-will-lea/	Republican Sen. Mike Enzi, whom Democrats had once hoped to woo for bipartisan support of a health care bill, attacked the version put forth on Nov. 18, 2009, by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. "Like the Pelosi bill, the Reid bill is government-centered, not patient-centered," Enzi said "It’s chock-full of new taxes and higher health care costs that would threaten jobs, weaken our economy, punish families and small businesses trying to make ends meet, and stick our children and grandchildren with the bill." That's all pretty standard fare from Republican opponents of the Democratic health care plans being debated in Congress. But we were intrigued by another criticism leveled by the Wyoming senator, that the Senate bill "would leave 24 million people without insurance coverage." That uninsured figure cited by Enzi comes from an analysis of the Reid bill by the Congressional Budget Office. The report concludes that under the Reid bill, the share of legal nonelderly residents with insurance coverage would rise from about 83 percent currently to about 94 percent. Specifically, the report estimated that the number of nonelderly people who are uninsured would be reduced by about 31 million by 2019, leaving about 24 million nonelderly residents uninsured. So who are those 24 million who would be left uninsured? About a third of them are illegal immigrants, the CBO report states. So who are the other two-thirds (16 million) left uninsured? We asked three health care experts: John Holahan at the Urban Institute; Leighton Ku, a professor of health policy at George Washington University; and Kathleen D. Stoll, director of Health Policy at Families USA. They said those people mostly fall into several main categories: • People who are deemed able to afford health insurance but simply decide the tax penalties are not high enough to persuade them to buy it. Some young, healthy people, for example, may decide it's cheaper to simply pay the tax penalty rather than purchase insurance, Stoll said. The same is true for some wealthy people who are self-insured. "These are basically people who say, 'It's not worth it to me,' " Ku said. • People exempt from tax penalties because the cost of health insurance comes to more than 8 percent of their income, even if they are getting federal subsidies. These are generally people with a lower income, but not so low as to qualify for Medicaid. Without a penalty, many of those people may decide to continue not to buy insurance. "These are people on the lower end of the income scale, but not the poorest of the poor," Ku said, generally people who make anywhere from 133 percent to 300 percent of the poverty level. • People who are eligible for Medicaid, but simply don't sign up. Some people just think it's a hassle to sign up for insurance, even when it's free, Ku said. About 60 percent of people eligible for Medicaid today simply don't sign up, Holahan said. "People with very low incomes don't always know how to navigate a lot of things in life. People don't necessarily value health care, and they don't take the time to fill out the necessary paperwork." • Then there are those who are in transitional stages of life -- perhaps a job change -- and don't take steps to close the insurance gaps between jobs. The CBO report found that the Senate bill was less effective in reducing the number of uninsured compared to the version of the health care bill that passed the House. While the Senate version was estimated to reduce the number of uninsured by 31 million (leaving 24 million uninsured), the House plan was estimated to reduce the number of uninsured by about 36 million, leaving about 18 million uninsured. That's largely because the House tax penalty for not getting insurance is a lot harsher. Under the House bill, people who refuse to purchase health insurance will be hit with a tax penalty equivalent to 2.5 percent of their adjusted gross income. The Senate plan calls for a tax penalty of $95 in 2014, going up to $350 in 2015, $750 in 2016, and graduated up in ensuing years based on inflation adjustments. Given differences between the House and Senate bills that cause the Senate plan to leave more uninsured, we certainly think it's fair for a senator to criticize the plan in that regard. But since this criticism comes from a Republican senator, we would be remiss if we did not point out several other political realities. A CBO analysis of the main Republican health care plan, which was put forward by House Republican leader John Boehner, concluded it would reduce the number of uninsured by only about 3 million people (as opposed to 31 million in the Reid plan). "It has not been a particularly high priority for the Republican Party to expand the number of people who get health insurance coverage," Ku said. Again, a third of the people who would remain uninsured under the Reid plan are illegal immigrants. You may recall that many Republicans criticized Democrats for not taking enough precautions to ensure that illegal immigrants are barred from a public option and also argued that illegal immigrants ought to be prohibited from buying insurance in any government-sponsored health insurance exchange. And the biggest factor accounting for fewer uninsured in the Reid plan, as opposed to the House plan, is that the Senate plan has less severe penalties for those who do not buy insurance. But many conservatives have criticized Democrats for the mandate, arguing that the government ought not get involved in requiring health insurance. Still, the bottom line is that Enzi said the Reid plan would leave 24 million people uninsured, and the CBO confirms that figure. We rate his statement True.

pomt-00381	"When Abraham Lincoln made the Gettysburg Address speech, the great speech, do you know he was ridiculed? He was ridiculed."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/07/donald-trump/was-lincolns-gettysburg-address-initially-ridicule/	Few people would have had "Gettysburg Address" on their bingo card for President Donald Trump’s Sept. 6 rally in Billings, Mont. But Trump did riff on the famous mid-Civil War speech by President Abraham Lincoln. The 273-word address, memorized by countless schoolchildren, was delivered for the dedication of the National Cemetery of Gettysburg in Pennsylvania, at the site of a bloody but pivotal battle in the Civil War. Here’s what Trump said at the rally: "You know, when Abraham Lincoln made the Gettysburg Address speech, the great speech, do you know he was ridiculed? He was ridiculed. "He took the horse and carriage up from the White House, he wrote it partially in that carriage and partially at a desk in the Lincoln Bedroom, which is incredible, by the way, in the White House. And he went up to Gettysburg, and he delivered that speech, the Gettysburg Address. And he was excoriated by the fake news. They had fake news then. He was excoriated. "They said it was a terrible, terrible speech. They said it was far too short. It's not long. Many of us know it by memory. It was far too short, and it was far too flowery. It was too flowery, four score and seven years ago, right? Too flowery. And he died. "Fifty years after his death, they said it may have been the greatest speech ever made in America." Some portions of Trump’s description are inaccurate (the president rode the train to Gettysburg rather than taking a horse and carriage) while others are fairly accurate (he is generally believed to have written a large portion of the speech at the White House before completing it and making revisions after his arrival in Gettysburg). The part that raised our eyebrows is the notion that Lincoln, despite being lionized for his words in subsequent generations, was "ridiculed" for the address at the time. Trump has a point, but the speech’s reception is more complicated than he lets on. The Harrisburg Patriot & Union example Trump may have been thinking of the example of the Harrisburg Patriot & Union, which attracted national attention in in 2013, as the 150th anniversary of the address approached. The paper, located less than an hour away from the battlefield, wrote a scathing account of the speech. About Lincoln’s portion, the newspaper opined, "We pass over the silly remarks of the President. For the credit of the nation we are willing that the veil of oblivion shall be dropped over them and that they shall be no more repeated or thought of." A century and a half later, the newspaper's take officially changed. The Harrisburg Patriot-News and pennlive.com, under the leadership of editorial page editors John L. Micek and Matthew Zencey, ‘fessed up to the paper’s past editorial misstep in a 2013 fashion modeled on Lincoln’s original address: "Seven score and ten years ago, the forefathers of this media institution brought forth to its audience a judgment so flawed, so tainted by hubris, so lacking in the perspective history would bring, that it cannot remain unaddressed in our archives. … No mere utterance, then or now, could do justice to the soaring heights of language Mr. Lincoln reached that day. By today's words alone, we cannot exalt, we cannot hallow, we cannot venerate this sacred text, for a grateful nation long ago came to view those words with reverence, without guidance from this chagrined member of the mainstream media. ... The Patriot-News regrets the error." The newspaper’s self-deprecating retraction went viral, even inspiring a recurring character on Saturday Night Live’s "Weekend Update" -- Jebidiah Atkinson, the unrepentant, arrogant "speech critic" for the 1860s Harrisburg Patriot & Union, played by cast member Taran Killam. (Watch his inaugural SNL appearance, in which Atkinson haughtily disses famous speeches by everyone from Patrick Henry to Jesus.) See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com So one particularly high-profile case backs up evidence for Trump’s remarks in Montana. Was this a common occurrence? The Harrisburg Patriot-News’ negative reaction was not isolated, but it was not unanimous. The poet and historian Carl Sandburg wrote in 1954 that "the American correspondent of the London Times wrote that 'the ceremony was rendered ludicrous by some of the sallies of that poor President Lincoln. ... Anything more dull and commonplace it would not be easy to produce.'" And the Chicago Times wrote, "The cheeks of every American must tingle with shame as he reads the silly, flat, and dishwatery utterances." But others offered high praise indeed. The Chicago Tribune wrote, "The dedicatory remarks by President Lincoln will live among the annals of man." Sandburg reported that the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin wrote that "not many" who read Lincoln’s speech "will do it without a moistening of the eye and a swelling of the heart." And the Providence Journal added, "We know not where to look for a more admirable speech than the brief one which the president made." The key determinant of a newspaper’s positive or a negative review? Politics, historians say. Lincoln was a Republican. "The Patriot was a Democratic organ dedicated to the defeat of Republicans," said William Blair, a Penn State University historian and author of With Malice toward Some: Treason and Loyalty in the Civil War Era. "The Democrats were being increasingly dominated by a peace faction that was calling for an armistice of an indistinct nature but with the possibility of bargaining with the South for reunification while preserving slavery. The Democrats increasingly criticized Republicans for a seeming willingness -- in their eyes -- to waste more and more white lives for the ending of slavery while refusing to consider negotiating to end the war." In other words, Blair said, what seems to modern ears like an apolitical speech appealing to universal values was actually seen at the time as a statement of policy -- in favor of continuing the war, and seeking emancipation. "It was a brilliant speech that pressed forward two important policy measures without seeming to do so," Blair said. "The Patriot’s response was to an extent predictable. Republican newspapers were very supportive" of Lincoln’s speech in the immediate aftermath. Trump does have a point about the address' changing assessment over time, said Eric Foner, a Columbia University historian who specializes in slavery and the Civil War. "The speech definitely was seen as iconic 50 years later but not at the time," Foner said. "A few (newspapers) recognized that this one was really special. But generally, in 1863 Lincoln was much more revered for the Emancipation Proclamation than the Gettysburg Address." Our ruling Trump said, "When Abraham Lincoln made the Gettysburg Address speech, the great speech, do you know he was ridiculed? He was ridiculed." Lincoln was definitely ridiculed by some newspapers, primarily on the basis of politics. Those sympathetic to Democrats and the South blasted it for seeming to support a continuation of the war and the goal of emancipation. It's worth noting that other newspapers -- those whose sentiments aligned with the Union -- lavished the address with praise. The statement is accurate but requires additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.

The problem with that headline? The crash actually occurred June 2, 2016, and the driver received three years in prison and a lifetime suspension on her license, according to local reports. "Burka clad woman runs over baby, gets away with crime for 1 stunning reason," said a June 12, 2018, headline from Daily Headlines, a website offering "unapologetic news (and) commentary from a conservative perspective," according to the about section of its Facebook page. On its website, Daily Headlines said it is neither satire nor "fake news." Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Citing a Nov. 22, 2017, article from America Now, a blog site, the story said a Somali native drove her car off the road and into a house, injuring a man and killing his child in what was her second car accident in four days. The man was walking his son in a stroller. "After 2 car accidents in 4 days, one of which injured a father and took the life of his 7-month old baby before the car drove into a house, a Somali native has been arrested, charged, and convicted of aggravated vehicular homicide and was then let free to roam around until her sentencing hearing," the story said, adding that the woman, Muhuba Mohamed of Columbus, Ohio, was driving on a temporary permit at the time of the accident. But according to local reports from the Columbus Dispatch and others, Mohamed was not set free following the crash. After a judge found her guilty of aggravated vehicular homicide on Oct. 5, 2017, Mohamed surrendered her passport and remained free on bond while she awaited sentencing, which occurred Nov. 29, 2017. Mohamed’s bond was set at $10,000, according to court records. Judges often set criminal defendants free on bond as a means of securing their agreement to return to court for their remaining criminal proceedings. In this case, Mohamed returned to court for sentencing, where she received three years in prison and a lifetime license suspension. So yes, Mohamed was able to "roam around until her sentencing hearing," so to speak. But she surrendered her passport and was bound to return to court by a high bond. She also did not get away with her crime, as the Daily Headlines headline falsely stated. (Daily Headlines did not respond to a request for comment submitted via the contact page on their website.)

pomt-02455	"We’ve got close to 7 million Americans who have access to health care for the first time because of Medicaid expansion."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/feb/25/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-medicaid-expansion-has-brought-h/	After the troubled launch of President Barack Obama’s health care law last fall, the numbers of health insurance sign-ups has increased -- and so has the spin. Speaking at a dinner with the Democratic Governors Association on Feb. 20, 2014, Obama said the law had brought health care to millions of people. He provided a breakdown: "Right now, we’ve already got close to 4 million Americans who have signed up for exchanges. We’ve got 3 million Americans who were able to stay on their parents’ plan because of the law. We’ve got close to 7 million Americans who have access to health care for the first time because of Medicaid expansion. So we’ve already got well over 10 million Americans just in the first few months, despite problems with healthcare.gov in the first month and a half, who suddenly have the financial security that in some cases they’ve never known before." One of these numbers has attracted particular scrutiny -- the "7 million Americans who have access to health care for the first time because of Medicaid expansion." This refers to an expansion under the law of the federal-state Medicaid program. Obama’s law lifted the income limits on who is eligible for Medicaid coverage, newly opening the program to those who had incomes that were very low but still too high to qualify. The federal government would initially pay 100 percent of the cost, with the federal share eventually dropping to 90 percent. In its landmark decision affirming most of the law, the Supreme Court made an exception for the Medicaid provision, saying that states could opt out of the Medicaid expansion. So far, 25 states plus the District of Columbia have decided to expand their Medicaid program, and four more are still considering it. The remaining 21 -- mainly states with Republican political leadership -- have opted out. Our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker gave Obama’s claim the worst rating on their scale -- Four Pinocchios. We thought we’d take a look, too. We asked the White House if it would like to explain Obama’s claim, but the press office did not offer any additional information. (The White House didn’t talk to the Post’s Fact Checker, either.) But we think we have a pretty good idea where the president got his number from -- a report released Jan. 22 by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, titled, "Medicaid & CHIP: December Monthly Applications and Eligibility Determinations Report." According to that report, the cumulative number of individuals determined eligible for Medicaid (or a related but separate State Children’s Health Insurance Program) by state agencies during October, November and December 2013 was a little more than 6.3 million. That’s not 7 million, but it’s approaching that number. However, the report notes some caveats about the 6.3 million figure. The number, according to the report, "includes those newly eligible under the Affordable Care Act and those eligible under prior law and, for some states, renewals." In other words, the number includes people who were already eligible under the old, pre-Obamacare Medicaid rules and "came out of the woodwork," so to speak, during the last three months of 2013. This means they did not suddenly gain "access to health care for the first time" due to Obamacare, which was the standard Obama used in his speech to the governors’ group. The number also includes some people who simply renewed lapsed Medicaid coverage -- people who also wouldn’t be getting "access to health care for the first time." So how many people actually got health coverage due to the Medicaid expansion? That’s a tougher nut to crack, because the data is scattered among different states and different categories. Two private-sector efforts to estimate the number produced divergent figures. Charles Gaba, a website developer and blogger in Michigan, has been tracking enrollment figures at his ACASignups.net site. His most recent estimate from late February shows 2.6 million Medicaid sign-ups once you subtract those falling into three categories -- those who signed up in states that didn’t expand Medicaid, those who were previously eligible and who "came out of the woodwork" to sign up, and an estimate of the typical "churn" for Medicaid sign-ups in those states. Meanwhile, Avalere, a health-care consulting firm, concluded that over the three-month period, between 1.1 million and 1.8 million people newly enrolled for Medicaid due to Obamacare. Avalere developed its estimates in part by comparing the CMS data on new enrollments to enrollment rates from the summer of 2013. The idea is to see how much of a "bump" in enrollments materialized due to the Medicaid expansion. There’s a significant difference between 1.1 million and 2.6 million, but the important factor for our fact-check is that both numbers are well short of Obama’s 7 million figure (and CMS’ 6.3 million figure). Our ruling Obama said, "We’ve got close to 7 million Americans who have access to health care for the first time because of Medicaid expansion." Obama’s 7 million figure was a stretch even compared to his own administration’s 6.3 million figure. But more problematic is a disconnect between what he said and what the administration data is showing. The administration’s 6.3 million figure includes a lot of the "churn" in Medicaid that has nothing to do with the new law’s Medicaid expansion, as well as new sign-ups of people who were previously eligible for Medicaid -- and thus were not granted "access to health care for the first time because of Medicaid expansion," in Obama’s words. The actual number is estimated to be between one-seventh and two-fifths of what Obama said it was. We rate the claim False.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2014-02-25T18:26:20	2014-02-20	['None']

pomt-03561	Says Sam Houston opposed slavery and as governor said Texas should not leave the union over slavery.	half-true	/texas/statements/2013/may/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-sam-houston-opposed-slavery-and-sa/	As the Texas-headquartered Boy Scouts of America moved closer to a vote on allowing openly gay members, Texas Gov. Rick Perry revisited his opposition to such a change, while calling for leadership that hews to principles even when they are unpopular. Speaking May 6, 2013, via video as part of the national, conservative Family Research Council’s "Stand With Scouts Sunday" webcast, Perry cited the example of Sam Houston, Texas’ first president and seventh governor, whose portrait hung behind Perry on a wall in the Governor’s Mansion. "From this library that I speak, he made a powerful decision that cost him his governorship," Perry said. "He was against slavery, and he stood up and very passionately said, you know, ‘Texas does not need to leave the Union over this issue of slavery. We need to stay. We’ve only been’ -- he thought, a terrible decision. He was right. But it cost him his governorship." That’s "the kind of principled leadership" we need today, said Perry, a former Eagle Scout who wrote a 2008 book defending the organization’s "American values" and saying it was the object of an anti-religious "cultural war" being waged to force the inclusion of gays, agnostics and atheists. His comments touched off an Internet flurry of debate over whether opposing slavery could or should be equated with opposing gay admission, but we wondered about the underlying facts. Did Sam Houston, the leader of Texas’ military insurrection against Mexico, oppose slavery and say Texas shouldn’t split from the United States over it? Houston did lose his job as governor over secession, ending a career of representing Texans in elected office almost continuously from the Texas Revolution to the start of the Civil War. The military hero of San Jacinto became the first president of the Republic of Texas in 1836; then a representative in the Republic’s legislature; president a second time; U.S. senator when Texas became a state in 1845; and, finally, governor starting in 1859. But Texas’ secession convention removed Houston as governor March 18, 1861, after he refused to sign an oath of loyalty to the Confederate States of America. Historians have written that Houston’s views on secession had earlier cost him his seat in the U.S. Senate. As a senator, according to the Texas State Historical Association’s Handbook of Texas, Houston angered pro-slavery factions by voting in 1848 to prohibit slavery in Oregon; supporting the delicately balanced slavery/anti-slavery decisions in the Compromise of 1850; and opposing, in 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska Act that let territories decide their own slavery status, repealing previous law that banned slavery north of latitude 36°30'. What guided Houston’s thinking in these disputes was his belief in the "glorious Union" he had worked hard to get Texas into. The Handbook says, "As senator, Houston emerged as an ardent Unionist ... a stand that made him an increasingly controversial figure. He stridently opposed the rising sectionalism of the antebellum period and delivered eloquent speeches on the issue." Perry spokesman Josh Havens referred us to the 2004 biography "Sam Houston," in which author James Haley described Houston the politician as treading a fine line on slavery for decades: "He disliked it," Haley wrote, but "recognized it as a fact of life to be dealt with." Via email, Haley told us, "Gov. Perry is right that Houston was against slavery, but as a Southern senator he was chained to it and could not openly oppose it." Haley pointed us to a key speech by Houston on slavery, delivered Feb. 22, 1855, in Boston, in which the senator said the Union should not be sundered for "political opinions," that slavery was natural to the Southern economy and that the North would still have slaves if it were profitable there. Emancipation, Houston said, would cast the freed man into jobless destitution: "You might call him free, but he would be an object of want and wretchedness." Haley wrote, "To Sam Houston, what was paramount at that time, and in that place, and during that crisis was keeping the Union together." Houston’s personal views on slavery are unclear. He was a slaveowner; according to his biography online at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, an inventory of his property upon his death in 1863 listed "12 slaves valued at $10,530.20." Yet "almost all acts other than his ownership of slaves support the idea that he disagreed with slavery as an institution," the university biography said. Among examples given: "While in office as president of the Republic of Texas and later as governor, he refused to permit payments to bounty hunters of escaped slaves. He also prohibited slave ships from trafficking in Texas." One of Houston’s slaves recalled hearing him speak against the institution on the day Abraham Lincoln was elected president. In the 1940 memoir "My Master," Jeff Hamilton said, "I heard the General say that slavery was a damnable thing at best, and that he didn’t believe in human slavery nor in secession or disunion either. He said he hoped God might in some way perform a miracle as of old and save the country from destruction." After Houston had helped shepherd Texas into the United States, he spoke publicly and often against ripping the Union apart over slavery. His pro-Union views and Senate votes made him anathema in Southern politics. His Senate career, the Handbook of Texas says, "was effectively ended when, in 1855, the Texas Legislature officially condemned his position on the Kansas-Nebraska Act," which Houston opposed "because it allowed the status of slavery to be determined by popular sovereignty, a concept he saw as potentially destabilizing to the nation." Somewhat of a lame-duck senator, Houston returned to Texas and ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1857. Opponent Hardin Runnels advocated reopening the slave trade with Africa, which Houston had called an "unholy and cruel traffic" as Texas’ president. Houston was portrayed as a traitor to the South; the press accused him of "voting against all bills in the interest of slavery," according to a July 1914 analysis in the Southwestern Historical Quarterly that summed up his defeat: "The people had not yet forgiven Houston for his support of the Kansas-Nebraska bill." Before leaving Washington for good, Houston defended his Kansas-Nebraska vote in March 19, 1858, remarks to the Senate: "I was not the enemy of slavery, nor was I its propagandist, nor will I ever be." Houston ran for governor again as a pro-slavery candidate, according to T.R. Fehrenbach’s 2000 "Lone Star: A History Of Texas And The Texans": In 1859, Houston, now past his sixty-fifth year, determined to appeal to the people once again. His platform was clear: he supported slavery, he supported the Constitution, but he pledged allegiance to the Union, come what may. It was not a popular platform, but Houston could not believe that the Texans were prepared to forsake the greater nation he had done so much to build. From the gubernatorial pulpit, Houston kept arguing against secession on practical grounds. In a Sept. 22, 1860, speech in Austin, Houston said slavery was not threatened if Southern states stayed in the Union: "We still have the institution of slavery. All the legislation on the subject for the past twenty years has been to secure it to us, so long as we may want it." Civil war would destroy the Southern states, he said, and there was no need for secession: "Are our rights invaded and no government ready to protect them? No! Are our institutions wrested from us and others foreign to our taste forced upon us? No! … if the battle is to be fought for the Constitution, let us fight it in the Union and for the sake of the Union." The institution of slavery "is our own," Houston said, "and the North has nothing to do with it. The North does not want it, and we have nothing to do with that. … We have the right to abolish slavery -- they have the right to establish it. It is in our interest to have it. Climate, soil, association -- all make the institution peculiarly suited to us. If it were to their interest, the people of the North would have it." In a Nov. 14, 1860, open letter to residents of Huntsville who wrote to seek his advice on secession, Houston said a revolution should not be launched without "some more weighty reason for overthrowing the Government, than rash enthusiasts have yet given." As Texas moved toward secession, Houston told the Legislature in a Jan. 21, 1861, message that the slave states should be able to keep their rights, but "hasty" action could be disastrous for cash-strapped Texas. "The millions now spent by the United States, the support of our postal service, the defense of our commerce, must all come from the pockets of our people." Houston’s appeals failed, but Lincoln was impressed by his courage and according to the Texas State Library’s web site "made secret contact with him through intermediaries, offering the old general command of 50,000 troops and the rank of major general if he would lead a force to restore federal control of Texas." Houston turned down the offer in a March 29, 1861, letter; some accounts say he sat up late into the night discussing the question with friends in the mansion’s library and then dropped Lincoln’s offer into the fire. We asked Havens for reaction to our findings, and asked whether the Lincoln offer or another event was the "powerful decision" Perry had referred to. Haley’s book mentions a "family tradition" that says Houston paced the mansion’s floors all night before refusing to sign the Confederate oath. Havens said, "Gov. Perry was referencing Gov. Houston’s strength of character, standing up for what he believed was right in the face of public opposition. There were a collection of events that occurred over that period of time, including burning Lincoln’s letter in the mansion library, when Houston was pondering an issue that would not only shape the fate of our state, but also his personal future." Houston did not live to see the war’s end; he left Austin to return to Huntsville, where he died of pneumonia on July 26, 1863, at age 70. Our ruling Perry said his long-ago predecessor "was against slavery, and he stood up and very passionately said, you know, ‘Texas does not need to leave the Union over this issue of slavery.’ " Houston’s personal views are unclear; politically, he took actions that were viewed as anti-slavery as well as actions that were pro-slavery. But he did exhort Southerners and his fellow Texans not to secede over slavery -- an unpopular stance he stuck to in hopes of preserving the Union he revered. We rate Perry’s statement as Half True.

pomt-12504	Says Texas House rules authorized by the Texas Constitution supersede the state law permitting anyone to record a public government meeting.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2017/apr/27/charlie-geren/mostly-true-texas-house-can-supersede-state-law-pe/	State troopers arrested a Texas woman after she persisted in shooting video of a legislative hearing in keeping with a decades-old state law. That law says: "A person in attendance may record all or any part of an open meeting of a governmental body," including legislative panels. Amy Hedtke, a 2017 Waxahachie school board candidate and self-described anarchist, streamed on Facebook Live a portion of the March 22, 2017, hearing of the House State Affairs Committee in a building on the Capitol grounds. Hedtke transmitted the live video, we confirmed, despite the panel’s chairman, Rep. Byron Cook, announcing at the hearing’s outset that anyone making a recording who lacked media credentials would be asked to leave. According to a March 22, 2017, Texas Department of Public Safety statement provided by the agency at our inquiry, Hedtke, 42, was removed "after she ignored repeated requests by the House Sergeant-at-Arms to stop recording/live video streaming during the meeting. Signs posted in the meeting room prohibit such action without proper media credentials." Anthony Holm of Austin, who brought Hedtke's removal to our attention, noted an April 2017 news report about Hedtke by WFAA-TV, Channel 8 in Dallas. Hedtke’s removal was reported earlier by the Waxahachie Daily Light. Holm asked that we look into whether officials had the authority to act against someone simply taping a hearing as the open-meetings law permits. Our initial inquiries led us to the House's legal explanation in a letter from a House leader, Rep. Charlie Geren, R-Fort Worth, to the TV station that essentially said House rules in keeping with a state constitutional provision let members rule their proceedings regardless of conflicting laws. And is that accurate? A House chairman's explanation Hedtke’s video plus video shot by another person show her refusing requests that she stop taping and being carried by troopers to a DPS sedan. By phone, Hedtke later told us that she was then taken to the Travis County Jail where she was charged with criminal trespass for failing to depart when asked; a court hearing, she said, is scheduled for May 2017. Hedtke’s video from the hearing shows Hedtke telling an unidentified House aide: "State law says that open meetings, you cannot prohibit attendees from recording." The aide replies: "The rules of the House have precedence over that — the Constitution, as well." Geren, chairman of the powerful House Administration Committee, said the same in his April 11, 2017, letter to the TV station, which we fielded by email after asking Jason Embry, a spokesman for House Speaker Joe Straus, why Hedtke was stopped from recording and carried out. Geren's letter says the station’s news account mistakenly indicated the law allowing individuals to record government meetings prevails over House rules giving members control of its proceedings. Constitutional provision and House rules Article III, section 11 of the Texas Constitution, Geren wrote, "authorizes each house of the legislature to determine the rules of its own proceedings." In its entirety, the section says: "Each House may determine the rules of its own proceedings, punish members for disorderly conduct, and, with the consent of two-thirds, expel a member, but not a second time for the same offense." Geren, chairman of the House Administration Committee, further wrote that the House’s 2017 rules deem those rules to be "the only requirements binding" on the 150-member body. Correct: House rules adopted by members at the start of the 2017 legislative session open: "Pursuant to and under the authority of Section 11, Article III, Texas Constitution, and notwithstanding any provision of statute, the House of Representatives adopts the following rules to govern its operations and procedures. The provisions of these rules shall be deemed the only requirements binding on the House of Representatives under Section 11, Article III, Texas Constitution, notwithstanding any other requirements expressed in statute." We asked Geren if he wished to elaborate on his letter, which WFAA-TV subsequently excerpted in a note preceding a web version of its story; he did not. In the latest House rules themselves, meantime, we didn’t spot any provision that a House member can obviate the open-meetings law including its provision that people can record meetings. Otherwise, the rules require the House to post video of public meetings and specify that permission to make live or recorded television, radio, or Internet broadcasts in or from the House chamber when the House is in session may be granted only by the administration committee. Murky? Section 551.023 of Texas’s government code, part of the open-meetings law that came to be in 1973, says: "A person in attendance may record all or any part of an open meeting of a governmental body by means of a recorder, video camera or other means of aural or visual reproduction." But, the law says, a governmental body "may adopt reasonable rules to maintain order at a meeting, including" rules relating to the location of recording equipment and how the recording is made. The law also says those rules "may not prevent or unreasonably impair a person from" recording during a meeting. So, what gives? Angling to sort this out, and with help from Kelley Shannon of the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas, we queried Austin attorneys steeped in Texas open government laws. Each one agreed that no court has ruled on the ability of the House or Senate to invoke the constitutional provision about the bodies setting internal rules to bypass the permission spelled out in the Texas Open Meetings Act for people to record meetings. Likewise, we found no sign of any such court interpretation when we reviewed materials available at the Texas State Law Library. The lawyers diverged, though, on whether Geren’s explanation holds up. "It gets murky," said David Donaldson of Austin, a retired lawyer whose past clients include the Austin American-Statesman, one of the newspapers that sponsors PolitiFact Texas. By phone, Donaldson added: "The answer may be that we don’t know the answer yet." Over the course of a couple days, Donaldson told us, he was swayed by conflicting arguments both for and against a person being able to record a legislative meeting. Bob Heath, who has advised lawmakers in the past, and Buck Wood, who helped write the open-meetings law, each said the constitution’s language supports what Geren told the station. To his chagrin, Wood said by phone, House members reinforced such a stance by adopting the provision leading its rules stating the body’s rules shall be deemed the "only" requirements binding on the House, regardless of state laws. In contrast, attorneys Bill Aleshire and Jennifer Riggs each suggested a portion of the open-meetings law signals an overarching legislative commitment to complying with the open-meetings law. Section 551.003 of the state’s Government Code states: "In this chapter, the legislature is exercising its powers to adopt rules to prohibit secret meetings of the legislature, committees of the legislature, and other bodies associated with the legislature, except as specifically permitted in the constitution." By email, Aleshire maintained that the section protects the open-meetings law from being preempted by lawmakers any which way. He noted also that the Constitution doesn’t say the Legislature has the power to outlaw recordings. Another hearing, another approach While checking this claim, we noticed that days after troopers carried Hedtke out, a different House chairman, Rep. Phil King, R-Weatherford, let people at a hearing, including Hedtke, take pictures and shoot video. According to House-posted video, just after the start of the March 28, 2017, meeting of the Homeland Security & Public Safety panel, King said: "We want to talk a little bit about cameras and things like that. I’m going to be a little flexible there." King directed anyone taking photos to do so from the back of the Capitol hearing room. "The rule of the day," he said, "is don’t disturb other people when you do it." Hedtke told us, and King confirmed, that she later got King’s permission to move her camera closer to the front of the room; intermittent noise from the hallway was marring her recording from the back. King, asked why he laid out guidelines for people to record the meeting, told us he recognized before the hearing that people following issues before the panel wanted to record or livestream. By phone, King said he’s aware of the law that says anyone can record a government meeting. Yet, he said, his decision to let people take photos or video was based on his discretion under House rules to run the hearing as the committee’s chairman. King said it’s the duty of any chair "to make sure the meeting is smooth, efficient and not disrupted." How did the permission to record affect the hearing? "It was fine," King told us. "Everybody behaved themselves." Our ruling Geren wrote that House rules authorized by the Texas Constitution supersede the state law permitting anyone to record an open government meeting. We find that a constitutional provision plus sweeping House-adopted language that arguably lets the body operate without regard to any law support the chairman's statement. But it's also worth clarifying that the rub with the 1973 law allowing anyone to record a government meeting has yet to be dissected by a court. We rate the claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE, 12:20 p.m. May 25, 2017: On May 25, 2017, a Travis County state district judge sided with Hedtke, issuing a temporary order requiring Cook to let Hedtke take photographs and video-record hearings that Cook chairs. See the Austin American-Statesman's news story on the ruling here. This action wouldn't bear on our past rating of Geren's statement in that the judge acted after Geren made his claim.

pomt-05746	"We supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2012/mar/02/barack-obama/obama-says-he-supported-first-nuclear-power-plant-/	Countering Republican attacks on gas prices, President Barack Obama gave a hard-hitting speech on energy policy in Miami on Feb. 23, 2012. In his speech, Obama laid out a defense of his oil-related policies and reiterated his commitment to diverse energy sources. One of his speech’s shortest lines caught our attention: "We supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades." Thirty years -- really? And why has it been so long? To satisfy our curiosity, we decided to check it out. (We fact-checked Obama’s claims about drilling in a separate report.) If you haven’t been keeping tabs on the nuclear energy industry, it has indeed been awhile since a new reactor was built. But Obama’s 30-year claim hinges on licensing. On Feb. 9, 2012, the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved a license for two new nuclear reactors in Georgia. The electricity giant Southern Co. intends to build them at its Vogtle site south of Augusta. (The White House pointed us to news coverage of the approval when we asked for evidence of Obama’s statement.) Prior to this year, the last time the commission granted a license to build a new reactor was in 1978, which was 34 years ago, according to a commission spokesperson. The permit was for the Shearon Harris plant operated by Carolina Power & Light near Raleigh, N.C. But it takes a long time to build nuclear reactors, so the plant didn’t get operational approval until 1986. And the North Carolina plant isn’t the most recent to go operational. That distinction goes to the Tennessee Valley Authority’s Watts Bar site in Tennessee. It received a construction license in 1973 and an operating license in 1996, or 16 years ago. Still, as we ran this claim by people who watch the nuclear industry closely -- both those opposed to nuclear energy and those in favor of it -- they agreed Obama’s claim to have "supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades" was largely accurate. A technical note: The Georgia project adds two reactors to an existing electricity generation site with two existing reactors. We wondered if that diminished the accuracy of Obama’s statement, but the experts said it’s fair to call each reactor its own "power plant." Nuclear’s long wait So why has it been so long since a license was granted? Interestingly, the experts we spoke with said it’s not because of bureaucratic hassles or super-stringent rules. Rather, it’s because building new plants is expensive, and the dynamics of the energy market haven’t made new reactors a good deal for energy producers. The Nuclear Information and Resource Service opposes nuclear energy as "dangerous, dirty and expensive," said executive director Michael Mariotte. It’s the expensive part that’s made for the long wait, he said. Energy companies have struggled to build plants in a cost-efficient manner, and the Georgia plants are a long way from being finished, he said. The Southern Co. is trying to construct two reactors at once, which makes for more operational complexity. "If history repeats itself, then they won’t get built. We’ll have to see how much the industry has learned in the past three decades in terms of managing construction costs," he said. His group is part of a lawsuit to stop the construction, on the grounds that the reactor designs need to be updated with lessons learned from the recent nuclear disaster near Fukushima, Japan. (The Nuclear Regulatory Commission approved the license on a 4-1 vote; the dissenting vote was cast for that reason.) A sunnier take on the three-decade wait is that the nuclear industry has been really good at innovating and getting more electricity out of its existing plants. That’s what Steve Kerekes of the pro-nuclear Nuclear Energy Institute told us. "From essentially a static number of facilities -- a little over 100 --we’ve increased our electricity output roughly 40 percent. That’s the equivalent of nearly 30 new reactors since 1990, and we’ve done that from existing facilities," he said. Nuclear executives say they would build more plants if the current energy markets were different. The Georgia plant is going forward in a state where regulations allow utilities to bill customers for construction costs before the plant is finished. By way of contrast, the Illinois-based nuclear energy company Exelon operates in many states where that’s not the case. Exelon executives have said plainly it makes little economic sense for them to build new plants, citing two more factors. First, natural gas prices are very low. Second, Congress has abandoned plans to address global warming through a cap-and-trade system or other attempts to limit carbon emissions from coal-fired electricity generation. Both those things work against the business case for building new reactors. (Exelon executives, by the way, donated to Obama’s 2008 campaign, as we noted in this fact-check.) The administration’s support Obama said in his speech that his administration "supported" the new nuclear plants. Again, experts agreed this was so, particularly since the administration is in final negotiations to support the Southern Co.’s construction with $8.33 billion in federal loan guarantees. Back in February 2010, when the project received conditional approval, Obama himself praised the deal, connecting it to the need for climate change legislation. "To meet our growing energy needs and prevent the worst consequences of climate change, we need to increase our supply of nuclear power, and today’s announcement helps to move us down that path," he said. Our ruling Obama said, "We supported the first new nuclear power plant in three decades." He is right that it’s been that long since a new nuclear reactor has been licensed. However, because it takes so long to construct nuclear power plants, the most recent plant actually opened in 1996. The experts we spoke with, both those who support nuclear power and those who oppose it, said that Obama’s statement was largely accurate, given that the last time a nuclear reactor received federal approval was 1978. And, his administration has so far supported the recent approval of new reactors in Georgia with $8.3 billion in federal loan guarantees. We rate Obama’s statement Mostly True.

pomt-08140	"In Florida, illegal immigration costs taxpayers nearly $4 billion (a year). This amounts to $700 for every household in Florida."	false	/florida/statements/2010/dec/06/vern-buchanan/vern-buchanan-says-illegal-immigration-costs-flori/	Sarasota-area congressman Vern Buchanan, a Republican who many think could run for the Senate in 2012, released a video Dec. 2, 2010, arguing against the DREAM Act -- a controversial piece of immigration legislation that would create a path to citizenship for youths brought to the United States illegally. The minute-long video included some sobering figures on the cost of illegal immigration to Florida taxpayers. "In Florida, illegal immigration costs taxpayers nearly $4 billion. This amounts to $700 for every household in Florida," Buchanan said. "Incredibly, some in Congress are still trying to pass a law to grant amnesty. The so-called DREAM Act would grant amnesty to as many as 2 million illegal immigrants. Amnesty rewards people who break our laws and encourages more illegal immigration." PolitiFact just recently ruled False the claim that the DREAM Act would grant amnesty to as many as 2 million illegal immigrants, noting that the 2 million figure is the number of people who would be potentially eligible for citizenship. It's also a matter of debate whether the path to citizenship can be called amnesty. You can read that analysis here. The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act would allow children brought to the United States by illegal immigrants to obtain permanent legal status if they complete two years of college or enlist in the military. There are currently several versions of the DREAM Act kicking around in Congress, but under the version introduced in March 2009, people under 35 who arrived in the United States before the age of 16 and have lived here at least the last five years would be able to apply for legal permanent resident status on a conditional basis if they have obtained a U.S. high school diploma or GED. That conditional status would be upgraded to permanent after six years if they successfully complete at least two years of college or military service and if they maintain "good moral character." In this item, we wanted to check Buchanan's figures on the cost to taxpayers. Buchanan's press secretary, Sally Tibbetts, said the number comes from a 2009 study by the group the Federation for American Immigration Reform (FAIR). It is a group that opposes the DREAM Act and advocates against congressional action that includes amnesty for illegal immigrants, or a path to citizenship. The group also wants to reduce legal immigration to the United States. The FAIR study examined projected government spending on education, health and incarceration for illegal immigrants and found that illegal immigrants cost Florida taxpayers $3.8 billion. To determine the "cost" of illegal immigration to Florida, FAIR identified the average cost of government services according to, in many instances, other private studies, and then multiplied those figures by the number of illegal immigrants in the population. One of the problems with that kind of analysis, however, is that there's no official number of illegal immigrants living in Florida (illegal immigrants being a group that aren't exactly eager to raise their hands and be counted, after all). For example, FAIR ranked Florida's illegal immigration population fourth in the nation, with an estimated 950,000 immigrants in 2008. In contrast, the Department of Homeland Security ranks Florida third in the nation, with 720,000 illegal immigrants in 2009. But that's not the only problem. The FAIR report tries to identify spending on illegal immigrants in three different areas -- education, health care and incarceration. Of the $3.8 billion estimate, the lion's share -- $3.4 billion -- is spent on education. FAIR uses estimate after estimate to create a "fact." The group used its estimate of the illegal immigrant population in Florida to craft an estimate of illegal immigrant school-aged children -- a number they peg at about 146,000. Then, they use another estimate, a per-pupil figure from the National Center for Education Statistics of $8,234, to say that K-12 illegal immigrant children cost Florida taxpayers "at least $1.2 billion per year." Then, they create another estimate for the sons and daughters of illegal immigrants who were born in the United States -- and thus are American citizens. That number, they say, is 204,000. Add the cost for them in (an estimate) and you get an additional $1.7 billion in cost per year, or $2.9 billion combined. We admit, we can't offer you better estimates for the number of illegal immigrant schoolchildren or the number of legal sons and daughters of illegal immigrants -- because those numbers don't exist. But we can tell you, for instance, that the Florida Department of Education says its per pupil spending is $6,871, not $8,234. And if you use the state number, and not the one from the National Center for Education Statistics, the total cost is $2.4 billion not $2.9 billion. That's $500 million saved by using a different, and at least as reputable figure -- without even dealing with the other estimates, mind you. The remaining education funding, about $566 million FAIR figures, comes from teaching English language instruction for non-native English speakers. FAIR estimates that 80 percent of all children in English language training, a number they estimate to be around 250,000, are the children of illegal immigrants. They multiply that number by another estimate -- they say the amount of additional cost for these students is $2,264 -- to reach a taxpayer cost of $566 million. More estimates on top of estimates. FAIR bases its health care costs on a 2002 Florida Hospital Association survey that found unreimbursed emergency medical care for illegal immigrants topped $40 million. But the survey includes responses from private hospitals that are not funded by the state. So the cost to taxpayers is overestimated. And FAIR produces the state's incarceration costs for illegal immigrants based on the state Department of Corrections' "illegal alien" count of inmates. However, no such count exists. Instead, the state keeps tabs on all inmates who are not U.S. citizens, whether they're in the country legally or illegally. While many of those inmates are eventually released to U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement for further immigration processing, including possible deportation, the state does not track whether its inmates are legal U.S. residents. (We covered some of this ground already in a fact check from June about this same FAIR study). "I would take FAIR's numbers with a big shaker of salt," said Daniel Griswold, director of the Center for Trade Policy Studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian Washington, D.C., policy group. "The organization exists to portray immigrants in a bad light." One of the easiest ways to see just how malleable the numbers are is to look at FAIR's 2010 state-by-state report. In 2010, FAIR said illegal immigrants cost Florida taxpayers almost $5.5 billion -- that's about a $1.7 billion or 44 percent increase in a year. Nothing that we've discussed, for the record, accounts for the money illegal immigrants pay in state sales taxes and federal income taxes. All people are required to pay state sales taxes. And while some illegal immigrants are paid cash under the table, many are paid by payroll check just like everyone else. Recent estimates suggest illegal workers are now paying $9 billion to $12 billion a year into Social Security through payroll taxes, for instance, with no legal way to get that money back in retirement benefits. (Illegal immigrants provide faked documentation and fake Social Security numbers). So while there is a cost, there also is a revenue side to the equation. In 2009, FAIR said illegal immigrants contributed $1.6 billion in taxes in Florida. In 2010, the number dropped more than $1.3 billion, to $261 million. Eric Ruark, FAIR's director of research, said the group greatly overestimated the amount of disposable income of illegal immigrants that would be subject to sales tax. In defending the study, Ruark notes that FAIR does not estimate the increased tax payments that Florida would gain from having legal workers replace illegal ones, or the cost to the state in payments to Floridians who are unemployed because of the presence of illegal workers in the labor force. The point is, the actual cost could be higher. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress, tried back in December 2007 to quantify the fiscal impact of illegal immigrants on state and local governments. It couldn't, and found problems with studies that did. The CBO noted that illegal immigrants who just arrive in the United States might use more government resources than those well or better integrated into American society, that it is difficult to capture all revenues and costs, and that there is little information on how much illegal immigrants contribute to American life through taxes, or how much they utilize government services. Instead, the CBO made a series of more general findings. Among them: * State and local governments incur costs for providing services to unauthorized immigrants and have limited options for avoiding or minimizing those costs. * The amount that state and local governments spend on services for unauthorized immigrants represents a small percentage of the total amount spent by those governments to provide such services to residents in their jurisdictions. * The tax revenues that unauthorized immigrants generate for state and local governments do not offset the total cost of services provided to those immigrants. To us, that's a more appropriate and tempered analysis. A quick side note: In his comments, Buchanan said the per-household cost of for illegal immigrants is $700 a year. To get there, Buchanan again uses FAIR, which divided their cost figure for taxpayers ($3.8 billion) by the number of households headed by native-born residents (5.65 million). FAIR excludes households headed by non-native-born residents regardless of whether those heads of household are citizens or living in the United States legally. If they included all households (7 million), the cost per household would be about $550. We're unclear why FAIR, for instance, excluded citizens not born in the United States as well as legally documented residents -- who are all paying taxes -- from their calculations. Let's review. Buchanan said: "In Florida, illegal immigration costs taxpayers nearly $4 billion (a year). This amounts to $700 for every household in Florida." He is mostly quoting accurately from a study performed by the group Federation for American Immigration Reform, though he doesn't cite FAIR in his comments. The FAIR study is highly suspect. It relies on estimate after estimate, and was conducted by a group that is hardly objective when it comes to analyzing the effects of illegal immigration. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office warned specifically against trying to put dollar figures on the costs associated with illegal immigrants because of the large number of unknown variables. We'd consider offering more leeway if Buchanan sourced his statement back to FAIR, so at least people could know the source and question it independently. But Buchanan makes his pronouncement sound like it's fact, when it's far from it. We rate this claim False.	None	Vern Buchanan	None	None	None	2010-12-06T18:42:32	2010-12-02	['Florida']

pomt-01890	President Obama has left the U.S. with the lowest number of active-duty troops since before World War II, putting the nation at risk.	half-true	/georgia/statements/2014/jul/07/jack-kingston/kingstons-attack-obamas-miltary-plans-misfires/	As Georgia’s U.S. Senate race heats up, Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah has not been shy about his disdain for the policies touted by the current presidential administration. He has railed against Pres. Barack Obama’s Affordable Health Care Act, saying it needs to be repealed and replaced. In television and radio ads he has played the part of playful provocateur, hiring a voice actor to play a pleading facsimile of the president. If you’ve hopped in your car for even a quick lunch break the last few days, you’ve probably heard this ad. However, it’s another Kingston ad that has us at PolitiFact wondering. In a spot titled, "Backward Priorities," Kingston takes aim at federal cuts to the defense budget. "Pres. Obama has it all wrong. He’s growing government with wasteful spending while drastically cutting our military, leaving us with the lowest number of active-duty troops since before World War II," Kingston says in the ad posted on his campaign’s YouTube channel on May 12. "Obama’s backwards priorities puts us all at risk." Kingston goes on to tout his own track record on military bases in Georgia, but this statement made us press the pause button. Is it true that troops are at their lowest since WWII? And if so, are we really at risk? We asked Chris Crawford, Kingston’s campaign spokesman, for the source behind the ad. Crawford forwarded us to a February press release from the Department of Defense, which detailed Pres. Obama’s proposed Pentagon budget for fiscal year 2015. Amidst the cuts were a series of reductions which included "shrinking the Army to its smallest size since before World War II." The proposal would shave off 15 percent of active-duty personnel over five years, from 520,000 to between 440,000 and 450,000. It acknowledged the fiscal reasoning behind the decision, noting cuts made through the Budget Control Act of 2011 ($487 billion over 10 years) and sequestration ($50 billion annually). Right off the bat, Kingston’s ad faces a problem. The 2015 fiscal year budget has a proposed five-year plan for military cuts – it hasn’t actually occurred yet, and will have to be approved by Congress. So Obama has not yet left the country with the lowest number of troops since WWII, even if he has proposed such cuts, though they are likely to go through given the fiscal constraints on the Pentagon. Crawford said this about the budget: "The President’s budget is a formal vision for the country and something behind which he uses the force of the entire federal government. It is a policy statement of the Administration under the President’s leadership. Keep in mind this comes from an administration that doesn’t let that repeatedly oversteps its bounds of executing the law rather than legislating it." But how do the numbers compare with past deployments? The folks at PolitiFact Wisconsin compiled a list of Army figures going back to 1775 while conducting a fact check of similar comments made by Wisconsin Congressman Jim Sensenbrenner. Kingston said active-duty troops will decrease to pre-WWII levels. On first blush, that seems true. That list, citing the Secretary of War Annual Report and Strength of the Army Reports, shows that in 1940, there were 264,118 active-duty troops. In 1941, after the United States joined the war following Pearl Harbor, that number shot up to 1.5 million troops. Kingston’s phrasing could use some fine-tuning. He seems to imply that the number of troops will be around 1940 levels through his comparison. But they are actually much closer to the numbers seen in the late 1990s and even early 2000s. There were only 479,026 active troops in 2000, and from 1998 to 2001, the number stayed close to 480,000. The current numbers are low, but historically speaking, they aren’t that low – especially when considering the nation’s unstable finances .Now for the second question: what risk does a smaller military pose for U.S. citizens? That’s a bit less cut and dry. Center for a New American Security fellow Travis Sharp addressed the issue in a policy brief, noting that the comparison to 1940 was "interesting," but "not particularly useful." "Since the 2014 Army is not going to fight in the 1940 strategic environment," Sharp wrote, "comparing them does not help us decide what to do today." He writes later that size does matter in many combat operations, but that decreasing ground forces in peacetime is "both precedented and logical," given budgetary concerns. For its part, the Defense Department report states that active duty strength will diminish, but will be replaced with continued investments in cyber capabilities, missile defense and nuclear deterrence. We called Ricky Smith, a senior army official and director of the Army Capabilities Integration Center, a military think tank, to get his take about the connection between today’s troops and their 1940 counterparts. "It really is an apples to oranges comparison. The quality of today’s individual soldier is so much higher than it was," Smith said. "What they’re able to do the squad level, versus World War II, is amazing." Smith said the Army should still be able to handle single operations, but might struggle from its diminished force when attempting to fight in multiple arenas, like when U.S. troops fought in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Technology does decrease the need for on-the-ground troops, but those units are also still necessary for the vast majority of tasks. The military’s status as a global force may be lessened by cuts. "You ultimately have to have some kind of human contact," Smith said. "There’s something to be said about putting boots on the ground and having tanks." But that desire is balanced with fiscal realities. "By reducing our capacity, you are in some ways accepting risk," Smith said. "The question is, what is prudent risk?" In short, Kingston accused the Obama administration of reducing active troops to pre-WWII levels and putting "us all" at risk. While it is true that the numbers are at their lowest since 1940, they are substantively similar to the active enrollment numbers seen in the 1990s and early 2000s. Changing technologies and strategies for deployment make the comparison to the pre-Pearl Harbor days a bit of a stretch. The reduction of active troops has a clear effect on the scope of missions the United States can take on globally. But whether citizens at home are seeing a greater risk is less clear. Though Kingston’s ad contains some truth there is a lot of context missing. We rate Kingston’s claim Half True.

pomt-06908	The Atlanta streetcar is expected to create 930 jobs during construction, totaling more than 5,600 jobs over the next 20 years.	pants on fire!	/georgia/statements/2011/jul/25/federal-transit-administration/fta-says-atlanta-streetcar-create-thousands-jobs/	The familiar clang of the Atlanta Streetcar Project sprang the Truth-O-Meter to action. Leaders fought hard for funds to build the line, which is slated to open in 2013. It will ferry passengers from Centennial Olympic Park to the Martin Luther King Jr. National Historic Site, bringing new jobs and businesses to struggling downtown neighborhoods, they said. The $72 million project scored a crucial $47.6 million federal grant in October, but Republicans in Congress threatened to take the money back. Now, streetcar fans can breathe a sigh of relief. A Federal Transit Administration press release announced July 13 that the money’s finally ready, and construction can begin. The press release trumpeted reasons why the streetcar is good for Atlanta, including this one: "[T]he project is expected to create an estimated 930 jobs during construction and more than 5,600 jobs over the next 20 years." Wait a second. Didn’t the Truth-O-Meter debunk a similar streetcar job creation claim in March? Indeed, Democrat U.S. Rep. John Lewis, who represents the district where the streetcar will be built, said in a newsletter to constituents that building and running the streetcar is projected to create 1,399 jobs -- 460 to run it, and 939 to build it. The newsletter cited figures in the grant proposal that won the streetcar more than $47 million in federal money. Experts and civil servants came up with the numbers and vetted them, so Lewis’ staff thought they were safe to use. They weren’t. We ruled Lewis’ claim False. Those jobs weren’t actual positions. They were "job years." "Job years" means one job lasting for one year. So if a single position lasts five years, it counts as five "job years." But Lewis’ newsletter described the "job years" as "jobs," which would mislead typical readers. People think of "jobs" as actual positions, so constituents would think the streetcar would create more jobs than experts actually estimated. Since the FTA’s recent press release uses the same numbers, its statement has similar problems. The FTA said its 5,600 jobs figure includes the 930 construction jobs, plus those needed to run the streetcar and positions created when new residences and businesses pop up along the route. The agency, like Lewis, got its numbers from Atlanta’s grant application. (The FTA’s 930 construction jobs count is very close to the 939 the grant application used, so we won’t count this difference against the FTA.) The FTA’s press release portrays the construction jobs estimate accurately. It will take about one year to build the streetcar, so for this phase of the project, one job year does equal one actual job. But that doesn’t mean 930 people are projected to build the streetcar line, and the jobs aren’t all for locals. This is the construction phase’s "total employment" figure, which means the number of people who would be employed for construction, plus two other types of jobs created by the project: those to make materials such as steel to construct the line, and those created when workers spend their earnings on a new stereo or a package of cheese puffs. Planners expect to employ 467 workers for streetcar construction. The rest would be making steel, cheese puffs and the like -- often outside the Atlanta area. Now let’s deal with the rest of the jobs cited in the FTA release. These are the posts planners think the project will create over the next 20 years: 460 needed to operate the streetcar, plus about 4,200 created when the line spurs economic growth. When PolitiFact Georgia researched Lewis’ statement, we were unable to come up with enough evidence to evaluate job estimates for when the streetcar brings new business to the neighborhood. But we could evaluate the claim that 460 jobs are needed to operate the streetcar. This number also represents "job years," not actual positions. It will actually take an estimated 23 positions to run the streetcar, lasting over 20 years. In other words, this jobs figure is 20 times too high. How do we rule on the FTA? As we wrote earlier, a typical person thinks of "jobs" as actual positions, not "job years." And while experts may understand that the FTA’s jobs figures do not represent actual jobs, your average citizen would not. In fact, it will take an estimated 467 jobs to construct the line, plus 23 jobs that last 20 years or longer to run the streetcar. Experts think the remaining 4,600 jobs will be for those who produce materials needed to build the line or products workers purchase with their earnings, as well as employees of new businesses the streetcar brings to surrounding neighborhoods. This means that when the Federal Transit Administration announced the streetcar project would "create an estimated 930 jobs during construction," totaling more than 5,600 over the next 20 years, it gave a misleadingly high impression of the actual positions needed to construct and run it. If public officials keep exaggerating the number of jobs created by this project, PoiltiFact Georgia will keep turning up the heat. Pants on Fire.

pomt-06256	Says Mitt Romney has flip-flopped on his support for President Reagan’s policies.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/nov/29/democratic-national-committee/dnc-calls-out-romneys-evolving-affection-reagan/	The Democratic National Committee is beating the flip-flop drum to attack Mitt Romney. A four-minute DNC video ad accuses the Republican presidential candidate of switching positions on a host of issues including President Barack Obama’s job stimulus package, abortion, global warming and health care reform. Another topic on which the DNC says Romney pulled a switcharoo: his support for former President Ronald Reagan. The ad, released Nov. 28, 2011, juxtaposes two clips of Romney talking. In the first, he says, "I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I’m not trying to return to Reagan-Bush." Next, he’s standing at a podium saying, "The principles that Ronald Reagan espoused are as true today as they were when he spoke them." It’s wrapped up with a clip of Reagan himself chuckling and saying, "There you go again." We’re looking separately at several claims in the ad. Here we ask, is Romney really a flipper when it comes to the Gipper? The video evidence The DNC provided us with a fact sheet laying out the source of each claim in the ad. The first clip of Romney, in which he seemed to be distancing himself from Reagan, comes from a 1994 debate when Romney was challenging the late Edward Kennedy in a race for U.S. Senate. The two were having a mostly philosophical discussion about poverty and families with Kennedy, a liberal Democrat, claiming that child poverty rates rose when Republicans occupied the White House. "Under the Reagan/Bush economic programs, under the economic programs you want to return to, the total number of children that are living in poverty, the total number of children out of wedlock -- this has happened, you know we’ve had Republican presidents during this period of time and the cutting back of support systems for children and most of all for families to get jobs," Kennedy said. "If you’re not going to provide a climate and an atmosphere for men and women to be able to work and provide for their children, you’re going to see the breakdown of the family as well." Kennedy said discussions about supporting families shouldn’t be used to score "political hits," prompting Romney to fire back that he wasn’t politicizing the issue -- Kennedy was. "I mentioned nothing about politics or your position at all. I talked about what I’d do to help strengthen families, and you talked about Reagan-Bush. Look, I was an independent during the time of Reagan-Bush. I’m not trying to return to Reagan-Bush," Romney said, distancing himself from the popular former president. In the second clip, Romney was speaking at the annual Reagan lecture at the Reagan library in Simi Valley, Calif., in May 2010. He was talking about America’s position in the world. "I have to tell you that I’m optimistic. I’m optimistic about the future because I recognize that there is a growing awakening among the American people that this administration has put us on the wrong track and that the principles that Ronald Reagan espoused are as true today as they were when he spoke them." Romney was interrupted by applause, and then continued by elaborating on policies emphasizing low taxes, balanced budgets and strong families. So the two clips are as the DNC presented them in the ad. They are not covertly edited or cut to leave a false impression about what Romney said. But is it a flip flop? The DNC ad is titled "Mitt v. Mitt, The story of two men trapped in one body." It opens with ominous-sounding music and white letters on a black background saying, "He wants to be president" followed by "but what does he really believe?" Then a voice in the background asks, "Who is this guy? Can you trust him?" and the Romney images unfold. The ad’s overt message is that Romney has changed his position on numerous issues, and that makes him an untrustworthy candidate. But the Reagan matter is not so simple as a candidate voting in favor of a concrete issue, then voting against it. We looked and couldn’t find any other references to Romney distancing himself from Reagan, beyond the 1994 debate comment. Prior to 1994, Romney was a businessman, not a politician. It’s true that Romney was not registered with any party for several years in Massachusetts, and in 1992, he voted for former Sen. Paul Tsongas, a liberal Democrat, in the Massachusetts Democratic presidential primary, according to a McClatchy newspapers story. (Romney’s spokesman responded then "that the vote for Tsongas was a vote against Bill Clinton and that not enrolling in either major party was common in Massachusetts.") Later, during his first presidential campaign in 2007, Romney blasted primary rival John McCain for voting against President George W. Bush’s tax cuts. "That's failing Reagan 101," Romney said, holding up Reagan as the standard to which Republicans should aspire. In a debate that year, he was asked whether the primary candidates would support the Republican nominee if it was someone else. Yes, Romney said, then added, "I want that nominee, however, to come out of the same mold as Ronald Reagan." In the 2010 Reagan library address, Romney had more flattering words for the former president. While speaking about the need to keep America strong for the sake of world peace, he paraphrased "that wonderful line" of Reagan’s: "(Reagan) said, ‘of the four wars that were begun during my lifetime, not one of them was begun because America was too strong.’ And he’s absolutely right," Romney said. And again in that speech, Romney approvingly quoted Reagan taking a jab at the left, recalling Reagan’s words, "it isn’t that liberals are ignorant, it’s just that what they know is wrong." Our ruling The DNC ad casts Romney as a flip-flopper on his support for the policies of former President Reagan. In the first clip, Romney in 1994, as a candidate running against a liberal icon in a liberal state, says he’s "not trying to return to Reagan-Bush." Then, 13 years later, he’s speaking approvingly of the former president saying that Reagan’s principles "are as true today as they were when he spoke them." Romney’s affection for Reagan’s presidency has grown warmer over the years and as he appealed to a different electorate. In 1994, Romney needed to win votes from the middle while gunning for the Massachusetts Senate seat. Running for the Republican nomination for president, it’s politically wise for him (and any Republican presidential candidate) to speak glowingly of Reagan. We rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-12658	"In year No. 1, 14 million Americans lose coverage," according to the CBO.	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/mar/22/chris-murphy/house-gop-health-care-bill-would-cause-14-million-/	Democrats continue to hammer Republicans over a health care overhaul that’s projected to set in motion steep drops in insurance enrollment nationwide. Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., in a press conference said the "biggest headline" from an analysis of the House bill by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office was that 24 million fewer Americans would be insured by 2026 under the plan, with a big drop off starting next year. "In 2018, right off the bat, right in year No. 1, 14 million Americans lose coverage," Murphy said in a March 16 press conference. "This is because of the cuts to Medicaid, which will result in states dramatically curtailing Medicaid eligibility, but also because lots of Americans who today have private health care through these exchanges won't be able to afford that coverage, as well as people who will come off employer-sponsored care." We decided to fact-check Murphy's claim about the bill, formally called the American Health Care Act, that 14 million Americans would lose coverage. Murphy accurately identified several of the drivers behind the projected rise in the uninsured rate. But he left out that some of the reduced enrollment would result from the repeal of a deeply unpopular provision in the Affordable Care Act—the individual mandate that requires most Americans to get coverage or pay a penalty. 14 million fewer Americans insured next year The CBO report places the anticipated 14 million newly uninsured people into several categories. It projects 5 million fewer people will be covered under Medicaid; 2 million fewer people will be covered through their employer, and 6 million fewer will obtain coverage on the individual market, either through private insurers or exchanges set up under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. Murphy accurately characterizes the CBO’s findings on reduced enrollment due to Medicaid. In addition to the 5 million fewer people expected to be covered under Medicaid next year, the CBO projects 14 million fewer people would be enrolled in Medicaid by 2026 as states that would likely expand Medicaid under Obamacare chose not to do so under the Republican proposal. The senator also fairly states the CBO’s conclusion on employer-based insurance. Beyond the roughly 2 million fewer people to get coverage through their employer in 2018, the Republican proposal is estimated to lead to roughly 7 million fewer people enrolled in employer-based insurance by 2026. But Murphy didn’t mention that some of these people would voluntarily drop their insurance. The House Republican health care overhaul would repeal the individual mandate penalty, and according to the CBO, this would be the single biggest driver of raising the uninsured rate by 14 million next year. "Most of that increase would stem from repealing the penalties associated with the individual mandate," the CBO report reads. "Some of those people would choose not to have insurance because they chose to be covered by insurance under current law only to avoid paying the penalties, and some people would forgo insurance in response to higher premiums" (emphasis ours). The CBO could not provide specific figures on how many people would opt out of coverage based solely on the removal of penalties, so it’s difficult to quantify. But there’s reason to think the figure would be significant. A RAND study from 2014 found that repealing the individual mandate would cause a sharp reduction in enrollment—with roughly one in five people in the individual market dropping coverage—while adding only relatively small increases to insurance premiums. Some conditions have changed since the study was published, but these findings seem to suggest millions of people would opt out of coverage if the penalties associated with the individual mandate were eliminated. Suffice it to say that while those people would no longer have coverage, they didn't technically lose it, as Murphy said, so much as voluntarily forgo coverage. And omitting this group as a driver of the projected rise in next year’s projected uninsured rate does not tell the whole story behind the 14 million figure. Keep in mind, the people required to buy insurance helped keep rates reasonable for people who are sick or had pre-existing conditions. Insurance markets set up under Obamacare have depended on a group of younger, healthier people blending into a diverse pool with older, sicker people. This arrangement led to a system where "young and healthy enrollees without large subsidies effectively cross-subsidize older, less healthy enrollees when they are required to purchase insurance or pay a penalty," according to a December CBO report. Our ruling Based on the CBO's analysis of the House Republican health care bill, Murphy said, "In year No. 1, 14 million Americans lose coverage." It is the CBO's estimate that 14 million more Americans would be off the health insurance rolls in the year following the bill’s passage. But Murphy overlooked that some of next year's newly uninsured population never wanted insurance to begin with and only got coverage under Obamacare to avoid tax penalties. This is particularly true of the people who "lose" coverage during the first year -- many of them are people dropping coverage because there is no longer a penalty.

pomt-15123	"I cut state spending more than anybody (in the 2016 GOP field)."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/sep/09/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-cut-spending/	Jeb Bush, otherwise known as "Veto Corleone" in Florida, says he has the fiscal conservative track record to back up his nickname. "I cut state spending more than anybody. I’ll do it in DC too," Bush tweeted on Aug. 31, with an accompanying chart. I cut state spending more than anybody. I’ll do it in DC too. pic.twitter.com/8rXnJwBomb — Jeb Bush (@JebBush) August 31, 2015 Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who’s No. 2 in spending cuts according to the chart but No. 14 in the polls, begged to differ and tweeted at Bush with a different chart that shows the former Florida governor was actually the top spender in the field. (Jindal has used this chart to tout his own conservative bonafides before.) .@JebBush may claim to have cut government spending, but FL’s budget grew 52% under his watch https://t.co/BFGM4URs0a pic.twitter.com/VG5NUc6e7t — Gov. Bobby Jindal (@BobbyJindal) September 1, 2015 We were curious about Bush’s claim that he’s the top spending cutter. We found that neither Bush’s chart nor Jindal’s chart is a perfect way to compare state budgets — but Jindal’s chart is less perfect. Bush’s chart The Bush campaign told us his source was a Fox News fact-check that compared the track records of the GOP governors in the race. It looked at changes in state spending, expressed as a percentage change in each state’s budget. Here’s the original chart from Fox: "The chart above shows that Bush cut spending the most. Though he's criticized by conservatives as ‘too moderate,’ the former Florida governor cut spending by an average of 1.39 percent each year he was in office. Most cuts came from ‘public assistance,’ higher education, and state discretionary spending," the fact-check reads. Fox’s data comes from a National Association of State Budget Officers report, which breaks up state spending into four spending pools: general fund (the main fund and typically most flexible), federal funds, other state funds (which includes targeted revenue, such as gasoline taxes for transportation spending), and bonds. According to Brian Sigritz, the association’s director of state fiscal studies, Fox tallied up two of the pools — general fund and other state funds — and adjusted the numbers for inflation and population. We ran Fox’s analysis by a few experts who told us that while it’s a fair analysis, it’s not flawless. (We’ll get to its imperfections later.) On the positive side, taking the different population sizes of different states into consideration is a good start, according to Alan Auerbach, a professor of public finance at the University of California at Berkeley. It’s also fair to leave out federal funds and bonds. David Crane, who researches state fiscal policy at Stanford University, told us he also excludes those categories when crunching the numbers in California’s state budget. "If the goal is to learn if a governor cut spending, why would you include funds provided by a third party?" he said. "(Bonds) are generally issued for infrastructure, not operating costs." Overall, the analysis created a way to measure spending that is mainly under the control of state officials. "It is pretty close to a concept of ‘tax supported spending,’ but still imperfect," said Don Boyd, who analyzes state and local fiscal issues at the Rockefeller Institute of Government. "Overall, based on what Fox said they did, I think they did a pretty good job." Jindal’s chart What about Jindal’s retort? According to his chart, Bush was the top spender out of the eight governors in the 2016 race, and his budget increased by an average of 6.08 percent every year. We noted in a recent fact-check that it’s a more simplistic, and thus more imperfect, way to look at the state budget picture. For one, the analysis does not adjust for inflation. That’s not an issue if you’re comparing the same years for everybody, but the numbers may be distorted when comparing different time periods. (Bush was governor from 1999 to 2007, while Jindal took office in 2008.) "If you're looking at different time periods, inflation surely would have been different and it can't possibly be an accurate reflection of the consequences of policy choices," Boyd said. For another, Jindal’s numbers only consider the general fund. Given that some governors may spend more out of other state funds, just looking at one pool of money makes it more difficult to compare across states, according to Boyd. Limitations all around Experts, however, emphasized that there’s no one way or perfect way to compare budgets across states. "There is not one single measure of state fiscal conditions that we recommend using," said Sigritz of the state budget officers’ association. "There are pluses and minuses with using each indicator." Then there are limitations with the data itself. The association’s numbers are self-reported by the budget offices of each state, which Boyd said may affect the quality of the data. Moreover, the numbers also reflect spending that’s not supported by taxes, such as higher education spending supported by tuition. And because the governors all served at different times, it’s unfair to compare them because they were working with different economic conditions. Bush, for example, governed during an economic boom, and Jindal held office during a recession. "The Bush claim has some merit, but there are additional things one would want to control for — like economic conditions in Florida relative to other states — to get a better picture," said Auerbach. "And, of course, what any governor does depends on the state legislature to a reasonable extent." He and Sigritz both noted that economic downturns have significant impacts on state budgets, and spending usually decreases during recessions. To its credit, Fox tried to address the disparity by comparing each candidate to his contemporaries (i.e. Bush to other governors of the 2000s and Jindal to sitting governors). By that measure, Bush was still the top cutter. Beyond the question of who cut the most spending, experts said we shouldn’t ignore how they did it. "If, for example, a governor cut spending by underpaying pension contributions, or by deferring maintenance on roads and bridges, then look out below," said Boyd. As Fox notes, Bush’s cuts came from public assistance, higher education and state discretionary spending. Much of the reduction under Jindal, reported the Times-Picayune in 2011, is "explained by waning hurricane recovery appropriations and the end of federal stimulus aid." Our ruling Bush tweeted, "I cut state spending more than anybody." He cited a chart by Fox News that experts told us was a valid way of looking at budget reductions. It’s not perfect nor is it the only way to measure spending cuts. Bush’s claim is partially true but leaves out context. We rate it Half True.

pomt-11209	"Two-thirds of the people who use Medicaid are poor children, but two-thirds of the money is for long-term care for seniors, whether in a facility or at home."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/may/11/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-wrong-medicaids-role-children-elderly/	During an appearance at a fiscal policy summit in Washington, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., delved into who – and what — the Medicaid program pays for. Medicaid, the federal-state program that serves many poor Americans, is one of several mandatory spending programs putting pressure on the federal budget. At roughly 6:48 in this video, Pelosi said, "Two-thirds of the people who use Medicaid are poor children, but two-thirds of the money is for long-term care for seniors, whether in a facility or at home." Is this accurate? No — as Pelosi’s office quickly clarified after PolitiFact inquired. See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Pelosi "misspoke," said Henry Connelly, Pelosi’s deputy communications director. Connelly clarified that she should have said that "children are close to half of Medicaid enrollees" and said she "inverted" the statistic about long-term care spending. "It’s not that two-thirds of Medicaid goes to long-term care, it’s that two-thirds of long-term care is paid for by Medicaid," citing data posted by the Alliance for Retired Americans. (To be precise, according to the group, the share of long-term care costs paid by Medicaid was 62 percent in 2015.) Let’s take a closer look at the actual data for age and long-term care spending. Children accounted for 48 percent of Medicaid beneficiaries in 2013, not the two-thirds Pelosi initially said. The percentage may have changed somewhat following the expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act, but experts said they did not expect there to have been a dramatic shift. Here’s the full breakdown: See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com As for long-term care costs as a share of Medicaid spending, it’s quite a bit less than the two-thirds Pelosi cited. In 2016, various types of long-term care accounted for 21.4 percent of all Medicaid spending. See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Our ruling Pelosi said, "Two-thirds of the people who use Medicaid are poor children, but two-thirds of the money is for long-term care for seniors, whether in a facility or at home." Her office acknowledged that she misspoke. She overstated both the percentage of Medicaid beneficiaries who are children, and the percentage of Medicaid spending devoted to long-term care.

pomt-00896	"The governor must inform the Senate president about his or her absence from the state."	mostly false	/new-hampshire/statements/2015/mar/05/jennifer-horn/nh-republican-party-says-governor-required-notify-/	Gov. Maggie Hassan traveled to private meetings in New York and Washington D.C. Monday, fanning speculation that she may consider a run for U.S. Senate in 2016 to challenge first-term Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte. In recent weeks, the New Hampshire Republican Party has taken aim at Hassan’s out-of-state travel schedule, claiming the New Hampshire Democrat is using the governor’s post as a "political stepping stone" to elevate her political career. Republican party Chairwoman Jennifer Horn filed several right-to-know requests seeking Hassan’s travel itinerary, and suggested that Hassan did not follow "proper protocol" by notifying the Senate President when she left the state. In a letter sent to Hassan’s office, Horn writes that "the governor must inform the Senate president about his or her absence from the state." In response to Horn’s letter, Hassan responded that -- at the time -- she had only traveled outside the state once in 2015, to the border with Maine to attend the groundbreaking for a bridge reconstruction project. She has since traveled out of the state twice more. We wondered, is the governor required to tell the Senate president every time she leaves the state, whether on official business, for vacation or simply to go out for dinner in Boston? State Republican Party spokesman Ryan William pointed to the New Hampshire Constitution, part 2 article 49, which outlines who acts as governor when the office is vacant, and what qualifies as a vacancy. That section states: "In the event of the death, resignation, removal from office, failure to qualify, physical or mental incapacity, absence from the state, or other incapacity of the governor, the president of the senate, for the time being, shall act as governor until the vacancy is filled or the incapacity is removed." The section furthers outlines when the powers of the governor are transferred as a result of an absence from the state in its concluding sentence: "While the governor or an acting governor is absent from the state on official business, he shall have the power and authority to transact such business." In other words, under Article 49, the only time gubernatorial authority would fall to the Senate President due to the governor’s absence would be when the governor is away on unofficial business, such as a private vacation, said Martin Gross, senior counsel at the law firm Sulloway & Hollis and an expert in New Hampshire constitutional matters. So, if Hassan leaves, is she required to notify Senate President Morse? The Constitution doesn’t directly spell it out. Williams says it’s good practice, for the safety of the state. "It’s important for Gov. Hassan to inform Senate President Morse when she is out of state. If she doesn't, he has no way to know he is acting governor (and) that would put the state at risk," Williams said. Still, good practice is not the same thing as a requirement. This is not a new issue; it has come up in state politics from time to time. The state attorney general’s office has rendered opinions on whether the governor is required to notify the senate president of an absence. "While there are instances when notice has been formerly given in the past, it is not mandated by the Constitution, which is wholly silent on the issue," wrote Attorney General Stephen Merrill in 1987. However, Merrill noted, the intention of the Constitution was to have an automatic transfer of powers. "Since the executive power must be kept functioning at all times, there can be no possibility of the gap which would occur while the Senate President awaits a notice from the governor," Merrill wrote. And Merrill added, "There appears to have been a custom in New Hampshire for a Governor to provide notice if he is to be absent or disabled for some significant period of time." Over the years, governors and senate presidents have worked out their own notification processes, and they vary widely. When Sen. Sylvia Larsen, a Concord Democrat, was Senate President between 2006 to 2010 then-Gov. John Lynch, a Democrat, didn’t tell her when he was leaving, she said. "In my four years (as Senate President) I don’t ever recall ever being notified," said Larsen, who did not seek reelection last year. "If I learned about it, it was just because we were friends." That wasn’t the case with Larsen’s successor, Peter Bragdon, a Milford Republican who was Senate President between 2010 and 2013, overlapping with both Lynch and Hassan’s terms. Lynch and Bragdon worked out an informal system, Bragdon said. Lynch’s chief of staff would notify Bragdon’s office when the governor would be out of state. It was the same when Hassan took over, he said. "It was pretty much a courtesy," said Bragdon, who is now executive director of Health Trust Inc., which was formerly part of the Local Government Center. Hassan’s office recently released documents showing that her chief of staff, Pam Walsh, emailed Morse’s chief of staff, Kristy Merill, on the morning of Thursday, Feb 19, 2015, to tell her Hassan would be out of state that evening through Monday. That was when Hassan went to Washington D.C. to attend the National Governors Association winter meeting. "She will be reachable by cell and email during the trip," Walsh wrote. Walsh again emailed on Feb. 27, to say Hassan would be out of the state until the morning of March 3 as she traveled to New York and Washington D.C. We’ll note that none of the governor’s powers were transferred to Morse during any of Hassan’s absences, according to the governor’s office. Our ruling New Hampshire Republican Party Chairwoman Jennifer Horn said Gov. Maggie Hassan "must inform the Senate president about his or her absence from the state." While according to the state Constitution the governor’s powers are passed onto the Senate president during certain gubernatorial absences, the Constitution does not specifically require notification. It has been a frequent practice for governors to notify the Senate president of their absence from the state (as Hassan has been doing by email) but this policy hasn’t been followed in every case.

pomt-09693	"I signed the largest single tax cut in the history of Florida, a $25 billion tax cut over five years, directed at property tax cuts."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/10/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-is-taking-credit-for-floridas-larges/	It's become part of Florida Gov. Charlie Crist's firewall when confronted with criticism that he isn't conservative enough. "I signed the largest single tax cut in the history of Florida, a $25 billion tax cut over five years, directed at property tax cuts," Crist said while speaking to a group of Michigan Republicans in September. "My state goes back to 1845; the largest tax cut since 1845 in the Sunshine State." Crist touts his tax-cutting record over and over, in news releases, political speeches and in the first radio ad for his U.S. Senate campaign. The line is good politics. But is it true? The property tax changes proposed by Crist and the Legislature in early 2007 were sold as the antidote to citizens' complaints that local government spending had spiraled out of control. Crist famously predicted taxes would "drop like a rock." On June 21, 2007, the governor signed House bills 1B and 5B — the two-pronged tax package. House Bill 1B required local governments to reduce their property tax rates to 2006 levels and mandated deeper cuts based on how much a local government collected in property tax dollars. The reported savings to taxpayers: $15.6 billion over five years. House Bill 5B, meanwhile, let voters consider further property tax changes. Also known as Amendment 1, the changes — which included an additional homestead benefit, limited property value increases for non-homesteaded property and created portability for Save Our Homes — were approved by voters in January 2008. The savings: $9.3 billion over five years. Combined, that's the $25 billion Crist is talking about. We have to address two questions to see if Crist's claim is right: Are the estimates correct? And do they constitute the largest state tax cut ever? Caution: The following information is considered highly wonky. Crist's tax math To estimate the financial impact of the 2007 and 2008 property tax changes, analysts at the governor's office first forecast a future as if the changes had not occurred. The process was relatively simple. Analysts estimated five years of statewide property tax collection information by multiplying a tax rate, which they did not change, by taxable property values, which they grew at 3 to 5 percent a year. The calculation, analysts said, attempted to replicate the billions of dollars in property taxes Floridians would pay each year if nothing else happened. With that baseline, analysts next built a world post-tax changes, multiplying an estimated new tax rate by the same property values. The difference between Year 1 of the first calculation and Year 1 of the second constitutes the governor's estimate of the savings to Florida taxpayers. They did the same math for years 2 through 5, and voila — $25 billion in savings. Simple? No, says David Gamage, an assistant professor at the University of California at Berkeley who specializes in taxation. The governor's estimates would be accurate only if property tax values increased as analysts predicted and local governments failed to reduce their tax rates, Gamage says. We will never know what governments would have done to their tax rates, but we do know about property tax values: They've gone down. Taxable property values dropped 15 percent in 2008, according to figures from county property appraisers. Property values are expected to drop again in 2009. "Even if this policy hadn't been enacted, the future would look different than today," Gamage said. It's the same reason that a recent Florida Association of Counties report concluded that of the $1.5 billion trimmed from property tax collections at the county level in the past three years, almost half is a result of falling property values, not the Crist-led changes. When questioned by PolitiFact, the governor's office admitted that its original savings estimates are now likely high and it has not rerun the analysis. What we do know is this: the Department of Revenue said that as a result of the legislative-mandated tax rate rollbacks, the state's property tax collections fell about $300 million ( page 9 ) from fiscal year 2007 to fiscal year 2008. And property tax collections in total fell an estimated $745 million ( page 163 ) from fiscal year 2008 to 2009, the first year the Amendment 1 changes took effect. That's a $1.05 billion reduction in property taxes. The governor's estimate predicted $6.1 billion in savings during that same period. If property values fail to increase, the gap will only widen since the changes are estimated to have a bigger impact in later years. Part of the difference in the numbers is that the governor's office counted future, theoretical increases in tax collections as part of its estimated "tax cut." And part of the difference is that falling property values wrecked the governor's projections. Is it the biggest? Despite inaccurate projections, the governor's office says the 2007 and 2008 tax cuts are still the state's largest. But what else competes? The governor's analysts point to the repeal of the intangibles tax. The intangibles tax — created during the Depression — was paid on investments, and at its peak, sat at 2 mills ($2 for every $1,000). The tax was cut under Gov. Lawton Chiles and repealed entirely in 2006 by Gov. Jeb Bush. At its height in 1999, it provided the state about $1.2 billion in revenue, according to the Department of Revenue. Adjusted for inflation, that translates to about $1.5 billion in 2007. That's a bigger tax break than what the Crist-led changes delivered in fiscal years 2007 and 2008, but not more than Crist's rosy projection. We wondered if anyone previously has claimed to be Florida's tax cut king. Bush did. In 1999, Bush and the Legislature passed what they called "the largest tax cut in state history." The $1.01 billion plan included further cuts to the intangibles tax, as well as the repeal of a per-drink tax on alcohol, a rollback in the school property tax rate and a reduction in unemployment taxes businesses pay, among other things. Kurt Wenner, director of Tax Research at Florida TaxWatch, suggested a third tax change that could be considered the state's largest: Save Our Homes. The amendment to the state Constitution proposed and approved by citizens in 1992 limited increases to the property value of homesteaded property in Florida. While there is debate about whether those savings were offset by people without homestead exemptions, the savings to homesteaded property owners is quantifiable. From 1996 to 2008, almost $1.9 trillion in property value went untaxed because of Save Our Homes. Using a conservative tax rate of 17 mills, that equates to $32 billion less in property taxes paid — or about $2.66 billion per year without adjusting for inflation. In 2007, the savings was about $7.27 billion and from 2004 to 2008 the estimated savings was more than $26 billion. Those numbers certainly are bigger than the Crist cuts so far, in reality and in projection. The governor's office said it did not consider Save Our Homes when it made the claim that the Crist tax changes constitute the state's largest. Officials then provided data that showed the saving in the first years of Save Our Homes was modest. But that's because the large savings came in later years as Save Our Homes protected against increases to properties' taxable value. Failing to consider Save Our Homes didn't sit well with Ken Wilkinson, the Lee County property appraiser who led the push for Save Our Homes — and supported the Crist-led changes. "I would say Save Our Homes is the largest tax cut in the history of Florida," Wilkinson said. "There is a savings, you can look it up, and it's real." Wilkinson and Wenner said you can't ignore Save Our Homes just because it was a citizen initiative. Moreover, the Crist-led changes built off Save Our Homes in two major ways — by making Save Our Homes portable and by creating a Save Our Homes style benefit for commercial and rental properties. If one's a tax cut, so is the other. Our ruling The Crist-led changes to Florida's property tax structure certainly required the lowering of tax rates and assessment values throughout Florida. But there are all kinds of holes in projecting the size and scope of the legislation's impact. The basis for the governor's estimate assumed a future that did not come to pass. Specifically, the governor's estimates relied on future property values continuing to increase and local governments failing to lower their property tax rate. We now know property values are decreasing. The governor's office admits its projections are now inaccurate because of declines in property values statewide. A state analysis concluded that the tax measures have failed to produce the savings estimated by the governor. Portability, for instance, was predicted to cut taxable property values by $11.5 billion in 2008. But it cut property values only $3.4 billion, the analysis showed. Here's the bottom line: While the tax structure changes passed by the Legislature, signed by Crist and approved by voters undoubtedly will result in less property taxes being paid by Florida residents, the specific financial impact of the initiatives remains quite unclear. Experts say projections can be misleading. But given the decline in home values, we know Crist will have difficulty reaching his claim of $25 billion over five years. In the absence of additional data, and with the knowledge that Save Our Homes has cut property tax bills for Florida residents $32 billion or more, we can't agree with Crist that the 2007 and 2008 changes constitute the largest tax cut in state history. We rule Crist's statement False.	None	Charlie Crist	None	None	None	2009-11-10T18:02:40	2009-09-25	['None']
pomt-00812	Georgia has one of the nation’s highest jet fuel taxes.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2015/mar/31/trebor-banstetter/delta-spokesman-mostly-correct-about-jet-fuel-taxe/	Time is running out for the 2015 General Assembly and for state lawmakers who had a lofty goal this session of raising at least $1 billion for transportation improvements. One of the backstories to the transportation bill (House Bill 170) has been: Will a fraction of the money -- about $23 million -- come from eliminating a controversial state jet fuel tax exemption? That tax break has benefitted hometown Delta Air lines for nearly a decade and was made permanent by that lawmakers and the governor in 2012. To some, eliminating the exemption seems reasonable. "The loophole is unnecessary since Delta is highly profitable and no longer at risk of bankruptcy, as they were a few years ago (when the exemption was first granted)," said Wesley Tharpe, analyst with the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute. "Ending their special privileges at a time when we’re asking Georgians for more revenues makes sense." Delta executives don’t feel the same. They’ve called efforts to remove the exemption "one of the most business-unfriendly moves" by the General Assembly in recent years. Among Delta’s arguments is that the existing jet fuel taxes are already high enough and that a further increase could jeopardize Atlanta airport’s competitive status. "If approved, this measure would put Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport at an economic disadvantage by making aviation fuel taxes in Georgia some of the highest in the industry," Trebor Banstetter Delta spokesman told The Associated Press, referencing House Bill 175, a measure that initially would have eliminated the sales tax exemption just for Delta. Banstetter and other Delta officials have cited information from Airlines for America, the airline trade association, that they say backs ups their claim that Georgia already has one of the nation’s highest jet fuel tax rates. PolitiFact Georgia wondered: Could that be right? Buckle up, and let’s see where the facts take us. The right-leaning Tax Foundation ranked states for jet fuel taxes in June 2014 based on data from Airlines for America. The foundation found Georgia was 11th nationally at 15 cents, based on its combined effective jet fuel tax rate and fees per gallon. Illinois had the highest jet fuel taxes at 32.8 cents -- more than twice Georgia’s -- followed by California with 27 cents and Connecticut with 26.4 cents. Three states -- Texas, Ohio and Delaware -- had no jet fuel taxes. Of the 47 states that have some type of jet fuel tax or fee, Georgia is considered an outlier, said Victoria Day, spokeswoman for Airlines for America. "Most states do not apply a retail sales tax to jet fuel, which makes sense because taxing business inputs creates tax pyramiding," Day said. Georgia’s jet fuel sales tax would go from three percent to four percent, if the exemption is eliminated. To show how complicated the jet fuel tax computations are: 19 states don’t include any jet fuel in their sales tax base; 16 states tax private jet fuel purchases but exempt commercial airlines; and 15 states apply the sales tax to commercial jet fuel, although sometimes at a reduced rate. Finally, three states (New Jersey, New York, and Washington) only tax fuel estimated to be burned within their state borders, significantly reducing the burden of fuel taxes, the foundation’s report said. We found another report on jet fuel costs at 12 billion.org, a site run by Unite Here International Union, a group critical of tax exemptions benefitting the airlines. The report looked at costs at the major airports. It’s data was slightly older than the association’s. It showed fuel costs at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as sixth highest at 15 cents a gallon and Chicago’s O'Hare International Airport as the highest at 32.75 cents per gallon, numbers identical to those reported by the airline trade association for 2014 for Georgia and Illinois, respectively. Commercial aviation supports more than 350,000 jobs and drives 45 billion in economic activity in Georgia, according to Airlines for America. How the tax break came to be Lawmakers first approved the jet fuel tax break for Delta in 2005, when the airline was headed into Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. They repeatedly extended the tax exemption even as the carrier’s finances improved and its stock soared, making it permanent for Delta and any airlines in 2012. State Rep. Earl Ehrhart, R-Powder Springs introduced House Bill 175 in January, saying it was time Delta "get off the taxpayer dime." He said the bill was retaliation against Delta officials for speaking out against a potential second airport in Paulding County or suggesting that lawmakers should not be "chicken" about raising taxes for transportation. Delta officials said Ehrhart’s bill, as originally drafted, was illegal because federal law requires jet fuel tax revenues be spent on airports or airport improvements, not go to the general fund, a statement PolitiFact Georgia ruled as True. Ehrhart vehemently denied the bill, which stalled in the House, was illegal, saying a three-year grace period from the feds would give the state a chance to reinstate the tax and spent the money as it wants, at least temporarily. Delta’s Banstetter said last week: "At this point, all we can say is that if the bill is passed it will be up to the FAA to decide whether the state is in compliance." In at least two other states -- North Carolina and Illinois -- legislators are considering proposals to remove tax breaks or close tax loopholes for airlines. Our conclusion: Delta officials are arguing against reinstating a 1-percent tax on jet fuel, which would generate about $23 million a year, mostly from Delta fuel purchases. Delta executives say that Georgia already has one of the nation’s highest jet fuel taxes and would have an even higher rate, if the exemption were eliminated. Georgia’s jet fuel tax is ranked 11th and is less than half of the tax in No. 1 rated Illinois. That bit of missing context takes this one down a notch on the Truth-O-Meter.

pomt-00462	Says Bill Nelson "doesn’t pay payroll taxes for his employees. He doesn’t even provide them with health benefits. It’s stealing money from Medicare and Social Security."	mostly false	/florida/statements/2018/aug/16/rick-scott/nelson-wasnt-paying-payroll-taxes-because-he-didnt/	A new attack ad portrays U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson as scamming his employees and the federal government by avoiding payroll taxes. The ad, released by Republican challenger Gov. Rick Scott, claims, "(Bill) Nelson doesn’t pay payroll taxes for his employees. He doesn’t even provide them with health benefits. It’s stealing money from Medicare and Social Security." Several PolitiFact readers emailed us (truthometer@politifact.com) to ask if the ad was accurate, so we decided to fact-check it. Back to the source The ad includes a headline that says, "Bill Nelson’s campaign avoiding taxes, health care costs on campaign staff." So we ruled out that Nelson’s official Senate staff were the employees the ad was talking about. The headline is from the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news organization, which published an article July 13 stating that Nelson had not hired any full-time employees on his Senate campaign. Federal campaigns are required to disclose their spending information to the Federal Election Commission, which regulates campaign finances. When the story was published, the Nelson campaign had not disclosed any "disbursements" labeled as payroll. Likewise, there were no insurance payments for workers listed in FEC filings between January 2017 and June 2018. When we dug in deeper, we found that the Nelson campaign didn’t have any full-time staff to pay taxes on. In the first half of the year, the Nelson campaign was using paid consultants. "This isn’t unusual, as most political campaigns rely heavily on consultants, especially early on in the cycle," said Nelson spokeswoman Carlie Waibel. Employers do not need to pay the payroll tax on consultants. They also do not need to provide health benefits. Paul Herrnson, professor of political science at the University of Connecticut, said hiring consultants is relatively common, especially for incumbent politicians. Incumbents may work with consultants — often people and firms they’ve worked with on previous campaigns or during their time in office — to help raise money, conduct polls, and organize early campaign efforts. Staff for a campaign are hired to manage day-to-day activities and voter mobilization closer to the election. We checked the FEC filings to see if other campaigns relied heavily on consultants. We focused on nearly a dozen similar races— battleground states with an incumbent running for re-election. Based on the FEC filings for these campaigns, all 11 incumbents had hired staff (and paid payroll taxes) by June, when the last filing was due. Nelson’s tactics, while legal, do seem to be uncommon. (Some Democrats have criticized Nelson’s campaign as understaffed and overmatched.) The Nelson campaign hired some full-time employees in early July, according to Waibel, but these changes have not been reported to the FEC yet. The next filing is due on Aug. 16, and Nelson will have to begin paying payroll taxes on these new employees. As for health insurance, Waibel said, "Nelson for Senate staff are compensated to ensure they have access to health care. Health care costs are considered when establishing staffer's salaries." The ad is somewhat outdated, but it does align with the most recent data available online. "Stealing money from Medicare and Social Security" The ad also claims that Nelson is "stealing money from Medicare and Social Security" by not paying payroll taxes. The payroll tax is one of the major financiers for Medicare and Social Security. But a company that pays consultants is not "stealing" from Medicare or Social Security. Here’s how it works: When a company pays a full-time employee, they set aside 7.65 percent of the employee’s check to go toward Medicare and Social Security. The employer will match that, so effectively 15.3 percent of the employee’s salary is paid to Social Security and Medicare. For consultants, things get a little more complicated. Consultants, like other contract workers, generally have to pay the full 15.3 percent themselves to Medicare and Social Security. If the consultant employed his or her own full-time employees, the employees would pay half and their employer (the consultant) would pay half. The same amount of money will go to Medicare and Social Security, regardless of whether the Nelson campaign pays it or the consultants do. This may be a cost-cutting measure for the campaign, but it certainly isn’t "stealing," as the ad claims. Our ruling Scott released an ad which claimed, "Nelson doesn’t pay payroll taxes for his employees. He doesn’t even provide them with health benefits. It’s stealing money from Medicare and Social Security." Nelson relied on consultants for the early parts of his campaign. Because he did not have employees, he did not have to pay payroll taxes or provide health insurance. In July, Nelson hired employees, though they will not report that change to the FEC until mid-August. The campaign still does not provide healthcare to their employees but says that salaries are adjusted so staff will have access to care. Nelson does not have to pay payroll taxes on consultants. Instead, the consultants pay the payroll taxes. This is a common set-up for contract work. No money is being lost or stolen from the national funds. We rate this statement Mostly False.

pomt-13266	"We don't have any" chess grandmasters in the United States.	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/oct/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-maligns-us-chess-prowess/	One of Donald Trump’s signature lines at rallies has been that the United States doesn’t win any more. "Folks, we don't win anymore, right?" he said in June in an event in the Woodlands, Texas. "We don't win anymore. We don't win! We don't win on anything." More recently, during an Oct. 10 rally in Ambridge, Pa., Trump offered a variation on that theme -- and the U.S. chess community wasn’t happy about his remarks. Trump was in the midst of criticizing international trade agreements, including the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He said he supports the idea of bilateral agreements, saying that such deals would make it possible for the United States to threaten to withdraw, then renegotiate on more favorable terms before the agreement expired. Trump went on to say that with multilateral pacts like the TPP, "you can't terminate -- there's too many people, you go crazy. It's like you have to be a grand chess master. And we don't have any of them." (You can see it here, around the 19:45 mark.) Trump’s statement sounded wrong to us. The Trump campaign did not respond to an inquiry, but as it turns out, it is wrong. In fact, the comment provoked anger and ridicule within the chess community, which knows that the United States is currently on a roll in international competition. Chess grandmasters It’s literally wrong that "we don’t have any" chess grandmasters. That’s the correct term, by the way, not "grand chess masters." Currently, the United States has 90 grandmasters, counting both men and women, which is enough to rank third-highest in the world. The title is awarded by FIDE, the international governing body of chess; it’s the highest rank conferred by the group, and it is given for life. Russia, a longtime chess powerhouse, ranks first with 234 grandmasters, while Germany ranks second with 91, just one more than the United States. Here’s a list of the top 30 nations in the FIDE rankings. Recent U.S. victories In the meantime, Trump chose a particularly inopportune moment for his comment. Most notable is the victory less than a month earlier by the U.S. men’s team at the 42nd Chess Olympiad in Baku, Azerbaijan -- which is considered the first time in nearly 80 years that the United States won the gold. To win in September, the United States bested such powerhouses as Russia, Ukraine, India and China. Chess may not be the most popular sport in the United States, but observers called the Olympic victory a watershed moment for U.S. chess. "The 2016 win in the Chess Olympiad is huge," said Olimpiu G. Urcan, a Singapore-based chess writer and historian. "The previous Olympiad was won by China, and Russia and Ukraine are extremely competitive. Having the United States finish first was a huge boost for chess in America and a moment of genuine pride. Many in the U.S. right now believe that the successes of 2016 could produce a rejuvenation of chess" similar to what happened with the international stardom of Bobby Fischer in the 1970s. Macauley Peterson, a Hamburg, Germany-based American who serves as content director for chess24, calls it "frankly discouraging" that the United States team "received so little media attention. The number of U.S. grandmasters is higher than ever, and winning the Olympiad was a historic achievement." Urcan was among the first to notice Trump’s quote and tweeted about it. That led to none other than Garry Kasparov -- probably the most famous living chess grandmaster -- to tweet his disbelief. Kasparov is Russian but is living in exile in New York City; he has been an outspoken critic of Russian leader Vladimir Putin. See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com Hikaru Nakamura, a U.S. Olympic team member and currently the world’s No. 7 ranked player, joined in: See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com In the meantime, the United States is home to 15-year-old grandmaster Jeffrey Xiong, who in August won the World Junior Chess Championship -- the first U.S. victory in the tournament in nearly two decades. And the United States is currently the only country to have three players in the world’s top 10 list -- Nakamura, Fabiano Caruana and Wesley So. A final note: There is a long history of foreign players flocking to affiliate with the U.S. team. The victorious Olympic team includes Fabiano Caruana, a dual American and Italian citizen who had previously played for Italy, and Wesley So, who was born in the Philippines. Our ruling Trump said, "We don't have any" chess grandmasters in the United States. Actually, the United States has 90 grandmasters, the third most of any country, and the U.S. team recently won chess’ biggest international tournament for the first time in eight decades.

pomt-11016	Marijuana and THC "have caused emergency room visits to skyrocket."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2018/jul/06/patrick-kennedy/has-marijuana-caused-emergency-room-visits-skyrock/	Advocates against marijuana legalization frequently cite increased marijuana-related hospitalizations as proof the drug should not be sold commercially. But how much of a threat does cannabis actually present? Since retiring from Congress in 2010, Patrick J. Kennedy has been speaking out about his struggles with drug addiction and mental health. Kennedy is the co-founder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, a non-profit dedicated to combating cannabis legalization. The group refers to marijuana as "the next ‘Big Tobacco’" and advocates for increased research into cannabis as a potential medicinal source, rather than a recreational drug. In Kennedy’s home state of Rhode Island, the push for recreational legalization continues. In February 2018, the Rhode Island General Assembly resolved to create a working committee to study the effects of legalization. In May, Sen. Joshua Miller introduced a bill to the House to legalize for all people 21 and over. The day after the bill was introduced, the Providence Journal published an editorial by Kennedy. In it, Kennedy draws connections between addiction and mental illness, and encourages readers to take control of their mental health through "healthy coping mechanisms and problem solving skills." Especially for children, he writes, turning to drugs as a way of handling stress is a dangerous road to follow. Good as that all sounds, one line in particular stood out to us: "These drugs (marijuana/THC), which masquerade as food, have caused emergency room visits to skyrocket," Kennedy wrote. Researchers are still working to determine the long-term health consequences of marijuana. Although each person reacts to THC differently, no deaths caused by marijuana alone have ever been recorded, according to a Drug Enforcement Administration fact sheet. Regardless of immediate health risks, though, marijuana can impair judgement, leading to more accidents, or cause anxiety and paranoia in some users, leading to panic attacks that may prompt hospital visits. We decided to look at the numbers and determine if marijuana really has caused emergency room visits to increase. Colorado case study When we contacted Kennedy about this claim, Kennedy’s spokeswoman directed us to two studies about marijuana usage in Colorado: one conducted by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, and another compiled by Smart Against Marijuana. Colorado was one of the first states to legalize marijuana for recreational use. Retail marijuana stores opened in early 2014, and medical marijuana had been legal since 2000. Colorado has also collected the most data on the consequences of marijuana legalization, serving as the template for other states considering the move. Hospitalization and emergency department visit rates related to marijuana are studied based on patient records. When a patient arrives at the emergency department, they are assigned "billing codes," which list their conditions. According to the American Health Information Management Association, the primary diagnoses should be listed first. The 2015 report from the Colorado Department of Public Health shows that hospitalizations with marijuana-related billing codes have climbed steadily over the years. In 2011, 1,313 per 100,000 hospitalizations had marijuana-related billing codes, a figure which had risen to 3,025 by 2015. However, hospitalizations and emergency department visits—the statistic that Kennedy claims to be citing—are slightly different. Emergency department visits refer to patients who come to the hospital and are treated without being admitted. According to Dr. Daniel Vigil, program manager of the Marijuana Health Monitoring and Research Program at the Colorado Department of Public Health, hospitalizations are more likely to include marijuana-related billing codes. "The limitation that a marijuana code might be present even when it isn't a causal factor in the visit may be more pronounced with hospitalizations, because there's more opportunity for gathering and documenting substance use information," Dr. Vigil told us in an email. "For this reason, I'm more likely to discuss the (emergency department) visit rates when asked about health impacts." So, although hospitalization rates are increasing in Colorado, emergency department rates are not. The emergency rate had increased from 2011 to 2014, peaking at 1,034 per 100,000 emergency visits, but then fell significantly in 2015 to only 754 per 100,000. In both this dataset and the data for hospitalizations, researchers counted any patient with a marijuana-related billing code, even if that code was unrelated to the injury being treated. So, if a patient were to come in with a cut on their hand, but also had smoked a few hours prior, they would receive a billing code and count as a "marijuana-related hospitalization." What’s it all mean? In Colorado, there has been a significant increase in patients being hospitalized with marijuana in their system. In the last decade, the hospitalization rate has more than doubled. However, it’s important to recognize that these numbers, while increasing, still make up a very small percentage of the total hospital visits. Three percent of hospitalizations in Colorado had a marijuana-related code in 2015, which could mean anything from "patient is currently high" to "patient smokes weed habitually." Only 0.6% of Colorado hospitalizations list marijuana in the top 3 billing codes. And again, none of that means that people are in the hospital because of marijuana. What About the Other States? There are currently few studies which examine marijuana-related hospitalizations within individual states, even in areas where recreational cannabis has been legalized. One nationwide study by Dr. He Zhu of Duke University Medical Center showed that across the United States, between 2004 and 2011, emergency department visits that involved the use of cannabis had increased from 51 to 73 per 100,000 patients between 2004 and 2011. Those that involved cannabis combined with other drugs had also increased from 63 to 100 per 100,000. So again, definitely a trend upwards, but marijuana-related cases still encompassed less than 0.01% of total hospitalizations. Similarly to the Colorado studies, the researchers relied on hospital records that could not identify cannabis as the cause of the visit, but rather just a contributing factor. Additionally, because the study only used data up until 2011, it could not accurately reflect the trends related to recreational sales. Is it causal? We cannot conclusively say that marijuana has caused an increase in visits to the emergency room. Rather, the data show that more people are arriving at the hospital having recently or habitually used cannabis, even if that is not their primary condition (or related at all to their primary condition). Through it seems plausible that impaired judgment or slowed reflexes may be a culprit, it is impossible to say how often that is true. Dr. Jerome Avorn, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, told us for a 2016 fact-check, "The main risk from marijuana is from the risky or stupid things people do after using it, such as driving, rather than from any toxic effects of the substance itself, which is remarkably safe." Our ruling Kennedy wrote that marijuana and THC, "have caused emergency room visits to skyrocket." It is true that hospitalizations have increased over the last decade by people using marijuana, both in states like Colorado that have legalized recreational cannabis and nationwide. However, due to the way hospitals keep patient records, it is impossible to say that marijuana is the cause of these visits. Rather, it is possible that the higher numbers of high patients are due simply to the fact that more people are using marijuana overall. To say that marijuana is causing emergency room visits to skyrocket is unfounded based on the limited data that has been collected. We rate this claim Half True. Correction: This article has been revised to better reflect uncertainty about the long-term medical effects of marijuana. It does not change the rating of the fact-check.

pomt-06494	When George W. Bush was governor of Texas, "the percentage uninsured went down." Under his successor, Rick Perry, "it's gone up."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2011/oct/13/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-uninsured-increased-under-rick-pe/	During the Oct. 11, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Hanover, N.H., former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney sought to contrast health care in his state with that in rival Gov. Rick Perry's home state, Texas. "We (Massachusetts) have less than 1 percent of our kids that are uninsured," Romney told Perry. "You have a million kids uninsured in Texas. A million kids." Under the administration of George W. Bush, he continued, "the percentage uninsured went down. Under your leadership, it's gone up." We weren’t sure whether Romney meant the uninsurance rate for Texans of all ages, or specifically for children. Romney didn’t explicitly cite children in his comment, and when we contacted the campaign, they confirmed that he had meant uninsured Texans overall. However, the comment followed on the heels of discussion of uninsured children, so we think viewers would have reason to think Romney was talking about the uninsurance rate for kids only. As it turns out, which meaning is ascribed to Romney’s words pretty much determines whether Romney is right or wrong. To explain, we’ll turn to historical data compiled by the U.S. Census Bureau. First, let’s look at the uninsurance rate for the population as a whole. Under Bush, the percentage of Texans without health insurance declined from 24.5 percent in 1995 to 23.5 percent in 2001. Under Perry, the percentage without health insurance rose from 23.2 percent in 2001 to 26.1 percent in 2009, the most recent year available. (Eagle-eyed readers will notice that the rate for 2001 was slightly different for the two governors. This is because the Census Bureau changed its methodology in the interim.) So, based on the uninsurance rates for Texas’ population at large, Romney’s claim is justified. How about the rates for children? That’s a different story. Under Bush, the uninsurance rate for children fell from 22.4 percent in 1995 to 21.3 percent in 2001. Under Perry, the uninsurance rate for children didn’t rise -- it continued to fall, from 21.1 percent in 2001 to 16.5 percent in 2009. So looking at the children’s uninsurance rate, Romney’s comment is wrong. "The continued decline in the number of uninsured Texas children … is the silver lining to a very cloudy uninsured rate for Texas adults," said a report from the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank in Austin. The results for children’s uninsurance surprised us. Even as uninsurance rates for the Texas population as a whole were rising, the rates for children were falling -- and falling faster than the overall rates rose. In addition, the rate of children without insurance in Texas fell faster than the national rate, which declined from 11.3 percent in 2001 to 10 percent in 2009. And this all came as Texas’ population was increasing by about 20 percent, meaning that huge numbers of kids had to be added to the insurance rolls just to keep pace with population growth. One explanation we looked at is the margin of error for the Census Bureau studies. Using the sampling error values included in the tables, we found that the declines for both all Texans and children during the Bush years was within the margin of error. That means that the decreases we saw might actually have been an increase -- the measurements weren’t precise enough to know for sure. However, the changes under Perry were all outside the margin of error. So sampling error didn’t cause an anomaly with Perry’s statistics. As it turns out, the biggest increase in childrens’ coverage under Perry came from government programs, mostly Medicaid, which is a joint federal-state program. In 2001, 22.5 percent of children received their health care from Medicaid; by 2009, that rose to 37.4 percent. During that same period, the percentage covered by private health insurance fell from 59 percent to 48.5 percent. Both Bush and Perry acted to increase coverage of Texas children by Medicaid and other government programs, though both of them also took actions that worked against or delayed increasing coverage. In 1997, when Bush was governor, the Texas Legislature established the Texas Healthy Kids Corp., a public-private partnership that subsidized coverage for children in families with incomes up to 185 percent of the federal poverty line. That same year, Congress passed the State Children’s Health Insurance Program, which gives federal matching funds for states to help low-income children get health coverage. By 1999, after initially being criticized for slow adoption of SCHIP, Bush and the Legislature sped up Texas’ utilization of the program. "Texas was slow in enacting and implementing SCHIP expansions, in part because the Legislature meets only every other year, and the federal authorizing statute was enacted after adjournment in 1997," wrote Joshua M. Wiener and Niall Brennan in a 2002 paper for the Urban Institute, an independent Washington think tank. "After implementation, however, enrollment in the Texas SCHIP program increased quickly. In June 2000, enrollment was only 39,859 beneficiaries, but by September 2001, it had reached 439,222 children." Bush also signed Medicaid eligibility simplification provisions for children, which helped increase coverage rates. Perry, for his part, first tried to privatize many of the administrative functions of his health and human services department, a decision that led to backlogs and hampered signups for Medicaid, said Anne Dunkelberg, associate director of the Center for Public Policy Priorities. Later, Perry pulled back and instead appointed Tom Suehs to head the department. Under Suehs, Dunkelberg said, the department has "really turned things around," possibly explaining the past few years of insurance coverage gains among children, she said. So both governors did some things that boosted coverage (and some things that didn’t) but their powers were hardly dictatorial. To the extent that Texas has seen gains in coverage among children, significant credit goes to the federally supported programs of Medicaid and SCHIP. And numerous other factors, including the general state of the economy, have an impact on insurance coverage rates. Our ruling Romney’s camp said he meant to refer to the uninsured population as a whole, and using those statistics, he’s right that uninsurance rates declined under Bush (though within the statistics’ margin of error) and rose under Perry. But we think many viewers, seeing the comment in context, might have assumed that Romney was referring to uninsurance among children. And for children, uninsurance has actually declined steeply under Perry. Meanwhile, the policies pursued by both Bush and Perry had an influence on their respective trendlines, but their records in this regard were somewhat mixed and other factors also contributed. On balance, we rate the statement Half True.	None	Mitt Romney	None	None	None	2011-10-13T18:55:37	2011-10-11	['Rick_Perry', 'Texas', 'George_W._Bush']

Corn's initial story said O'Reilly claimed he reported in a "war zone" when he was not. O'Reilly disputed the story and called Corn "an irresponsible guttersnipe." We’ll leave it to you to decide who to believe in that he-said, he-said. But we were struck by something Corn said during an appearance on the Feb. 25, 2015, Rachel Maddow Show. Apparently, Corn once worked for Fox News, and he and O’Reilly were something of pals. Here’s how Corn put it: "I’ve watched Bill O’Reilly over the years. In fact I used to work there from 2001 to 2008, and was often on Bill’s show and often was praised by Bill, not as a liar but as a good reporter. But that was then. This is now." Corn said. That’s an interesting little nugget in this media story that we thought was worth verifying. As it turns out, when Corn was the Washington editor of The Nation, a long standing left-of-center publication, he had a contract with Fox News and played the role of arch liberal against the network’s roster of conservative voices. We went to the Nexis transcript database to see how many times Corn appeared and what O’Reilly said about him. Corn appeared on Fox News at least 60 times. Six of those appearances came on O’Reilly’s The O’Reilly Factor (May 3, 2002; Nov. 18, 2002; Jan. 15, 2003; March 4, 2003; April 7, 2003; and April 20, 2007). Six appearances over five years is hardly often, but what did O’Reilly have to say about Corn? We found one occasion when O’Reilly explicitly praised Corn’s reporting. In November 2002, a few months before the Iraq War, Corn wrote that a small socialist group called the Worker’s World Party had played a key role in organizing a large anti-war demonstration. O’Reilly clearly valued journalism that revealed a tie between the protest march and a group that O’Reilly called "hardcore commies." "All right, Mr. Corn, good reporting," O’Reilly said. "Nobody else reported that. And we appreciate it." That was as effusive as O’Reilly ever got with Corn. The two men always sparred aggressively, transcripts show. A couple of weeks before the start of the Iraq War, Corn argued that the evidence was thin that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction and that the United States was ill prepared for the aftermath of an invasion. O’Reilly said an invasion was worth the risk, but at the end, appreciated Corn for his feistiness. "Mr. Corn, we appreciate your point of view. Thanks for coming in, and standing up," he said. After the war began, Corn appeared again to challenge O’Reilly’s belief that papers like the New York Times slanted their headlines to make the fight look tougher for American forces than it actually was. As the segment clock ran down, O’Reilly threw it back to Corn. "David, because we like you as a guest, give you the last word. You've got 15 seconds. Go," O’Reilly said. On one occasion O’Reilly called Corn "a left-wing, liberal, pinko communist," a remark that Corn took in good humor. Once, O’Reilly accused Corn of intellectual dishonesty. O’Reilly also described Corn and journalist Robert Scheer in 2006 as "bomb throwers" and "very far-left individuals." We spoke to the Mother Jones public affairs director, shared the results of our Nexis search and asked if there were any other details we should know. We did not hear back and will post an update if we do. Our ruling Corn said that before this current brouhaha with O’Reilly, he appeared often on O’Reilly’s show and was often praised by the Fox News host. Corn’s use of the word "often" wouldn’t pass the eye test of most fact-checkers. While Corn was a guest on Fox News programs many times, he had just six appearances with O’Reilly between 2001 and 2008, transcripts show. And as for praise, O’Reilly explicitly did so once. A few other times O’Reilly expressed his satisfaction with Corn as a spokesman for a liberal perspective. But he also described him as bomb thrower and very far-left individual. Corn’s statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We rate the claim Half True.	None	David Corn	None	None	None	2015-02-26T17:45:25	2015-02-25	['None']
pomt-06594	Says Rick Perry wrote a letter "supporting Hillarycare."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2011/sep/24/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-rick-perry-wrote-letter-supporting-h/	Standing next to the other Texan seeking the Republican presidential nomination, U.S. Rep. Ron Paul of Lake Jackson suggested during a Sept. 7, 2011, debate that Gov. Rick Perry had flip-flopped on health care. "You know, the governor of Texas criticized the governor of Massachusetts for Romneycare, but he wrote a really fancy letter supporting Hillarycare," Paul said, referring to two well-known health care overhaul plans that were debated about a dozen years apart. "Romneycare" is a term that critics use to refer to a 2006 Massachusetts health care law signed by then-Gov. Mitt Romney, who is also currently seeking the Republican presidential nomination. Many Republicans have criticized the law as a government intrusion into the health care system, including through its mandate that residents obtain health coverage. As PolitiFact has noted in previous fact-checks, the Massachusetts law is similar to the act that President Barack Obama signed into law in 2010. For this article, we’re reviewing only whether Perry wrote in support of what critics call "Hillarycare." We’re not judging that label. Days after entering office in January 1993, President Bill Clinton created a task force to write health care overhaul legislation to bring costs under control and extend coverage to the nation’s uninsured. He selected his wife, Hillary, to lead it. In September 1993, President Clinton outlined his plan in a speech to Congress, and two months later, legislation was formally introduced by Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine. According to a 1994 analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation, Clinton’s proposal for universal coverage built on an employer-based health insurance system, requiring individuals to have coverage and employers to provide coverage for their workers and contribute to their premiums. The plan also would have created "health-purchasing alliances" in which private insurers and providers would compete for business from people and businesses. A September 1993 New York Times news article reported that Americans "would be guaranteed a generous basic package of coverage, negotiated separately in each state by alliances of consumers with insurance companies and medical groups." During the Sept. 7 debate, Perry did not dispute that he had written a letter to the first lady in 1993 when he was the Texas agriculture commissioner. "We were hoping that she would be able to come up with something that would not leave (out) the agriculture men and women — because I was the agriculture commissioner at that particular point in time," Perry said. "We had no idea it was going to be the monstrosity that's known as Hillarycare." Perry’s letter — dated April 6, 1993, and posted online Aug. 30, 2011, by the conservative website Daily Caller — was sent on Texas Department of Agriculture stationery. It opens with Perry saying that he thinks Clinton's "efforts in trying to reform the nation's health care system are most commendable." He continues: "I would like to request that the task force give particular consideration to the needs of the nation's farmers, ranchers, agriculture workers, and other members of rural communities. Rural populations have a high proportion of uninsured people, rising health care costs, and often experience lack of services." Perry then details some of the health care delivery problems in rural areas of Texas, including hospital closures and shortages of providers "within a safe driving distance." The letter continues: "I have made economic development for rural Texans a high priority in my Administration. Leadership, education, infrastructure systems, and health care facilities can do much towards aiding a rural community to prosper." In closing, the letter revisits its opening, stating that Perry thinks Clinton's efforts are "worthy" and asking that she "remember this constituency as the task force progresses." The letter was last brandished against Perry in 2005 when U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison was considering challenging him in the 2006 Republican gubernatorial primary. In a March 2005 news article, though, the Houston Chronicle described Perry’s letter as falling "far short of actually being an endorsement" of the Clinton health care plan. However, the story said, the letter was penned at a time when some commentators were already describing Clinton's idea for a "government-sponsored HMOs and health care cooperatives as 'socialism.' " The Chronicle article quotes Perry's 2006 campaign manager, Luis Saenz, as saying that when the letter was written, "I don't know that anybody knew what the final efforts were going to be." In an Aug. 30, 2011, radio interview with Sean Hannity, who also has a Fox News Channel program, Perry said he wrote the letter because he didn't want the Clinton administration "to overlook a very important constituency." Perry said he had no idea that the "end product" would be "this monstrosity of a bill." Fair enough? Not so fast, said Gary Howard, a spokesman for the Paul campaign, who told us in an email that key aspects of the Clinton health care plan were already known before Perry signed the letter to the first lady. He pointed to a news article published in the Los Angeles Times the day before the date of Perry's letter. The April 5, 1993, article says that although many key details of the reform plan remained unsettled, "the broad outlines" were emerging. The story included specifics, including that the plan would likely create new "government-certified regional health insurance purchasing cooperatives" and impose a requirement that employers provide insurance to their workers. We checked to see what Austin American-Statesman readers were learning about the work of the health care task force around the same time. In the second half of March and first week of April 1993, the newspaper published at least 10 news and opinion articles related to the task force or its work, including reports on possible reform ideas and reactions to them. On April 3, 1993, the Statesman published a Los Angeles Times story on its front page noting that the Clinton plan was expected to lead to universal health coverage and a guaranteed set of health benefits for all Americans. The article quoted Ira Magaziner, a leader of the Clinton task force, as saying that care would be delivered under a "managed competition system," with residents of a geographic area choosing among several health plans that meet government standards. The story also says the Clinton proposal would require businesses to provide health coverage for their employees. Workers could either choose their company's plan or select one offered by "local buying organizations," which the employer would pay for, according to the article. The next day, the Statesman published another Times article; it details three mechanisms that the task force was reportedly considering to impose price controls on health care services. Our ruling It's correct that Perry sent a letter to Hillary Clinton commending her efforts as the head of the president’s health care task force at a time when the president’s general goals and some possible specifics of the plan had been reported. Yet Perry's letter, dispatched more than five months before the plan was finalized, is clearly a request that the task force consider the interests of rural Americans. We rate the statement as Mostly False.	None	Ron Paul	None	None	None	2011-09-24T14:05:48	2011-09-07	['Rick_Perry']
pomt-03817	"Under Gov. Kasich, Ohio wages have increased by $10.3 billion."	true	/ohio/statements/2013/mar/21/john-kasich/gov-john-kasich-says-ohio-wages-are-more-10-billio/	With budget battles looming for Gov. John Kasich's plans on taxing and spending, Ohio's improving economy remains a bright spot for him. Kasich promised during the 2010 gubernatorial race that his pro-business agenda would bring jobs to Ohio, and he has touted his record on job creation since his first year in office. On March 15, he tweeted about it with another angle: "The most recent data shows OH wages have jumped by $10.3 billion. Ohioans are creating jobs and driving our comeback." It linked to a picture with the overlay "Under Gov. Kasich, Ohio wages have increased by $10.3 billion." PolitiFact Ohio wanted more detail and wondered about the source of the wage figure. Kasich's office pointed to data assembled by the Bureau of Labor Market Information of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services. Specifically citing the figures for total wages of workers employed in Ohio, they compared the combined wages for the third and fourth quarters of 2010 and the first and second quarters of 2011 against the period starting six months after Kasich took office -- the third and fourth quarters of 2011 and the first and second quarters of 2012. The first four quarters total $204.2 billion (averaging $51 billion per quarter). The second four quarters total $214.5 billion (averaging $53.6 billion). The difference: $10.3 billion. We looked further, hoping to make the numbers more meaningful to individuals, and found that per capita income in Ohio increased 4.5 percent in 2011, the most recent figures available, according to the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis. PolitiFact has always stipulated that the ability of an individual governor -- or president or any other elected official -- to influence the economy is limited. Determining how credit or blame should be apportioned is seldom clear. Kasich took office at a time when Ohio's employment picture already had begun to improve. The wage growth for the time period under the Republican governor could as easily be classified as having happened under President Barack Obama, a Democrat (as Mitt Romney found last fall). In his tweet, Kasich did not try to apportion responsibility or take personal credit for wage growth in Ohio. In fact, he credited Ohioans with "creating jobs and driving our comeback." The link to the photo with the words "Under Gov. Kasich. . .," however, seemed clearly designed to attribute the wage growth to Kasich. Still, we have previously found that Kasich can certainly lay claim to having kept some jobs here and attracted new ones. The numbers back up his statement. We rate it as True.

pomt-10743	"Our tax code is so complicated it extracts $140 billion in extra tax preparation costs every year - one thousand dollars for every American family."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/nov/05/john-mccain/the-high-cost-of-paying-taxes/	Sen. John McCain wants to overhaul our complex tax code and turn it into something simpler. In making the case against current tax laws, he pulled together an array of statistics. In a speech in September 2007, McCain got specific: "Our tax code is so complicated it extracts $140 billion in extra tax preparation costs every year - one thousand dollars for every American family. It's offensive that six out of every ten taxpayers have to pay someone else just to figure out how to pay the government." According to McCain's campaign, the senator got his stats from a 2005 report from the President's Advisory Panel on Tax Reform. Some of the numbers are right. It's true that six out of 10 individual tax filers pay someone to prepare their returns, according to the IRS. But when McCain says the total cost of tax preparation is $140 billion, he's got nothing to back him up. The Advisory Panel on Tax Reform that he cites has no background citations and the only place we can find that $140 billion figure is a Tax Foundation study from 2001 that referred the cost of tax preparation for individuals and businesses. A 2005 study by the Tax Foundation puts the value at closer to $111-billion. That would put the per-family cost at about $822. But this is worth noting: The dollar figure for spending on tax preparation is a calculation of the value of the time people spend working on their taxes, which the Tax Foundation put at about $39 an hour, not how much they pay to tax pros. That's not clear in McCain's statement. McCain has suggested fixing the tax code by getting a task force headed by former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan to come up with a plan for simplifying the code and putting it to Congress for an up or down vote. McCain's point is on target; tax preparation is costly because the tax code is so complicated. But McCain is off by a good bit on the figure he uses and he's not being clear that the cost he's talking about isn't an expense of dollars but of time. That leads us to a Half True.

pomt-05201	Says Jeff Wentworth, bending the rules, "has used $211,743.96 in campaign contributions to lease luxury cars."	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/jun/11/connservative-republicans-texas-pac/political-group-says-jeff-wentworth-bending-rules-/	San Antonio state Sen. Jeff Wentworth, headed to a July 2012 runoff with Republican challenger Donna Campbell, drew fire from a political group before leading the May primary, including a claim about the cars he drives. On its anti-Wentworth website, www.wentworthrecord.com, the Conservative Republicans of Texas PAC says: "Wentworth has used $211,743.96 in campaign contributions to lease luxury cars including the Lexus he currently drives." The claim appears under the heading "Bending the Rules." Curiosity steered us to take a closer look. A word: It’s legal for state legislators to lease vehicles with campaign funds so long as the vehicles are not for personal benefit. Put another way, Texas law permits campaign contributions to be used to pay expenses incurred while holding an elected office as well as those incurred while campaigning. Conversely, state law bars candidates or officeholders from converting campaign funds to "personal use," which the law defines as a "use that primarily furthers individual or family purposes not connected with the performance of duties or activities as a candidate." Austin lawyer Fred Lewis, who wrote a 2004 report detailing expenditures by Texas lawmakers on vehicles and other expenses, told us by phone that the leasing of cars is a "very common practice. There is nothing unusual about it in the least." And the fact that Wentworth leases cars qualifies as old news. According to a July 30, 2007, Houston Chronicle news article, Wentworth spent $20,308 from January through June 2007 to lease a Lexus. The newspaper quoted Wentworth as saying the campaign Lexus is in keeping with the kind of cars he drives in his personal life. He said it is necessary for driving the dangerous stretch of Interstate 35 between San Antonio and Austin. "It's a matter of safety," Wentworth told the newspaper. Three years earlier, Chronicle columnist Rick Casey noted that Houston Democratic Sen. Rodney Ellis was paying $630 a month to lease a campaign vehicle and Sen. John Whitmire, D-Houston, had plunked down $29,211 in campaign contributions for a "campaign vehicle." Casey said Wentworth and then-Sen. Kip Averitt, R-Waco, had leased top-of-the-line Infiniti sedans. We asked the PAC for the basis of its claim, especially the part about bending the rules. Spokesman Allen Blakemore emailed us a spreadsheet listing car lease expenditures from 2000 to 2012 that he told us by phone were drawn from Wentworth’s campaign finance reports. We compared the research to Wentworth’s campaign finance filings, finding minor discrepancies with the research while otherwise confirming the PAC’s proclaimed cost of the leases, $212,446.20, over the dozen years. We asked to interview Wentworth and heard from his campaign consultant, Bryan Eppstein, who declined to address the specific claim. Broadly, Eppstein said, Wentworth’s auto expenses are not unusual for a legislator whose district runs from part of Bexar County through four counties into a chunk of Travis County. Wentworth "travels across his district every day," and during this campaign he’s driven to 40 debates in six counties, Eppstein said. In a follow-up interview, Blakemore asserted that Wentworth drives no other vehicles, so he must have used leased cars for personal purposes. Also, Blakemore said, Wentworth’s reported campaign contributions and expenditures fail to show the senator regularly reimbursing his campaign for times he used the leased vehicles for personal purposes. Eppstein later said that Wentworth has three personal cars, also saying by phone that Wentworth has driven leased vehicles only for campaign or officeholder purposes. Earlier, Eppstein provided a confidential June 9, 2009, order from the Texas Ethics Commission dismissing a complaint referring in part to Wentworth spending $54,740 in campaign funds on auto leases. The order quotes Wentworth swearing that he used those vehicles for office-related purposes. "I have other vehicles for personal use, and personally pay the cost of operating the leased vehicles when they are used for personal purposes." Eppstein told us Wentworth’s statement that he paid for personal uses of leased vehicles was hypothetical. The commission’s order notes that Wentworth swore that he used the leased vehicles only for official duties and used personal vehicles for personal purposes. "There is no evidence to contradict" those sworn statements, the order says, thus insufficient evidence that Wentworth violated the law. Our ruling Wentworth spent some $212,000 in campaign funds leasing vehicles, as the PAC says. Then again, such leases are allowed if the vehicles are used for officeholder or campaign purposes, which is how Wentworth's camp says he uses the leased vehicles. All told, this claim portrays spending on a permitted activity as "bending the rules" without evidence of wrongdoing. We rate the statement as Mostly False.

pomt-05016	"If you make more than $250,000 a year … you only really take home about $125,000."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jul/16/steve-doocy/steve-doocy-says-someone-earning-250000-pays-half-/	Steve Doocy, one of the co-hosts of Fox & Friends, last week took aim at President Barack Obama’s longstanding proposal to let the George W. Bush-era tax cuts expire for taxpayers making $250,000 and up. "If you make more than $250,000 a year, (President Obama wants to) jack up your taxes about 5 percent," Doocy said on the July 11 edition of the show. "But when you think about it, at $250,000 you only really take home about $125,000, which in some parts of the country, if you've got a couple of kids in college, is not much money." A reader asked us to check whether Doocy was right that a typical taxpayer earning $250,000 a year would be left with only $125,000 in take-home pay. (Fox’s media office did not return an inquiry for this story.) The main taxes we’ll consider here are federal income taxes, federal payroll taxes and state income taxes. • Federal income taxes: A table produced by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center offers data on the "effective tax rate" -- that is, how much a filer paid in income tax divided by their income -- for various income ranges. More than a third of those earning $200,000 and up had an effective tax rate between 15 percent and 20 percent. Just under one-third had an effective rate between 20 and 25 percent. So, if you’re earning $250,000, this means you’re pretty typical if you’re paying between $37,500 and $62,500 in federal income taxes. • Federal payroll taxes: An employee will pay Social Security taxes (6.2 percent on the first $110,100 of salary) and Medicare taxes (1.45 percent of all of their salary). Someone who’s self employed will pay twice that, to cover the employer’s share. So the payroll tax can add an additional $8,000 to $17,000 to the tax bill. • State income taxes: State income taxes vary widely; in fact, some states have no income tax at all. A 5 percent state income tax, which is somewhere in the middle of the pack, could add an additional $10,000 to $12,500, or perhaps less, depending on how many deductions are being taken. Adding these three tax categories together and subtracting them from $250,000 gives us a range of take-home pay from $158,000 to $194,500. Either figure is well above the $125,000 in take-home pay that Doocy claims. Is it possible to get the taxes so high they can cut take home pay for $250,000 to just half? Let’s construct an extreme example to see if it gets us there. Using the IRS’ tax calculator, we plugged in information for an individual who earned a $250,000 salary, without any other non-salary income such as capital gains. Although this would shock our hypothetical taxpayer’s hypothetical CPA, we assumed the taxpayer refused to use even the most basic deductions beyond the standard deduction. No home-mortgage deduction, charitable donations, child credit or IRAs. And no offshore tax shelters. According to the IRS calculator, this unlucky taxpayer would owe the IRS $63,811 in federal income taxes. Add in payroll taxes ($8,817 to $17,634) and income taxes for the state with the highest rate, Hawaii (roughly $25,000) and it brings you to, at worst, take-home pay of $143,555. So, even in this extreme and highly improbable example, the taxpayer takes home more money than the $125,000 Doocy claimed. We checked our math with Steve Street, an accountant with the firm Ross & Moncure in Alexandria, Va. He ran a hypothetical tax return for a single New Yorker earning $250,000, first as an employee and then as a self-employed businessperson, with no deductions beyond the standard deduction. The employee takes home $153,629, while the self-employed businessperson takes home $148,408. One might be tempted to throw other taxes into the equation. However, tax experts do not typically include property taxes or sales taxes in such comparisons because they are so variable and require too many assumptions about behavior, said William McBride of the Tax Foundation. Assuming that someone has a house or property with a large tax bill is "not a normal assumption to make," McBride said. "You could also get there with sales taxes, but again you’d have to make some very particular assumptions about consumption which are not very representative." Even if you take this inadvisable course of adding in property taxes, it’s highly unlikely that they could provide the additional $20,000 in taxation needed to hit Doocy’s benchmark even in this extreme case. For instance, to return to our Hawaii example, the state’s highest median property tax payment for any county is $1,463, in Honolulu County. So to make it to Doocy’s $125,000 level you’d need to be stuck with a property tax bill almost 14 times the county’s median. Bottom line? "Doocy is stretching it," McBride said. Our ruling Doocy said someone who earns $250,000 a year ends up with take-home pay of just $125,000. But typical taxpayers end up with comfortably more than that. We found someone with that salary would take home $158,000 to $194,500 -- and even more if they lived in a state without income tax. Even our most extreme example produced quite a bit more take-home pay than he suggested. We rate Doocy’s statement False.	None	Steve Doocy	None	None	None	2012-07-16T14:41:10	2012-07-11	['None']

Name calling has a long, if not honorable, history in public life, and opinions are protected speech under the Constitution. But all names are not equal -- nor are they even matters of opinion. A number of websites and blogs recently have been busy claiming there are 70 card-carrying Socialists in the U.S. House of Representatives, including three Democrats from Ohio: Reps. Marcia Fudge, Marcy Kaptur and Dennis Kucinich. (The number actually varies. Some posts say 70, others insist it’s either 73 or 76 and some go as high as 83. One post used both 76 and 75 in the same entry.) While most of the names politicians are called are opinions, calling a congressman a Socialist sounds both emphatic and exact, which always gets our attention at PolitiFact Ohio. Another thing that gets our attention is when a claim gets spread far and wide. This one meets that test, too. Our colleagues at PolitiFact Oregon scrutinized the claim because it also named two members of that state's congressional delegation. We're following their work here. An Aug. 12 post on the website for a group called Sovereign Citizens United mentions Fudge, Kaptur and Kucinich by name. It also says this: "I’m sure if you asked random people on the street if we had open socialists in the U.S. Congress, they would say – well only Bernie Sanders (Senate). But the right answer is much, much worse." "This should come as a surprise to absolutely no one," says an Aug. 16 post on ConservativeByte.com. "The radical Marxist-progressives (communists) took control of the Democrat party some time ago. They’ve only become more emboldened with the election of Barack Obama, who was raised as a communist from birth." In case you miss the point, the post comes equipped with a large and very bright hammer and sickle emblem. Here’s a blog post on Aug. 17 by Texas radio host Dan Cofall, whose show airs out of Fort Worth: "The magic number ‘70’ is the number of members of the 111th Congress who are members of the Democratic Socialists of America. These are not just politicians who vote left of center; these are card-carrying members of ‘the Democratic Socialists of America’." Cofall did not respond to an email asking for comment. And PolitiFact couldn’t reach anyone from ConservativeByte. Before our ruling, let’s begin with some basics. Congress resets itself every two years, which means the current edition is the 112th Congress, not the 111th. Why does that matter? Because the new Congress that begins in January every two years always follows an election and some of the people on the list are no longer in office. Cofall acknowledges this but then continues to list names from the 111th Congress anyway. Those listed as "card carrying" socialists who are no longer serving include Robert Wexler (Florida), Phil Hare (Illinois), John Hall (New York), Alan Grayson (Florida), and Neil Abercrombie (Hawaii). Then there’s this: Real card-carrying Socialists say those members are not Socialists. The list that Cofall and dozens more rely upon "is completely fraudulent," said Frank Llewellyn, who served as national director of the Democratic Socialists of America for 10 years until stepping down July 5. There is not one member of Congress who is a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. In order to join, a person must fill out a form and pay dues. Even Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a self-described democratic socialist, is not a formal member of the DSA, Llewellyn said. The last member of Congress who was an actual card-carrying member, he said, was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998. Llewellyn and DSA’s new national director, Maria Svart are chagrined for two reasons. First, they have to spend time knocking down reports that never seem to go away. Second, Llewellyn said, "if we had formal political relationships with 70-odd members, we would be making a lot more money’’ from dues. For the record, Fudge, Kaptur and Kucinich say they’ve never been associated with the Democratic Socialists of America. Fudge's spokeswoman, Belinda Prinz, said the same claim came up last year, when the congresswoman's office contacted one website and asked that her name be removed from its list. "We're sorry to see this erroneous information get repeated," Prinz said. "She has never been a member of the Democratic Socialists of America and never endorsed their activities or policies." Kaptur denied the accusation and said, "As a Polish-American, I know very well the difference between totalitarian communism and fascism on the one hand and social-democratic governments in Europe that include our NATO allies." Her spokesman, Steve Fought, said the claim "is part of this unfortunate trend in our country where if you don't agree with someone politically, you vilify and villainize them. "A lot of people who throw the word socialism around don't even know what it is and couldn't distinguish the different varieties," he said. "It's a facile way for people who don't understand shades of gray to talk about political movements." Kucinich said: "I'm a Democrat." Bad information gets spread all the time. But where did the number, or numbers, come from? The list purported to have originated with the DSA says this on page two: Q: How many members of the U.S. Congress are also members of the DSA? A: Seventy It then lists them by name. What it does not say is that the names are simply lifted en masse from the membership of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a collection of liberal-leaning lawmakers that includes not a single socialist. According to its website, the Progressive Caucus is one of the largest in Congress and works for such causes as economic justice, civil rights and civil liberties as well as global peace and security. Llewellyn said that DSA supports some of the policy positions of the caucus. Voicing support for positions embraced by a group of lawmakers is a routine part of business on Capitol Hill and is employed by organizations as disparate as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Rifle Association and NORML, a group devoted to legalizing the use of marijuana. But agreeing with some positions doesn’t make a member of Congress a card-carrying Socialist. Llewellyn says similar accusations of Socialism (with a capital S) have surfaced every election year since 1991 when the Progressive Caucus was created. "There’s nothing we can do to stop it, Llewellyn said. "I can’t tell you the number of times we’ve tried to stop it." Misinformation and smear campaigns also are part of political life. But these persistent claims about socialists are riddled with errors and outright lies. Any one of the problems would be sufficient to discredit the report, but taken together, the effort is flagrantly false. For that reason, we rate this claim: Pants on Fire.

pomt-06949	Says a new report proves the stimulus supported by N.J. Democrats cost $278,000 per job.	false	/new-jersey/statements/2011/jul/19/national-republican-congressional-committee/NRCC-stimulus-278k-per-job/	Republicans in Congress were not functioning independently of one another on their first workday after the Independence Day holiday. Shortly after noon on July 5, House Speaker John Boehner "tweeted" a July 3 blog posting from the conservative Weekly Standard’s website, labeling it "POTUS’ economists: ‘Stimulus’ Has Cost $278,000 per job." Around 4 p.m., the National Republican Congressional Committee followed suit with multiple press releases that used the same Weekly Standard blog item to target dozens of Democrats in Congress, including New Jersey’s Rush Holt and Frank Pallone. Its headline: "New Report Shows Dems’ Failed Stimulus Cost $278,000 Per Job As Economy Got Worse." It went on to claim that Holt’s and Pallone's "government spending spree" "delivered little except skyrocketing debt owed to foreign countries like China." By 4:55 p.m., the National Republican Senatorial Committee had recycled the Weekly Standard blog posting to attack Ohio Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown. This time the claim was: "President Obama’s own top economists estimate that the Obama-Brown stimulus debacle cost taxpayers an average $278,000 per job." Our sister website, PolitiFact Ohio, thought the concerted GOP effort made it worthy of a look. Since Boehner kicked it off on Twitter, they used his tweet. The Weekly Standard blog item that spawned the statistic cites a July 1 report by the White House Council of Economic Advisers, which states the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act "saved or created between 2.4 and 3.6 million jobs as of the first quarter of 2011." It also tallies the sum of the stimulus bill’s outlays and tax cuts at $666 billion. The $278,000 per job figure doesn’t appear anywhere in the White House report. To come up with that number, the publication divided the $666 billion stimulus total by the low-end 2.4 million job estimate to come up with a dollars per job statistic that it rounded off to $278,000. The blog item contends this statistic "provides further evidence that President Obama’s ‘stimulus’ did very little, if anything, to stimulate the economy and a whole lot to stimulate the debt," and insists "the government could simply have cut a $100,000 check to everyone whose employment was allegedly made possible by the ‘stimulus’ and taxpayers would have come out $427 billion ahead." After Republicans began to circulate the blog item, White House spokeswoman Jay Carney said its conclusions were "based on partial information and simply false analysis." White House spokeswoman Liz Oxhorn issued a statement that noted the Recovery Act bolstered infrastructure, education, and industries "that are critical to America’s long-term success and an investment in the economic future of America’s working families." The White House points out that Recovery Act dollars didn’t just fund salaries - as the blog item implies - it also funded numerous capital improvements and infrastructure projects. Lumping all costs together and classifying it as salaries produces an inflated figure. Furthermore, the publication created its statistic with the report’s low end jobs estimate. Had it instead gone with the 3.6 million job figure at the top end of the range, it would have come up with a smaller $185,000 per job figure. Republicans made a similar assertion in November 2009, using similar calculations to contend that the stimulus cost taxpayers more than $246,000 per job. Back then, they divided $160 billion in stimulus spending by 650,000 jobs that the White House estimated the measure had created or preserved. A "fact check" conducted at the time by the Associated Press called that math "satisfyingly simple but highly misleading." "Any cost-per-job figure pays not just for the worker, but for the material, supplies and that workers’ output - a portion of a road paved, patients treated in a health clinic, goods shipped from a factory floor, railroad tracks laid," the 2009 Associated Press item noted. The Weekly Standard claimed that the stimulus actually "has been working in reverse the last six months, causing the economy to shed jobs." It derives this conclusion from the fact that as of two quarters ago, the stimulus had added or saved just under 2.7 million jobs - or 288,000 more than it has now. Moody’s chief economist Mark Zandi says the Weekly Standard misinterpreted that data. "It’s not that ARRA [the stimulus] is now costing the economy jobs, it is that the economy is now creating jobs without ARRA’s help," Zandi told TPMDC. "This is exactly the objective of fiscal stimulus, namely to end recession and jump-start economic recovery." The day after the White House responded to the GOP’s dissemination of the Weekly Standard blog item, its author penned a defense that reiterates his claims. He says he never said that $278,000 per job went to salaries, but "rather that each job has cost taxpayers $278,000." Yet, his original item did say taxpayers would have come out $427 billion ahead if the government had simply "cut a $100,000 check to everyone whose employment was allegedly made possible by the ‘stimulus?’" So where does that leave Boehner’s tweet -- and the identical claim from the NRCC -- that a report said the stimulus had cost $278,000 per job? The figure attributed to the president’s economists does not appear anywhere in the White House report. Rather, the Weekly Standard attributed the number to economists at the White House after it made its own calculations and conclusions. The methodology used to get that number was previously termed suspect because it lumps all costs associated with stimulus projects together as if they are wages, suggesting it would have been cheaper to just "cut a $100,000 check" to each person who found work as a result of the stimulus. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate the tweet (and the subsequent variations of the claim) as False. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com. Editor's note: This item was originally published on the Boehner statement. We have specifically republished it on the National Republican Congressional Committee statement.

pomt-10170	Henry Kissinger "said that we should meet with Iran — guess what — without precondition."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/sep/27/barack-obama/kissinger-and-obama-arent-really-on-the-same-page/	From the start of his campaign, Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama has said that as president he would personally negotiate with the leaders of rogue states who have long been denied face-to-face meetings with U.S. presidents, such as Iran. Sen. John McCain raised the issue during the first presidential debate, arguing that Obama's willingness to meet with dictators — without conditions — would provide enemies of the United States, like Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, with a platform to spread propaganda. Ahmadinejad, McCain pointed out, has called for the destruction of Israel and denied that the Holocaust ever happened. McCain's point, notably, is one on which he agrees with New York Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton, who differed with Obama on the same issue during the Democratic primaries. To parry McCain's criticism at the debate, Obama said that McCain's own foreign policy adviser, former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, who served under President Richard Nixon, has called for high-level negotiations with Iran, without condition. And Obama's statement suggests that Kissinger was supporting presidential-level negotiations. Here's what Obama said: "So let's talk about this. First of all, Ahmadinejad is not the most powerful person in Iran. So he may not be the right person to talk to. But I reserve the right, as president of the United States to meet with anybody at a time and place of my choosing if I think it's going to keep America safe. "And I'm glad that Senator McCain brought up the history, the bipartisan history of us engaging in direct diplomacy. "Senator McCain mentioned Henry Kissinger, who's one of his advisers, who, along with five recent secretaries of state, just said that we should meet with Iran — guess what — without precondition. This is one of your own advisers." McCain opposes direct, president-to-president meetings with Ahmadinejad; Obama favors them. Kissinger may differ with McCain on when negotiations should begin – the Sept. 20, 2008, remarks Kissinger made on CNN, which Obama was referencing, aren't entirely clear – but he did not endorse a meeting between the presidents of Iran and the United States. Here's what Kissinger said during the CNN forum with other secretaries of state at George Washington University: "Well, I am in favor of negotiating with Iran. And one utility of negotiation is to put before Iran our vision of a Middle East, of a stable Middle East, and our notion on nuclear proliferation at a high enough level so that they have to study it. And, therefore, I actually have preferred doing it at the secretary of state level so that we — we know we're dealing with authentic," Kissinger said. "At a very high level right out of the box?" asked moderator Frank Sesno. "Initially, yes," Kissinger said. "And I always believed that the best way to begin a negotiation is to tell the other side exactly what you have in mind and what you are — what the outcome is that you're trying to achieve so that they have something that they can react to. Now, the permanent members of the Security Council, plus Japan and Germany, have all said nuclear weapons in Iran are unacceptable. They've never explained what they mean by this. So if we go into a negotiation, we ought to have a clear understanding of what is it we're trying to prevent. What is it going to do if we can't achieve what we're talking about?" Kissinger then added, "But I do not believe that we can make conditions for the opening of negotiations. We ought, however, to be very clear about the content of negotiations and work it out with other countries and with our own government." That would seem to differ from McCain's position. McCain has made clear he would hold "no unconditional summits." After the debate, the McCain campaign was quick to say that Obama had incorrectly described Kissinger's remarks, issuing a statement from Kissinger that said, "I would not recommend the next president of the United States engage in talks with Iran at the presidential level.” Obama is right that Kissinger supports meetings without preconditions, but he neglects to mention that Kissinger specified they would be "at the secretary of state level." And Obama's comments imply that he was referring to meetings at the presidential level. So we find Obama's statement to be Half True.

pomt-05083	The Medicaid expansion is "going to cost Florida $1.9 billion a year."	false	/florida/statements/2012/jul/02/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-medicaid-expansion-will-cost-state/	Gov. Rick Scott announced June 29, 2012, that Florida will not expand its Medicaid program, saying that provision of the federal health care law would cost the state an additional $1.9 billion a year. "It’s going to cost Florida $1.9 billion a year," Scott said July 2, 2012, while co-hosting CNBC’s Squawk Box. Scott repeated the $1.9 billion claim on Fox News June 29 and July 2, on CNN July 1 and in a July 1 official statement. Don’t believe it. Scott’s Medicaid figure is an oversimplified estimate that relies on several assumptions and ignores how the Medicaid expansion would actually be implemented. Even if you believe the assumptions and ignore how the law would be implemented, Scott is still quoting the wrong number, according to an estimate created by his own Agency for Health Care Administration. By now, you’ve probably read about the proposed Medicaid expansion, which was part of the 2010 federal health care law. But you’ve also likely missed some critical details in the few paragraphs of background you’ve seen. Medicaid is a joint state-federal, government-run health care program for the very poor. (Its cousin, Medicare, is for senior citizens of any income level.) Medicaid is an entirely voluntary program for the states -- but every state participates -- in part because of the good financial terms. The federal government covers about 55 percent of all Medicaid costs in Florida and covered about 68 percent in recent years with additional stimulus funding. The health care law required states to expand eligibility to Medicaid by raising income eligibility limits to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. States currently have widely varying thresholds depending on a person’s age and situation, and Florida has some of the strictest thresholds in the country. For instance, childless adults cannot receive Medicaid in Florida, and parents who have children must make less than 22 percent of the federal poverty level to receive Medicaid. (That means a single parent of one would have to make less than about $3,500 a year to qualify for Medicaid in Florida.) The federal government agreed to fund 100 percent of the cost for states to expand Medicaid for three budget years. The federal government would cover 95 percent of the costs in 2017, 94 percent of the costs in 2018, 93 percent of the costs in 2019 and 90 percent of the costs in 2020 and beyond. The expansion, too, was technically voluntary, but the federal government said it would penalize any state (by withholding Medicaid funds) that failed to comply. That penalty was declared unconstitutional by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 28, 2012. The court’s ruling allows states like Florida to decline expansion without losing any current funding. That brings us back to Scott. His own Agency for Health Care Administration attempted to quantify the financial impact to the state because of the changes to Medicaid (which is quite different than the expansion of Medicaid Scott is talking about). We received a Microsoft PowerPoint presentation of the agency’s findings, dated Jan. 4, 2012. The state first assumed that there are people who currently qualify for Medicaid, pre-expansion, but have not enrolled for one reason or another. They would come forward, however, in the new system. The cost to Florida: $516 million a year. The state also figured that there are people currently privately purchasing insurance who would abandon their private plans because they would be eligible for Medicaid as part of the expansion. That would cost Florida another $90 million a year. And of course the state estimated the number of people who would be eligible for the Medicaid expansion and would apply. The cost: $500 million. Most of these costs, mind you, would not kick in until 2020 -- a fact Scott ignores. That said, the state estimates the Medicaid expansion -- which the state says would provide health insurance for an additional 2 million Floridians -- would cost about $1 billion a year starting in 2020. More than half of that cost, however, would come from people who today are eligible for Medicaid but have not yet enrolled. That cost could come whether or not Florida agrees to participate in the Medicaid expansion. The state health care agency lumps in another $400 million in costs each year for increased rates for Medicaid primary care physicians in its report. But we’re not sure why. The rate increase was part of the federal health care law -- not the Medicaid expansion -- as a way to make reimbursement rates the same for Medicare and Medicaid patients. But the rate increase was only temporary for 2013 and 2014, and was fully funded by the federal government. Florida could decide to continue paying higher reimbursement rates, but it is not required to. So the state’s most generous estimate is that the Medicaid changes as part of the federal health care law will cost the state about $1.47 billion a year starting in 2020. But really, the expansion to Medicaid -- the part Scott is fighting -- would cost the state about a little more than $500 million once it’s fully implemented in 2020, according to the state. (We should note that a Tallahassee group called the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy has criticized the state estimates, saying its figures are "hyper-inflated." We're not taking a side on the estimates as a whole as it pertains to this fact-check.) The nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation put the additional cost to the state between $1.2 billion and $2.5 billion between 2014 and 2019, which is roughly between $200 million and $400 million a year. That would help insure between 950,000 and 1.3 million Floridians. (Kaiser did not calculate a cost to the state in 2020, when Florida would pay for 10 percent of the expansion.) Our ruling In triumphantly declaring that Florida will reject a provision of the federal health care law that expands Medicaid coverage, Gov. Rick Scott told national television audiences that the expansion would cost Florida $1.9 billion a year. The most recent estimate from the state health care agency says a series of changes to Medicaid could wind up costing about $1.4 billion a year, but that number includes things beyond the expansion to Medicaid that Scott was talking about. For instance, about $400 million is tied to increased reimbursement payments to Medicaid providers. But the state isn't required to pay that out. And another estimated $516 million will pay for people who are eligible for Medicaid under its current provisions but have not enrolled. They would remain eligible whether or not the program is expanded in Florida. That leaves about $500 million in estimated new costs for Medicaid patients under the federal government expansion. And that cost would not fully kick in until 2020. So yes, the Medicaid expansion will cost the state. But Scott’s $1.9 billion claim appears to be wildly high. We rate this claim False.

pomt-10561	"8 years of the Clintons, major losses for Democrats across the nation."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2008/feb/11/barack-obama/cumulatively-major-losses/	Raising the prospect that a Hillary Clinton presidency will weaken the Democratic party nationally, a mailer sent on behalf of Barack Obama in the days before Super Tuesday spells out how many governorships and congressional seats the party lost during the eight years of Bill Clinton's presidency. "8 years of the Clintons, major losses for Democrats across the nation," the mailer read, comparing the number of Democratic governors, U.S. senators and representatives after the 1992 and 2000 elections. It shows Democrats lost 12 governorships, seven Senate and 46 House seats over that span. Factually, the mailer's claims are borne out in breakdowns by the Senate, Clerk of the House and Congressional Quarterly, using 1993 and 2001 as the reference years. Many of the Democratic losses came in the 1994 election cycle, when voters dealt a stunning rebuke to Clinton's first-term policies and put Republicans in control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years. But the GOP began to lose congressional seats in the 1996 and 1998 elections, while Clinton still was in office. And just months after he departed, the Senate shifted back to Democratic control after Vermont Sen. Jim Jeffords switched his affiliation from Republican to Independent. While it's true that Democrats suffered major losses in 1994, they recouped some of those seats before Clinton left office. We find the claim to be Mostly True.

pomt-07092	"Seventy of Ohio's 88 counties now have more than 25 percent of their residents eligible for emergency food."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/jun/24/dennis-kucinich/rep-dennis-kucinich-says-one-quarter-residents-qua/	A report by the Government Accountability Office on potential duplication of federal programs led the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee to call a hearing on welfare spending. Two Ohio congressmen took lead roles that showed contrasting approaches to the subject. Chairman Jim Jordan, a Republican whose 4th District includes a broad swath of conservative countryside in the central and western Ohio, accurately characterized the GAO report when he said it "concluded that not enough is known about the effectiveness of many of these programs." Jordan has introduced H.R. 1167, the Welfare Reform Act of 2011, which would change eligibility requirements and reduce funding. The committee's ranking member, Rep. Dennis Kucinich, whose heavily Democratic 10th District includes part of Cleveland and several urban suburbs, said the GAO report "did not find waste, fraud and abuse in the administration and delivery of these programs. It does not recommend delivering fewer benefits to those in need." Jordan asked if Kucinich agreed the government should be able to determine if programs are effective and make sure they do not "encourage the wrong kind of behavior." Kucinich replied that the issues can be examined "while we keep feeding people" during a time of continuing need. And he offered statistics to illustrate that need. "Seventy of Ohio's 88 counties now have more than 25 percent of their residents eligible for emergency food," he said. PolitiFact Ohio decided to take check that claim out. Kucinich's office referred us to recent reports from the Ohio Association of Community Action Agencies and the Ohio Association of Second Harvest Foodbanks, using data from the Ohio Department of Development. The starting point for the figure is poverty, defined in the OACAA report as a state of deprivation in which a person or family lacks sufficient resources for a minimally adequate standard of living. The 2009 federal poverty threshold for a family of four with two children was a household income of $21,756. Higher up the scale of economic well-being is the self-sufficiency level, or the income that a household needs to meet its basic needs without public or private assistance. That is generally considered to be about 200 percent of the federal poverty level, and is a ceiling for eligibility for food assistance programs. The Ohio Department of Development data shows that in 70 of the state's 88 counties, at least 25 percent of their citizens live at or below 200 percent of the federal poverty level -- and are therefore eligible for emergency food. The level drops below 20 percent in only three counties -- Medina, Delaware and Warren -- but tops 45 percent in five: Adams, Meigs, Morgan, Pike and Vinton. In rural Morgan County, 51 percent of residents live below the self-sufficiency level. The data shows that Kucinich’s statement is both accurate and not lacking significant details. On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates as True.	None	Dennis Kucinich	None	None	None	2011-06-24T06:00:00	2011-06-01	['Ohio']

pomt-11656	Says a "recent analysis" showed that 91 percent of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients are employed, in school or serving in the military.	mostly true	/texas/statements/2018/jan/10/julian-castro/julian-castro-daca-recipients-employed-school-mili/	Calling out Republicans, Julián Castro of Texas said research shows that nearly every young immigrant at risk of losing federal protection from deportation is employed, in school or serving in the military. According to an October 2017 web post, the former Housing and Urban Development secretary was generally urging the Republican-led Congress to change federal law by offering a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants brought to the U.S. illegally as children or those who overstayed their visas. The post on the conservative blog PJ Media says that in a conference call organized by an advocacy group, Castro specified that a "recent analysis" showed that 91 percent of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients, sometimes called "Dreamers," are employed, in school or serving in the military. Critics, conversely, sometimes characterize the program as an illegal amnesty that harms the working class. Castro, the former San Antonio mayor and 2020 Democratic presidential prospect, directed his call for DACA action at U.S. Rep. Will Hurd, R-San Antonio, as well as John Cornyn of Texas, the Senate majority whip, who, Castro said, "should make sure Congress passes a DREAM Act soon." Castro, who joined the faculty of the University of Texas Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs in 2017, was otherwise quoted in the post criticizing President Donald Trump for declaring the month before that his administration would discontinue DACA, which President Barack Obama launched through a 2012 memo, unless Congress authorized a program by changing federal laws. In a September 2017 tweet, Trump said both that Congress should "legalize DACA" and that in the event of inaction, he’d "revisit this issue." Castro cites online survey results So, was Castro right about DACA recipients nearly all being in school, employed or in the military? Castro, asked the basis of his claim, told Josh Baugh of the San Antonio Express-News by text that he drew his data points from an August 2017 web post by the left-leaning Center for American Progress about a national DACA survey. That survey, we found, asked if DACA recipients had jobs or were in school. It didn’t ask if respondents were in the military. The center’s post summarizing the results said Tom Wong, a political scientist at the University of California, San Diego, led the August 2017 survey of 3,063 DACA recipients. All told, the post says, the survey reached DACA recipients in 46 states including Texas, where 17 percent of respondents said they were living, according to the center’s separate post of the survey’s 22 questions and tallied results. Let’s check on whether the results back up Castro’s claim before turning to the survey methodology and other efforts to gauge how DACA recipients spend their lives. Survey results Asked if they were "currently employed," 91.4 percent answered affirmatively, according to the results, with 55.9 percent of those respondents saying they hadn’t been employed "before DACA." Another question asked if the respondent was currently in school; 44.9 percent responded affirmatively with 55 percent saying not, according to the results. Wong told us by email that an additional sort of the "in school" and "currently employed" responses showed 97 percent of all respondents reporting being employed or enrolled in school — with 71.5 percent of those saying that they were in school reportedly pursuing a bachelor’s degree or higher. Methodology The center said in its post that the results drew on the largest sampling of DACA recipients to date. Some perspective: the 3,000-plus respondents would have amounted to about 4/10ths of 1 percent of some 690,000 active DACA recipients reported at about that time by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Wong conducted the survey in collaboration with the center and advocacy groups United We Dream and the National Immigration Law Center. At the survey’s release, that teaming drew criticism on the right-leaning Breitbart blog, where writer Neil Munro underscored an acknowledgment in the survey’s methodology section that "it is not possible to construct a valid margin of error" for the results because "there is no phone book of undocumented immigrants." Munro counted this as an admission that the data was unreliable. In the same vein, we wondered how Wong’s team confirmed that respondents were signed up for DACA; best we could tell, beneficiaries are not revealed by the government. By phone, Wong reaffirmed the methodology described in the center’s post about the survey including that the partnering entities recruited the recipients surveyed online. Specifically, Wong said, the partners sent a web link to the survey to individuals on their respective email lists, also employing Facebook ads to ensure that self-identified DACA recipients from all over the country could participate. Recognizing that non-DACA recipients could potentially click through the survey, the researchers reported taking steps to eliminate bias and other factors that might skew the results. In the write-up posted by the center, Wong and his co-authors said that to prevent people from submitting multiple responses, they used a survey platform that prevented an IP address from submitting multiple responses. Wong said he used another tactic to stop people from gaming the study: Near the beginning of the survey, each respondent was asked to say at which age she or he came to the U.S. Close to the end, the survey requested the year the respondent came to the U.S. If the age provided toward the survey’s start matched the year offered later, the results stayed in. If off by more than a year, Wong said, he threw out the response. In the end, he said, the responses of 3,063 people were tallied--with approximately 6,000 respondents’ surveys getting set aside for one reason or another. We asked Wong to provide more detail perhaps enabling us to confirm the percentages in the results. Wong told us by email that he hadn’t talked to the study’s outreach partners "about what data can and can’t be released." Wong also said he plans to write a book analyzing the first four years of his survey results, at which point the data he analyzes for the book will be made publicly available. "I know talk isn’t worth much, but I analyzed all of the data myself and stand by the results," Wong wrote. Solid research, expert says We separately asked Ernesto Castañeda, an American University expert on migration research, if he considers the Wong-led results to be valid. Castañeda’s answer: Yes. Wong and his colleagues "carried out a valid study on a hard-to-reach population," Castañeda said by email. "With more than three thousand respondents, this is an exceptionally large sample size." Castañeda further said that researchers cannot always calculate margins of error for "unknown populations" like homeless and undocumented people, adding that the authors "took a number of steps to avoid duplicates or dubious data." Castañeda told us too that the study’s results appeared to be consistent with ethnographic research on DACA recipients and survey and interview research through 2016 by Roberto Gonzales, a Harvard University expert on immigration and social inequality, suggesting that DACA recipients made gains after getting that designation. Wong and Gonzales each found DACA beneficiaries finding educational and career opportunities that had been closed to them before they entered the program. According to Gonzales’ study, posted by the center in June 2017, "DACA beneficiaries told the authors that they were able to match their education and training with work that was meaningful to them—‘an occupation that they could be proud of and that did not carry the stigma of ‘immigrant work.’ " Wong told us a result from his 2017 study stood out to him: 54.2 percent of respondents reported getting a job "that better fits my education and training." In the Breitbart post critical of Wong’s work, Munro wrote that the study was "based on a skewed sample of relatively successful DACA illegals who were identified by advocacy groups." To Munro’s point, 35.5 percent of respondents 25 and older reported having bachelor’s degrees or higher. Seemingly in contrast, Munro noted, an August 2017 Migration Policy Institute study found only 5 percent of the "immediately eligible DACA population" holding a bachelor’s degree or higher. The institute, a think tank that says it believes in the benefits of well-managed immigration, reached its "5 percent" figure by drawing on responses to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2014 American Community Survey. Wong, asked about the possibly too-high education levels suggested by his results, pointed out that the 35.5 percent of survey-indicated DACA recipients with bachelor’s degrees came out only slightly greater than what’s lately shown for naturalized American citizens. According to bureau data from 2016, 35.2 percent of naturalized citizens — those who obtained citizenship after being born as non-citizens — reported having a bachelor’s, graduate or professional degree. DACA recipients’ high education levels make sense, Wong said, because the program requires applicants to be currently in school, have graduated from high school, have obtained a General Education Development (GED) certificate, or be an honorably discharged Coast Guard or military veteran. "We’re actually requiring them to be more educated than the general population," Wong said, adding: "Now that the DACA population is getting older, we’re talking about a pretty sizable number of college-educated individuals who are just beginning to hit their strides in their careers." Castañeda suggested by email that Wong’s survey provided more meaningful results than the MPI study, which was concerned with many more residents including individuals unlikely to seek DACA status. Castañeda wrote: "DACA recipients are by definition positively self-selected since they have to apply to the program, deal with the complex application process and requirements, and pay application fees." Another view We also asked Jessica Vaughan of the conservative-leaning Center for Immigration Studies to evaluate the survey cited by Castro. By phone, Vaughan told us that she would not be surprised that DACA recipients participate in the labor force at high rates because for many, employment was likely "a motivating factor to apply for DACA." Vaughan speculated, though, that the survey overstated the employment and education rates of DACA recipients simply by being administered online and, she suggested, drawing from people with regular online access as well as individuals with the "time and inclination to fill out such a survey." It’s reasonable, she said, to suppose that the same people would be more likely employed and well-educated. Our ruling Castro said a "recent analysis" showed that 91 percent of DACA recipients are employed, in school or serving in the military. Some 97 percent of respondents to an August 2017 online survey reported being employed or in school. However, the researchers asked no questions about military service.

pomt-10817	"Bill Richardson is the only major Democratic candidate with a plan to withdraw all American troops from Iraq. All of the other major Democratic candidates support leaving American troops in Iraq indefinitely."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2007/sep/23/bill-richardson/richardson-wants-all-troops-out/	Bill Richardson claims for himself a place among the top tier candidates (Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and John Edwards) as he seeks to distinguish himself from the field on Iraq, saying he is alone among this group to want to withdraw all the troops. The distinction is real. The others candidate want to leave residual forces in Iraq to be on hand for peacekeeping purposes or in case terrorists mount an offensive. Richardson says a small force will be ineffective, and all troops should come home. But we feel compelled to point out that Richardson's poll numbers have never put him in league with Clinton, Obama or Edwards. A Sept. 16 Gallup Poll showed him with 5 percent support, a good six points shy of Edwards' 11 percent, and well behind Clinton and Obama. That leaves Richardson in the single digits, along with Sen. Joe Biden and Rep. Dennis Kucinich. Of those two rivals, Richardson's position is not significantly different from Kucinich on questions of withdrawal and timetables. Kucinich advocates a prompt withdrawal of U.S. troops to be replaced with international peace keepers. Biden, on the other hand, has proposed an elaborate plan for partitioning Iraq into self-governing regions with U.S. troops helping maintain order. We won't take any points off for Richardson's claim to be among the "major" candidates here, but we will lower his Truth-O-Meter rating because the other candidates have not said they want troops in Iraq indefinitely, as Richardson suggests. Instead, they have said they need the information a commander-in-chief gets to make a final decision on force levels in Iraq. It may be a fine distinction, but it's not the same thing as supporting an indefinite deployment.

pomt-11801	Says the Austin school district "enjoys the highest per-student funding of all large Texas districts" even after forwarding tax revenue to the state.	false	/texas/statements/2017/nov/17/roger-falk/taxpayer-incorrectly-says-austin-school-district-t/	An activist made his case against voters approving a record $1 billion Austin school bond proposition in part by saying the school district tops other big Texas districts in per-student funding. We wondered about that. "Austin ISD has the highest taxable property value per student of all school districts in Texas," Roger Falk of the Travis County Taxpayers Union wrote in a November 2017 commentary published a few days before the bond won voter approval. "It also has the lowest tax rate of all districts in our area." Falk then rebutted the school district’s complaints that it suffers under the state’s school-finance system of recapture, which essentially shifts money from districts with strong property tax bases (like Austin) to property-poor districts. "A major part of its sales pitch is that recapture is killing the district and driving this bond," Falk wrote. "Recapture, as an argument from the district, actually shows its incompetence, as Austin ISD enjoys the highest per-student funding of all large Texas districts after recapture." We’re not fact-checking all that Falk said there. But by email, Falk told us he reached his conclusion about the Austin district having the highest per-student funding among large districts by checking on 2016-17 per-student budgeted spending in a dozen high-enrollment districts starting from a Texas Education Agency website. We confirmed from TEA figures posted for the Austin district that the district budgeted $10,949 per student--an amount reached by dividing $906,180,314 shown in AISD state, local and federal receipts by its 82,766 students. That disregards $406 million in local taxes recaptured by the state. Falk said that from TEA-posted figures, he identified only one high-enrollment district with a greater per-student figure; the 157,787-student Dallas district, per the site, drew $11,377 in receipts per student. Falk told us he found from posted figures that 10 other districts--including Houston, San Antonio, Fort Worth, El Paso and Corpus Christi--drew less in receipts per student. "First or second, my central point remains true: AISD uses recapture to give the impression they have unfair and inadequate funding," Falk said. "Based on their peers, many of whom don't pay recapture, they have superior funding along with a low tax rate." We confirmed that most of the districts Falk reviewed are classified by the state as "major urban" districts, although that classification doesn’t apply to all the districts in his comparison. The exceptions are the Katy, Cypress-Fairbanks, Aldine and Corpus Christi districts. We also learned more precision was possible. Taking into account all funds Next, we asked the state education agency and a couple of school funding experts who advocate for districts at the Capitol to assess Falk’s statement and methodology. By email, TEA spokesperson DeEtta Culbertson said Falk’s per-student figures, based on 2016-17 budgeted data submitted to the state, were accurate to a degree. Culbertson said, for instance, the posted data didn’t reflect final totals of federal funds fielded by each district. She subsequently emailed us a spreadsheet showing that districts ultimately got far more, or less, federal aid than indicated in the reports Falk drew upon. In response to our inquiry, agency experts reviewed audited actual spending data, including federal aid, for the latest available year, 2015-16. By this sort, Culbertson said, Austin fell to eighth among the dozen districts singled out by Falk with $10,805 in per-student spending. Culbertson provided a chart indicating the San Antonio district topped the sampled districts with per-student spending of $12,430. At the low end, the Fort Worth ($10,507); Cypress-Fairbanks ($10,395); Corpus Christi ($10,216) and Arlington ($10,171) districts spent less per student than the Austin district. Also to our inquiry, lobbyist Joe Wisnoski, a former education agency official expert in school finance, similarly said the TEA data cited by Falk was incomplete, leaving unconsidered "a lot of federal funds" spent by districts. Like the education agency, Wisnoski turned to audited district revenues for 2015-16 showing Austin eighth in per-student revenue of all kinds among the districts analyzed by Falk, though his review indicated Austin was sixth if federal aid wasn’t considered. Wisnoski also advised: "Spending can vary from revenues in a given year and result in a different ranking." Wisnoski said too that the revenue amounts "would include money for both operations and debt service," a reference to what districts put into paying off bond debt rather than paying for day-to-day operations. Also, Wisnoski wrote, the "amounts per student are without regard to any variance in the educational needs of, or program participation of, the students in the listed districts." By email, Tom Canby of the Texas Association of School Business Officials concurred with Wisnoski’s analysis. Focusing on state’s highest-enrollment districts For our part, we noticed that Falk’s sampling left out a few of the state’s 12 highest-enrollment districts: in 2016-17, the latest year of state-posted counts, these were the Northside and North East districts in Bexar County, the Conroe district in Montgomery County and the Fort Bend district in Fort Bend County. Folding in actual per-student financial data for Falk’s listed districts and for these other districts led us to compose a chart showing the Austin district in 2015-16 trailed eight of the state’s highest-enrollment districts in such spending. Within the sample, the San Antonio district had the greatest per-student figure, at $12,430, followed by the Dallas, Katy, Houston, Ysleta, North East, El Paso and Aldine districts--before the Austin district. Focusing on the 10 largest districts by enrollment puts Austin sixth in per-student revenue, with the Dallas district leading at $12,069 per student. TEN HIGHEST-ENROLLMENT TEXAS SCHOOL DISTRICTS DISTRICT 2015-16 All Funds Total Revenue/Student DALLAS $12,069 KATY $11,568 HOUSTON $11,450 NORTH EAST $10,921 ALDINE $10,905 AUSTIN $10,805 NORTHSIDE $10,722 FORT WORTH $10,507 FORT BEND $10,419 CYPRESS-FAIRBANKS $10,395 SOURCES: Email, DeEtta Culbertson, information specialist, Texas Education Agency, Nov. 13, 2017 and PolitiFact Texas research starting from a TEA website, "PEIMS District Financial Actual Reports, 2015-16," accessed Nov. 15, 2017 We shared the information provided by the agency and Wisnoski with Falk. He replied by email: "In my goal to provide accurate, thoughtful counterpoint, I defer to those I use for reference, like TEA," which collects and analyzes data. "If they differ with the assessment, I accept their numbers and gladly stand corrected." Falk followed up: "My point could have been made by simply saying ‘similar funding to other large districts’ or something to that effect." Our ruling Falk said the Austin district "enjoys the highest per-student funding of all large Texas districts" even after forwarding revenue to the state. Considering all audited actual revenues for 2015-16, it looks to us like the Austin district trailed other high-enrollment districts in spending--ranking sixth or ninth among such districts depending on which ones you include.

abbc-00279	"In terms of how I have described my attitude towards negative gearing, I have always understood that for the vast majority of Australians who use negative gearing they are modest income earning Australians, nurses, teachers, police," Treasurer Scott Morrison told the National Press Club in February.	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-03-03/fact-check-negative-gearing-scott-morrison/7180812	Mr Morrison's claim is selective. Australian Tax Office data shows that one in 10 Australians who files a tax return is negatively geared in terms of rental property. Data provided by Mr Morrison's office, based on Treasury calculations, showed 67 per cent of the people who use negative gearing have taxable incomes of $80,000 or less. This was backed up by Fact Check's analysis of ATO statistics. However, as 82 per cent of all taxpayers have taxable incomes below $80,000, it is not surprising that most of the negative gearers fall into this category. As this category represents only 67 per cent of negative gearers, it is clear that these taxpayers use negative gearing proportionately less than taxpayers with higher income. Put another way, only 8 per cent of people with taxable incomes less than $80,000 use negative gearing, compared with more than double that proportion among people with taxable incomes above $80,000. Similarly, people with taxable incomes over $80,000 receive 42 per cent of the negative gearing benefit, but they only represent 33 per cent of all negative gearers. Finally, those with a total income (including negative gearing benefit) of $52,000 a year or less — an income more in line with the definition of modest as a "moderate" or median income — represent 59 per cent of all taxpayers, but only 40 per cent of negatively geared taxpayers. Only 4 per cent of these people use negative gearing. When the negative gearing benefit is removed by taking out their rental losses, they represent 33 per cent of people who use negative gearing.

pomt-14886	Obamacare insurance cooperative failures "should be expected" because they're like any business, and "when you start businesses in America, at the fifth year, half of the businesses have closed."	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2015/nov/10/ezekiel-emanuel/did-obamacare-insurance-co-ops-fail-faster-average/	It’s sign-up time for Obamacare and while the website is clicking along and the program has succeeded in reducing the ranks of the uninsured, there is one notable sore spot: A $2.4 billion effort to provide low-cost insurance through consumer owned insurance cooperatives is in deep trouble. Out of the 23 co-ops largely funded through Obamacare by federal loans, 12 will no longer offer policies after this year. Republican critics of the president’s signature health care law have focused on these failures. But a staunch defender of the Affordable Care Act, Zeke Emanuel, brother of President Barack Obama’s former chief of staff and bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania, downplayed the bad news on MSNBC. "When you start businesses in America, at the fifth year, half of the businesses have closed," Emanuel said on Nov. 3, 2015. "The idea that some of these co-ops are going to work and some aren’t should be expected. That's what business is about. The idea that 100 percent will succeed is a false metric we don't hold the private sector to." We decided to dig into Emanuel’s notion that a 50-percent failure rate after five years for businesses applies to these insurance co-ops. Where the co-ops came from When Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, it included $6 billion in loans to launch Consumer Owned and Oriented Plans. The vision was to create nonprofit health insurance companies that would provide low-cost, high quality policies to individuals and small businesses. Without the need to produce a return on investment, these enterprises would, in theory, be able to compete against the major generally for-profit players in the market. In fact, in places where competition was scant, these co-ops would help the market deliver better value for all consumers. Throughout 2012 and 2013, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department approved loans to get the co-ops up and running. After a series of budget cuts, program funding was capped at $2.4 billion. In 2013, the co-ops began selling policies to provide coverage in 2014. The dates are important because it’s doubtful any of these co-ops were five years old as of 2015. If they weren’t five years old, then Emanuel’s benchmark might not be as suitable as he suggested. Emanuel told us that the co-ops launched before 2012. "Many of these co-ops were started in 2011 and were doing a lot of work to get ready," Emanuel told PunditFact. "To apply for a loan, you had to do some serious analysis about the market and costs. You needed to have a business plan." On the other hand, Emanuel said there isn’t any perfect comparison data to work with. His real point he said was "to give some context for the closures," and "to focus on when they began is to miss the forest for the trees." "Their age? They were somewhere north of three years old," he told us. Scott Harrington is a business professor who focuses on health care finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. "Some of the co-ops didn’t even last two years," Harrington said. We looked at the data to help resolve this. Failures accumulate For several decades, the U.S. Census Bureau has tracked the births and deaths of firms in the Business Dynamics Statistics database. We crunched the numbers in two ways -- for all firms and for firms in the finance, insurance and real estate business. That industry group -- known by the acronym FIRE -- is broader than you would want but it’s the closest match to see how the insurance co-ops stack up against approximately similar kinds of firms. The bottom line is that after five years, about 44 percent of all businesses have disappeared. So Emanuel was pretty close when he said about half have closed. But as you might expect, the younger the companies, the lower the failure rate. Here are the average rates from 2000 to 2007, based on Census business data. (We didn’t include 2008 or 2009 because closings spiked during the Great Recession.) Average firm failure rate 2000-2007 After 1 year After 2 years After 3 years After 4 years After 5 years All firms 17% 27% 34% 40% 44% FIRE industry 16% 26% 34% 40% 45% So Emanuel’s comparison ultimately boils down to how old the co-ops were. There is no perfect answer. Emanuel said they existed when they began doing the research to apply for a federal loan. You could say they were born on the day Washington approved their loans. We used the Census Bureau definition. The Census Bureau said it treats the first year a company shows employment in its payroll tax records as the year it was born. We looked at CoOportunity Health in Iowa. It was in the first wave of loan recipients on Feb. 17, 2012. The company’s former Chief Financial Officer Stephen Ringless told us the loan award took the co-op to the next step of securing a state insurance license. When that came through, it hired a few consultants. "When the company was able to develop a payroll system in early June 2012, those consultants became full-time employees," Ringless said. Almost exactly two-and-half years later, on Jan. 29, 2015, the Iowa insurance commissioner moved to liquidate CoOportunity Health. The firm was about $50 million in the red. While some employees were retained as the firm was wound down, as a going concern, its days ended in early 2015. We did not dig into the details of all of the failed co-ops but the CoOportunity timeline seems more or less to apply to many of them. A June 2013 Inspector General’s Office report looked at the 18 co-ops funded in the first half of 2012. The federal auditors said that by the end of 2012, all of the firms were still "hiring staff, obtaining licensure, and building necessary infrastructure." By the third quarter of 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that 12 co-ops would no longer be in business as of 2016. Given all this, it would be reasonable to say the co-ops were three years old when they failed. That would run from mid-way through 2012 -- approximately the time of funding -- until mid-way through 2015 -- approximately the time the closure process was underway. The failure rate was over 50 percent. The corresponding failure rate at the three-year mark for all American businesses and for the broader finance, insurance and real estate sector is 34 percent. The co-ops fared significantly worse than the U.S. average, failing at a rate that is about 40 percent faster than is typical. Harrington at the University of Pennsylvania noted one other significant difference between the co-ops and the typical American start-up. "How many firms launch with heavy subsidies from the government?" he asked. Our ruling Emanuel said the Obamacare insurance co-ops failed at a rate that’s typical for American businesses over a five-year period. The underlying comparison is flawed. While the age of each co-op is subject to debate, we used the Census Bureau’s definition to determine when they were born. Interviews with experts, government audits, and regulators’ actions point to three years as the typical lifespan of a failed co-op. About 50 percent of the co-ops shut down. Compared to the three-year failure rate in America, the co-ops have done much worse -- cratering at a rate that is about 40 percent faster than average. But Emanuel could turn out to be right. We won’t know the five-year rate for the entire group until late in 2016 or early 2017. If the remaining co-ops are still running, then the group’s failure rate will be close to the national average. Emanuel’s statement is accurate regarding the five-year-average but leaves out important details. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-04400	Says his administration has created "5 million jobs … over the last 30 months in the private sector alone."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/oct/17/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-his-administration-has-created-5/	Early in the second presidential debate at Hofstra University, President Barack Obama answered a question from a young voter seeking reassurance that he will be able to find a job after he graduates. Obama responded in part, "And what I want to do is build on the 5 million jobs that we've created over the last 30 months in the private sector alone." Job-creation statistics have been bitterly contested terrain between the campaigns this election cycle, with each trying to frame the question in a way that paints their side most favorably. For example, Mitt Romney’s campaign ran an ad recently that said, "Since President Obama took office, there are over 450,000 more unemployed women." We rated that statement Half True, because the number was correct by one method, but way off by others. Obama’s claim from the debate suffers from the same problem. If you start at the low point in the private-sector job market -- February 2010, which is 31 months ago -- then Obama has presided over the net creation of 4.7 million jobs. But that means starting the count more than a year after Obama took office, which -- a little too conveniently for the president -- removes all of the job losses from his first year off his ledger. Another way of doing it would be to start with January 2009, when Obama was sworn in. By this count, the nation has gained a net 514,000 private-sector jobs -- an amount only one-tenth the size of what Obama claimed. However, this method has its drawbacks, because no president can have much impact in the first few months on the job. A middle-ground position is to start the count at the official beginning of the recovery, which came in June 2009. From June 2009 until today, the nation has gained roughly 3.6 million private-sector jobs. That’s less than Obama claims, but more than the inauguration-day calculation the Romney camp often prefers. It's also worth noting that economists say that presidents have a relatively modest impact on the ups and downs of jobs, so it can be a stretch to give Obama either credit for good job numbers or blame for weak job numbers. A final note: Private-sector job numbers are a credible yardstick, but they do paint a more favorable picture for the president than total job numbers do, since government jobs have been shrinking in recent years. Since June 2009, the nation has gained a little under 3 million total jobs, compared to 3.6 million using private-sector jobs alone. Our ruling Obama said that his administration has created "5 million jobs … over the last 30 months in the private sector alone." That’s true only using the most cherry-picked time frame. A more reasonable method -- starting the count at the beginning of the recovery -- shows a gain of 3.6 million jobs. That’s still a substantial number, but well short of the 5 million Obama claimed. We rate the statement Half True.	None	Barack Obama	None	None	None	2012-10-17T15:04:50	2012-10-16	['None']
pomt-00328	Says Michigan congressional candidate Elissa Slotkin "just parachuted into the district to run for Congress" and "admitted that she doesn’t know our area."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/sep/19/mike-bishop/campaign-ad-accuses-elissa-slotkin-carpetbagging/	It has been 18 years since a Democrat held the U.S. House seat in Michigan’s 8th Congressional District. Even so, the race between political newcomer Elissa Slotkin and incumbent Mike Bishop is viewed as a bellwether in the fight for control of the U.S. House in November. Slotkin, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst, is looking to unseat the two-term Republican congressman, who received 56 percent of the vote in his 2016 re-election bid. The district, which stretches from north of Detroit to the state capital Lansing, voted for President Trump with 51 percent of the vote. Slotkin is seen as a "different kind" of Democrat who served in both the Bush and Obama administrations, supports existing gun rights and criticizes single-payer health care. One argument routinely made against Slotkin — and emphasized in a recent radio ad by Bishop — is her weaker ties to the district. "What do we know about D.C. insider Elissa Slotkin? Not much, since Elissa Slotkin just parachuted into the district to run for Congress. We know that Elissa Slotkin was recruited by Nancy Pelosi and sent here from Washington. Slotkin doesn’t own a home in Michigan, and her only voting record … for herself, just a few days ago in the Michigan primary. Elissa Slotkin even admitted that she doesn’t know our area." (Audio of Slotkin's voice) "I did not know the outline of the district…" "Doesn’t know the district? Then how can Elissa Slotkin know us?" Here, we are focusing on her Michigan ties and the claim that she "doesn’t know" the district’s boundaries. She's not as much of an outsider as the ad says. Slotkin and Michigan Slotkin’s campaign calls her a third-generation Michigan native. Slotkin was born in New York, but her family returned to Michigan when she was 4 years old, the campaign said. Slotkin grew up on her family’s farm in Holly, which is located in the 8th district in Oakland County. Her great-grandfather established her family’s meat business called Hygrade Foods, which opened its Detroit headquarters in 1949. The business created a number of foods, but most famously the Ballpark Frank, first sold at Tiger Stadium. Slotkin studied at Cornell University in New York and then went to graduate school at Columbia University. She served three tours in Iraq as a Central Intelligence Agency analyst before taking on various roles in Washington in the intelligence and defense departments during the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. Slotkin moved back to her family’s farm from D.C. in the spring of 2017 after her national security post ended with the Obama administration. She runs a small consulting business there called Pinpoint Consulting, according to the Michigan Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs. Does Elissa Slotkin own a home in Michigan? The ad claims that Slotkin doesn’t own a home in Michigan. That is accurate, but leaves out some important context. Slotkin does not own her family’s farm herself — the deed is in the name of her father, Curtis Slotkin, Oakland County property records show. Slotkin's father and stepmother live about 30 minutes from the farm, in the Detroit suburbs of Oakland County. The farm was purchased by Slotkin’s grandfather and passed down to her father when her grandfather passed away, said Slotkin campaign spokeswoman Laura Epstein. "When Elissa’s parents pass," Epstein says, "the property will then be in her name — in line with family tradition." What about her voting record? Bishop’s ad asserts that Slotkin has only voted in Michigan once, and that was in her own primary. That statement, according to state records, is correct. Michigan Secretary of State Elections Bureau records show that Slotkin has only voted once in the state, and that was in the August primary. Does she really not know the district’s boundaries? The audio clip of Slotkin talking about the district’s outlines is from a town hall event sponsored by the NAACP Lansing chapter, according to Bishop campaign consultant Stu Sandler. It is clear the audio is clipped. Slotkin said she "did not know the outline of the district," even though the ad's retort of "doesn't" makes the listener think she still doesn't know. We were unable to obtain a full recording from that event. However, at a campaign volunteer event on July 7, Slotkin can be heard saying something similar, that she "didn’t know, probably a year and a half ago, the exact boundaries of the district." She then goes on to review the district’s outlines. Epstein told PolitiFact that Slotkin frequently introduces herself by giving a lay of the land at the beginning of an event and sometimes starts by talking about the district lines. Our ruling Bishop’s ad portrays Slotkin as a "Washington insider" who parachuted into the district to run for the U.S. House. It also utilized an audio clip to allege she doesn’t know the outlines of the district. On some of the technical claims, the ad is accurate. Slotkin has only voted once in the state (in her own primary race), and she is not a Michigan homeowner. However, the ad leaves out important details about her childhood background in the district, and takes her words at a campaign event out of context. The home where she lives is owned by her parents on her family farm, and is slated to be passed down to her. The ad's soundbite is clipped to make it sound like Slotkin admitted to not knowing the outlines of her own district. A similar Slotkin statement shows she may not have known the boundaries before moving back to the state, but she does now. We rate the claim Half True. Update, Sept. 24, 2018: This report was updated to include Slotkin's birth in New York. The rating remains the same.

pomt-06623	Says that even if you have no children, "under Obamacare, you would still have to carry insurance that covers pediatric, maternity and newborn care even though you do not need it."	mostly false	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/19/mary-taylor/lt-gov-mary-taylor-says-obamacare-would-require-pu/	Ohio Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor also heads the state Department of Insurance. She makes no secret of her dislike for what she derisively calls "Obamacare," the law formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. In June, Taylor wrote a guest column for newspapers in which she said, "I will do everything I can to protect Ohio’s citizens and job creators from this catastrophic law." She followed it by giving a speech with a similar theme. In another guest column for newspapers that was posted Sept. 8 to the Department of Insurance website, Taylor says the health care law will limit choice and increase cost for consumers. "The law’s heavy-handed mandates force insurance companies to include coverage for many benefits and services you may not want," she wrote. "Say for example, you do not have any children. Under Obamacare, you would still have to carry insurance that covers pediatric, maternity and newborn care even though you do not need it. "Such mandates remove consumerism from the process and replace it with a one-size-fits-all approach. By requiring consumers to buy services they do not want or need, costs will rise significantly." That got PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. Would consumers really be forced to buy unnecessary coverage, like pediatric, maternity and newborn care for people with no children? We asked Taylor's office for support. We were referred to Section 1302 of the Affordable Care Act as amended by the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. "It addresses the essential health benefits," a spokesman for Taylor said. We read Section 1302, and it seemed to bear out Taylor's assertion. But we were frankly confused by the wording, and we turned for guidance to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a trusted independent source on health care issues. "It is true that this (pediatric, maternity and newborn care) is covered as part of the essential benefits package," a spokesman told us. "The law does mandate that insurance." But the spokesman added more: Current employer-provided insurance plans "may include coverage you will never use or need, such as maternity care for a man or prostate cancer coverage for women." Wanting further explanation, we talked with Neera Tanden, who worked on the health care legislation as senior advisor for health reform at the Department of Health and Human Services. She is currently CEO of the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. "Ninety percent of all plans cover everything described in the bill as 'essential health benefits package," she said. "People are paying for all those benefits today. We all pay for things we never use. It is the nature of insurance." Individual policies are usually more expensive, offer fewer benefits and are less regulated than group plans, she said, noting that Section 1302 of the health care act says that the scope of the package should equal the scope of benefits "under a typical employer plan." The act also bans exclusions for "preexisting conditions" that exclusively or primarily affect women and ends the practice of charging women higher premiums than men, she said. "The thrust of (Taylor's) case is there should be no requirements on what insurance companies offer," Tanden said. Wanting the perspective of an authority without a dog in the political fight, we turned to J.B. Silvers at Case Western Reserve University. He is professor of health care finance and professor of banking and finance at the Weatherhead School of Management, faculty director of the Health Systems Management Center and holds a joint appointment in the School of Medicine. He also is former CEO of a health plan and insurance company. Silvers said the health care plan "makes the playing field level" by setting a standard for benefit packages. "It is true you could buy some sort of stripped-down policy," he said, but such plans are "almost universally a bad deal" with higher costs. Normally, he said, a company negotiates coverage for employees, and "wouldn't offer one plan for single males and another for people with families." What does that say about the accuracy of Taylor's statement? "It's irrelevant," Silvers said. "It's a silly argument, frankly. Insurance by definition includes things you don't think you need." What it means to us is that Taylor, the top official at the state department that oversees insurance, was accurate in describing provisions of what she calls Obamacare. But it is misleading to imply that health insurance policies are purchased a la carte, that such purchasing would reduce costs to consumers, and that the "essential benefits package" represents a departure from current group plans. And when a statement has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, it rates Mostly False on the Truth-O-Meter.

pomt-07116	Muslims tried to use Sharia law to influence court decisions in New Jersey and Oklahoma	mostly false	/georgia/statements/2011/jun/20/herman-cain/cain-claims-muslims-tried-influence-sharia-law-nj-/	Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain can’t get away from the subject of Islamic law. Reporters have been dogging him on the issue since March, when a liberal blogger asked Cain whether he’d feel comfortable appointing a Muslim to his Cabinet if he became president. Cain said he would not appoint one because Islam demands they follow Sharia law, above all others -- including the U.S. Constitution. Sharia law is a wide-ranging set of rules that govern aspects of Islamic life including religious practice, daily living, crime and financial dealings. Muslims differ on its interpretation. Later, Cain denied saying he would not appoint Muslims -- a statement PolitiFact Georgia ruled Pants on Fire. CNN anchor and moderator John King asked Cain about the subject again during the June 13 Republican primary debate in Manchester, N.H. "Are American-Muslims as a group less committed to the Constitution than, say, Christians or Jews?" King asked. "There have been instances in New Jersey -- there was an instance in Oklahoma where Muslims did try to influence court decisions with Sharia law. I was simply saying very emphatically, ‘American laws in American courts,’ " Cain replied. Have there been instances in New Jersey and Oklahoma where Muslims tried to "influence court decisions with Sharia law"? We turned to news accounts and court documents to address the issue. First, we’ll consider Oklahoma, where voters approved the "Save Our State Amendment" Nov. 2. It forbids courts from using Sharia law as well as international law when they make decisions. A judge granted a request later that month for a preliminary injunction that bars the amendment from going into effect. It is being challenged in federal appellate court. During a Nov. 22 hearing in Oklahoma federal court, state Assistant Attorney General Scott Boughton defended the amendment on behalf of the state. He conceded under questioning by a federal judge that he did not know of any instances where Sharia law was used in state courts, according to The Oklahoman newspaper. An Oct. 28 Los Angeles Times article on the proposed amendment found three cases that backers said demonstrate Sharia law is being used in U.S. courts. None of them took place in Oklahoma. A brief filed in federal court in support of the Oklahoma amendment did not assert that Sharia law had been used in Oklahoma courts. Instead, it listed one example from New Jersey. This brings us to Cain’s mention of New Jersey during the June 13 debate. In 2009, state Superior Court Judge Joseph Charles denied a woman a restraining order after she reported her husband repeatedly beat and sexually assaulted her. She and her husband are Muslim. Charles asked their imam during the injunction hearing how Islamic law applies to sexual behavior. The imam testified that a wife must comply with her husband’s sexual demands, but a husband was forbidden to approach his wife "like any animal." Charles said he denied the restraining order in part because the husband’s "desire to have sex when and whether he wanted to, was something that was consistent with his practices and it was something that was not prohibited," according to the decision. The New Jersey appeals court ruled July 23, 2010, that Charles was wrong. His decision contradicted U.S. and state Supreme Court precedent on conflicts between criminal law and religion, the ruling said. Let’s sum up. Cain was wrong on Oklahoma. Voters did pass an amendment to the state constitution that would prevent the use of Sharia law in state courts, but supporters found no instance where "Muslims did try to influence court decisions with Sharia law," as Cain said. There was a New Jersey case in which a judge considered Islamic law when he denied a request for a restraining order. However, since the issue of Islamic law arose only when the New Jersey judge questioned the couple’s imam, it is unfair to accuse Muslims of trying to "influence court decisions with Sharia law." The judge raised the subject. We rule Cain’s statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Herman Cain	None	None	None	2011-06-20T06:00:00	2011-06-13	['New_Jersey']

pomt-00212	"Of course you've got a low unemployment rate when people've got to work two and three jobs just to make ends meet."	pants on fire!	/florida/statements/2018/oct/15/andrew-gillum/andrew-gillum-unemployment-claim/	Gov. Rick Scott has touted a strong Florida economy built up over his two terms in office. But Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate seeking to replace him, says the economy is "propped up" by low wages and people working multiple jobs just to make ends meet. In an interview on CBS Miami’s "Facing South Florida," host Jim DeFede asked the Tallahassee mayor if he gave Scott any credit for the economy. "I give him credit for an economy that is largely propped up on low-wage work," Gillum said. "Of course you've got a low unemployment rate when people have got to work two and three jobs just to make ends meet." In a companion fact-check, we looked Gillum’s claim about low-wage work propping up Florida’s economy (Half True). Here, we will examine Gillum’s latter point about the low unemployment rate is propped up by people with multiple jobs. After the interview, the campaign of Gillum’s Republican rival, Ron DeSantis, cried "Pants on Fire!" to Gillum’s multiple jobs claim. The campaign was referencing our fact-check of a similar statement by Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez about the national unemployment rate. Is Gillum’s claim any better? No. It is similarly wrong. Multiple jobs Florida does have nearly full employment, with an unemployment rate of 3.7 percent as of August 2018. Gillum doesn’t see that as positively as Scott. But his point that low unemployment indicates that people are working multiple low-wage jobs to make ends meet doesn’t hold up. Official unemployment rates are not affected by the number of jobs people hold. Nationally, only a small percentage of American workers are employed at more than one job, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number has hovered in the 4.7 to 5.2 percent range during the past 10 years. Florida’s percentage of residents with more than one job does not deviate from national trends. The number of jobs in Florida has risen 2.8 percentage points faster than the number of workers in Florida over the past eight years, based on data from the federal Household and Payroll surveys. Moody's Analytics senior economist Kwame Donaldson said that’s evidence some workers have more than one job. However, he said, Florida is ranked 26th in the United States in this measure. Nationally, the number of jobs rose 2.9 percentage points faster than the number of workers in that time period. Data about multiple job holders isn’t specific enough to draw conclusions about the quality of the jobs, according to Sean Snaith, the director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Economic Competitiveness. "You can have multiple jobs even if your primary job is high-paying," Snaith said. Over the past year, the number of American workers who’ve held multiple jobs has ranged between 6 million and 7 million, compared to more than 148 million who are employed in a single job. The number of jobs people hold does not affect the BLS unemployment rate. People are counted as employed as long as they hold one job. They do not get counted again if they hold more than one. "The claim about multiple jobs and unemployment is simply not true," Snaith said. Our ruling Gillum said that unemployment was low because people were working multiple jobs. Unemployment rates are not influenced by how many jobs someone holds, and not many people hold more than one job. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.

pomt-08346	Of the more than 1.3 million temporary mortgage modifications, over half have defaulted.	half-true	/florida/statements/2010/oct/27/marco-rubio/rubio-claims-among-more-13-million-temporary-mortg/	Foreclosures are a rampant problem in Florida, and the next U.S. senator will be expected to help tackle the national crisis. In the final debate Oct. 26, 2010, between Florida's U.S. Senate candidates on NBC, moderator David Gregory asked Republican Marco Rubio "what would you do to solve the foreclosure problem?" During his answer, Rubio bashed the efforts of the current administration. "Over 1.3 million temporary work-outs, over half have now defaulted,'' he said. Gregory clarified what Rubio meant by "work-outs:" "Those are called mortgage modifications?" Rubio: "The temporary modifications. There have been 500,000 permanent (modifications). We just found out yesterday of the 500,000 permanent (modifications), 11 percent already defaulted." For this Truth-O-Meter we wanted to explore, did Rubio get his numbers right on the larger figure -- have there been more than 1.3 million temporary mortgage modifications of which more than half have defaulted? An Oct. 25 Associated Press article provides some answers. The article focused on comments by Neil Barofsky, special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, a $700 billion Wall Street bailout in 2008 that includes a mortgage modification program launched in 2009. According to the AP, Barofsky concluded that the administration's "foreclosure-prevention effort has been ineffective in tackling the foreclosure crisis." Barofsky issued a 338-page quarterly report about TARP to Congress on Oct. 26, the day of the debate. The report states on Page 6: "Finally, the most specific of TARP's Main Street goals, 'preserving homeownership,' has so far fallen woefully short with TARP's portion of the Administration's mortgage modification program yielding only approximately 207,000 ... ongoing permanent modifications since TARP's inception, a number that stands in stark contrast to the 5.5 million homes receiving foreclosure filings and more than 1.7 million homes that have been lost to foreclosure since January 2009." Funded through TARP, the Home Affordable Mortgage Modification Program is intended to help prevent foreclosure by modifying mortgages. By the end of September 2010, HAMP spent about $483 million in TARP money. The report shows a chart on page 74 that 1,369,414 mortgage modification trials had started by the end of September 2010. The chart states that 699,924 trials had been cancelled -- so note that is slightly more than half. The chart doesn't use the word "temporary" for any of the trials -- but it is clear that the 699,924 figure refers to temporary because another line on the chart shows that nearly 500,000 trials were converted to "permanent." Of those permanent modifications, the majority survived while almost 29,000 were cancelled. Rubio stated that the more than 1.3 million mortgage modifications were temporary. While all of the more than 1.3 million started out as temporary, about 500,000 became permanent. Rubio also said that more than half of those 1.3 million had "defaulted." But the chart doesn't state that they defaulted -- it says cancelled. We sent Rubio's claim to Matthew Anderson, spokesman for the U.S. Department of Treasury that oversees the mortgage modification program. "It is not accurate, however, to say that all canceled trials are the result of 'default,'" Anderson wrote in an e-mail. "Trial plans may be canceled for a number of reasons, only one of which is failure to make payments." Anderson pointed us to the September 2010 HAMP report that contains data from the largest service providers, which indicates the top three reasons, in order, for cancellation. Anderson listed them for us: "Borrowers not providing sufficient documentation to servicers, trial plan payment default, or a homeowner who is ineligible because their housing expense is already below the program's 31% threshold." We called and e-mailed Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos on Oct. 27. He sent us back a link to an Oct. 18, 2010, Government Sponsored Enterprises report, a publication done by the Washington, D.C., consulting firm Canfield and Associates. The GSE report stated: "As of August, only 449,000 borrowers have received permanent modifications through HAMP—34% of the 1.3 million borrowers who have enrolled in the program, while 680,000 borrowers have fallen out of the program (51%)." That report also stated that through July, incomplete requests (28 percent) and trial plan default (21 percent) were the top two reasons that trial modifications failed to convert to permanent. Rubio is familiar with the housing crisis personally. An Oct. 22 St. Petersburg Times article about his personal finances stated that Rubio's "Tallahassee home, which he bought with fellow legislator David Rivera, nearly went into foreclosure before Rivera came up with $9,525 for missed payments and fees. Rubio said the delay was over a dispute with the mortgage company." In the final full week of the U.S. Senate race, how did Rubio fare on his numbers about the mortgage modification program? Rubio said "over 1.3 million temporary work-outs, over half have now defaulted,'' referring to a temporary mortgage modification program. His claim requires some clarification -- of the more than 1.3 million mortgage modifications that started out as temporary, nearly 700,000 in the trial phase were cancelled -- or 51 percent. So Rubio is correct on "over half" but wrong to conclude that all of those had "defaulted." Defaulting was the second most common reason for cancellation, therefore we rate this claim Half True.

pomt-06586	"We have 10,000 baby boomers retiring every day."	true	/ohio/statements/2011/sep/26/john-boehner/house-speaker-john-boehner-says-10000-baby-boomers/	Since President Obama launched his offensive to tout initiatives he believes will create jobs and revive the economy, House Speaker John Boehner of Ohio has provided a steady Republican counterpoint. Boehner appeared Sept. 19, 2011, on Fox Business Network, where he described Obama’s call for higher taxes on millionaires as "class warfare," and advised the president to "tackle the spending problem." "What we’re seeing out of the president’s so-called deficit reduction package is more of the same," Boehner told interviewer Gerri Willis. "It’s class warfare, not serious about dealing with the real drivers of our debt. And that’s major entitlement programs. "We have 10,000 baby boomers retiring every day. It’s time for us to get serious about ensuring that these programs are going to be there for them." That’s a lot of retirees. PolitiFact Ohio was intrigued and took a look at the speaker’s claim. The claim is similar to one made by House Majority Leader Eric Cantor that our counterparts at PolitiFact Virginia examined. We’ll incorporate some of their findings here, too. Baby boomers comprise a large demographic group of Americans who were born between Jan. 1, 1946 and Dec. 31, 1964. Their pending departure from the workforce is expected to significantly stress the retirement system. According to the Social Security System’s Annual Performance Plan for Fiscal Year 2012: "Nearly 80 million baby boomers will file for retirement benefits over the next 20 years – an average of 10,000 per day." That bears out the statistic cited by Boehner. A 2010 Pew Research Center study says baby boomers comprise 26 percent of the total U.S. population. After 2030 - when that generation reaches retirement age - Pew projects that 18 percent of the nation’s population will be over age 65, compared with 13 percent today. Census data collected by Pew indicates the estimated number of retires could be even greater than 10,000 per day. According to Pew’s data, 76 million people were born in the United States between 1946 and 1964. After subtracting those who died and adding immigrants born during those years, America has 79.6 million people of that generation. If you divide 79.6 million by 19 years (the number remaining until 2030), then divide that by 365 days, you get a daily average of 11,476 people turning 65. Although not everyone in that age group will live to reach age 65, the amount who will end up retiring each day could significantly exceed Boehner’s 10,000 per day figure. Boehner’s statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing. We rule his claim True.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2011-09-26T06:00:00	2011-09-19	['None']
pomt-04945	Says PolitiFact "validated and independently documented" its "criminal history" claims about Adan Ballesteros.	mostly false	/texas/statements/2012/jul/27/texans-accountable-government/texas-group-says-politifact-validated-criminal-his/	In a July 26, 2012, email blast, a political group backing Michael Cargill for a Travis County constable post asserts that Cargill’s opponent in the July 31 Democratic primary runoff, incumbent Adan Ballesteros, has been stealing anti-Ballesteros signs. We’re not wading into signs being hoisted. But we fired up the Truth-O-Meter for the email’s citation of PolitiFact. The email from Texans for Accountable Government, which says it’s focused on reining in the reach of government, says that its anti-Ballesteros website, CocaineConstable.com, brings to light Ballesteros’ "criminal history -- including being fired from (the Texas Department of Public Safety) for allowing the trafficking of drugs and taking money from informants, the Texas Public Safety Commission sustaining the firing, and his lawsuit against them being thrown out of court for being 'baseless and retaliatory.'" The email continues: "TAG's claims were validated and independently documented recently by PolitiFact.com," the email says. Do what? We figured that this part was referring to our June 25, 2012, article on another group’s claim that Ballesteros, the county’s Precinct 2 constable, had "accepted more than $15,000 in cocaine blood money." Unlike most of our fact-checks, we ended up being unable to rate that claim. Our 2,200-word story says that the DPS dismissed Ballesteros as an employee in 1998 after seeing merit in a complaint that, years earlier, he had accepted thousands of dollars in illicit funds from a drug smuggler/informant -- a firing upheld by the Texas Public Safety Commission. However, a Texas Workforce Commission tribunal later said a grand jury found no probable cause to indict Ballesteros and also said "there is not a preponderance of evidence before this appeal tribunal to find the claimant guilty of criminal acts." The July 26 email blast makes no mention of the tribunal’s statement or of the fact that Ballesteros was not charged in criminal court. Ballesteros, who has consistently said he did not accept such funds, told us in an interview that he was investigated and fired because he refused to fire a secretary who had made sexual harassment allegations against a DPS employee. He said that he was ordered to fire the woman shortly after moving to Austin to lead DPS’s narcotics training unit in 1993 — two years before the investigation into his activities as a narcotics investigator in South Texas began. Ballesteros made the same claim in a lawsuit he filed against the DPS. U.S. District Judge James Nowlin dismissed the suit on Sept. 20, 2000, saying in his order that Ballesteros failed to offer relevant evidence. On April 2, 2001, a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the order, writing that Ballesteros had failed to offer evidence that the DPS investigation was "baseless and motivated by retaliatory intent," as mentioned in the email blast. By telephone, we asked the group’s executive director, Heather Fazio, to elaborate on PolitiFact validating its claims, as the email says. Fazio said the reference was solely to our reporting on Ballesteros getting fired by the DPS for allegedly letting drugs into the country and taking illicit money; his firing being upheld; and his post-firing lawsuit being judged baseless. Fazio said the validation reference was not intended to say PolitiFact had confirmed the entire CocaineConstable site. Asked about the email’s reference to Ballesteros’ "criminal history" despite the fact he was not indicted, Fazio replied: "If you were fired for something that is a criminal act, just because you were not indicted doesn’t mean you were not involved in criminal activity." Beyond that, she said, the "criminal history" term reflected the group’s opinion and was not intended to signal that PolitiFact validated as much. If recipients reach such a conclusion, she said, "I guess I have to apologize for that part." Our ruling As the group’s email suggests, our story that was the basis of the email’s PolitiFact reference sketches out the complaint and investigation that preceded Ballesteros’ firing and the fact that the firing was upheld and his lawsuit found baseless. However, we did not validate Ballesteros’ "criminal history," as the group’s email can be read, and the group’s statement fails to point out he was not indicted or that the workforce commission tribunal saw no preponderance of evidence of criminal acts. Broadly, the group indicates we reached a conclusion about Ballesteros being a criminal that we did not reach. The claim rates Mostly False.

pomt-09660	"The Congressional Budget Office -- supposedly non-partisan -- estimates that in just a few years the average cost to every family of four (from cap and trade) will be $6,800 per year."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/nov/27/chain-email/6800-cap-and-trade-not-cbo-estimate/	Critics of the Democratic cap-and-trade proposal have many complaints about the plan, but their biggest is cost. They say it will cost so much that it will be a significant burden on a typical American family. The latest variation of this comes in a chain e-mail that contends the cap-and-trade plan will require more energy-efficient homes (a claim we rated Pants on Fire ). The e-mail says, "The Congressional Budget Office -- supposedly non-partisan -- estimates that in just a few years the average cost to every family of four will be $6,800 per year. No one is excluded." We've spent a lot of time looking into claims about how much the cap-and-trade plan could cost families, and one thing's for certain: There's no consensus. The Environmental Protection Agency says it could cost as little as $80 per year while the conservative Heritage Foundation says it could cost as much as $1,241 annually in higher energy bills. We've explained the pros and cons of the various estimates in those previous items, so here we're going to look into the chain e-mail's claim that the CBO estimates cap-and-trade will cost a family of four $6,800 a year. The bill in question is called the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009. It is sponsored by Henry Waxman of California and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, and aims to reduce carbon emissions 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Companies, particularly utilities, would have to either buy pollution credits or adopt cleaner technology. Critics say that either way, the cost of energy will go up, and that cost will be passed on to the consumer. The CBO is a key player because it is a widely respected nonpartisan branch of Congress that calculates cost estimates. In June 2009, the CBO released an analysis of the House bill, saying that the economywide cost of the cap-and-trade program in 2020 would be $22 billion -- or about $175 per household. The individual cost would vary depending on your wealth. Low-income consumers could expect to save $40 a year because of credits from utilities, while high-income consumers would see a net cost for energy of $235 to $340 annually. It's also important to note that the costs are expected to vary year to year because of the way the law would be phased in. The CBO chose 2020 as a milestone for its analysis because it's a point at which the program would have been in effect for eight years, giving the economy and polluters time to adjust. But had the CBO chosen a later date, the cost per family may have been higher because the government would gradually be charging polluters more. We traced the $6,800 estimate back to a report from the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank that has been very critical of the cap-and-trade plan. In the report, the group criticizes the CBO for failing to consider the harm that the cap-and-trade plan could do to the economy. The conservative group says the law could cause companies to produce less, which would reduce the GDP in 2020 by $161 billion in 2009 dollars. By 2035, it would be $650 billion lower, which works out to about $6,800 per family of four per year. So the chain e-mail has taken the estimate from a conservative think tank and falsely attributed it to the CBO, a nonpartisan branch of Congress. There are many legitimate questions that can be raised about the cost of cap-and-trade, but it's simply incorrect to say the CBO came up with the $6,800 figure. We find this claim False.

pomt-05997	"Many types of fish and shellfish from waters across the state are labeled unsafe to eat."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2012/jan/20/james-florio/jim-florio-says-fish-new-jersey-waters-labeled-uns/	There’s plenty of fish in the waters of New Jersey, along with lots of other things: mercury, polychlorobiphenyls and dioxin, among them. And according to a former governor, there could be some danger in eating fish from Garden State waters. "Many types of fish and shellfish from waters across the state are labeled unsafe to eat," Jim Florio wrote in a Dec. 14 guest column in The Star-Ledger about how new reductions in mercury pollution will protect New Jerseyans from contaminated seafood. It turns out Florio wasn’t exactly telling a fish tale, PolitiFact New Jersey found. "I think that’s a fair and accurate statement actually," said Kerry Pflugh, manager of Constituent Services for the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection. "But that doesn’t mean that everything we catch is unsafe to eat. … Advisories are not based on water quality, it’s based on what’s in the fish itself. Fish advisories are set by tissue analysis, not water quality." Jonathan Scott, communications director for Clean Water Action in Washington, DC said, "We would agree with his assessment." Florio could not be reached for comment. How are fish consumption advisories formulated? Fish collected from New Jersey waterways are sent to The Academy of Sciences of Drexel University in Philadelphia. Tissue samples are taken to test for contaminants – mostly mercury, PCBs, DDT and other pesticides, said Richard Horwitz, senior biologist at the academy. A committee decides an acceptable risk for eating a particular fish based on potential health issues for people considered "high risk": children, pregnant women and women of child-bearing age, Horwitz said. They are advised to eat smaller portions of fish and less often. The 2010 Fish Consumption Advisories for all New Jersey waterways is available at the DEP’s Office Of Science website. The 30-page document explains what parts of fish are safe to eat; proper preparation; consumption frequency; and more. "Fish is a very healthy source of protein, vitamins and minerals," said Dr. Gary Buchanan, manager for the DEP’s Office of Science. "Just be careful about the fish you eat when catching them in local waters." The state also considers federal recommendations made by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. "The EPA provides guidance to assist states, Indian tribes and local governments in developing methods of monitoring, gathering and assessing information about their fish populations," EPA press officer John Martin said in an email. "Since this information is only guidance, use by states is not mandatory. The States have primary responsibility for monitoring, assessing and making advisory decisions. Thus the basis for each State fish advisory varies." While a variety of contaminants are found in fish, mercury is the most prevalent, experts told us. The mercury found in New Jersey waters comes from air pollution emitted from power plants, coal plants and incinerators from Pennsylvania and the Midwest, according to Buchanan, Horwitz and Scott. "If those sources from out of state are reduced, that will help speed up the reduction of mercury in our waters and our fish and help allow additional fish consumption," Buchanan said. "It is a nationwide problem. It’s not just a New Jersey problem. Every state in the country has a fish advisory for some parameter and some species." Even with the chemicals found in fish, New Jerseyans shouldn’t fear eating fish caught from the state’s waters, said Tom Fote, legislative chairman for the Jersey Coast Anglers Association in Toms River, as long as fish consumption guidelines are followed. "Seafood coming out of New Jersey waters is no different than the seafood coming from out of any other state," Fote said. Our ruling Florio said in a recent opinion column in The Star-Ledger that most fish from New Jersey waterways "is labeled unsafe to eat." Experts told PolitiFact New Jersey that they agree with the former governor’s assessment but also note that fish from New Jersey waters can be eaten safely by following consumption advisories. Also, fish bought in supermarkets or other stores in New Jersey are labeled, but recreationally caught fish are not. We rate Florio’s statement Mostly True. To comment on this story, go to NJ.com.

pomt-04733	Says the national health care law puts federal "bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor."	false	/new-jersey/statements/2012/aug/30/chris-christie/chris-christie-says-national-health-care-law-puts-/	The truth can be difficult. So difficult that even as Gov. Chris Christie said Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney would "tell us the hard truths," Christie himself slid into misleading territory. "Mitt Romney will tell us the hard truths we need to hear to end the debacle of putting the world’s greatest health care system in the hands of federal bureaucrats and putting those bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor," Christie said during his keynote address Tuesday night at the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla. In his capacity as a top Romney surrogate, Christie has previously criticized the health care reform passed by President Barack Obama, repeating the thoroughly debunked Republican talking point that the law is "a government takeover of health care." Here, we decided to check Christie’s statement that the law, formally called the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- or as some call it, Obamacare -- puts federal "bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor." (In a separate fact-check, we evaluated Christie’s claim that the United States has "the world’s greatest health care system.") PolitiFact National recently fact-checked a nearly identical statement from Romney and rated it False. Romney said that "Obamacare puts the federal government between you and your doctor." PolitiFact found Romney’s claim overstated the level of government control under the new law, which keeps intact the private-sector delivery of health care. The law requires insurance plans to carry a minimum benefits package and sets up virtual exchanges where individuals can purchase insurance. The law also creates incentives and penalties to promote better care. But none of that prevents doctors and patients from making healthcare decisions together, as they do now. And while some doctors are critical of the law, the leading physician advocacy group, the American Medical Association, supports the reform. The group’s president, Jeremy Lazarus, said in a June 28 news release after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Affordable Care Act that the law "simplifies administrative burdens, including streamlining insurance claims, so physicians and their staff can spend more time with patients and less time on paperwork." Other physician advocacy groups have also expressed support for the law. But, as PolitiFact noted, there are concerns among specialists about the legislation’s impact, specifically in relation to the Medicare program. Many opponents of the law have said the 15-member Independent Payment Advisory Board or IPAB -- which will recommend ways to prevent Medicare’s spending growth from exceeding certain targets -- will lead to health care rationing. But the board is specifically forbidden from submitting "any recommendation to ration health care." Though it can decrease government payments to health care providers for services and recommend ways to cut wasteful spending. In a March fact-check, U.S. Senate hopeful Joe Kyrillos, whom Christie has endorsed, pointed, in part, to IPAB to support his claim that under the health care law "the patient-doctor relationship will be eliminated." That statement rated a Pants on Fire on the Truth-O-Meter. Our ruling Christie said Romney will be able to tell the hard truths necessary to end the debacle of putting federal "bureaucrats between an American citizen and her doctor." We found no solid evidence to support Christie’s sweeping claim, which overreaches on the role of the federal government under the new law. With the reform, the private health care delivery system remains in place. While there are significant changes to the health insurance market and incentives and penalties to promote better care, that doesn’t mean the government is inserting itself in between doctors and patients. We rate this statement False.

pomt-04073	Says Rick Scott’s proposal for election reform "only mandates 48 hours of early voting."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2013/jan/22/pink-slip-rick/pink-slip-rick-rick-scotts-proposal-only-mandates-/	Activists behind Pink Slip Rick are not impressed with Gov. Rick Scott’s attempts to distance himself from the voting reforms he signed into law in 2011. Scott called on the Florida Legislature to consider three reforms to avoid hours-long waits that dogged early voting in some counties in 2012: add more sites for early voting aside from election offices, libraries and city halls; shorten the language of proposed constitutional amendments; and increase the maximum number of early voting days from eight to 14. Scott touted his proposal as giving Floridians "the greatest access to early voting ever in Florida history – at up to 168 hours." But @PinkSlipRick tweeted a strikingly different take on the announcement. "#PinkSlipRick’s proposal is so vague that it only mandates 48 hours of early voting," the tweet said. We wondered how Pink Slip Rick, which is organized by liberal group Florida Watch Action, could have a tally so much lower from the governor’s statement. Here’s the answer: Both sides are right. The 2011 elections law reduced the number of days for early voting from 14 to eight, with supervisors required to offer between six and 12 hours of early voting each day instead of simply eight hours. (Here’s a related check on that.) That meant local elections supervisors had the choice to offer between 48 hours and 96 hours of early voting over eight days. Still, most supervisors offered the maximum of 96 hours, according to an analysis by University of Florida political science professor Daniel Smith. At 54 hours, Hernando County was among counties offering the smallest amount of time to vote early. Scott is recommending a law that allows supervisors to offer between eight and 14 days of early voting and maintaining the six-to-12 hour window. So under Scott’s proposal, supervisors would be able to provide a maximum of 168 hours of early voting (14 days multiplied by 12 hours a day). The fewest number of hours they would be required to offer for is 48 (eight days multiplied by six hours). Scott’s proposal largely mirrors recommendations from the state supervisors of elections association. "Our ultimate goal must be to restore Floridians' confidence in our election system," Scott said in a statement. "We need more early voting days, which should include an option of the Sunday before Election Day." So both sides make an accurate remark about Scott’s plan, but they cherry-pick the extreme scenario to fit their interest. Florida Watch Action executive director Amy Ritter said Scott should have restored early voting the way it was before the 2011 election law, with a minimum of 96 hours. "Anything less than that is not a promise to restore or expand early voting," Ritter said. We surveyed several local supervisors for how they might implement Scott’s option. In Miami-Dade County, a spokeswoman said the county would likely resume the pre-2011 law system of offering 14 days with 8 hours each day and eight total hours on the weekend, with more room to offer more hours closer to a presidential election. In Hillsborough County, supervisor Craig Latimer said the county has always offered the maximum amount of hours for early voting, and he could see offering the hypothetical max of 168 hours in a presidential election. "There’s got to be relief for large counties," he said. In tiny Franklin County, home to just over 7,000 Panhandle voters, elections supervisor Ida C. Elliott said implementing the full monty of 168 hours would not be feasible, citing overtime costs for workers and a simple lack of need. But even she wouldn’t go to the minimum of 48 hours. "48? That’s a little too...not enough," she said. "That’s crazy. You’d have to do at least your whole working day, for sure." Our ruling Pink Slip Rick’s remark is accurate but leaves out part of the story. Scott’s proposal would mandate a minimum of 48 hours, but it would also let supervisors offer a maximum of 168 hours. Local supervisors would make the call, and the ones we spoke with said they would offer more than the bare minimum. Still, the group is right that 48 hours would be the mandated minimum. The statement is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Pink Slip Rick	None	None	None	2013-01-22T17:56:05	2013-01-17	['None']

abbc-00252	Prominent barrister Geoffrey Watson SC has criticised Australia's failure to establish a federal anti-corruption watchdog, telling ABC's RN Breakfast that it puts us "out of step with our international obligations".	in-between	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-28/fact-check-is-australia-in-breach-of-anti-corruption-obligations/8974742	Mr Watson's claim that Australia is in breach of its treaty obligations is debatable. But the convention allows nations to use whatever system best suits their particular circumstances, and their approaches can be wide and varied. In Australia's case, our "multi-agency" integrity system relies on a variety of state and Commonwealth bodies to investigate corruption in the public sector. Included among these agencies is the national watchdog for investigating Commonwealth public sector corruption — the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. Experts and advocates are divided on whether this system is sufficient for Australia to comply with its treaty obligations, the result of their different interpretations of the convention's requirements. Some argue that we will not be meeting our obligations until our system is made to be effective by being comprehensive. For the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity to meet this expectation, its funding would need to be increased and its jurisdiction expanded. Others say that simply by having federal law enforcement officials who are not subject to political interference could get Australia across the line. And while they argue that a single, national watchdog might be desirable, it may not be necessary for meeting our obligations. Most countries considered "cleaner" than Australia in terms of corruption do not have such a body.

pomt-13423	"Since 1978, California has spent $5 billion to put 13 people to death."	mostly false	/california/statements/2016/sep/21/tom-steyer/did-california-spend-5-billion-execute-13-people/	California billionaire and potential gubernatorial candidate Tom Steyer joined the debate over ending the state’s death penalty last week by repeating a questionable claim. "Since 1978, California has spent $5 billion to put 13 people to death," Steyer said in a press release announcing his support for Proposition 62. The measure would abolish capital punishment in the state. Proposition 66, a competing measure on November’s ballot, would keep the death penalty but proposes speeding up its appeals process. There’s no doubt California’s death penalty system is slow and expensive: But $5 billion to execute 13 people? We decided to fact-check that suspect claim. Our research There are more than 700 people on California’s death row, which the Yes on 62 campaign has correctly claimed is the largest death row in the Western Hemisphere. The state has paid incarceration and court costs for all of those inmates, not just the few that have been executed since California reinstated the death penalty in 1978. Steyer based his ‘$5 billion to execute 13 people’ claim on information from the Yes on 62 campaign, according to his spokesman. The campaign has made the death penalty’s high cost a central part of its argument for abolishing executions. The Yes campaign made the same claim as Steyer in a September 12 Facebook post. The Yes on 62 campaign posted this image on its Facebook page on Sept. 12, 2016. The Yes on 62 campaign made the same claim on Twitter on Sept. 16, 2016. It published a more accurate and nuanced statement on its website: "Since 1978, California taxpayers have paid $5 billion to maintain the death penalty and death row, and executed 13 people." The Yes on 62 campaign says it extrapolated the $5 billion estimate from a report by California’s Loyola Law School in 2011 that placed the cost of the state’s entire death penalty system at $4 billion. One of the report’s authors, Paula Mitchell, told PolitiFact California that the $5 billion figure is her updated estimate for how much state and federal taxpayers have spent on California’s entire death penalty system since 1978, not just on cases for the 13 people who have been executed. Mitchell said Steyer and the Yes on 62 campaign left out this key context in their claims. "I think the way to fairly characterize the expense is to say we’ve spent $5 billion on a system that has produced only 13 executions since 1978," said Mitchell, who heads Loyola’s Project for the Innocent and is an adjunct professor. Representatives for the No on 62 campaign rejected the claim by Steyer, noting costs are spread across "a much larger number of cases." They also called the $5 billion estimate in Mitchell’s report "a wildly inflated number." A guard stands watch over the east block of death row at San Quentin State Prison Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2016, in San Quentin, Calif. A pair of November ballot measures will decide the future of the death penalty in California. As of Aug. 1, 2016, there were 700 condemned inmates at the prison. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) Wildly inflated? We dug a bit deeper to examine whether Steyer not only wrongly attributed the entire cost of the death penalty system to 13 cases, but also used a "wildly inflated" cost estimate. Mitchell, who is an advocate for abolishing capital punishment, said she’s worked with the Yes on 62 campaign to discuss death penalty cost estimates. She said her estimates are derived from the cost of pre-trial investigations, trials, appeals and incarceration. Her report cites figures from the California Commission on the Fair Administration of Justice, among other sources. Frank Zimring, a law professor and death penalty expert at UC Berkeley, said he’s relied on the report in the past and finds the cost estimate credible, "give or take a hundred million or so." Cost comparison Mitchell’s said her current $5 billion cost estimate represents the amount taxpayers spent "above what it would have cost us" without the death penalty. Her report could not reach a conclusion, she said, on how much a life in prison system would have cost taxpayers over the same period. On average, it cost $47,000 per year to incarcerate a prison inmate in California during the 2008-2009 fiscal year, according to the Legislative Analyst’s Office. The cost to house a death row inmate, however, is $90,000 more per year than for an inmate in the general prison population, said Mitchell. She attributed the higher cost to lengthy and complex death row court cases. Death penalty court cases cost more than others, in part, because more attorneys are legally required to participate and more investigation is required. Costs also mount because death penalty appeals must be heard by the California Supreme Court, which has only seven justices. That creates a bottleneck, Mitchell said, where each case can stretch a decade or more. Without the death penalty, Zimring said the cost of trials and appeals would be "vastly less." Our ruling Tom Steyer said recently: "Since 1978, California has spent $5 billion to put 13 people to death." But that cost has been spread over hundreds of cases since 1978, not just the 13 that led to executions. California currently has more than 700 inmates on death row. Prosecuting and housing each costs the state significantly year after year. Steyer’s claim might have been correct if he had said taxpayers have spent $5 billion on a system that’s resulted in 13 executions. Instead, his words leave the impression California paid the entire $5 billion for a fraction of its hundreds of cases. We rate Steyer's claim Mostly False.

pomt-11708	"Alabama state police arrest 3 poll workers in Birmingham."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/19/american-revolution/no-alabama-poll-workers-were-not-arrested-us-senat/	Poll workers in Birmingham, Ala., allowed 3,000 invalid votes to benefit Democrat Doug Jones in his Senate race against Republican Roy Moore, according to a fake news article on Facebook. "Alabama State Police arrest 3 poll workers in Birmingham" stated a headline on the American Revolution website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. There is no truth to this article. We saw no disclaimer on the American Revolution website, but the same story was posted on reaganwasright, a website that identifies itself as satire and is a frequent purveyor of fake news. Jones beat Moore in the Alabama U.S. Senate special election Dec. 12. The Washington Post reported in November that Moore, while in his 30s, initiated sexual encounters with several teenagers, according to the women interviewed by the newspaper. There have been multiple fake news reports related to the election. This article on the American Revolution website contained no details explaining the supposedly fraudulent votes and contains some fictional details such as stating that Birmingham is in Applevale County -- it is located in Jefferson County. It stated that the three poll workers -- Wanda Werkmeister, Olivia Pertuiary and Maureen Brown -- will all face felony charges punishable by up to 10 years in prison and $1 million in fines. The article includes a quote by Fox News host Sean Hannity, but we found no evidence he said this: "Without that inner-city ghetto vote, Doug Jones doesn’t have a chance. It doesn’t make much sense why someone from the city’s vote is so much more important to Democrats, who swear they aren’t at all racist." The article stated that Hannity made those comments on Dana Loesch’s show Guns God and Grits. A Fox News spokeswoman told PolitiFact that Hannity did not make the statement and Loesch, who hosts a conservative radio show, told PolitiFact that she hadn’t had Hannity on her show in a few years and doesn’t have a show with that name. The American Revolution website linked to the Facebook page for Special News USA. We sent a message to Special News USA via Facebook and a person replied stating, "I do not know whether or not the news is correct or not, but I distributed it to get the feedback of other people." We found no news reports that poll workers were arrested in Birmingham. Robyn Bradley Bryan, Alabama Law Enforcement Agency spokeswoman, told PolitiFact that the agency did not arrest any poll workers. A spokesman for the Alabama Secretary of State, John Bennett, told PolitiFact that there were no poll workers with the names in the article. A headline stated "Alabama state police arrest 3 poll workers in Birmingham." There is no evidence that such a crime occurred. We rate this headline Pants on Fire.

pomt-00970	On counting state budget shortfalls	full flop	/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/13/scott-walker/did-scott-walker-flip-flip-budget-shortfall/	It’s a favorite talking point of Gov. Scott Walker, one he’s taking national as he charges up a potential presidential campaign: He inherited a $3.6 billion budget shortfall from Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, but dug out of it by cutting costs and limiting union bargaining power with state and local government. Walker even dropped the figure into his well-received January 2015 speech at an Iowa cattle call for 2016 Republican presidential hopefuls. So our eyebrows went up Feb. 6, 2015 when Walker was questioned about his stewardship of the state budget by Fox News anchor Bret Baier in a profile on the rising presidential hopes of the Wisconsin governor. During the interview, Baier said: "You talk about $2 billion in (tax) savings for individuals and businesses, but you also have a $2.2 billion budget shortfall in the coming two years." Walker immediately questioned the credibility of the $2.2 billion number and portrayed it as a media creation. "I would contend that’s based on numbers from some of the Wisconsin media outlets as if everybody who asked for anything got it," Walker said. "Even in your own household budget that never happens." Has Walker changed his view on the validity of these shortfall estimates now that he’s in the governor’s chair? This is another one for the Flip-O-Meter. Our standard disclaimer applies: The Flip-O-Meter is not designed to say whether any change in position is good policy or good politics. Rather, it strictly looks at whether a public official has been consistent in his or her stated views on a topic. Let’s go back to November 2010, shortly after his election to replace Doyle. Walker pounced on the numbers from a statutorily required report by the state Department of Administration that showed -- in combination with other debts -- Walker would inherit a $3.6 billion shortfall six months after taking office in January 2011. Time and again …. and again … Walker used that number to portray the state as broke, and to explain the cuts he proposed -- and which were ultimately made -- in public education funding and other programs. We, and other media outlets, examined the figure then and declared it credible, as far as it goes. As we’ve explained, it’s not a "deficit" number as Walker and others in Madison often call it. It’s a pre-budget estimate designed to illustrate the size of the shortfall or challenge the governor faces when putting together a budget. The shortfall figure includes all the requests from state departments, and also predictions of how much tax revenue the state will collect. Fast forward to the Fox interview. Walker said the report of a $2.2 billion shortfall heading into his budget was a media creation. But the fact is, it came from a report from his own budget shop in his Department of Administration. What’s more, tax cuts pushed by Walker and Republicans in the Legislature play into some of the challenge that faced budget-makers, as projected revenues have fallen short. But by far the biggest chunk of the $2.2 billion projection is -- as Walker alluded to on Fox -- the spending increases sought by state agencies. But that’s always been the case. That’s the purpose of the report -- to see how tax revenue projections are looking compared to what state agencies say they want and need. Nothing’s changed about the methodology behind the shortfall projections. The only thing that’s changed is Walker’s tune. He still talks up the 2010 figures as if describing a budget-balancing miracle, but now dismisses their 2014 version as a big nothing. This merits a Full Flop. ------ More on Scott Walker For profiles and stories on Scott Walker and 2016 presidential politics, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel's Scott Walker page.

pomt-02914	"Only 14 percent of Americans were able to keep these individual market plans for two years" before Obamacare became law.	half-true	/punditfact/statements/2013/nov/03/van-jones/amid-swarm-canceled-policies-van-jones-says-indivi/	Opponents of President Barack Obama’s health care law are quick to evoke the plight of potentially millions of Americans getting hit by cancellation notices from their health insurance companies due to new coverage requirements under the Affordable Care Act. All of a sudden, Republican critics sound like members of the consumer-first "party of Ralph Nader," quipped Van Jones, the Democratic co-host of CNN’s Crossfire, during a panel discussion on ABC’s This Week. "They're the biggest consumer protection operation in the world now, but six months ago we had people who were getting these same cancellation notices and the Republican Party was silent," he said. "There's a problem when you're indifferent to the losers the last time. I want to make one thing perfectly clear. You look at the numbers here. Fourteen percent, only 14 percent of Americans were able to keep these individual market plans for two years before." Is his figure about the volatile individual market accurate? First, understand that consumers who seek health insurance coverage on their own are not the norm in this country. Most people are covered by their employer or Medicaid or Medicare. Another 16 percent are uninsured. About 6 percent, or 15 million Americans, are in the individual marketplace, which will be the most affected by the new law. That was intentional. After the show, Jones told PunditFact that the individual marketplace is a "wild, wild west" where people were denied coverage for pre-existing conditions and policyholders were continually dropped by insurers offering thin, sketchy coverage. The people in this unstable market are a transient bunch, signing 12-month contracts with insurers as they move between jobs or lose coverage they once had. When their contract is up, the insurer can discontinue a policy or change it. If they end it, federal law says they have to give policyholders 90 days notice and the choice to sign up for different coverage. "Current policyholders are not having their current policy canceled – rather, the insurance company is exercising its option to discontinue the policy at the end of the contract year," according to Georgetown University’s Center on Health Insurance Reforms. And now, if healthcare.gov straightens out, they can purchase new coverage there. The health care law’s authors wanted to make sure people in the individual marketplace had access to the same standardized coverage as everyone else. As a result, new policies created after the health care law passed in March 2010 must cover "10 essential health benefits," such as preventive care, ambulatory service, and maternity and newborn care. Because many of these individual plans don’t offer that, and they weren’t eligible to be "grandfathered" under the new law, the insurers are shedding some of them. It’s a lot to take in, but it’s all part of the complicated before-and-after picture that Jones was trying to paint for viewers about the benefits of the much-maligned health care law. As for his stat that "only 14 percent of Americans were able to keep these individual market plans for two years" before the health care law, Jones told us he was a little off. He meant to say 17 percent, a reference to a finding in a 2004 study published in the journal Health Affairs that was recently highlighted in a Washington Post explainer about the policy cancellations. The study examined coverage patterns in the individual insurance marketplace from 1996-2000 -- quite some time ago. The key finding for our purposes is this: "Roughly one-sixth (17 percent) of those with individual insurance coverage retained it for more than two years." The reason? Not because of insurers canceling plans like Jones suggested. Though insurers do cancel coverage, the study determined that most of the volatility with enrollment and dropped policies had to do with policyholders moving between employer coverage, with a median enrollment length of eight months. The people who kept their insurance the longest were small business employees or self-employed, the study found. So Jones is close on the number. But Timothy Jost, a Washington and Lee law professor, says the number does not exactly mean what Jones said it does. Jones is saying it’s the fault of insurance companies that most people could not hold onto their coverage, but the reality is less known. It’s probably not accurate to pin it all on insurers canceling the plans, Jost said, though no one knows for sure how much of the churning has to do with insurers and people canceling their plan or choosing a new one. "He does have a point, but I wouldn’t have said it that way," Jost said. "It’s a market that has just not functioned very well. ... It’s long been the case that people just come and go from the market all the time." Other health policy experts found Jones’ remarks confusing. Yes, the market tends to be volatile due to high administrative costs and the inability to pool risk among healthy and sick patients like large employer plans, said Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. "Does he think Republicans should have complained about the volatility in the individual market before this? That only makes sense if they have a solution to the problem," she said. U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius referenced another 2004 study by the Kaiser Family Foundation in an online column meant to offer some calm around the cancellation notices for individual plans. The study said about 45 percent of policies remained after two years, a much higher estimate though its sample did not include short-term health insurance policies that are often bought to cover gaps of three to six months. Our ruling Jones said, "Only 14 percent of Americans were able to keep these individual market plans for two years" before Obamacare became law. He was trying to make the point that canceled policies have been the norm in the individual insurance market long before the Affordable Care Act. His figure is 3 percentage points off of a 2004 study that found only 17 percent of individual policyholders kept their plans for more than two years. More importantly, though, a health policy expert said Jones probably went too far in indicating that insurance companies were to blame for the high turnover. Many people enter that market for the purpose of buying short-term protection. That means people in the individual market might be dropping the health insurance plan they have as much as insurance companies might be canceling the plan altogether.

pomt-00430	"NASA says an asteroid bigger than a football pitch is heading towards Earth."	mostly false	/punditfact/statements/2018/aug/24/blog-posting/not-so-close-asteroid-headed-towards-earth-wont-hi/	Articles trending on social media are hinting at an out-of-this-world claim: that Earth is about to be decimated by an incoming asteroid. "NASA says an asteroid bigger than a football pitch is heading towards Earth," the Wakefield Express reported. The meaning of that sentence — aside from the term "football pitch," which is simply Britspeak for "soccer field" — seemed alarming to us. "Dubbed ‘2016 NF23’, the gargantuan lump of space rock has been labelled ‘potentially hazardous’ by (NASA)," the article continued. Uh-oh. We began to wonder if Earth was on a collision course with a giant asteroid. Turns out, the answer is no. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Close, but not that close The Center for Near Earth Object Studies at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory keeps a database that details all instances where objects in space have had a "close approach" to the Earth. The asteroid in question, 2016 NF23, is on that list. According to that database, the asteroid is predicted to be closest to the Earth on Aug. 29, 2018. It will be travelling at 20,000 miles per hour, or about 5 and a half miles per second. The database also says the asteroid is estimated to be 70 meters to 160 meters in diameter, or about 75 to 175 yards. That’s roughly the size of a soccer field. But there’s actually no reason to worry about 2016 NF23. That’s because even at its point of closest approach to the Earth, the asteroid will be more than 3 million miles away (or, a lot of soccer fields). That’s more than 13 times the distance between the Earth and its moon. "From an astronomical perspective, that may be close, but from a human perspective, it’s obviously not very close at all; the asteroid is certainly not ‘skimming’ past the Earth, as the story claims," said Paul Chados, the manager of the Center for Near Earth Object Studies, in an interview. He added, "In no way is our prediction a ‘warning,' as the story intimates." The Wakefield Express is also incorrect in saying that 2016 NF3 "has been labelled 'potentially hazardous'" by NASA. Alan Chamberlin, a senior engineer at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, told PolitiFact, "The object is not classified as a PHA (Potentially Hazardous Asteroid) as defined in our CNEOS website." That’s because the asteroid has too high of an absolute magnitude (a measurement for determining how bright asteroids appear) and is too small of an object to be considered a Potentially Hazardous Asteroid. Both Chados and Chamberlin suggested that the article was misleading and recommended that readers who are concerned about asteroids and other objects possibly striking the Earth look at NASA’s Sentry page. Unlike the close approach database, the Sentry page only lists asteroids "that have even the slightest chance of colliding with our planet over the next century or two," as Chados put it. The Wakefield Express did not respond to a request for comment sent to the editorial email listed on its Contact Us page. Our ruling A headline on the website Wakefield Express claimed that "NASA says an asteroid bigger than a football pitch is heading towards Earth." NASA has indeed confirmed a large asteroid is heading in the direction of Earth. But the asteroid will not actually do any damage to us. It will stay far, far, far away. In addition, the article says that NASA has labeled the asteroid ‘potentially hazardous.’ NASA has made no such designation. We rate this claim Mostly False.

pomt-14186	"As a former federal prosecutor, I prosecuted over 4,000 cases."	true	/missouri/statements/2016/apr/25/catherine-hanaway/federal-prosecutor-catherine-hanaway-and-her-offic/	At the March 17 Republican gubernatorial debate in Columbia, candidate Catherine Hanaway told an audience that she prosecuted more than 4,000 cases during her tenure as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri. Hanaway served as a federal prosecutor from July 20, 2005, through April 17, 2009, which means that she would have had to prosecute at least three cases a day on average to make that 4,000-case benchmark. That seemed like a lot of cases, so we looked at the record. Hanaway’s history in public life While many Missourians may know Hanaway as the first female speaker of the House in Missouri, she is also a decorated prosecutor who’s worked in both the private and public sectors. In 2005, Hanaway left her position as speaker after being appointed U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri by former President George W. Bush. In 2009, Hanaway resigned and joined the Ashcroft Law Firm, founded by former Missouri governor, senator and U.S. attorney general John Ashcroft. As a side note, in 2013, Missouri Lawyer’s Media listed Hanaway as the most expensive lawyer to hire in Missouri at a rate of upward to $793 an hour. Hanaway said at the time that most of the firm’s clients were large national and international companies, and "our rates are reflective of that." Hanaway joined Husch Blackwell’s St. Louis office in 2013. Her federal prosecution history Will Scharf, Hanaway’s policy director, said as a U.S. attorney, Hanaway was "directly responsible for federal prosecutions across half the state, signing every federal indictment initiating formal proceedings against criminals within the district, and supervising prosecutions as they progressed." It’s unclear how many of these cases she prosecuted personally. She oversaw a staff of more than 100 people, as Hanaway makes clear on her campaign website. According to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri’s online Case Management/Electronic Case Files system, which tracks criminal case filings for the court, Hanaway’s office filed at least 5,430 cases during her stint as a federal prosecutor. That doesn’t include cases inherited by Hanaway from her predecessors. So it could be argued that Hanaway actually dealt with even more than 5,430 cases. Scharf also noted in an email interview that Hanaway never claimed to be "lead counsel" or that she "tried 4,000 cases," and that the notion that she could physically be there to prosecute 4,000 cases "would be absurd, since 95 percent of criminal cases end in a guilty plea without a trial." That percentage of plea bargains is in line with a 2011 Bureau of Justice Statistics estimate. Our ruling Hanaway told an audience that she prosecuted over 4,000 cases during her time as the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Missouri. Based on federal data, Hanaway’s office dealt with well over 4,000 cases and each case required her personal signature. Her words might suggest that she handled each case herself, but most listeners would understand that she ran a large office. We rate this statement True.

pomt-00508	"Under the Affordable Care Act, anyone on Medicare who is admitted to a hospital for observation will be responsible for the bill. Medicare won't pay a cent."	pants on fire!	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jun/25/chain-email/chain-email-says-medicare-wont-pay-observational-s/	A reader recently sent us a chain email we hadn’t seen before. The lengthy missive, purportedly written by a "senior gentleman in Mesa, Arizona," details a visit to a hospital made contentious by Medicare payment rules. The anonymous author claims to have experienced "a medical situation that made it very clear that the ‘Affordable Care Act’ is neither affordable, nor do they care." The full email, which is lengthy, is accessible in its entirety here. But briefly, the author relates what happened after he sought treatment for a suspected urinary-tract infection. After collapsing in a local urgent-care clinic, he was taken to a hospital. There, the medical staff feared he could be experiencing sepsis, a potentially serious inflammation caused by an infection, so they ordered a battery of tests, including one that could take a day or two to complete. As a result, they told him that he would need to stay in the hospital "for observation" rather than going home. Here’s what happened next: "I said, ‘Doctor, correct me if I'm wrong, but if you admit me for observation, my Medicare will not pay anything. This is due to the Affordable Care Act.’ He said, ‘That's right, it won't.’ I then grabbed for my bag of clothing and said, ‘Then I'm going home.’ He said you're really too sick to be going home, but I understand your position. This health program is going to hit seniors especially hard." Then another doctor came into the room. "I said, ‘Doc, you and I both know that under the Affordable Care Act anyone on Medicare who is admitted to a hospital for observation will be responsible for the bill. Medicare won't pay a cent.’ At which point he nodded in affirmation. I said, ‘You will either admit me for a specific treatment or you won't admit me.’ Realizing he wasn't going to win this one, he said he would prepare my release papers." We zeroed in on the core claim of this story, that "under the Affordable Care Act, anyone on Medicare who is admitted to a hospital for observation will be responsible for the bill. Medicare won't pay a cent." When we looked into it, we found that Medicare does indeed have different reimbursement policies for patients who had been admitted to hospitals for observation as opposed to being admitted to treat a specific diagnosis. However, the email’s author (and, if his recounting is accurate, each of the medical professionals he spoke to) were sorely misinformed about how Medicare rules operate. The different reimbursement rates have to do with follow-up in-home care, not the original hospital stay. And crucially, the controversy over reimbursement for patients under "observation care" has nothing whatsoever to do with President Barack Obama’s health care law, the Affordable Care Act. What is ‘observation care’? According to Kaiser Health News, "hospitals provide observation care for patients who are not well enough to go home but not sick enough to be admitted. This care requires a doctor’s order and is considered an outpatient service, even though patients may stay as long as several days. The hospitalization can include short-term treatment and tests to help doctors decide whether the patient should be admitted." Because observation care is considered outpatient treatment, Medicare generally covers such visits, minus things like copayments and the cost of routine drugs. Where Medicare reimbursement significantly falls short is once an observation patient leaves the hospital. "Observation patients cannot receive Medicare coverage for follow-up care in a nursing home, even though their doctors recommend it," according to Kaiser. "To be eligible for nursing home coverage, seniors must have first spent at least three consecutive days (or through three midnights) as an admitted patient, not counting the day of discharge." In other words, assuming the email author’s story actually happened, he shouldn’t have had to worry about Medicare paying for his time in the hospital while under observation. Medicare would have paid, minus copayments and the like; there was no need for him to go home while in a fragile state just to avoid being responsible for the full cost of his care. Is this related to the Affordable Care Act? Tying this policy to Obama’s law is flat-out wrong. "The Affordable Care Act has nothing to do with observation status," said Mary T. (Terry) Berthelot, a senior attorney with the Center for Medicare Advocacy. Several other health-policy experts confirmed that. The policy was established by the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services, a division of the Department of Health and Human Services. While we’re at it, we’ll take a moment to debunk an additional Affordable Care Act-related claim included in the email. The author writes that during a visit to his family practitioner, "I told him that I had heard that the Affordable Care Act would no longer pay for cancer treatment for those 76 and older, is that true? His understanding is that it is true." In reality, there are no such age limits. In October 2014, we rated Pants on Fire a chain email that claimed that under the Affordable Care Act, "at age 76 when you most need it most, you are not eligible for cancer treatment. … Cancer hospital will ration care according to the patient's age." Our ruling The chain email said that "under the Affordable Care Act, anyone on Medicare who is admitted to a hospital for observation will be responsible for the bill. Medicare won't pay a cent." That’s wrong. Medicare will cover the hospital stay, minus standard copayments and the like. Patients kept in the hospital under observation will not be able to receive Medicare reimbursements for follow-up care such as nursing-home stays, however. Even more inaccurate is the charge that this policy stemmed from the Affordable Care Act. In reality, this stems from a separate policy decision and had nothing to do with Obama’s law. The claim is not only ridiculous but also dangerous, by urging ailing patients to leave the hospital for no good reason. This claim rates Pants on Fire.

pomt-01547	Says "Nick Rahall voted with Obama 94 percent of the time."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/sep/15/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-nick-rahall-voted-barack-obama-94-time/	One of the biggest obstacles to a strong Democratic showing in the 2014 midterm elections is that approval ratings for President Barack Obama are mired in the 40 percent range -- and even lower in many red states. Because of this, it’s no surprise that the National Republican Congressional Committee -- the House Republicans’ campaign arm -- is creating ads that emphasize the degree to which vulnerable Democratic incumbents have voted with Obama. We recently found two NRCC ads using virtually identical language on this point. Here, we’ll fact-check an ad that targets Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall of West Virginia. In a separate item, we’ll fact-check an ad attacking Democratic Rep. John Barrow of Georgia. Rahall, first elected in 1976, represents a district that gave Republican Mitt Romney a whopping 32-point margin of victory over Obama in the 2012 presidential election. It ranks as the second-most Republican district currently represented by a Democrat in the House, making it a prime takeover opportunity for the GOP. (The most Republican district held by a Democrat is the Utah seat occupied by retiring Rep. Jim Matheson.) Rahall faces state Sen. Evan Jenkins in November, in a race analysts say is one of the most vulnerable seats held by the Democrats. The ad against Rahall features a constituent, Carrie Overby of Huntington, W.Va. She says, "On the issues that have mattered, Nick Rahall has voted with Barack Obama, whether it's spending, cap-and-trade, EPA regulations, Obamacare." When she says that, text on the screen says, "Nick Rahall voted with Obama 94 percent of the time." In much smaller type, the ad footnotes this claim to "Congressional Quarterly 2009 vote analysis." Since data from 2009 would now be five years old, we had a hunch that the NRCC might have ignored a couple of years with lower percentages. It turns out we were right. Data from the same CQ study shows that Rahall voted with Obama 88 percent of the time in 2010, 65 percent in 2011, 64 percent in 2012 and 58 percent in 2013. (Data for 2014 has not yet been posted.) That’s not as low as Barrow, who was targeted in the companion ad; Barrow’s score dropped as low as 28 percent in 2012. Still, it shows a degree of voting independence by Rahall that’s not reflected in the NRCC ad. Clearly, the 94 percent figure for voting with Obama was a more attractive one for the NRCC to highlight, but it amounts to cherry-picking. Asked to justify using the five-year-old data and ignoring later figures, NRCC spokesman Ian Prior said, "It is important for West Virginia voters to know that in 2009, when the Democrats controlled all the levers of government and could push legislation through both chambers of Congress, Nick Rahall voted with Barack Obama 94 percent of the time, including on Obama’s budget, which included a cap-and-trade plan and a $3 billion, 37 percent EPA funding increase to advance his climate agenda." Our ruling The NRCC ad said, "Nick Rahall voted with Obama 94 percent of the time." Rahall did indeed vote with Obama 94 percent of the time -- but that was in 2009, a fact that is footnoted in the ad, albeit in small type. Between 2010 and 2013, Rahall’s voting record was less closely aligned with Obama, bottoming out at 58 percent in 2013, the most recent year for which data is available. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True.

pomt-02378	Says President Barack Obama’s approval rating "gained 3 points in the last couple months."	mostly true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2014/mar/16/dan-pfeiffer/dan-pfeiffer-says-obamas-approval-rating-recent-mo/	Here’s a smattering of headlines from the last week on President Barack Obama’s polling numbers: Time: "Poll: Obama’s Approval Rating Sinks To New Low." Politico: "Poll: Obama approval at record low." Wall Street Journal: "WSJ/NBC News Poll: Obama's Approval Rating Hits New Low." Des Moines Register: "Obama job approval hits record low." So you can imagine our surprise when White House adviser Dan Pfeiffer claimed Obama’s numbers are actually up during an interview with Meet the Press host David Gregory. Here’s the exchange. Gregory: "We had a big poll out, Wall Street Journal/NBC News, this week. Here’s what it found. Overall job approval for the president: 41 percent. Handling the economy: 41 percent. Same number when it came to foreign policy. And here’s what’s striking: Approval is 74 percent among Democrats. Sounds high, but it’s the lowest that the president’s had. ... The president has really slipped." Pfeiffer: "Public polls are a little bit all over the map. On the same day your poll came out, another poll came out that showed the president gaining 6 points in the last couple months. I’ve looked at a lot of data and let me tell you what we see. There’s no question that everyone in Washington, the president included, took a big hit from the double whammy of a shutdown and the problems of healthcare.gov. We have stabilized and we’re working our way back. If you look at the aggregate of public polling, we’ve gained 3 points in the last couple months." We checked in with the White House to see where Pfeiffer got his numbers. A spokesman pointed us to Real Clear Politics, a political website that aggregates polling data and calculates an average. Obama’s job approval has been underwater for some time. Since May of last year, more Americans polled expressed disapproval in Obama’s job performance than approval. The gap has widened considerably since then. While the Wall Street Journal/NBC poll released this week has Obama hitting a new low with an approval rating of 41 percent, the White House noted the Real Clear Politics average had Obama bottom out in December with an approval rating of 39.8 percent. That came on Dec. 3 after several weeks of bad headlines about healthcare.gov’s botched rollout. On March 17, Obama’s aggregate poll numbers put his approval rating at 42.9 percent. That accounts for the 3-point jump that Pfeiffer claimed. The recent "surge" in the average seems to be skewed largely by two outlier polls conducted by Rasmussen Reports and Bloomberg. In a survey from March 13-15, Rasmussen Reports said 49 percent of Americans approve of Obama, while 50 percent disapprove, a statistical dead heat. Bloomberg between March 7-10 found an even split among those surveyed -- 48 percent both approved and disapproved of Obama. That’s a six-point improvement from December, when Bloomberg put his approval rating at 42 percent. The remainder of the polls included in the Real Clear Politics average showed Obama’s net approval rating ranging from -8 (Public Policy Polling) to -16 (Fox News) percentage points. John McIntyre with Real Clear Politics said the average from Dec. 3 likely included six or more polls taken between mid to late November as well as daily tracking polls, but it's possible they weren't from the same pollsters as the current average (at press time McIntyre was looking into which polls were used and we'll update the post when he gets back to us). He added that a quick look at the numbers showed, based on Real Clear Politics' average, Pfeiffer was right, though he noted that the December average captured a weird time period as some polls shut down around the Thanksgiving holiday. Other poll aggregation methods, meanwhile, show much more modest gains by the president. Huffington Post, for example, tracks 88 polls and takes a snapshot of the daily tracking polls from Gallup and Rasmussen every three days. According to their model, Obama’s aggregate approval rating was 42.5 percent on Dec. 2 (his low point) and has jumped just a bit to 43.3 percent. That’s less than 1 percentage point, a considerably smaller improvement than Real Clear Politics’ average. Charles Franklin, co-founder of pollster.com (which the Huffington Post now owns) and director of the Marquette Law School Poll in Milwaukee, walked us through his own aggregation of Obama’s poll numbers. According to Franklin, Obama’s low point came Dec. 2 when he registered an approval rating of 41.98 percent. He currently estimates the number at 44.38, a gain of about 2.4 percentage points. So all three poll averages show Obama’s low point actually came in early December, but his bounceback varies depending on the methodology. "There are various ways of ‘averaging’ or aggregating polls to estimate trends," Franklin said. "My bottom line: There has been some gain though it appears to be not as large as 3 points when using all available polls and a standard trend estimate. There may be a specific pollster you could find that has shown a 3 point gain, but that is cherry picking the one with a larger gain, rather than using all the polls as I and HuffPost do." Our ruling When asked about Obama’s approval rating, Pfeiffer said, "We’ve gained 3 points in the last couple months." He’s right that the aggregate of polling data suggests that Obama’s low point was December, not early March, as the new WSJ/NBC poll said. But there’s some variation in how big of a rebound Obama’s approval rating has seen. While Real Clear Politics says its 3 percent (buoyed by two outliers), Huffington Post put it at less than a percentage point. Franklin said it was somewhere in between those two. Pfeiffer’s correct that the president’s poll numbers are up slightly over the past few months. But they remain low (and underwater), and the gains depend on how you run the numbers. We rate Pfeiffer’s claim Mostly True. Correction: Charles Franklin said President Barack Obama's aggregate approval rating bottomed out at 41.98 percent in December 2013. An earlier version of this fact-check included a different figure.	None	Dan Pfeiffer	None	None	None	2014-03-16T17:39:52	2014-03-16	['None']

pomt-03711	"Gov. Scott Walker (is) more than halfway to (his) 250,000 jobs goal."	pants on fire!	/wisconsin/statements/2013/apr/17/maciver-institute/maciver-institute-says-wisconsin-gov-scott-walker-/	Gov. Scott Walker promised to create 250,000 private sector jobs by the end of his four-year term. With less than two years remaining, the governor’s opponents -- and supporters -- are paying increased attention to the count. That’s why an item posted April 9, 2013 by the MacIver Institute caught our attention. The Madison-based group, which publishes items supportive of conservative causes -- items that are often then cited by other conservatives -- included this headline: "Gov. Scott Walker more than halfway to 250,000 jobs goal." That’s a much larger number of jobs created under Walker than we’ve ever heard -- even from the governor himself. In December 2012, Walker said the state had created "just under 100,000 jobs" since he took office. We rated that statement Pants on Fire. Why? Walker had combined full and partial year data sets from the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages compiled by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. His staff explained that he was using a "raw number." But state experts and the governor’s own staff have long said that while the quarterly census is more accurate than monthly measures, the census data should only be viewed in one-year blocks. That is, January to January, or July to July. In other words, you can’t combine partial years of census data with full years to create a running total, due to major seasonal fluctuations in the workforce. Here is what Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie told us when we asked about job numbers in the summer of 2012: "Please don’t, as John Koskinen, an economist at DOR would say, compare February temperatures to July." When we asked MacIver to show us their math, spokesman Nick Novak responded: "We used Bureau of Labor Statistics QCEW figures for each month from January 2011 to September 2012 (the most recent month available). To get to the number of 137,372, we simply subtracted the January 2011 jobs number from the September 2012 jobs number." Novak provided a link to a BLS report that showed the two numbers. But, this isn’t just a simple math problem. MacIver made two critical errors in their calculations. Starting point Walker took office at the beginning of January 2011. MacIver used the number for the end of January 2011. To properly measure the governor’s promise, you need to start with the number of jobs that existed at the start of his term. That is a difference of 65,401 jobs. Here’s how it plays out the way the MacIver Institute calculated the numbers. January 2011 census number: 2,205,584 September 2012 census number: 2,342,956 Increase: 137,372. Here’s how it plays out with the December 2010 number. December 2010 census number: 2,270,985 September 2012 census number: 2,342,956 Increase: 71,971 In summary: MacIver’s math nearly doubles Walker job count because it started counting one month later. In effect, they used a lower starting point, which makes the growth seem larger -- by 65,401 -- than it really is. And even that is a bad number. Apples to oranges There’s a second, more important -- and more familiar -- problem. Like Walker in December, MacIver failed to line up a year-to-year comparison. It measured February temperatures against July. What’s more, the item itself notes that Koskinen, the state economist, told them they should not combine the data sets in this manner: While Koskinen called the numbers "literally true" the article goes on to note: "Koskinen said economists typically use the same month from different years to avoid seasonal variations in employment." Asked about this, Novak said: "In the article we account for the fact that this is not seasonally adjusted and that the chief economist from the Department of Revenue is wary of using data from different months when comparing data year over year." But they didn’t apply any such disclaimer to their headline, or a very large graphic. The claim was retweeted by Madison-based conservative talk show host Vicki McKenna to her 7,114 followers and Milwaukee talker Charlie Sykes posted it on his Right Wisconsin subscription-based website. PolitiFact Wisconsin follows Walker’s jobs promise using the Walk-O-Meter, using a method created with guidance from both state and academic economists, including Koskinen. We combine full year census reports with less accurate monthly employment survey results, and show the results in a monthly graphic. Once full-year information becomes available, it is added in to get an ever-stronger number. As of February 2013, our latest estimate of the number of jobs created since Walker took office is 63,700. Our rating The MacIver Institute posted an item that says Wisconsin has 137,372 more private sector jobs than when Gov. Scott Walker first took office, meaning that Walker is more than halfway to his goal of 250,000 jobs. The jobs promise will be the No. 1 yardstick used to measure Walker’s performance as governor. But the conservative group’s number is wrong, two times over. MacIver started with the wrong month of data. That alone nearly doubled the number of jobs they claim were created under Walker. They compounded their error by combining full and partial years of data -- even though they (like the governor himself) were told not to do so. Pants on Fire.

pomt-02346	"Our state economic development agency under Walker, WEDC, actually isn’t even using the funds that are appropriated to it."	mostly true	/wisconsin/statements/2014/mar/23/mary-burke/mark-burke-says-wisconsins-job-agency-has-unspent-/	In 2011, Gov. Scott Walker led the transformation of the state Commerce Department into the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. The creation of a quasi-private agency was meant to spearhead job creation. After a rocky start, including staffing turmoil and a scathing audit in 2013 , WEDC executives say the agency is finally on solid ground. Walker’s Democratic challenger, Mary Burke, thinks otherwise. "Our state economic development agency under Walker, WEDC, actually isn’t even using the funds that are appropriated to it," she said in a Jan. 21, 2014 video interview with the Appleton Post Crescent. The claim caught our attention because Walker is less than half way to meeting his promise to create 250,000 private-sector jobs by the end of his four-year term. Is Burke right that the agency has not even spent the money it has been given to boost job creation? When we asked Burke for backup to the claim, campaign spokesman Joe Zepecki cited news stories and a Jan. 8, 2014 report from the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau about the state of WEDC finances. That report was prepared as WEDC asked the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee to release the second year of the agency’s two year budget. WEDC leaders were ordered to appear before the committee so lawmakers could hear a progress report and get a detailed look at agency finances. The report said WEDC had a "surplus" of about about $18 million. That’s for an agency that has 90 employees with a budget of about $95 million. The agency also is allowed to issue employers some $300 million in economic incentives in the form of tax cuts. Not surprisingly, leaders of the agency viewed their performance differently. They say a good part of the the surplus stems from the switchover from the old Commerce Department. They also say the agency is track to spend all of it’s budget for the current fiscal year, which ends June 30, 2015. Burke’s claim is a "bumper sticker about a pretty complicated topic," said WEDC deputy secretary Ryan Murray. The surplus WEDC ended its last fiscal year, which closed in June 2013, with a surplus of $34 million. About $14 million of that was money that "carried over" from the old Commerce Department. The largest chunk -- $30 million -- was due to low demand for loans from the agency. In short, WEDC had expected to lend out $30 million more than was sought by businesses planning to relocate or expand in Wisconsin. The lower demand for loans came from the weak economic recovery, and also the rocky transition to the new agency, Murray said. The agency’s board took two actions to deal with this surplus. First, it created a new policy -- one overlooked when the agency was created in 2011 -- that creates a reserve fund of between 15 to 25 percent of the agency’s budget. The fund gives the agency greater flexibility to handle unexpected events, such as loans offered during propane shortages this winter. The reserve fund was set at $16 million for the current fiscal year. Secondly, WEDC sought for and received funding for the current fiscal year that was $18 million less than the agency’s original request. That action happened in January 2014, after WEDC executives were ordered to appear before the committee. In the end, the panel voted to provide $44.7 million in new taxpayer money for WEDC through June 2015. Spending pace Murray and WEDC spokesman Mark Maley also noted that the agency is on pace to spend its entire appropriation for the current fiscal year. The organization’s total appropriation for the fiscal year ending in June -- including programs, loans and operating expenditures -- is $95.2 million. Through the first six months of the fiscal year, WEDC has spent, made commitments or signed contracts totaling $53.4 million -- 56 percent of the total appropriation, Maley said in an email. That’s a good point. But, of course, it’s not what Burke was talking about. She was criticizing the $18 million surplus -- the amount that was left even after the creation of the reserve fund -- even though she spoke in the present tense. Our rating Burke says that Walker’s jobs agency "isn’t using the funds appropriated to it." She referred to WEDC’s well-documented surplus. No one disagrees about the amount, how it came about or what was done in response to it. Officials note the current budget is on track to be spent in its entirety. We rate Burke’s claim Mostly True.

pomt-12142	There are"thousands of Georgia workers that are misclassified as independent contractors," who lose benefits, including health care.	mostly true	/georgia/statements/2017/aug/10/stacey-evans/are-georgia-firms-cheating-1000s-workers-out-healt/	With health care policy in limbo in Washington, the politicians who would like to be Georgia’s next governor are staking out their own policy outlines. Democratic State Rep. Stacey Evans favors expanding Medicaid, but said the state could take other action as well. "There are thousands of Georgia workers that are misclassified as independent contractors, so that their employers can wrongfully deny them the benefits that they deserve, including health care," Evans said Aug. 5. "By expanding Medicaid and classifying workers appropriately, insurance will be available to hundreds of thousands more Georgians." We decided to check Evans’ number of misclassified workers, and found she’s on safe ground. Defining misclassification Some businesses avoid treating workers as employees by calling them an independent contractor. The person might work only for that one business, use equipment the business provides and do exactly what the business tells him or her to do, and yet be labeled as if the person was in business for themselves. The advantage for companies is they avoid paying a number of employment taxes, including Medicare, Social Security and unemployment insurance. If they offer health insurance, they would sidestep that too. As Georgia’s Department of Labor put it, "independent contractors are not independent just because that is what their employer calls them, because that is what they call themselves, or because they sign an ‘independent contractor agreement.’ Independent contractor status depends on the underlying nature of the work relationship." In a recent case, a state administrative judge ruled that a man who drove for a Georgia limousine service was actually an employee and not an independent contractor, as the company (and the state Department of Labor) claimed. The company had required the man to set up his own limited liability corporation, but the ruling said that made no difference. The driver used a company car, and he was "given direction as to where to drive, when to drive, how to drive, how often to drive, and the rates to charge customers." The judge called this an "extreme" case of misclassification. The number in Georgia Evans’ campaign spokesman Seth Clark said she relied on a 2015 Georgia Senate study. That report said an accurate estimate was difficult to make because the state had never done a complete study, as other states have done. However, the state Department of Labor reported that its inspectors had found "over 4,000 misclassified employees," across about 1,700 businesses in 2014. When we asked, the state Department of Labor sent us more recent data. In 2015, it found about 1,500 misclassified workers at 1,800 firms, and in 2016, the number was about 3,000 out of 2,400 firms audited. Complaints by workers and random selection by inspectors trigger audits. The data show that most audits lead to the discovery of a misclassified worker. The department told us that currently, it lists nearly 235,000 employers. The review of about 2,400 represents a small fraction, about 1 percent. The Senate report said the department lacked the resources and manpower to "effectively audit and investigate potential violators." The Senate report listed other state studies. By and large, the more effort a state put into an investigation, the more it found. Minnesota estimated that about 14 percent of employers misclassified workers. Michigan found about 8 percent. A Maryland audit uncovered an average of 20 percent of employers misclassifying employees. In contrast, Nevada relied on records accumulated in the ordinary course of business and reported that while about 12 percent of complaints involved a claim of misclassification, the fraction of audits that found this problem was 2.7 percent. At the national level, the most recent numbers come from the Government Accountability Office. Its review of IRS data from 2008-10 found that worker classification problems represented 20 percent, or over 3 million cases, of noncompliance issues. It’s important to note that simply being classified as an employee is no guarantee of health coverage. Companies with fewer than 51 employees face no penalty if they fail to offer insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Our ruling Evans said that thousands of Georgia workers are misclassified as independent contractors and as a result, lose out on benefits, including health insurance. A state Senate study said there is no solid estimate of the number of misclassified workers, but state investigators had found between 1,500 and 4,000 instances in each of the past three years, or an average of 2,800 per year. That is based on a review of about 1 percent of businesses and most reviews reveal a misclassified worker. States that have conducted more systematic studies found misclassification rates in the range of 10 to 20 percent. The 2,800 average likely misses many instances and it’s a relatively small number, but it’s enough to support Evans’ statement. The connection to health care is less clear, because many small employers don’t offer health insurance, nor are they required to. But Evans was careful to include health care as one of several benefits, and her claim doesn’t hinge on that element. With that caveat, we rate this claim Mostly True.

mpws-00035	Gov. Mark Dayton gave a late-season State of the State address this week. In it, he highlighted some of the bright spots in Minnesota’s economic, education and health outlook as evidence that changes made during his tenure are making the state better. PoliGraph looked at three of those statements this week. “There are more than 2.8 million jobs in Minnesota today. More jobs than ever before in our state’s history. 150,000 more jobs than when I became governor.” Using seasonally adjusted Department of Employment and Economic Development data going back to 1990, Dayton’s claim checks out: There are roughly 2.81 jobs in Minnesota today, and that’s more than the state has seen in recent history. It’s also true that there are about 151,000 more jobs today than when Dayton took office in January 2011. Of course, it’s important to put these numbers in context. The nation as a whole has been recovering from the recession for several years now. According to DEED, Minnesota went into the recession earlier than the nation and came out of it a bit earlier, too. Since then, the state’s growth has essentially tracked the nation’s growth. “Our graduation rate, nearly 80 percent, is the highest in a decade.” According to data from the Department of Education, 79.5 percent of seniors graduated in 2013 up from about 77 percent the year before “This increase is twice the yearly increase seen over the past three years, showing acceleration in progress for Minnesota seniors,” the education department said when it released the numbers. Minnesota’s graduation rate is among the highest in the nation. In fact, graduation rates everywhere are on the rise, particularly among Hispanic and African American kids. However, when it comes to graduating lower income kids, Minnesota’s rate is on the low side compared to other states – about 58 percent, according to a report from the U.S. Department of Education. “We have the fifth lowest percentage of citizens without health insurance coverage.” 	accurate	https://blogs.mprnews.org/capitol-view/2014/05/poligraph-dayton-claims-about-economy-education-accurate/	None	None	None	Catharine Richert	None	PoliGraph: Dayton claims about economy, education accurate	May 2, 2014, 2:20 PM	None	['Minnesota', 'Massachusetts', 'Washington,_D.C.', 'Connecticut', 'Mark_Dayton', 'African_American', 'Vermont']
pomt-04731	Says Connie Mack IV co-sponsored a bill to "take a third of the Social Security Trust Fund ... give it in individual accounts to the senior citizens, who then were to invest it in the stock market."	false	/florida/statements/2012/aug/30/bill-nelson/bill-nelson-said-connie-macks-wants-take-social-se/	We’ve heard plenty about U.S. House budget chairman and vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan’s plans for Medicare lately, but what about his efforts to reform Social Security? U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson would sure like to discuss it -- and tie his opponent, Rep. Connie Mack IV to Ryan’s largely unpopular past plans for the program. "My opponent co-sponsored a bill with none other than congressman Paul Ryan, a bill to privatize Social Security," Nelson said. "Specifically what they did was they were going take a third of the Social Security Trust Fund, they were going to give it in individual accounts to the senior citizens who then were to invest it in the stock market." Never mind for a moment the claim that the GOP wants to privatize Social Security -- we’ve found that particular Democratic condemnation of personal savings accounts to be Mostly False, since they would be voluntary. Let’s delve into the specifics Nelson is citing, and find out how clear he is on the whole Republican plan. A taxing analysis Although Mack wasn’t mentioned by name, Nelson’s office told us the senator was referring to Ryan’s Social Security Personal Savings Guarantee and Prosperity Act of 2005, which was co-sponsored by Mack and 12 others. The proposal, which never became law, aimed to reform Social Security by allowing workers to divert some of their contributions away from the traditional Social Security program and into personal savings accounts. (Ryan has proposed several versions of this plan over the years.) That’s enough for Nelson to try to fire up his liberal base, but the specifics of his claim are off base. Nelson said this would rob the trust fund, which is funded through payroll taxes. But that fund was never going to have money taken directly from it, nor was the fund going to be abolished. The Ryan plans called for the fund to be compensated with general tax revenue in order to maintain benefit levels for people who stayed in the traditional system. We should note that the plan Mack co-sponsored would have allowed people to divert half their payroll taxes, not a third as Nelson said. An age-old debate More critically, Nelson said the Ryan-Mack plan would have senior citizens invest payroll taxes in the stock market. This gives the wrong idea about who would be affected. Every plan advanced by Ryan has stated the changes in the system would only affect workers younger than 55, with no changes in Social Security for workers and retirees older than that. No one older than 55 would even be eligible for the personal savings accounts, let alone be given an account to invest on their own. Among younger workers who chose to invest in the accounts, government oversight of the accounts would not allow them to invest on their own. The Social Security Administration would have ensured future retirees with those accounts would receive at least the equivalent in payouts as the traditional system, if not more so, if the investments had a higher rate of return. If the accounts fell short due to losses from the stock market, general revenue tax money was slated to cover the difference, which was a source of criticism after the Great Recession savaged investments in 2008. The accounts are no longer part of Ryan’s budget resolutions, the most recent of which passed the Republican-led House but not the Democratic Senate. The ruling Nelson said that Mack "co-sponsored a bill with none other than congressman Paul Ryan, a bill to privatize Social Security. Specifically what they did was they were going to take a third of the Social Security Trust Fund, they were going to give it in individual accounts to the senior citizens who then were to invest it in the stock market." There are few things wrong with this. The 2005 proposal Mack co-sponsored allowed one-half of payroll taxes to be used, not a third. Payroll taxes do replenish the Social Security Trust Fund, but the money to fund personal savings accounts would have been replaced with general revenue taxes to pay out traditional benefits.The trust fund would have remained balanced, with fewer people entering the system by using personal accounts instead. Redirecting one third of payroll taxes from the trust fund does not constitute removing one third of the total trust fund, in any case. Those accounts also wouldn’t have gone to senior citizens, as Nelson alleges, because no one over the age of 55 would have been eligible for the accounts in the first place. Every version of Ryan’s plan maintains this age limit. Nelson had a point that Mack has supported Ryan’s plans for private or personal accounts in the Social Security program. But his comments gave the wrong impression to a roomful of seniors that it would have affected them. A constant in Ryan’s budget proposals is the exclusion of senior citizens to any changes in the current system. We rate this statement False.

pomt-03000	Chris Christie "cut equal pay for women, calling it 'senseless bureaucracy.' "	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/oct/17/debbie-wasserman-schultz/dnc-says-chris-christie-cut-equal-pay-wome/	New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie seems poised for easy re-election this November, one step on a path toward a possible 2016 presidential campaign. As Christie becomes a more prominent figure in the Republican Party, he’s subject to more criticism on the national level. U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., who oversees the Democratic National Committee, wrote a statement attacking Christie after a gubernatorial debate that gave us a taste of what we might hear more of over the next two years. For this fact-check, PolitiFact decided to hone in on her critique of the governor’s wage policy. "He cut equal pay for women, calling it ‘senseless bureaucracy,' " Wasserman said. ‘Senseless bureaucracy’ The New Jersey state legislature passed a package of four bills in September 2012 designed to narrow the pay gap. Christie signed one, gave conditional vetoes to two and an absolute veto to the other. Here’s a breakdown of each bill in the package and Christie’s actions: A-2647: Christie signed a statewide requirement for employers to notify employees of the right to be free from benefits and pay discrimination. A-2648: This bill was designed to extend protections for employees who reveal discriminatory actions in their workplaces. Christie vetoed this bill conditionally, because he wanted it to fall under a different existing law than what was proposed by legislators. The bill became law in August, after Christie’s changes were made. A-2649: Christie gave this bill an absolute veto. It called for government contractors to report employee gender and compensation information to the NJ Department of Labor. A-2650: This bill would grant back pay to victims of pay gap discrimination. Christie gave this a conditional veto because it didn’t specify a limitation for how far back pay could go. It hasn’t been passed. Assembly Bill A-2649, the bill requiring government contractors to report compensation by gender and the only absolute veto of the bunch, is the one Wasserman Schultz referred to in her critique of Christie’s attitude toward discrimination by gender. That’s the bill Christie described as "senseless bureaucracy." In his veto message, he wrote that the bill "will burden countless employers with onerous reporting requirements, thereby driving up the cost of public contracts, which are ultimately shouldered by the taxpayer ... the reporting requirements fail to advocate sound policy over senseless bureaucracy." The bill’s focus is on transparency surrounding pay, but it would not have directly required changes in salary by gender. Yasemin Besen-Cassino, a Montclair State University sociology professor, conducted research on New Jersey’s gender gap with the American Association of University Women. She said the bill Christie vetoed would’ve helped narrow the wage divide. "A lot of women claim they just don’t know how much men make," Besen-Cassino said. "One of the things that we found in our research was that making it public and at least available to a third party would push corporations toward equal pay." There’s a correlation between a greater level of pay equity in the federal government and also a greater level of transparency, an AAUW report said. New Mexico passed legislation a couple of years ago requiring contractors to report pay equity information. Fatima Goss Graves, National Women’s Law Center vice president for education and employment, said the law has proven to be uncontroversial there. Vermont also has a similar law. We should note that although Christie vetoed that bill and issued conditional vetoes for others, he has not abolished any existing equal pay legislation, as a reader might assume from the wording of Wasserman Schultz’s comment. "The governor has never ‘cut’ equal pay and he has a well-documented public position of supporting the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act (a national law) and equal pay for equal work," said Kevin Roberts, a campaign spokesman for Christie. Christie touted the importance of A-2647 and asserted his support for equal pay. "Too often, women's value and contributions in the workplace have been undermined and shortchanged merely because of their gender," he said after signing the bill. Equal pay in New Jersey We wanted to take a look at the issue of equal pay in New Jersey on a broader scale and the implication that equal pay rights have not moved forward under Christie’s leadership. The median pay gap suggests that a woman in the Garden State make 77 cents for every dollar a man makes. However, it’s important to remember that this number doesn’t control for factors like number of hours worked, occupation and race. The AAUW reports that one-third of the pay gap remains after these factors are controlled for. The national wage gap has not closed in the past decade, said Goss Graves of the National Women’s Law Center. New Jersey’s divide falls in the middle of the pack in terms of biggest wage differences, she added. "I think that for Jersey, like the rest of the country, this problem has been pernicious and persistent and it’s clear that we can’t just wish it away," said Lisa Maatz, American Association of University Women vice president of government relations. "We need some kind of legislative response." Our ruling Wasserman Schultz said Christie "cut equal pay for women, calling it a ‘senseless bureaucracy.’ " Christie didn't cut anyone's pay, though. Instead, he said it was "senseless bureaucracy" to require government contractors to report more employee information, including information about gender and compensation, and he vetoed a measure that would have mandated such reporting. Experts said the measure would have improved equal pay for women. But Christie also signed two other bills that may help narrow the wage gap in New Jersey. So we rate Wasserman Schultz’s statement Mostly False.	None	Debbie Wasserman Schultz	None	None	None	2013-10-17T12:07:51	2013-10-08	['None']

pomt-11120	Says Wisconsin ‘could compel’ Foxconn to install solar panels that would power 33,000 homes.	mostly false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/jun/06/tony-evers/can-state-force-foxconn-install-solar-panels-publi/	Saying Wisconsin made a "bad deal" to bring Foxconn to the state, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tony Evers argues Wisconsin should force the company to be the best corporate citizens in the state. He suggested the state put Foxconn’s "feet to the fire" to make the company provide high wages and benefits, as well as transportation for workers who do not live close to the Racine County plant. Then Evers took it one step further. "We could compel Foxconn to put solar panels on the roof, and there'd be enough electricity generated to serve 33,000 homes in southeast Wisconsin," Evers said in an April 22, 2018, interview on UpFront with Mike Gousha on WISN-TV (Channel 12). Evers said he thinks Foxconn — which has begun work on a $10 billion facility that is to employ up to 13,000 in Racine County — is "all in," so renegotiating shouldn’t jeopardize the deal. Can the state force such an action at this point? And, if it forced the solar panels, could the panels really power more than 30,000 homes? Let’s take a look. System would be unprecedented in scope Asked to back up the claim, Evers spokeswoman Maggie Gau said he was drawing from a Wisconsin State Journal column from August 2017. In the piece, John Imes, executive director for the Madison-based Wisconsin Environmental Initiative, presented the idea as a hypothetical. "Imagine if … all of the roofs on those facilities were covered with the latest solar panel technology?" Imes wrote. "The buildings would generate over 200 (megawatt-hours) of electricity each year, enough to power almost 33,000 homes." But experts say a solar system with the kind of capacity Evers describes would have to be several hundred megawatts -- unprecedented for a rooftop solar array. A handful of U.S. solar farms — in places like Arizona and California — have this capacity, but those are dedicated, ground-based units. PV Magazine, a solar industry publication, says the largest rooftop system now is less than 20 megawatts, though Tesla has begun work on one around 70 megawatts. Such a system at Foxconn could cost $250 million to $500 million, said David Feldman, an economic and financial analysis researcher with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Checking the math Experts disagree on whether a system that size would be enough to power 33,000 homes. The planned Foxconn campus will cover about 22 million square feet, though a company spokesman declined to specify how much roof square footage will be involved (multi-story buildings would obviously reduce the available roof space). Two of the three solar experts we talked with said a roof around that size could feasibly provide enough power. Cara Marcy, renewable electricity analyst with the U.S. Energy Information Administration, said a roof at 22 million square feet -- based on the typical sunshine in Mount Pleasant -- could generate about 430,000 megawatt-hours of electricity annually. That’s above the roughly 300,000 megawatt-hours that 33,000 homes would need, based on the typical energy usage in Wisconsin. Ben Zientara, lead researcher and policy analyst for Solar Power Rocks, said a solar array could be enough to power 33,000 homes at 13 million square feet, well below the size of Foxconn. However, that would require flat-mounted arrays, which would be more susceptible to snow buildup. But calculations by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission, which regulates public utilities in the state, showed solar panels on 22 million square feet of roof would only generate enough electricity for about 24,000 homes, said spokesman Matthew Spencer. All calculations required some assumptions or approximations based on the type of solar panels — fixed or movable on one or two axes to tilt with the sun — and the space between panels. Experts also noted not all of the roof space would be usable for solar panels. Physical limitations The size of such a project means it is much more than a math problem, however. Marcy said it’s not realistic to describe generators in terms of homes powered because solar power is so inconsistent. It is obviously not available at night, or for long stretches of winter. "The solar facilities are not necessarily generating electricity at the same time electricity is needed by the system consumer, so from that perspective I think it’s inaccurate to say it's meeting the electricity of these homes," she said. A typical solar array has a maximum capacity around 20%, meaning there is enough sunshine to generate electricity about one-fifth of the time, experts say. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s solar resource calculator assumes 16%, but Wisconsin would face a challenge typical high-use solar states would not — snow removal. Spencer, whose agency is run by three commissioners appointed by Gov. Scott Walker, said companies that install solar arrays typically use the electricity for themselves first, then sell any unused power back to the grid. Spencer said it is likely not legal for Foxconn to provide electricity directly to the public — as the claim suggests — without going through the agency to become certified as a public utility. Can state compel solar installation? This brings us to where Evers’ claim started – whether Wisconsin "could compel" Foxconn to build such a thing. Requirements like installing solar panels could be fair game as part of negotiating an incentive package for a company like Foxconn. But for Foxconn, those negotiations are already over. "Any discussions about what could have been included in that contract are hypothetical and moot at this point since the state already has an executed contract in place," said Mark Maley, spokesman for the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. The agency is run by a 12-member board of Republican appointees, though it includes two Democratic party representatives. Maley said contracts do change in some cases, such as if the agreed-upon number of new jobs changes. That would open up a new negotiating window where changes to the agreement itself could theoretically happen. Jack Huddleston, emeritus professor of urban and regional planning at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said trying to re-open negotiations now would be "pretty risky" for the state. "The Development Agreement (DA) that was agreed to by all involved parties was a result of trade-offs made by each party," he said in an email. "If Foxconn, for example, agrees to renegotiate, it may demand new requirements to compensate for the loss of previously agreed to components." Gau, the Evers spokeswoman, noted Foxconn has made investments in renewable power in other countries. "If they are doing this there, why not here?" she said in an email. "Companies can be compelled to follow certain hiring practices like wages and employing workers from certain geographic areas, why not renewable energy for on-site sustainability or surrounding homes?" Our rating Evers says the state "could compel" Foxconn to install solar panels, and those would have enough capacity to power 33,000 homes. Experts say the quoted capacity is theoretically possible, though it would be extremely expensive and vastly larger than anything put on a roof in the world to date. And the logistical issues are many. Meanwhile, Foxconn construction is underway and incentive agreements have been signed, so the state doesn’t appear to have a route to force such action unless outside factors lead to reopened negotiations.

pomt-11350	"Republicans in Congress are plotting to take away Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/apr/05/ron-wyden/do-republicans-congress-want-take-away-social-secu/	It’s been a time-tested Democratic attack line: Republicans are going to take away your Medicare, or maybe your Social Security. We gave a variant of the line our 2011 Lie of the Year. Now the talking point has re-emerged, in a March 29 tweet, from Oregon’s Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee: "#TrumpTax was only the beginning. After giving massive tax giveaways to wealthy & powerful shareholders, Republicans in Congress are plotting to take away Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security." See Figure 1 on PolitiFact.com In reality, the notion that congressional Republicans are scheming to "take away" Medicaid, Medicare or Social Security is inaccurate. The Democratic news release The first piece of evidence undercutting the tweet’s message is actually linked in the tweet itself. An accompanying Senate Democratic press release, dated March 27, starts by saying, "It’s only been a few months since Republicans jammed through their massive giveaway to corporate executives and wealthy shareholders. Now they’re planning on paying for it with huge cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security, despite President Trump’s promises that he wouldn’t do so." "Huge cuts," the phrase used in the press release, sounds scary. But it’s not the same as saying the Republicans will "take away" the programs. The release goes on to cite specific comments by Republican leaders. These comments focus on changes to "entitlements," the wonky term for federal programs that automatically allocate benefits to qualified recipients, rather than being dependent on Congress appropriating enough money every year. Entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid account for the largest share of the federal budget. The Senate Democratic release includes two separate comments from House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., in December 2017 talking about returning to entitlement reform in 2018. The release quotes Ryan at a subsequent press conference on March 20, 2018, saying, "The House passed the biggest entitlement reform bill Congress has ever considered last year, and regrettably the Senate did not follow suit. So we’re just going to have to keep at it on entitlements." These quotes suggest the Republican in charge of the House continues to seek overhauls of the entitlement system. Cutbacks aren’t the same as elimination However, none of the proposals being weighed by Republican lawmakers would eliminate the programs. And Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., does not share Ryan's zeal for taking up entitlement changes. For Medicaid, Republican-proposed cuts could lead to specific individuals losing their coverage. That was the case with GOP proposals to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. Under these prior proposals, other beneficiaries might have experienced cutbacks in their Medicaid coverage. But the program itself wouldn’t have been taken away. The argument that Medicare or Social Security could be eliminated is even weaker. Even if cuts to these programs are proposed — usually through limiting inflation-adjustment formulas, raising taxes on benefits, or raising the retirement age — we’ve seen no plan that scraps the programs. Wyden’s staff tacitly confirmed that cuts are the GOP’s goal. They pointed us to President Donald Trump’s 2019 budget proposal, which calls for $15.3 billion in Medicare cuts and $6.5 billion in Medicaid cuts in just the first year. Wyden’s office added that Republicans have made no secret about their desire to "voucherize" Medicare (by giving beneficiaries a limited amount to purchase private insurance) and to raise the eligibility age for Social Security. Still, such ideas fall well short of what the tweet said. "Obviously the devil is in the details but reform does not equal ‘take away,’" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. "And clearly there needs to be some changes to get these programs on fiscally sound footing." AshLee Strong, Ryan’s spokeswoman, told PolitiFact that "no one has ever proposed taking away these programs. This kind of hyperbole is what keeps our important entitlement programs on an unsustainable trajectory." The House already passed a bill that would have curbed Medicaid, but it died in the Senate. And the Senate -- where Republicans have just a 51-49 edge in a chamber that requires 60 votes for most legislative business -- is expected to be a graveyard for legislation to rein in Medicare and Social Security. Indeed, McConnell, R-Ky., said during his year-end press conference on Dec. 22, 2017, that he does not plan to bring up entitlement reforms in the current environment due to a lack of bipartisan agreement on the sensitive issue. "We had a missed opportunity during the Obama years, when you had divided government, like you did with Reagan and Tip O'Neill, to address the long-term unsustainability of some of our most popular programs, who currently don't meet the demographics of the country in the future," he said. Our ruling Wyden said, "Republicans in Congress are plotting to take away Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security." Some key Republicans, including Ryan, have long argued in favor of overhauling entitlement programs such as these by reducing the amount of money spent on them. However, no Republican proposal has been made to "take away" any of the three programs cited in the tweet. In addition, Wyden glosses over just how far away from passage even a more modest overhaul would be. We rate it False.

pomt-00499	"Since Scott Walker has been our governor, we’ve gone from 50 percent state funding for the" University of Wisconsin System "to 15 percent."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2018/aug/06/tony-evers/tony-evers-figures-are-wrong-attack-scott-walker-o/	NextGen America is a political group run by California billionaire Tom Steyer, who plans to spend $30 million on the 2018 elections trying to give Democrats control of Congress. On July 22, 2018, the group took a narrower focus, hosting a forum that was attended by four of the eight Democrats running for governor of Wisconsin. NextGen America’s target is younger voters. And at times, its event at the former Pabst brewery site in Milwaukee, brought out the whimsical side of the candidates. Mahlon Mitchell, a firefighter and firefighters union president, used his time for a closing argument to put on firefighter gear in under 60 seconds. And Tony Evers recited the Gettysburg Address and took a selfie with the crowd. But the forum was serious, too, including when the host asked: "What would you do to make college more affordable?" Evers answered first. He noted that as part of his role as the state supreintendent of schools, he serves on the state Board of Regents, which governs the University of Wisconsin System. Then he attacked Republican Gov. Scott Walker, saying: "Since Scott Walker has been our governor, we’ve gone from 50 percent state funding for the (UW) system to 15 percent." That would be a precipitous drop of 35 percentage points. All our fact checks in the governor’s race. Walker and the GOP-run Legislature did cut $250 million from the UW System in the 2015-’17 state budget. And Democrats have attacked Walker on education funding ahead of the Aug. 14, 2018 primary, as they compete to be the nominee running against the two-term incumbent in the Nov. 6, 2018 general election. But in this case, the attack misses. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. "Tony misspoke," his campaign spokeswoman Maggie Gau told us. "We acknowledge it's not correct. As much as we try to prevent them, no one is perfect and mistakes happen on the trail." UW System’s funding streams The UW System is composed of 13 campuses, including the University of Wisconsin-Madison, that offer four-year and advanced degrees, and 13 campuses that offer two-year degrees. Currently, its operating budget is about $6 billion per year, with about $1 billion — 17 percent — coming from state funding. To see whether that percentage has changed during Walker’s tenure as governor, we turned to a state agency, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau. (Federal funding and tuition are the two other largest sources of funding, and there are others, as well.) Here is how much of the UW System operating budgets has come from state funding since the year before Walker took office as governor: Fiscal year Percentage of UW System operating budget from state funding 2010-’11 21.1 percent 2011-’12 (Walker’s first year) 17.9 percent 2012-13 19.2 percent 2013-’14 19.2 percent 2014-’15 19.3 percent 2015-’16 16.6 percent 2016-’17 16.8 percent 2017-’18 17.1 percent So, state funding of the UW System was nowhere near the 50 percent Evers claimed when Walker took office. Rather, it was 21 percent. Since Walker became governor, state funding has been below the 21 percent. Now it’s at about 17 percent, a drop of about 4 percentage points since Walker took office — though above the 15 percent Evers claimed. Our rating Evers said: "Since Scott Walker has been our governor, we’ve gone from 50 percent state funding for the" University of Wisconsin System "to 15 percent." The gap is much narrower. State funding made up about 21 percent, not 50 percent, of the UW Systems’s operating budget when Walker took office. It’s now at 17 percent, not 15 percent. We rate Evers’ statement False.

pomt-11692	After enactment of the Republican tax bill, "school teachers can no longer deduct the cost of their classroom supplies on their taxes."	false	/punditfact/statements/2017/dec/27/jenna-fischer/jenna-fischer-office-tweets-outdated-info-teacher-/	Jenna Fischer, the actress best known as Pam on NBC’s The Office, prompted a bit of a Twitter tussle before Christmas. "I can't stop thinking about how school teachers can no longer deduct the cost of their classroom supplies on their taxes...something they shouldn't have to pay for with their own money in the first place. I mean, imagine if nurses had to go buy their own syringes. #ugh," Fischer tweeted on Dec. 23. The tweet attracted 66,000 retweets and 223,000 likes. (Fischer has about 750,000 followers.) But the tweet was wrong, relying on an outdated proposal. (After this fact-check was posted, Fischer deleted the tweet; see "After the Fact" below.) An existing provision in the tax code has allowed teachers to deduct eligible, unreimbursed classroom spending up to $250. The provision was expanded and made permanent in December 2015. The tax bill unveiled by House Republicans in November would have scrapped the deduction. But amid an outcry from teachers and their allies -- we wrote about opposition from Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., here -- it was stripped before the House and Senate passed identical versions of the bill and President Trump signed it on Dec. 22. (The Senate bill actually would have doubled the deduction, but that idea was rejected too.) A number of Twitter users pointed this out, including one identified as Matt Rossetto, who snarked later that day that Fischer’s tweet "is 100% wrong, because the final bill KEPT this deduction, but 14,000 RT’s later..." Fischer noticed Rossetto’s tweet and fired back, "It was capped at $250 which is woefully insufficient especially considering they shouldn't have to go out of pocket at all. #iloveteachers." See Figure 2 on PolitiFact.com Some Twitter users, however, still found fault with Fischer, since $250 was always the limit for that particular deduction -- it was not lowered due to the new law. Rossetto, for instance, tweeted back, "It WAS $250 before the bill and hasn’t changed. If you’re going to grandstand, get it right." Finally, on Christmas Day, Fischer returned to Twitter to acknowledge her critics. She tweeted, "Thanks for your tweets! I had some facts wrong. Teachers surveyed by Scholastic in 2016 personally spent an average of $530 on school supplies for students. Teachers who worked at high-poverty schools spent an average of $672. The tax deduction was capped at $250." See Figure 3 on PolitiFact.com Fischer didn’t explicitly acknowledge that the $250 limit existed before the Republican-backed bill, but she was right on the other statistics. They refer to a national survey of 4,721 public school educators for Scholastic by the firm YouGov in July and August 2016. As of the time this article was published, however, Fischer’s initial correction tweet had garnered far less interest than her original one -- 830 retweets and about 6,600 likes. Our ruling Fischer tweeted that after enactment of the Republican tax bill, "school teachers can no longer deduct the cost of their classroom supplies on their taxes." As numerous Twitter users pointed out, that is incorrect -- the newly signed tax bill does not affect the existing deduction for teacher expenses. Fischer later acknowledged that "I had some facts wrong" and deleted the tweet. We rate her initial tweet False.

We've examined the role of abortion coverage in the health care debate numerous times, specifically as it relates to this amendment, including a recent claim by Rep. Nita Lowey . But on Nov. 12, 2009, MSNBC host Rachel Maddow addressed the issue again, and we thought we'd take another crack at it. "Congressman Stupak and his supporters say that this Stupak Amendment would simply maintain the status quo," Maddow said on her show. "It should be noted that that's baloney. The Stupak Amendment doesn't just say you can't use your federal insurance subsidy to pay for an abortion, it says, if you're getting a federal subsidy of any kind, you're not allowed to buy an insurance plan that covers abortion even with your own money. That's the first bit of dishonesty going on here." The amendment, sponsored by Reps. Bart Stupak, D-Mich., and Joe Pitts, R-Pa., was a last-minute addition to the House legislation and passed due to support from Republicans and antiabortion Democrats. It establishes restrictions on how abortion can be covered under the bill's virtual health insurance "exchanges." These exchanges are designed to help people buy coverage if they are not currently insured, or if they work for businesses that are too small to offer health coverage to employees. Essentially, the Stupak-Pitts amendment bars abortion coverage for those who choose the "public option," which is the House bill's federally administered, but privately funded, insurance plan. (Cases of rape, incest or a danger to the life of the mother are exempted.) The amendment also prevents anyone who accepts federal subsidies for health coverage from purchasing a plan with abortion coverage on the exchange. However, the amendment does allow people purchasing insurance on the exchange to choose a plan with abortion coverage if they pay for it without federal subsidies. Those who do accept subsidies can purchase an abortion "rider" -- that is, a separate policy covering abortion -- as long as they pay for it entirely with their own money. Many supporters of abortion rights argue that the amendment represents a severe infringement on a procedure that has been upheld by the Supreme Court. They say that relatively few women will be able to buy insurance on the exchanges without subsidies, making the exception for unsubsidized purchases close to meaningless. And they say that the idea of a "rider" isn't all it's cracked up to be. For one thing, abortion-rights supporters argue, women won't be likely to purchase separate coverage for a procedure they never expect to need. In addition, they say, insurance companies will be unlikely to offer abortion coverage because of the bill's logistical hurdles. For instance, the bill requires that insurers offering plans on the exchange that cover abortion also have to offer an identical plan that does not cover abortion. All of these factors, abortion-rights supporters say, indicate that insurers will simply take the path of least resistance and decline to offer abortion coverage. If this happens, the law could end up diminishing the abortion coverage options for people on the exchange. In our previous ruling, we drew a distinction between what the law does and what might possibly happen in the law's wake. The law spells out quite clearly that abortion coverage can be obtained on the exchange, even by those who are subsidized. By contrast, the notion that low demand for, and low supply of, abortion coverage could hamper women's access to abortion struck us as a different matter. We concluded that it's too speculative to say that this scenario will definitely come to pass. As we look at Maddow's statement, we'll start by giving her credit for using more careful wording than have many of her fellow abortion-rights supporters, including the subject of our prior fact-check, Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y. Whether by design or not, Maddow hewed quite closely to the actual language of the amendment when she said that "if you're getting a federal subsidy of any kind, you're not allowed to buy an insurance plan that covers abortion even with your own money." In fact, the amendment text does, on eight separate occasions, make a distinction between a "plan" and "supplemental coverage." Specifically, the amendment says that people who buy subsidized insurance on the exchange cannot buy an insurance "plan" that includes abortion coverage. But the amendment does allow subsidized people to purchase "supplemental coverage" that covers abortion, as long as they do it with their own money. We believe that Maddow's failure to mention the option of buying "supplemental coverage" -- a rider -- undercuts her broader argument that "if you're getting a federal subsidy of any kind, you're not allowed to buy an insurance plan that covers abortion even with your own money." We'll concede that the amendment's language does draw a distinction between buying a "plan" and buying "supplemental coverage," but the difference is likely to be lost on viewers without expertise either in the insurance business or in legislative drafting. We ran our argument by Maddow. She gamely disagreed. "I absolutely stand by my comment," she wrote in an e-mail. "Get real, you guys. It's crazy to argue that the real impact of the Stupak Amendment will be that women receiving federal subsidies (probably the vast majority of women in the exchange) will just buy 'abortion insurance,' since abortion wouldn't be covered as health care under their health insurance anymore. Women are really going to get a specific insurance rider that they'd pay for every month, for a procedure no one ever plans on having or thinks they'll ever have to have? Really? Come on." But we think her response only strengthens the argument that the law isn't, itself, barring abortion coverage. Saying, as she does, that the burden of purchasing or not purchasing "abortion insurance" would fall to women tacitly confirms that the law does indeed allow subsidized women on the exchange to buy abortion coverage. Meanwhile, contrary to suggestions that insurers won't offer abortion riders, our research shows that they do exist in at least three of the five states that already have rules similar to the Stupak amendment on the books. In Oklahoma and Kentucky -- both of which which bar insurers from offering elective abortion coverage as part of a comprehensive plan -- regulatory officials told PolitiFact that such riders do exist, because insurance companies must file paperwork with the state before they sell such policies. In addition, Paula Gianino, president and chief executive for Planned Parenthood of the St. Louis region, told the St. Louis Beacon that she estimates 7 percent to 10 percent of the roughly 6,000 abortions provided annually at its St. Louis facility are covered by private insurance. Since companies in Missouri are banned from purchasing plans with abortion coverage except by rider, these examples show that some abortion riders are being purchased in that state. However, none of these states keeps track of how many companies offer the riders, or how many people have purchased them. Ultimately, we'll give Maddow credit for linguistic care, but we continue to hold that the Stupak Amendment does not, as she suggests, prevent subsidized women on the exchange from buying abortion coverage. They can buy a rider that adds that coverage. We rate Maddow's statement Barely True. Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.	None	Rachel Maddow	None	None	None	2009-11-16T18:26:49	2009-11-12	['Stupak–Pitts_Amendment']
pomt-03920	Of six Rhode Island tax-credit programs worth about $35 million, "three companies got 90 percent of that -- CVS and two companies not even located in the state of Rhode Island."	true	/rhode-island/statements/2013/feb/24/gary-sasse/gary-sasse-says-90-percent-35-million-tax-credits-/	In the debate over taxes -- which ones to cut and which ones to raise -- any proposed change would result in winners and losers. During a discussion of taxes on the Feb. 10 edition of WJAR-TV's "10 News Conference," host Jim Taricani asked how taxes could be cut while still financing the services that governments need to perform. Gary Sasse, director of the Hassenfeld Institute for Public Leadership at Bryant University, said people need to be talking "about tax reform, not just tax cutting, the same debate that's going on nationally." "You asked why it's so expensive to live here. Well, we don't invest in things that will grow the economy [like] higher education," he said. "We have such an inbred system of crony capitalism that we have tax loopholes that make no sense. Good sound tax policy is lowering rates and not having government pick winners and losers by favoritism." Taricani asked Sasse if he was referring to "tax breaks for CVS and other types of things?" "Absolutely," said Sasse. "There was a study put out by the Division of Taxation. They only looked at six of our tax credits that totaled about $35 million, $36 million. Three companies got 90 percent of that -- CVS and two companies not even located in the state of Rhode Island. They were in California." Ninety percent of the tax credits were going to CVS and two California companies? We went to the Division of Taxation website and found the report Sasse was talking about. The division is required by law to report on six incentive programs, even though one was repealed in 2009 and the other is phasing out. The remaining four distributed $34.4 million in tax credits (not quite $35 million but close enough) to 39 entities. But one Woonsocket company, the pharmacy giant CVS Caremark, with a net after-tax income of $3.9 billion in 2012, got 59 percent of it. CVS got $4.9 million from the state through the Economic Development Corporation Project Status program, in which the EDC waives the sales tax for construction projects. (Only projects approved before July 1, 2011, could qualify.) CVS got another $15.4 million under the Jobs Development Act, which allows for a reduction in a company's corporate income tax rate if it creates and maintains a certain number of jobs. Total: just over $20 million. But wait, as the TV commercials say, there's more. Any entity that receives one of the six credits is required to disclose any other credits it gets from the state. During that fiscal year, CVS received an additional $4.4 million from four tax credits; nearly all of it from a $4.3-million state investment tax credit, which is designed to encourage investment in buildings and equipment. And what about the two out-of-state companies that Sasse was talking about? Both benefited from the controversial motion picture production tax-credit program, which was designed to encourage TV, motion picture and video production in Rhode Island. The credit can help production companies reduce their Rhode Island taxes. More often, those companies can raise money by selling unused tax credits -- typically through brokers -- to companies or individuals that owe Rhode Island taxes but have nothing to do with the entertainment business. The biggest tax credit for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2012, was an $8.1-million break to Paige Productions Inc. of Burbank, Calif., which was producing the ABC medical drama "Body of Proof" and filmed its initial episodes in Rhode Island. Another $2.9 million went to Moonrise LLC of Santa Monica, Calif., the production company that filmed "Moonrise Kingdom," a movie that has been nominated for an Academy Award in the best original screenplay category and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award in the category of best motion picture musical or comedy. Add them all together and you have three companies garnering $31.3 million of the $34.5 million in tax credits -- or 90.1 percent. "Keep in mind: that report is only dealing with six tax credits. There are others," Sasse said. "We ought to expand that report to look at more tax credits." Are these tax breaks worth the lost revenue? That’s a matter of opinion that we wouldn’t rule on. But we will remind readers that a PolitiFact Rhode Island article from Dec. 19, 2010, noted that there is a lot of debate over the real value of the motion picture production tax credit. The Rhode Island Department of Revenue was supposed to issue an evaluation of the incentives in January of 2012 but that report is still being prepared. We asked the Chafee administration for an explanation for the delay but didn't get a response. Our ruling Gary Sasse said that among six Rhode Island tax-credit programs worth about $35 million, "three companies got 90 percent of that -- CVS and two companies not even located in the state of Rhode Island." Sasse is rounding off some large numbers but he was, in essence, correctly quoting the state report he was citing. We rate the claim True.

abbc-00018	Many Australians try to reduce their personal carbon footprint, but do we have the same options as people in other countries?	in-the-red	http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-17/fact-check-corolla-emissions-comparison-uk-australia/8805598	Mr Butler's claim is ill-informed. Although Australia has placed limits on emissions of "noxious air pollutants" since the 1970s, Mr Butler accurately points out that there are no mandatory standards for carbon dioxide emissions from cars. However, the evidence does not back up the idea that the Corolla vehicle that "you'll buy" in Australia emits double the carbon dioxide as the same type of car in the UK. The comparison Mr Butler refers to was one made between two very different cars in the Corolla range — an Australian petrol model and a UK petrol-electric hybrid. A closer comparison would have been between the UK and Australian petrol models, or the UK hybrid and Australian Prius which shared the same engine. Importantly, Mr Butler's comparison is also based on outdated information. The Corolla is no longer sold in the UK, having been replaced by the Toyota Auris. And a lower-emitting petrol-electric hybrid Corolla was introduced to Australia in 2016, which compares more favourably with a similarly specified hybrid Auris. So, while Mr Butler has fairly accurately described a comparison that was set out in a 2014 Climate Change Authority report, the comparison was flawed at the time and changes in model line-ups mean the figures are not valid for 2017.

pomt-14608	Says Ohio Gov. John Kasich had "the worst rating on spending of any governor in the country, Republican or Democrat."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/feb/02/right-rise/does-john-kasich-have-worst-rating-spending-any-go/	The super PAC supporting former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush is trying to counter a perceived challenge for moderate New Hampshire voters from Ohio Gov. John Kasich. The PAC, Right to Rise, is airing an ad in New Hampshire that declares Kasich "wrong on New Hampshire issues." It’s run at least 284 times on Boston television since Jan. 21, according to the Internet Archive’s Political Ad Tracker. The 30-second ad makes a number of claims, but we decided to focus on one surrounding spending. The ad claims Kasich had "the worst rating on spending of any governor in the country, Republican or Democrat." That’s a potentially devastating claim, especially since Kasich is selling the economic turnaround in Ohio as part of his presidential resume. It in large part hinges on Kasich’s decision to expand Medicaid in the state as part of President Barack Obama’s health care law. Where the claim comes from Right to Rise isn’t pulling its claim out of the air. The super PAC is accurately citing a report by the libertarian Cato Institute. Cato’s report, entitled Fiscal Policy Report Card on America’s Governors 2014, attempts to compare 48 of the nation’s governors on a number of fiscal measures. (Virginia and Alaska were excluded.) Overall, Kasich earned a score of 44, which Cato translated to a D. Only 12 Democrats, and no Republicans, scored lower. But Right to Rise is focusing on one subcategory of the overall scorecard, which measures spending changes. On that score, Kasich indeed finished dead last -- with a total of six. Cato found that Ohio proposed 5.7 percent growth in per capita spending and ended up with 8 percent growth in actual per capita spending. In its report, Cato makes clear that the spending measures we just cited -- proposed per capita spending and actual per capita spending -- are only for general fund budgets, which Cato describes as "the budgets that governors have the most control over." Proposed per capita spending is measured through fiscal year 2015, and actual per capita spending is measured through fiscal 2014. As wonky as that previous paragraph sounds, that makes all the difference in assessing the validity of Cato’s report, Kasich’s rebuttal, and ultimately Right to Rise’s claim. A quick primer on state budgets If you’ve followed any state budgeting process, you’ll quickly realize that there are different ways to describe what you call "the budget." Cato is honing in on the general fund budget, which is usually the part of the budget that lawmakers and governors have the most power to influence. Generally speaking, this is the money that lawmakers might fight over when it comes to spending on pet projects, or subsidies for sports stadiums, or economic development incentives. Again, generally speaking, general fund spending is the most unencumbered. But there are lots of other pots of money that ultimately make up a state budget. Road tolls might go into a trust fund where they must be re-invested in road-building projects. A state lottery system might guarantee all its proceeds to education funding. Fees for developers might be dedicated to infrastructure improvements. The federal government might pass millions of dollars to a state for a specific project or need (roads, health care, school lunches). That’s all money that the state spends, but lawmakers have fewer levers to pull to try and manage it. Kasich’s rebuttal Kasich’s campaign offers two rebuttals to the Right to Rise/Cato charge. The first deals with how you define the budget. If you expand the budget to include all funds, the spending increases Cato references at 5.7 percent and 8 percent shrink to about 2 percent. The second rebuttal involves an accounting change that the Kasich campaign says inflates Cato’s numbers in the first place. Kasich officials say Ohio transitioned about $2 billion in spending into the general fund from the overall "all funds" budget. Analyzing only the general fund budget "makes this accounting correction erroneously appear to be an increase, when an analysis of all state spending would reveal that total spending didn’t go up as a result of this, and that this move was merely a movement of funds between internal accounting lines," the Kasich campaign told PolitiFact. State officials told the Columbus Dispatch that the accounting shift came when the state moved a large chunk of Medicaid spending from the all-funds budget to the general revenue fund. The money, tied to Medicaid expansion as part of President Barack Obama’s health care law, originally was placed in the "all-funds" budget but was moved to the general revenue budget. "That substantially explains … why the (general revenue fund) grew," Timothy S. Keen, Ohio’s director of the state office of budget and management, told the Dispatch. "It’s not new spending. It’s an accounting change." Cato’s rebuttal to Kasich’s rebuttal This issue, now appearing in the campaign ad, boiled over in August when Kasich was asked about it on Fox News Sunday. CHRIS WALLACE: "Unemployment down from 9.1 percent to 5.2 percent. And the top income tax rate has been lowered from 6.2 percent to 4.9 percent. "But the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, gave you a ‘D’ on its government’s (sic) report card just last year, noting the budget grew 13.6 percent in 2014 and that over your time as governor, government jobs have increased 3 percent. A ‘D,’ sir?" KASICH: "Well, I don’t know who these folks are, Chris, another Washington group. But, look, we have the lowest number of state employees in 30 years and in addition to that, our budget overall is growing by about 2 percent or 3 percent, and our Medicaid growth has gone from 9 percent when I came in to less than 4 percent and no one has been left behind. We haven’t had to cut benefits or throw anybody off the rolls. So, we pay attention to the mentally ill and the drug addicted and the working poor." Kasich’s criticism prompted a response from Cato. Cato looked at the budget in a few new and different ways, including by removing any federal Medicaid contribution from the general revenue budget. That calculation found that Ohio general fund spending increased 3 percent to 5 percent annually from 2013-16. "By using the all-funds number, Kasich is trying to use federal spending to mask the quick increase in general fund spending," wrote Cato economist Nicole Kaeding. (Kaeding has since moved on to the pro-business Tax Foundation.) "Federal spending — besides Medicaid — is not increasing in Ohio that quickly. Kasich has little control over federal spending, but he is using it to hide how much Ohio’s state spending has grown during his tenure." We asked Chris Edwards, the director of tax policy studies at Cato, what he makes of the Right to Rise attack and Kasich’s rebuttals. Edwards agrees that a large part of the spending increase is tied to Kasich’s decision to expand Medicaid. "I understand Kasich says we unfairly used that in our study," Edwards said. "But it’s spending, and he did it." Our ruling In an ad targeted at New Hampshire voters, a super PAC supporting Bush said Kasich had "the worst rating on spending of any governor in the country, Republican or Democrat." Right to Rise is accurately citing a portion of a study by the Cato Institute that looked at one measure of spending for 48 of America’s governors in 2014. But Kasich disputes the study itself, and correctly notes that there are other ways to measure state spending, and that a shifting of dollars from one part of the budget to another affected the results. What to make of it all? This reminds us of some previous attempts to look at the spending records of governors running for president. And like in those cases, the result here might be a tad unsatisfying for people seeking clarity. Cato, in our judgment, did nothing to unfairly target Kasich. Yet, there is more to Ohio’s particular budget story that may leave viewers with a different impression. We rate the claim Half True.

pomt-02689	"In my home state, nearly one in five Floridians live in poverty."	mostly true	/florida/statements/2014/jan/06/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-nearly-one-five-floridians-live-p/	Fifty years ago, President Lyndon Johnson declared war on poverty. Since then, says Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., taxpayers have spent $20 trillion on welfare and other government programs intended to lift them out of poverty -- yet tens of millions of Americans are still impoverished. "In my home state, nearly one in five Floridians live in poverty," Rubio said in a Jan. 5 video message. "After 50 years, isn’t it time to declare big government’s war on poverty a failure?" Rubio called for a new agenda to help people lift themselves out of poverty and create a new "opportunity society" to enable people to live the American dream. Rubio is expected to release additional details Wednesday during a speech at the U.S. Capitol hosted by the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. Rubio released his video as the Senate returns to take up the issue of renewing emergency unemployment benefits that lapsed in December. Also, Democrats have announced that they will target income equality as a top issue this election year, including a push to raise the federal minimum wage. Here we will fact-check Rubio’s claim that nearly one in five Floridians live in poverty. Census data on poverty and Florida First, some background. The Census Bureau, the official federal record-keeper for poverty rates, determines poverty status by comparing annual income to a set of dollar values called poverty thresholds that vary by family size, the number of related children and the age of the householder. For example in 2012, that would mean a single person earning $11,720 or a family of four earning $23,492 would be considered poor. A Rubio spokesman told PolitiFact Florida that he arrived at his figure of nearly one in five Floridians based on a story in the Sarasota Herald-Tribune that said Florida’s poverty rate was 17.1 percent in 2012, according to the census. In 2012, Florida had a higher percentage living in poverty than the national average of 15.9 percent. Using the 2012 figure of 17.1 percent would place the number of Floridians in poverty closer to one in six than one in five. "You’re correct that 17.1 is between one-in-six and one-in-five," Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told PolitiFact in an email. "He said 'nearly' 1 in 5, but he could have said "more than" 1 in 6. Either way, I think we can all agree that 17.1 percent is too high a number." (The numbers are even worse if we zero in on Rubio’s home county of Miami-Dade where about one in four residents lived in poverty in 2012.) Another way to look at the percentage of Floridians in poverty is by using the census’ three year average between 2010-12. That average showed that 15.4 percent of Floridians lived in poverty -- or about one in six Floridians. One footnote: While we’re not rating Rubio’s claim that the war on poverty is a failure, we will note that in 1964 the official poverty rate was even higher nationally than it is now -- 19 percent. Our ruling Rubio said that "nearly one in five Floridians live in poverty." He points to 2012 census data which showed that 17.1 percent of Floridians lived in poverty, which would mean about one in six Floridians live in poverty. The percentage is slightly lower if we look at the three year average which showed 15.4 percent living in poverty -- still about one in six. Rubio’s numbers are close. We rate his claim Mostly True.

pomt-12009	"Since we took office, we have been outpacing the nation in job growth."	half-true	/missouri/statements/2017/sep/21/eric-greitens/missouri-really-outpacing-nation-jobs-greitens-too/	Republican Gov. Eric Greitens has been pushing job growth since his 2016 campaign. In a Facebook live video on Aug. 23, Greitens said there has already been substantial improvement since he took office in January. "Since we took office, we have been outpacing the nation in job growth," he said. Is Missouri really "outpacing the nation" in jobs? We wanted to find out. By the numbers The number of jobs added from January through July 2017 increased by 0.9 percent over the same period in 2016. Greitens compared Missouri to the national average job growth over the same time, which was 0.8 percent. Between January and February of 2017, Missouri job growth increased by 0.0012 percent whereas national job growth increased by 0.0016 percent. However, Missouri experienced a 0.005 drop in jobs between February and March. Greiten’s Press Secretary Parker Briden claims that the governor has created more than 35,000 jobs since then. "Since March, we have created 37,200 jobs, while the United States as a whole has created 792,000," Briden said. "Thus, in that time we account for approximately 4.7 percent of total job creation in the country, performing far better than the national average." The standard metric for tracking job growth at the national and state level is the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Employment Statistics survey. As far as numbers go, Greitens has a point. But can he take credit for the job spike? In 2016, Missouri experienced a 0.2 percent hike in job growth. The same upward trend goes for 2014 and 2015, where jobs grew by 0.5 percent in the first seven months of each year. So, jobs had been added at a decent clip before Greitens took office, though not as much as this year. BLS' data shows the state of Missouri at a steady increase in job growth over the past five years. "Most economists would say that it’s highly unlikely anything he did in the first eight months of office is the reason for this job growth," said Peter Mueser, an economics professor at the University of Missouri’s Truman School of Public Affairs. Mueser even went on to say that most of the time, governors don't have enough control to cause employment growth or decline. "Lots of things contribute to the economic growth that the governor doesn't have control of," he said. "Over time, population increases and every so often it's easier to claim that employment grows because of the population growth." Bills for businesses Greitens’ major initiatives on the economy or workforce have either not yet taken effect or only recently became law. In January, Greitens signed SB 19, a "right-to-work" bill that allows workers to opt out of joining a union. Greitens pledged to pass this bill while on the campaign trail and signed the bill in an abandoned warehouse in Springfield. The bill was supposed to take effect on Aug. 28. However, after more than 300,000 petitions (more than triple what is required to put a bill on the ballot) were submitted, "right to work" will instead be moved to the Nov. 28 ballot for the public to decide. Another bill the governor has signed but only recently went into effect is HB 130, which requires transportation network companies, such as Uber and Lyft to pay a one-time $5,000 licensing fee and conduct driver background checks and vehicle inspections. Pacific Republican Kirk Mathews sponsored the bill and says regulations will keep transportation network company drivers in Missouri. The bill is expected to created up to 10,000 new driver jobs in the state but was five days away from becoming law when Greitens made his statement. Greitens also signed SB 43, which will make it tougher for fired workers to prove employment discrimination. The governor, who signed the bill in June, said the new law will "prevent trial lawyers from killing good jobs." Our ruling Greitens said, "Since we took office, we have been outpacing the nation in job growth." Missouri did outpace the national average in job growth from January to June in 2017. However, Missouri’s jobs have been on a steady uphill climb since 2014, long before Greitens took office. And although Greitens has passed multiple laws affecting employment and businesses, these bills did not go into effect until Aug. 28. So there is no evidence that the continued job growth in Missouri is because of his management. Even Greitens’ press secretary didn’t provide information on how exactly Greitens has increased job growth except employment numbers. When asked for further examples on how the governor has created 37,200 jobs, Briden did not return request for comment. We rate this claim Half True.

pomt-00022	Says photo of man shows "diseases coming across the border."	false	/facebook-fact-checks/statements/2018/nov/06/blog-posting/dated-photo-used-make-false-claim-about-migrants-d/	A 2014 photo of a man with a rash has been dredged up and re-posted on Facebook by a group that claims numerous diseases are coming across the border into the United States. But the accompanying photo is four years old. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar shared the original photo with the Houston Chronicle in 2014, along with a series of other images that showed cramped and unsanitary conditions in a Customs and Border Protection facility in South Texas. The claim that immigrants bring infectious diseases isn’t new. We’ve fact-checked a couple iterations of the claim over the years. In 2014, a congressman said migrants may be bringing the Ebola virus across the U.S.-Mexico border. We rated that Pants on Fire. In 2015, Donald Trump said, "Tremendous infectious disease is pouring across the border." At the time, the health experts we spoke with agreed that there was no evidence of massive influx of infections across the border. Most recently, other posts have gone viral about the migrants in the caravan heading toward the U.S.-Mexico border supposedly bringing diseases. There are no known reports of this being the case, according to The New York Times. The photo in the Facebook post is from a particular outbreak of scabies in 2014. Scabies is a treatable skin condition, but it can spread rapidly under crowded conditions. That outbreak was largely contained to migrants living in close quarters in detention centers. Only a small handful of border patrol agents appear to have contracted it. There is some evidence that diseases cross between the U.S.-Mexico border, but the Center for Disease Control attributes spread of disease in that region not to illegal immigration but to legal back-and-forth between the United States and Mexico. Our ruling There is no evidence that undocumented immigrants to the U.S. are carrying deadly diseases. Spread of disease is more likely from the much larger numbers of legal crossing across the border and the number of international travelers visiting other countries and then returning to the United States.

pomt-00577	"500 percent more traffic here?"	mostly true	/texas/statements/2015/jun/09/anonymous-activist/austin-yard-signs-suggest-office-tower-project-cou/	A chunk of residential Northwest Austin has bridled at the prospect of a low-rise office park becoming much more. Our attention was drawn to yard signs suggesting the towering redevelopment at the southwest corner of Spicewood Springs Road and MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1) would quintuple area traffic. Dallas-based Spire Realty Group LP seeks a zoning change to build up Austin Oaks, an office complex with 12 buildings of two to three stories each. In a version of its proposal made public in 2014, Spire said that on the parts of the site closer to MoPac, it wanted to build two office buildings of 17 stories each, though those plans have since been trimmed to 10-story buildings or so, according to Steve Drenner, an Austin lawyer representing Spire in its zoning case. Initial plans, also since modified per Drenner, called for up to 610 apartments and townhomes in the three- to five-story buildings, plus retail and restaurant space. The soonest construction was planned to start was around 2020, after existing office leases expire. The "500%" signs don’t reveal any group or person as the originator or sponsor. By phone, Ann Denkler, a volunteer with a coalition opposing the redevelopment, told us the group did not create them. City 'unable to verify' traffic impact We reached out to city officials at first, wondering what data were available. By email, spokeswoman Sylvia Arzola told us: "The project and the traffic impact analysis are currently under review. At this time we are unable to verify the traffic impact until a full evaluation of the project and accompanying mitigation is provided by the developer." Meanwhile, we found something close to the 500 percent claim in a September 2014 presentation by Jim Duncan of Austin, a city planner by profession. Duncan said he developed the presentation at the urging of a neighborhood friend and based his traffic projection on an engineering report written by another firm at the developer’s request. That report, Duncan said, indicated daily car trips near the proposed Austin Oaks Planned Use Development would increase from 4,118 to 23,804 once the expansion was finished--a 478 percent uptick. We turned back to Arzola, who agreed by email it looks like the traffic figures indeed came from "the developer’s consultant’s study." However, she noted, a fresh traffic analysis was released in May 2015 based on the developer changing what it seeks to build. Duncan said he’d heard the revision talk and for that reason, he said, his calculation of the potential 478 percent increase in daily car trips near the project would likely be outflanked. "I’m sure the number is lower" now, Duncan said. Traffic impact studies Arzola emailed us two traffic studies for the project, dated a year apart, and another city official, Bryan Golden, emailed us excerpts from a study completed in August 2014 (which looked to us like the one Duncan relied on). Each study presents predicted "unadjusted daily trips" in the area should the project be built out with predicted increases ranging from more than 300 percent to more than 480 percent. Generally, "unadjusted daily trips" means daily car trips in an area, a city official told us, without reductions accounting for trips internal to a development, say, or trips there on city buses. An unadjusted count rolls in trips expected due to existing developments plus the additional trips expected once the project is finished, Bryan Golden told us by email. The projections are generated by an engineering industry "calculator," Golden said. The initial June 26, 2014, traffic impact analysis was completed by a professional engineer, Bobak J. Tehrany, for Bury-AUS, Inc. That analysis, of 14 nearby intersections and 11 proposed driveways, said the redevelopment on completion in 2031 would generate an additional 20,736 unadjusted daily trips by car compared to some 4,248 daily trips attributed to the existing office complex — which breaks out to an eventual 488 percent increase. With the redevelopment, Tehrany wrote, all but two of the nearby intersections would need improvements. That is, he said, "the maximum desirable volumes are currently being exceeded along the roadway segments which were evaluated," though he also said that doesn’t mean the roadways had exceeded their respective capacities. The Aug. 19, 2014, traffic impact analysis--taking into account a nearby intersection the city wanted to add to the analysis, Amanda Swor of Drenner’s firm told us by email--suggested the project would result in nearly 19,700 additional unadjusted daily car trips, up 478 percent from 4,118 of late. We didn’t get a fix on why the count of current-day traffic went down. Most recently, the May 22, 2015, traffic impact analysis filed on behalf of the developers states: "Based on the proposed land use intensities, it is anticipated that the development will generate a total of 19,819 unadjusted daily trips; however, due to the existing office land uses, the proposed redevelopment is anticipated to generate a net increase of 15,701 unadjusted daily trips. This is taking into consideration the trips which already exist on the roadway network due to the existing development." That is, once the development is done, nearby traffic would be up 381 percent from the 4,118 daily car trips of late. Developer's advocate says traffic likely to increase less By phone, Drenner pointed out the May 2015 analysis includes a chart suggesting that once adjustments are made to account for car trips internal to the development, there would actually be a 332 percent increase in traffic. He said this latest analysis was based on Spire’s modified development plan—halving the number of residential units and reducing retail uses — filed with the city April 30, 2015. Drenner said, too, the developers are suggesting $1.5 million in spending to improve nearby streets and creation of a fund that would accumulate money for area road improvements. Next, we wondered how much traffic near the site would increase if the developers added nothing. Denkler and Golden counseled that analysts assume a 2 percent annual increase in car trips. At our request, Golden calculated the 4,118 current unadjusted daily car trips would escalate 37 percent to 5,653 in 2031--again, provided there’s no expansion on the site. Our ruling Yard signs posted in opposition to a proposed Northwest Austin redevelopment say: "500 percent more traffic?" Traffic studies filed in 2014 based on the developer’s original proposal support the 500-percent figure, yet the developer later submitted a revised plan and its May 2015 traffic analysis suggests at most a 381 percent increase in daily car trips, still a substantial spike. Perhaps the project and predicted traffic effects will continue to change. For now, taking into account the information available when the signs were made, we rate the claim Mostly True.

pomt-03889	Says his proposed education spending "is the highest state funding level in Florida history."	half-true	/florida/statements/2013/mar/05/rick-scott/rick-scott-touts-his-education-plan-third-state-st/	Gov. Rick "Let’s get to work!" Scott may be trying out a new slogan for his re-election campaign. More and more, his priorities are screaming "Let’s get to class!" Scott devoted much of his third State of the State address on Tuesday to education, singling out educators as special guests and asking lawmakers to stand in honor of their favorite teacher. Then he turned to another telltale sign of showing love: showing them money! To polite applause, Scott reiterated his desire for the Legislature to give teachers a $2,500 across-the-board raise. He asked lawmakers to use his proposed education spending, which calls for an increase of $1.2 billion from last year, as their guide as they craft the state’s 2013-14 budget. "Our total education investment of $10.7 billion in state funding for K-12 schools this year is the highest state funding level in Florida history," he said. "This represents an increase of more than $400 in per student funding over the current fiscal year." Is he right? We’ll explain. Scott’s statement is carefully crafted to specify that his budget proposal would provide the highest state funding level ever. Scott’s proposal would be the highest ever in terms of the state government’s actual dollar investment. In second place would be the 2007-08 budget signed by Gov. Charlie Crist, when the state allocated $9.71 billion. But this doesn’t tell the entire story. Schools have a complex funding formula that involves a mix of local taxes, state dollars and, in recent years, federal stimulus money. If Scott had his way, Florida’s total K-12 education budget would be $18.47 billion (the Legislature decides how to spend the state’s dough). If Scott gets the budget he wants, it would not be the highest spending on education ever. It would trail the 2007-08 budget signed by Gov. Charlie Crist by $280 million. Education spending per student tells the same story. Yes, at $3,941, the state’s share of per-pupil spending in Scott’s budget would be the highest dollar investment. But this view again neglects the complete picture of education spending. Total per-pupil funding proposed in Scott’s budget would be $6,700. This would be a $412 increase from the current year, but it lags behind per-pupil spending of $7,126 in the 2007-08 budget signed by Crist. This is an important point: Six years ago, the state had fewer students but spent more money on each. Now we have 85,000 more students but spend less money on each one, according to Department of Education data. We wondered if Scott’s proposal would hold up as the state’s biggest education investment when adjusted for inflation. Using a Consumer Price Index calculator from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we compared Scott’s proposal with state spending on education for the past 10 years. We found state spending on education, when adjusted for inflation, would not be significantly different than it was from 2004 to 2007. Our ruling Scott talked up the state’s share of education spending in his budget proposal as an historic investment, and it is in terms of actual dollars. But his overall recommendation for education spending remains short of what Florida students received before the economic crash, and about the same as it was from 2004 to 2007 when considering inflation. Scott’s claim is partially accurate but missing important details. We rate it Half True.	None	Rick Scott	None	None	None	2013-03-05T15:38:19	2013-03-05	['None']
pomt-02126	Wendy Davis "was just doing a fund-raiser in Chicago with the international socialists organization."	pants on fire!	/texas/statements/2014/may/09/david-dewhurst/dewhurst-claim-wendy-davis-raised-money-socialists/	Wendy Davis became debate fodder late in a roundtable showdown between Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and state Sen. Dan Patrick, who will meet in a May 27, 2014, runoff for the Republican Party’s lieutenant governor nomination. Toward the end of their quarrelsome give-and-take joust, hosted May 7, 2014, by WFAA-TV in Dallas, Patrick blamed Dewhurst for igniting Davis’ gubernatorial bid with his oversight of the Texas Senate in the summer 2013 special legislative session in which Davis, a Democratic senator from Fort Worth, filibustered GOP-sought abortion restrictions. Dewhurst scoffed, saying that Republican Greg Abbott, the state attorney general, is winning the governor’s fray. "And Wendy Davis’s star is falling, not rising," Dewhurst said. "She was just doing a fund-raiser in Chicago with the international socialists organization." She was? We put that claim to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. We asked Dewhurst’s campaign spokeswoman, Eliza Vielma, for the basis of Dewhurst’s claim, and, by email, she pointed to May 6, 2014, Abbott campaign press release. The Abbott release quoted a Chicago Sun-Times news blog post previewing Davis as a featured guest at a May 5, 2014, Chicago fund-raiser for U.S. Rep. Jan Schakowsky, D-Ill. Abbott’s release also cited an Oct. 16, 2010, post on "The Corner," a National Review Online blog that describes itself as a "web-leading source of real-time conservative opinion." The 2010 post, by Stanley Kurtz, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Ethics & Public Policy Center, said that while researching his book, "Radical-in-Chief: Barack Obama and the Untold Story of American Socialism," he came across "documentary evidence" that Schakowsky was a member of the Democratic Socialists of America at the start of her political career. Kurtz closed his post by saying the "idea of socialist politicians working openly or quietly within the Democratic Party is not a wild impossibility but a real phenomenon." No documents were included in the post to back up Kurtz’s claim that Schakowsky was a member of the socialist group. So we followed up with him. By email, Kurtz said Schakowsky was an "active member" of Chicago’s DSA chapter in the 1980s, a conclusion he said he based on chapter newsletters from 1983 and 1986 that he said he viewed in archives at New York University. "I do not know how long" Schakowsky "remained a member of the DSA," Kurtz wrote. After we published this fact check, Kurtz told us by email, he sent Breitbart Texas copies of the relevant newsletter pages. Schakowsky is credited as the author of an article in the February/March 1983 issue of the Chicago Socialist, published by the Chicago chapter. Her article recapped a Joliet meeting of the Illinois Public Action Council, a mix of progressive groups. A June 1986 newsletter item, headlined "DSAers on the move," included a sentence stating that on the local political scene, a DSAer had been hired by the chairman of the Illinois Democratic Party while Schakowsky’s bid "for Cook County Board got a boost when she drew 2nd ballot position among 14 candidates." The Cook County Board of Commissioners is the county’s legislative body. Also by email, Bob Roman, secretary of the Chicago DSA chapter, told us the posted excerpts were authentic. Schakowsky’s House spokesman, Lee Whack, referred us to her campaign political director, Alex Armour, who didn’t engage. By telephone, Maria Svart, the national director of the DSA, noted the group is an activist and educational group and not a political party. She also reaffirmed what a predecessor in that role, Frank Llewellyn, told PolitiFact in 2011. To join the group, a person must fill out a form and pay dues, Llewellyn said, adding that the last member of Congress who was a card-carrying member was California Democratic Rep. Ron Dellums, who served 28 years in the House until leaving in 1998. Svart also said that while the group doesn’t announce its members, as far as she knows, Schakowsky isn’t a member and never was. Separately, we spotted a web post by the Chicago chapter of the DSA showing Schakowsky spoke at the group’s May 13, 2011, Eugene V. Debs-Norman Thomas-Michael Harrington dinner celebrating union organizers and other activists on the left. A May-June 2011 DSA recap said Schakowsky told guests that despite Democrats being the House minority, she was optimistic in that conservatives in Congress had over-reached. A DSA web page on the history of the annual dinner lists Schakowsky as the 2000 dinner’s honoree. That listing led to another web post detailing why Schakowsky was honored, touching on her actions as a consumer advocate and state and federal legislator. It didn’t speak to her membership (or not) in the DSA. By phone, Roman said Schakowsky is "not somebody that we claim as a member." He also said he generally doesn’t comment on whether anyone is current or former member. "Once you say ‘so and so’ is a member, was a member or was never a member, then you open yourself to queries about any single person who has ever been a member," Roman said. To our inquiry, Davis campaign spokesman Zac Petkanas (fairly new to Texas) said of Dewhurst’s statement: "That’s potentially the most absurd claim I’ve ever heard." Petkanas emailed us a copy of the invitation to the Schakowsky event attended by Davis. The invitation lacks mention of Davis--and lists Winstead as the star attraction. Petkanas also provided what he described as the prepared text of Davis’ remarks at the event, which do not include an appeal for donations to Schakowsky’s political kitty. "Davis stopped by the event to talk about Texas and give an update on her campaign," Petkanas said. Our ruling Dewhurst said Davis raised money in Chicago for a socialist organization. Davis appeared at a fund-raiser for a Democratic U.S. House member who may have participated in DSA chapter meetings in the 1980s. There’s no sign Schakowsky is a current DSA member, nor is there evidence Davis raised money for a socialist group. This claim shakes out as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

pomt-13447	"Over the last 40 years, this country’s prison population has grown by 500 percent."	mostly true	/california/statements/2016/sep/16/kamala-harris/mostly-true-americas-prison-population-has-skyrock/	During her run for U.S. Senate, California Attorney General Kamala Harris has touted a "smart on crime" approach that focuses on the most violent offenders and reducing recidivism. Harris believes this strategy is key to slowing what she claims is a dramatic rise in the nation’s prison population. "Over the last 40 years, this country’s prison population has grown by 500 percent," Harris said on her campaign website, and in a recent tweet that included a stark black and white picture of prison bars. "We have a responsibility to ensure agencies focus on preventing crime -- not just fighting crime after the fact," Harris added in the tweet. Harris is competing with U.S. Rep. Loretta Sanchez to replace retiring Sen. Barbara Boxer in November’s election. All three are Democrats. We decided to check whether Harris stretched the truth in her claim about the rapid rise in America’s prison population. Our research We relied on data from the Sentencing Project. The criminal justice advocacy group is considered a credible source for incarceration figures. Its data was cited by the national PolitiFact team in a recent fact check on a similar claim. The Sentencing Project’s data show there are 2.2 million people in the nation’s federal and state prisons and local jails -- a 500 percent increase over the past 40 years. For comparison, the overall United States population has increased just 51 percent during that period. Available numbers from the U.S. Justice Department’s Bureau of Justice Statistics agree with those from the Sentencing Project. Harris’ claim is slightly different in that it cites the nation’s spike in "prison population" rather than a combined increase in prisons and jail figures. Some might read her statement as including both prison and jail inmates, but there’s a significant difference between the two. To assess Harris’ more limited claim, we examined the rise of the prison population alone. The Sentencing Project’s data show the nation’s prison population grew from 218,466 in 1974 to 1,508,636 in 2014, which is a nearly 600 percent increase. Unlike most politicians, it appears Harris understated her legitimate point. More background Harris’ claim and stance on prison reform is significant given California’s overcrowded prisons. At nearly 600,000 people, California has the second largest correctional population among states, behind only Texas’ nearly 700,000, according to the U.S. Justice Department. Those figures include prison and jail inmates and people on probation and parole. Source: U.S. Justice Department Harris’ claim centers on the rise of prison inmates over the past four decades. Over the past few years, however, America has seen a decline in prisoners. The nationwide total dropped about 100,000 from 2009 to 2014, according to the Sentencing Project. Reforms in California account for much of that drop, as the state has reduced its prison population by about 50,000 following a 2009 federal court order to do so, according to a report by the Public Policy Institute of California. In November, Californians will vote on Proposition 57, a measure proposed by Gov. Jerry Brown designed to ease the state’s prison overcrowding. It would allow some offenders to be considered for parole earlier than now possible. A campaign spokesman said Harris has declined to take a position on Prop 57, or any ballot measure, because as attorney general she is charged with writing an independent summary and title for each measure. The spokesman pointed to data from the Sentencing Project and other academic reports to back up Harris’ claim about the prison population. Our ruling U.S. Senate candidate Kamala Harris recently said "Over the last 40 years, this country’s prison population has grown 500 percent." Data show the nation’s combined prison and jail population has grown 500 percent over this period. But when isolating just the prison population, the data shows that group has soared by nearly 600 percent. No matter how you crunch the numbers, they show a dramatic rise in incarceration -- one that actually exceeds what Harris stated. Her statement is on the right track, but needs this clarification. We rate it Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

pomt-06001	"Romney signed government-mandated health care with taxpayer-funded abortions."	mostly false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/jan/19/newt-gingrich/gingrich-ad-says-mitt-romney-enacted-taxpayer-fund/	Did Mitt Romney make taxpayer-funded abortion the law of the land in Massachusetts? That’s one claim in an attack ad put out by Newt Gingrich’s campaign, which says Romney called himself "pro-life" but "governed pro-abortion." "Romney signed government-mandated health care with taxpayer funded abortions," the ad says, as a downcast Romney appears onscreen, along with his signature. This is a claim that’s sure to be repeated, so we decided to look into it. What’s in the law? First, what’s not in the law: the word "abortion." The sweeping health care legislation Romney signed on April 12, 2006, aimed to extend health insurance coverage to nearly every Massachusetts resident. It included an individual mandate, requiring almost all Massachusetts residents to get insurance, leading to an insured rate of nearly 98 percent in the state. It required people who don't have health insurance to buy it or lose their individual state tax exemptions. To cover low-income people, private insurance companies developed low-cost plans that residents could buy through a new state-run insurance exchange called the Health Connector. But the law doesn’t address what is covered and what isn’t. Search the text of it, and "abortion" is nowhere to be found. "It doesn’t say in the law what is covered or not. It talks about health care and funding health care," said Anne Fox, president of Massachusetts Citizens for Life, which opposes abortion. Yes, abortion is covered A 1981 Supreme Judicial Court ruling in Massachusetts said that the cost of abortions had to be included in publicly subsidized plans. Most private insurance plans in the U.S. include abortion coverage, and the state-subsidized plans in Massachusetts do, too. So when the Health Connector began, abortion coverage was automatically included. In some of the low-cost plans, abortions are covered with a $50 co-pay. So Gingrich’s ad is right that some abortions in Massachusetts are "taxpayer-funded." But that requirement long predated the law Romney signed. "That was already a given," Fox said. "Anything that’s paid for with tax money, like Medicaid, covered abortions." Her group was part of an effort to overturn that requirement with a constitutional amendment, but it failed. "The combination of the court order and state-controlled health care means Romney really wasn’t involved in funding these abortions. It was automatic, and there would be no way to stop it," Fox said. "We tried. It would have to be a constitutional amendment. It would not be something somebody could just veto." Fox’s assessment lines up with that of an abortion-rights group we contacted: "NARAL Pro-Choice America’s position is that the Massachusetts health care plan enacted during former Gov. Romney’s tenure expanded on a system that already covered abortion. Thus, Romney should not get credit for improving women's access to abortion in Massachusetts," spokesman Ted Miller said in an email. Our ruling Gingrich’s ad says "Romney signed government-mandated health care with taxpayer-funded abortions." What’s right about that? Romney did sign government-mandated health care, and Massachusetts does provide taxpayer-funded abortions. But the ad inaccurately links the two together. The law Romney signed did not mention abortion coverage. It was included by the state exchange, which created plans that mirror private insurance nationwide. And a court decision two decades earlier mandated that the cost of the abortions be included. You’d never know any of that based on the misleading wording in the ad. We rate it Mostly False.

The NAEP is a top measure of student achievement, and APS’ NAEP scores improved under Hall’s term, Hall has said. One of her backers mentioned these scores in a New York Times article last month. Hall, herself, raised them Aug. 10 in a commentary published by the national trade publication Education Week. "The results of the standardized tests administered in 2010 and 2011 under this enhanced security have not been questioned -- and most important of all the dramatic improvement in test scores has remained. That improvement has also been confirmed by the National Assessment of Educational Progress, or NAEP, which is independently administered," Hall wrote. "Dramatic" improvement in scores on the Criterion-Referenced Competency Tests has been "confirmed" by the NAEP? We decided to take a look. First, a brief aside. We checked Hall’s claim that CRCT tests scores for 2010 and 2011 "have not been questioned" and gave her a Pants on Fire. State investigators, the Governor’s Office for Student Achievement and The Atlanta Journal-Constitution questioned the validity of both years’ results. We asked Hall’s attorney for evidence backing her claim about the national test but received no response. After our inquiry, Council of Great City Schools Executive Director Michael Casserly repeated a similar claim Sept. 7 in The New York Times, but the story included no supporting evidence. Hall previously served on the board of Casserly’s organization. Now, the NAEP is different from your typical standardized test. Like the CRCT, it tests core subjects such as reading and mathematics, but many students don’t take it. Those who do don’t take all of it. They don’t even get their results. Instead, the NAEP randomly selects a representative sample of students to take the test. They take slices of the exam over a single day. Historically, the NAEP has been used to track student achievement at the state and national level. During the past decade, however, about a dozen large urban districts were recruited for a special trial to see how well the test evaluates district performance. APS joined the trial in 2002. The test was not the focus of the state’s CRCT investigation, and a federal review found no evidence of NAEP cheating, said Arnold Goldstein, who is program director for the assessment division of the National Center for Education Statistics, the division of the U.S. Department of Education that oversees the NAEP. The federal review’s findings were not published in a report, so PolitiFact Georgia could not examine its work. Experts agree that it’s much more difficult to cheat on the NAEP than the CRCTs, and they give the following reasons: -- NAEP test administrators are federal contract workers, not APS employees, so they have little incentive to cheat. Some are retired APS teachers, but a federal testing official told PolitiFact that they all worked as part of three-member teams with colleagues who had no ties to APS. -- NAEP test materials are not kept in schools overnight or during the weekend. That’s when much of the CRCT cheating took place, according to the state investigation. -- Students are tested on multiple subjects during the same NAEP test session. While one is working on a reading exam, another might be doing mathematics, so they can’t copy each others’ answers. But cheating is not out of the question. Sonny Perdue, who as governor launched the state investigation into the CRCT scores, is a member of the board that oversees the NAEP. He suggested at an August board meeting that there may be weaknesses in the system but did not give details. He declined through a spokesman to comment for this story. APS critics say the district might have tipped scores in its favor by withholding names of low-performing students from the roster the NAEP uses to select its test-takers. The NAEP doesn’t check student rosters by name. The procedure is to see whether the list it receives from a school matches up with the school’s overall characteristics, Goldstein said. The NAEP review found no problems, Goldstein said. But the federal review focused on whether APS followed standard procedures -- not whether the rosters were accurate. To comply with privacy policies, NAEP administrators routinely destroy the rosters schools send them, Goldstein said. Therefore, we think it may be impossible to check whether APS sent accurate lists. Now, let’s take a closer look at the NAEP results starting in 2002, which is when APS began participating in the urban district program. We found that even if you ignore the possibility of cheating, it’s not clear the gains are dramatic. APS previously trumpeted that since 2002, its students demonstrated the largest gains of other large urban school districts on the NAEP reading tests. This is correct, but since that time, APS’ demographics have shifted toward whites and Hispanics -- groups that generally score higher on the NAEP, experts noted. For instance, in 2002, 6 percent of APS fourth-graders were white and 3 percent were Hispanic. By 2009, the percentage of white students more than doubled to 13 percent. Hispanics increased to 5 percent. "I think that demographic changes in the fourth grade account for 40 percent or so of the progress, but that’s not something anybody wanted to talk about or even to point out," said Mark Musick, an East Tennessee State University professor who once was chairman of the board that directs the NAEP. Also, APS’ NAEP marks aren’t all improvements. The score gap between whites and blacks remains the second-largest in the nation among large districts. In addition, children in poverty now lag even further behind their peers in reading. Furthermore, Atlanta still trails well behind other large urban districts in crucial areas. For instance, Atlanta’s eighth grade 2009 mathematics scores were lower than all others but Cleveland, the District of Columbia and Los Angeles. And at current rates, it will take Atlanta 50 to 110 years for all its students to become proficient, said Binghamton University education professor Lawrence Stedman, who thinks that the cheating scandal is proof that the U.S. needs to scrap its approach to high-stakes testing. What gains APS made slowed in recent years, he said in a recent analysis of the district’s NAEP scores. Even if we take the NAEP gains at face value, it’s not accurate to say they support CRCT gains. Though student achievement rose according to both measures, NAEP gains don’t quite match up to CRCT increases, and demographic shifts might account for a portion of the increase. That said, it’s not clear we can take the NAEP scores at face value. While a federal review of APS procedures found no red flags, the bulk of the district’s cheating on the state CRCT exam only became public knowledge after a rigorous investigation that looked beyond procedures. Such an inquiry has not taken place on the NAEP. And even if it did, it may not ever be possible to ensure that APS sent accurate rosters to NAEP administrators. The NAEP destroyed its copies. Both the CRCT and NAEP registered some gains, but the causes are unclear, the results are mixed and the district’s integrity remains in question. So many questions remain unanswered that it makes little sense to conclude that NAEP scores confirm "dramatic" gains on the CRCT. Hall therefore earns a False.

pomt-01021	"When you look at the earned income tax credit, it has about a 25 percent fraud rate. We're looking at $20 billion to $30 billion."	half-true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/jan/30/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-earned-income-tax-credit-has-25-per/	In what could be a prelude to the Republican presidential debate season, a handful of potential GOP contenders shared a stage at a recent conservative confab hosted by the deep-pocketed Koch brothers. Sens. Marco Rubio of Florida, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Ted Cruz of Texas cordially sparred on a host of issues at the Freedom Partners retreat on Jan. 25. One area of division was about whether to expand the Earned Income Tax Credit. The program is designed to incentivize low-income individuals to work by giving them a tax refund (technically a refundable tax credit) on money that is earned. For the very poor, the refund increases the more money they make, which encourages more work. Expanding the Earned Income Tax Credit is one area where there’s some agreement between President Barack Obama and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., the GOP’s go-to member for fiscal issues. But Rand Paul said Washington needed to pump the brakes on those proposals. "When you look at the earned income tax credit, it has about a 25 percent fraud rate," Paul said. "We're looking at $20 billion to $30 billion. And this is from estimates from the (Government Accountability Office), from the government themselves." We decided to check to see if Paul’s numbers add up. There are definitely problems with the Internal Revenue Service’s administration of the Earned Income Tax Credit, but they’re not all issues of fraud, as Paul claimed. In multiple reports, the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration has dinged the IRS for failing to take steps to prevent improper payments. Since 2002, the IRS has been required to report estimates of improper payments to Congress. In that time, "the IRS has made little improvement in reducing improper Earned Income Tax Credit payments," the inspector general wrote in 2013. The Earned Income Tax Credit is the only IRS program that is considered a high-risk for improper payments, the inspector general said in 2014. At the root of the problem is the complex nature of the tax credit: It is available to only low-income individuals, and it fluctuates based on earnings, number of children and other factors. The churn into and out of the program is high — about one-third of all recipients are first-timers, or their eligibility changes year-to-year due to swings in their income. This creates confusion among both recipients and administrators. The IRS said it is difficult to balance reducing improper benefits with encouraging people who qualify to use the credit. How prevalent are these improper payments? According to the inspector general, 22 to 26 percent of all payments are improper. And how much does that cost taxpayers? The entire program totaled $63 billion in 2013, meaning improper payments ranged from $13.3 billion to $15.6 billion. So Paul’s percentage was right, but he overstated the actual annual cost. Paul’s statement, his spokesman Brian Darling said, also included another tax credit highlighted by the auditor’s 2014 report, the Additional Income Tax Credit, which similarly provides refunds for some working families with children. The inspector general found improper payments between $5.9 billion and $7 billion in 2013. Combined, improper payments from the two programs would likely top $20 billion. Not all improper payments, however, are "fraud," as Paul put it. There are six issues that have led to improper payments, one of which is fraud. But none of them "can be considered the primary driver of the (Earned Income Tax Credit) improper payments," the report said. Improper payments had two root causes: authentication and verification. For example, an authentication problem would be if a parent claims a child that doesn’t live with the parent most of the time. A verification problem would be if a person claims to have a lower income than they have. About 70 percent of improper payments are due to authentication problems. "The biggest source of error has to do with family status," said Eric Toder, co-director of the Tax Policy Center and former director of research at the IRS. "The size of the EITC has to do with how many kids you have, and the definition of ‘child’ means they’re living with you half the time. And in many low-income homes, kids go back and forth between one parent or another, and it’s not obvious who should be claiming the child, or they’re claiming the child they shouldn’t be." Of course, there are also ways to make mistakes filing income taxes under both scenarios. The IRS doesn’t keep track of how many improper payments are due to fraud and how many are due to human error. Paul’s spokesman said the distinction is negligible. "At a minimum it is a fraud on the taxpayer, because they are the source for improper payments," Darling said. Why have there habitually been issues stopping these improper payments? Unlike other federal assistance like food stamps, which require an in-person application process to weed out potential fraud, the tax credit is handled entirely by the tax system. Another issue is the typical benefit per family is small. The average payout is about $3,000. The IRS might prioritize more costly fraud instead of targeting small-time scofflaws, Toder said. Attempts have been made in the past to increase the number of auditors to target fraud among these populations, Toder added. Other policy changes have attempted to fix the error rate, to little success. Our ruling Paul said the earned income tax credit has a 25 percent "fraud rate" at a cost to taxpayers of $20 billion to $30 billion. There is a history of improper payments with the Earned Income Tax Credit that has not been resolved, for various reasons, since the IRS began reporting it in 2002. It’s listed as the only IRS program deemed to have a high risk of improper payments. But Paul’s characterization of the problem as "fraud" is way too specific. Not every improper payment constitutes fraud, and the exact percentage of fraud is not known. Also, the amount of improper payments is less than Paul said -- between $13.3 billion and $15.6 billion. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate the claim Half True.	None	Rand Paul	None	None	None	2015-01-30T13:27:58	2015-01-25	['None']
pomt-00336	Says there is a report "that showed that, should we move to cover more people to a Medicare for All system, we could actually save the system trillions over an extended period of time."	half-true	/florida/statements/2018/sep/18/andrew-gillum/fact-checking-andrew-gillum-cost-medicare-all/	Andrew Gillum, the Democratic nominee for Florida governor, has attracted national attention for his support for "Medicare for All," an idea to expand the government-run Medicare health insurance program to cover everyone, rather than just Americans 65 and over. Under the plan Gillum supports, individuals (and their employers) would no longer need to shoulder co-pays for medical care or premiums for private insurance coverage. Instead, the government would pay everyone’s medical bills. It's based on a bill sponsored by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt. On CNN’s State of the Union, host Dana Bash asked Gillum about a George Mason University study that found Medicare for All could cost the government $33 trillion over 10 years. Bash asked whether Gillum be willing to tell Floridians they need to pay more in taxes to offset the costs. "Well, let me first say there was also a report, Dana, that showed that, should we move to cover more people to a Medicare for All system, we could actually save the system trillions over an extended period of time," Gillum said during the Sept. 2, 2018 interview. We confirmed with Gillum’s campaign that he and Bash were actually referring to the same report — one published by the free-market-oriented Mercatus Center at George Mason University. Both sides in the Medicare for All debate have seized upon aspects of the report to bolster their arguments. Critics, including the author of the report, emphasized that the policy would bring a substantial fiscal burden. But supporters found fiscal hope. When Sanders previously said that the study indicated that enacting Medicare for All "would save the American people $2 trillion over a 10-year period," we rated that claim Half True. We thought that the issue was worth a fresh look with Gillum's defense, especially given some slight differences in his phrasing. The Mercatus study Medicare for All supporters say the proposal would not only increase health-insurance coverage to 100 percent but that the government could actually save money. The savings, they say, would come from eliminating the profits currently generated by health insurers, from taking advantage of economies of scale, and from being able to leverage lower prices on everything from prescription drugs to physician reimbursement fees. Critics are skeptical that such savings would materialize, leaving taxpayers on the hook if they don't. They also worry about other negative consequences, such as mass retirements of doctors unwilling to accept lower fees. To settle this debate, Medicare for All supporters flip to the page in the Mercatus report summarizing the financial effects of Sanders’ bill. The researchers looked at two main scenarios after implementation of the proposal. One compared Mercatus’ projection for the Sanders Medicare for All bill with what would be expected under a continuation of the current system (according to a Department of Health and Human Services’ projection). With Medicare for All, the total amount of health care expenditures nationally would fall by $2.054 trillion over 10 years compared to the current system. So Gillum can point to some evidence in the study that predicts savings. However, the Mercatus report’s author, Charles Blahous, criticized that takeaway. In an August interview with PolitiFact, Blahous said that estimate is based on a relatively generous assumption about how well Sanders’ plan will end up controlling health care costs. It assumes that provider payments will be reduced to Medicare levels, that negotiation with prescription drugmakers will generate significant savings, and that administrative costs will be cut from 13 to 6 percent. Blahous was more confident about an alternative scenario published in the report, in which cost-control works less effectively. Mercatus found that over the same 10-year period, national health expenditures would actually increase by $3.252 trillion compared to current law. In addition, even if the switch to Medicare for All does end up cutting the total amount of money spent on health care in the United States, the legislation places more of those costs on the federal budget. In an era of rising debt and an aging Baby Boom generation, that could be a problem. The role of uncertainty In other words, there are a range of possible outcomes if Medicare for All is enacted, some supportive of Gillum’s perspective and some not. Independent health policy experts express caution before assuming large savings. Sustained cuts as deep as those projected in the Mercatus model that Gillum likes are "not likely feasible," John Holahan, a fellow in the health policy center at the Urban Institute, told us in August. His Urban Institute colleague, Linda Blumberg, agreed, saying it’s a "pretty heroic assumption to say that you can dial payment rates down to those levels system-wide politically." Christine Eibner, a health policy analyst with the RAND Corp., said that uncertainty makes it hard to predict the cost impact of Medicare for All, including whether administrative costs and reimbursements would decline or whether demand for health care services could be kept in check. In a recent report co-authored by Eibner that considered the impact of a single-payer model for New York state, RAND found that "the estimated effects are highly dependent on the assumptions about provider payment rates, administrative costs, and drug prices." Our ruling Gillum said there is a report "that showed that, should we move to cover more people to a Medicare for All system, we could actually save the system trillions over an extended period of time." Trillions in savings would be one of a range of possibilities for how Medicare for All enactment could play out. But it’s not the only one, and independent analysts say it’s far from a sure thing that Medicare for All would save as much money as Gillum hopes it will. The statement is partially accurate.

pomt-02043	Says Gov. Scott Walker "has made Wisconsin 2nd in the nation in losing jobs."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2014/jun/02/brett-hulsey/brett-hulsey-says-scott-walker-has-made-wisconsin-/	It’s well known that Gov. Scott Walker has faltered on his top 2010 campaign promise of creating 250,000 private-sector jobs in his first term. With his re-election looming in November 2014, he’s less than halfway there. So when state Rep. Brett Hulsey announced he was running in the Democratic primary to challenge Walker, it would seem he had an easy issue to raise. But even when running a shoestring campaign, those shoestrings can trip you up. In an April 30, 2014 news release -- issued at a time when the state GOP was poised to vote on a resolution proclaiming the right to secede from the United States -- Hulsey declared: "Governor Walker’s Reign of Error has made Wisconsin 2nd in the nation in losing jobs. To create a better future for our children, we should strive to be the best in the United States, not leave it." As evidence of his jobs claim, Hulsey cited a March 30, 2014 article from The Capital Times that discussed the Bureau of Labor Statistics monthly jobs report for February of 2014. That report said Wisconsin lost an estimated 9,500 jobs in February. Only North Carolina at 11,300 was worst; Alaska at 2,300 placed third. (These figures include both private-sector and government jobs. Walker’s campaign promise focused only on private sector jobs.) So, at least in terms of the February report, Hulsey’s claim was on point. But the jobs count cited in the article was based on monthly numbers, which are derived from a small sample of employers and often subject to dramatic changes. And Hulsey did not specify a month in his claim. Rather, he expressed it as a current condition. Indeed, by the time Hulsey made his statement the estimates for March were already out, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics had also revised the February figures. Two things in those numbers stand out: -- Wisconsin’s jobs number for February actually worsened with the revision, and the state fell behind North Carolina to the top, er, bottom spot. -- But the March figures said the state added 6,900 jobs in March. As for the No. 2 loser title, that month it belonged to Virginia (-5,000) which followed Pennsylvania (-8,400) By either measure, Hulsey was wrong -- in one case slightly so, in the other wildly so. Our rating Hulsey said Walker "has made Wisconsin 2nd in the nation in losing jobs." He cherry-picked a report for a single month but spoke of it as a longer-term trend. What’s more, the data was already outdated at the time, so he was wrong when he said it. We rate his statement False.

pomt-11977	California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom was "for (high-speed rail), before he’s against it, and then he’s for it again."	mostly true	/california/statements/2017/sep/29/antonio-villaraigosa/has-gavin-newsom-flip-flopped-californias-high-spe/	High-speed rail has wedged itself into the 2018 campaign for California governor, splitting the current top two Democrats in the race. Former Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa recently claimed Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom — the frontrunner in the race — has essentially flip-flopped in his support for the state’s controversial and costly rail project. Here’s what Villaraigosa told the Sacramento Bee on Sept. 20, 2017: Newsom was "for it, before he’s against it, and then he’s for it again." He added that Newsom was revising his positions "when the winds blow in his direction." Given the key decisions California’s next governor will need to make on high-speed rail, we wanted to know whether Newsom has really shifted this much in his support for the massive project. We hopped aboard for a fact-check. Background on the bullet train In 2008, California voters approved a nearly $10 billion bond to jump-start the development of a high-speed rail network. Plans called for trains to zip across the state at 200 miles per hour, initially connecting San Francisco to Los Angeles and eventually extending the system to Sacramento and San Diego. Cost estimates for the project, however, have see-sawed from an initial $33 billion to $98 billion to $64 billion. The project has also fallen far behind schedule with construction limited to a small segment in the Central Valley. We asked Villaraigosa’s campaign for evidence of Newsom’s shifting positions. As examples of his initial support, it pointed to news articles showing Newsom backing the 2008 bond measure. The campaign then cited a 2014 radio interview that it says proves Newsom opposed the project. Finally, it cited articles from October 2016 in which the lieutenant governor again pledged his support. "We absolutely need this," Newsom said of high-speed rail in a 2007 Mercury-News article. In February 2014, however, Newsom was asked by conservative radio host Ben Shapiro: "Are you pro or against the train, especially now that the California public, which approved the train in the first place, has reneged and no longer likes the train?" Newsom responded: "I think I’m where the public was and is." A poll in September 2013 found 52 percent of Californians wanted the rail project stopped and 51 percent felt it was a waste of money. Newsom went on to tell Shapiro:"We don’t have the federal dollars we were hoping for ... the private sector hasn’t stepped up." Shapiro then asked: "If you had your druthers, Gavin, would you kill the thing?" Newsom responded: "I would take the dollars and redirect it to other, more pressing infrastructure needs. … I am not the only Democrat that feels this way. I gotta tell you, I am one of the few that just said it publicly. Most are now saying it privately." This exchange gave many the impression Newsom had backed away from the project. Newsom did not clarify in the interview what kind of funds should be redirected. In October 2016, Newsom told the Sacramento Press Club that he would "100 percent" seek a solid funding source for the train project if he's elected governor in 2018. The Associated Press took that to mean he again supported the project. A March 2017 poll found Californians remain divided over high-speed rail, with 48 percent favoring the project and 46 percent opposed. The survey added that 66 percent say they would favor high-speed rail if it cost less than the current estimate of $64 billion over the next 20 years. In this Feb. 26, 2016, file photo, the supports for a 1,600-foot-viaduct to carry high-speed rail trains across the Fresno River are seen under construction near Madera, Calif. (AP Photo/Rich Pedroncelli, File) Newsom’s response Dan Newman, Newsom’s campaign spokesman, described Villaraigosa’s claim about shifting positions this way: "The statement is extremely misleading at best," he said in an email. "Villaraigosa is simply trying to score political points with a disingenuous cheap shot, by blithely ignoring the fact that the project being discussed today is significantly different than what voters supported in 2008." The spokesman said Newsom has "never opposed" high-speed rail. Instead, Newsom publicly scrutinized the project’s business plan when cost estimates ballooned to nearly $100 billion and questioned Gov. Jerry Brown’s plans to use cap and trade funds for it, the spokesman said. "Scrutinizing the business plan is very different from opposing (high-speed rail)," Newman added. He said Newsom’s comment in the 2014 radio interview about redirecting money away from the project was referring to redirecting cap and trade money away from it, not the state bond money passed by voters. He said a statement from Newsom’s office in March 2014 clarifies Newsom’s consistent support even as he questioned the project’s finances: "The lieutenant governor has long supported high speed rail and still does, but this project in its current form gives him pause," Newsom’s spokeswoman Andrea Koskey, told Buzzfeed News for an article on March 27, 2014. He added that Newsom’s statements of support in more recent years are also consistent with previous comments. Experts we spoke with were split on the claim. Sacramento State Political Science Professor Wesley Hussey said Villaraigosa’s claim about Newsom vacillating on the project isn’t right. "I don't think it's a fair assessment," the professor said in an email."Newsom came out several years ago with serious doubts about the high speed rail, but I don't think he's ever said definitely he would stop the program if he became governor. Maybe he fluctuates from lukewarm to a soft no, but that's not the same as consistently changing his opinion." Key to our assessment, however, was the 2014 radio interview and Newsom’s own admission that he agreed with the growing public sentiment that opposed the train at that time. We spoke with one more expert. Lou Thompson is chairman of the California High-Speed Rail Peer Review Group, an independent oversight group that issues reports to the Legislature on the project. He declined to comment about whether he believed Newsom had definitely switched his stance on high speed rail. Thompson said, however, that redirecting cap and trade money away from the project in 2014, as Newsom suggested doing, would have made the project’s future "a lot more difficult." Asked whether such a move would have effectively killed the project, Thompson said: "I don’t know what other source of money they would have found." He described cap and trade money as the key revenue source for the project both then and now, given the restrictions on other sources, including the bond funds. Our rating Villaraigosa claimed Newsom has essentially flip-flopped in his support for California’s high-speed rail, saying he was "for it, before he’s against it, and then he’s for it again." Villaraigosa’s campaign cited articles showing Newsom strongly backed the project a decade ago. It also pointed to a radio interview in 2014 in which Newsom admitted that he shared the public’s growing opposition to high-speed rail. He also suggested redirecting funds away from the project, a move that the head of the project’s oversight panel said would have made building high-speed rail "a lot more difficult." A spokesman for Newsom’s campaign defended the candidate’s stance, saying Newsom has scrutinized project costs as they have soared beyond initial estimates. He said, however, that Newsom has never turned his back on high-speed rail. We found Villaraigosa pointed to key evidence, particularly the 2014 radio interview, that shows Newsom’s stance had shifted, at least for that moment in time. In fairness to Newsom, he’s consistently expressed concern that the project no longer represents what voters supported in 2008 and that his main worry was its cost.

pomt-12165	"Hillary Clinton has third heart attack — docs says she ‘won’t survive’."	pants on fire!	/punditfact/statements/2017/aug/03/blog-posting/hillary-clinton-not-dead-heart-attack-fake-news-si/	An online story about former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton suffering not just one heart attack, but three, is a fake news story concocted by a parody site run by a liberal troll. "Breaking: Hillary Clinton has third heart attack — docs says she ‘won’t survive’," read the headline on a July 28, 2017, post on PoliticsPaper.com. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. The article called Clinton the "Butcher of Benghazi" and quoted Dr. Eugene Icsa of Westchester Memorial Hospital in upstate New York as saying, "We predict she’ll be at rest within hours." The story further said daughter Chelsea was visiting, but husband and former President Bill Clinton was "sitting on the front porch of the Chappaqua mansion drinking what looks like either tomato juice or a Bloody Mary." There have been no other reports of Hillary Clinton suffering a massive coronary episode; it’s because she hasn’t. The story is fake. The photo ostensibly of a doctor feverishly working to save Clinton’s life is actually a stock photo we most recently found on a Seattle Times story about the challenges facing trauma nurses. There’s not even a Westchester Memorial Hospital in upstate New York, as far as we can tell. There is a Westchester Medical Center in Westchester, N.Y., but that’s it. This item was originally posted on July 22 on TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a website run by a man named Christopher Blair, who creates absurd news stories in an attempt to fool conservative readers. A footnote on the bottom of the website said that "everything on this site is a satirical work of fiction." The warning is repeated in the About Us section, where a disclaimer reads, "We present fiction as fact and our sources don’t actually exist." This site and its troll-run brethren like to write about Clinton’s death quite a bit. OurLandOfTheFree.com, a related website, wrote on July 13 that Clinton died of an overdose of Dilaudid, which is a brand-name of the opioid painkiller hydromorphone. TheLastLineOfDefense.org also ran a series of stories in which Hillary and Chelsea Clinton died in a boating accident that was the result of sabotage. Clinton is still very much in the news, since Republican members of Congress continue to push for investigations into her own campaign activities. But she’s still alive.

pomt-13674	Trade deals threaten "India’s role as the pharmacy of the developing world" for new HIV medicines.	mostly true	/global-news/statements/2016/aug/03/doctors-without-borders/do-trade-deals-threaten-india-low-cost-hiv-drug-ma/	If there was one success story to emerge from the International AIDS Conference in Durban, South Africa, it was that more people are getting treated for HIV/AIDS than ever before -- about 17 million by the latest United Nations estimate. Falling drug prices played a key role in helping providers reach this point. But the international health group Doctors Without Borders (Médecins Sans Frontières) warned at a press conference that trade negotiations around the world put future gains at risk. The group said its latest report "examines multiple global threats to access to affordable treatment, including trade deals which threaten India’s role as the ‘pharmacy of the developing world.’" Trade is at the center of the U.S. presidential election for its effect on the American work force. But is there more at play? We wondered if it’s true that the next round of agreements, both those that involve the United States and those that don’t, would undermine some large drug makers in India. Why India India matters because thanks to the country’s patent laws, India and generics go together like toast and jam. The rules there make it easier than other places for companies to churn out generic drugs once the patent on the original version runs out. Generics are cheaper than their brand name cousins and if you want to stretch a dollar, you take the generic option. Doctors Without Borders said 97 percent of the drugs it uses to treat people with HIV are generics made in India. That includes medicines for HIV itself, as well as for diseases like pneumonia and tuberculosis that hit people with suppressed immune systems. Doctors Without Borders is worried less about the drugs it uses today and more about the ones it’s counting on in the future. As the number of people coming in for treatment rises, doctors are finding more who don’t respond to the most common, or first-line, medications. Doctors Without Borders is focused on making second-and-third-line drugs more affordable to keep pace with a growing need, and they see India as the place to make that happen. Impact of trade deals Although the Trans-Pacific Partnership gets a lot of attention in the United States, India is not part of it. But it is part of discussions involving the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, a mega-regional pact that aims to tie together 16 countries including China, India, Australia, Japan, South Korea and many other Asian nations. The European Union is also seeking a regional trade agreement with India and other Asian countries. Both of those trade negotiations have sought to get India to tighten its patent laws. The United States has too, through a one-on-one process overseen by the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. The issues that office has raised mirror ones in the big trade deals. The USTR’s latest report criticizes India’s patent laws, saying "the pharmaceutical industry in particular faces a host of challenges related to intellectual property rights." What do U.S. trade negotiators not like in particular? For one, India is reluctant to grant new patents for a drug or blend of drugs built around medications that already enjoy patent protection. These so-called secondary patents extend the time for the drug maker to enjoy exclusive production rights. That translates into a chance to charge higher prices. American officials also don’t care for India’s rules on clinical trial information. When someone invents a drug, they have to prove it’s safe and effective. That proof is in the trial reports. India lets generic drug makers rely on the original clinical trials. One way to extend the exclusive right to make a drug is to bar generic drug makers from using that data for a number of years. Would these sorts of changes make life easier for the makers of new drugs and harder for the generic manufacturers? We found no dispute that they would. We talked with independent experts who think India should stand its ground and those who thought it ought to bend, but either way, they agreed on who wins and who loses. There are good arguments on both sides for protecting the profits of companies that invent new drugs, versus making drugs more affordable. We take no position on the larger question of where the right balance point falls. We're focused only on the claim that large trading partners want to move Indian law in favor of the inventors of new drugs. Lee Branstetter is a professor and trade specialist at Carnegie Mellon University. He thinks Indian law ought to change at the expense of the generic companies. "In the short run, this will constrain the profit opportunities for the generic producers," he told us. Srividhya Ragavan, a professor of law at Texas A&M, thinks India’s laws strike the right balance as they are. She told us she sees the U.S. position as "an effort to weaken India’s generic drug industry." We found any number of articles that reached the same conclusion. But just because Branstetter and Ragavan see eye to eye on how these policy shifts would undermine generic drug makers, that doesn't mean they agree on what this means for the availability of low-cost drugs. Ragavan told us "the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership and EU’s trade negotiations, are all targeting India’s generic drug industry much to the detriment of access to medication to the poor people." Branstetter said that’s unlikely and highlights an important feature in the overarching trade rules of the World Trade Organization. The escape hatch Branstetter said based on what he’s seen in other countries (he cited Peru as an example) he doubts that would happen. But even if it did, he said, a part of the WTO code -- the Doha Declaration on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Agreement -- gives countries the chance to override a patent that limits a drug’s availability. Branstetter calls it an escape hatch. "Any member state could declare we have a public health emergency," Branstetter said. "Then, they can force the company that holds the patent to licence the manufacture of that drug to a domestic or foreign drug producer, who would provide it at an agreed price." Branstetter notes that the Trans-Pacific Partnership specifically requires any country that signs it to accept that Doha declaration. Countries have taken this step before. At the height of the AIDS crisis in the mid 2000s, Indonesia, Malaysia, Ghana, Mozambique and many others issued what are called compulsory licenses to get affordable HIV/AIDS drugs to their citizens. Still, Rohit Malpani, director of policy of the Doctors Without Borders- Access Campaign, told us that in recent years, the number of compulsory licenses has fallen off. "Even if countries have the right to use the safeguard and can use them they do not," Malpani said. He suggested several reasons, including a lack of political will and pressure from the United States, the EU and the drug companies. Our ruling Doctors Without Borders said that trade deals threaten the capacity of Indian generic drug makers to produce the next round of HIV drugs. We found that trade negotiations, whether part of large regional trade agreements or unilateral discussions between the United States and India, have language that work against India generic drug makers. They push India to be more ready to grant patents for drugs that are extensions of drugs that already enjoy patent protection. And they want India to bar generic drug makers from relying on the clinical trial data produced by the inventor of the drug. Both measures would make patents last longer and give the drug companies more time to charge higher prices. None of the articles we read or experts we reached doubted this result or that this would undermine the generic drug makers. Our experts disagreed on whether this would reduce access to critical drugs. The trade deals do no favors for India’s generic drug makers. With a caveat about future access to drugs, we rate this claim Mostly True.	None	Doctors Without Borders	None	None	None	2016-08-03T11:24:05	2016-07-21	['India']

pomt-03325	"Most of the U.S. Senate is comprised of multimillionaires."	mostly true	/new-jersey/statements/2013/jul/25/sheila-oliver/sheila-oliver-says-us-senate-mostly-made-multi-mil/	Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver says the U.S. Senate doesn’t look enough like the rest of America. It’s mostly just a bunch of multimillionaires, the Essex County Democrat claims. As one of four candidates in the Aug. 13 Democratic primary to fill the U.S. Senate seat previously held by the late Frank Lautenberg, Oliver has presented herself to voters as a hard-working individual from humble beginnings. Oliver is competing against Newark Mayor Cory Booker and Congressmen Rush Holt and Frank Pallone. "Many of our senators have not lived the life of an average working-class person," Oliver said in a July 11 interview on NJToday. "Most of the U.S. Senate is comprised of multimillionaires." For the most part, Oliver’s claim is on the money. Most current senators had an average net worth in 2011 of more than $1 million, but less than a majority were "multimillionaires" with several million dollars, according to an analysis of financial disclosure forms by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics. The Washington, D.C.-based center’s analysis is based on financial disclosure forms filed by members of Congress when they were already in office or running as candidates last year. After subtracting the liabilities from the assets, the center estimates a range of net worth. The most recent data available on the center’s website covers 2011 and includes 98 of the 100 current senators. Only Sen. Jeff Chiesa of New Jersey -- who was appointed as an interim replacement for Lautenberg -- and Brian Schatz of Hawaii are not included in the database of personal finances for 2011. Of those 98 current senators, 62 had an average net worth of more than $1 million, according to the center. Among those 62 senators, 13 had between $1 million and $2 million; 6 had between $2 million and $3 million; and 43 senators had more than $3 million, the center states. Based on those 2011 figures, the wealthiest senator was Mark Warner of Virginia, who had an average net worth of slightly more than $228 million, according to the center. The poorest senator was Florida’s Marco Rubio with negative $45,494 in average net worth, the center states. The annual salary for most senators is $174,000. Senate leaders earn $193,400 per year. Since less than a majority of senators had an average net worth of several million dollars in 2011, Oliver’s claim about "multimillionaires" is slightly off. Still, most senators at least had more than $1 million. In response to our findings, Oliver spokesman Michael Makarski made the following statement: "Speaker Oliver was making the point that average working and middle class people are underrepresented, and that Congress and Washington in general are out of touch with mainstream Americans." Some political science experts said the number of millionaires in the Senate is related to the expense of running a Senate campaign and the prestige of being a senator. "The Senate is the big boy's and big girl's...sandbox," Ross Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers University, said in an e-mail. "You get all your calls returned." Richard Arenberg of Brown University’s Taubman Center for Public Policy and American Institutions, who worked on Capitol Hill for about 34 years, also noted how wealthier individuals are more likely able to meet the demands of running for Senate and maintaining the office. "My theory would be that it is a challenge to live the lifestyle expected of a senator, including maintaining homes in Washington and their home states, if the senator is living solely on a senator's salary," Arenberg said in an e-mail. "The campaign demands also play a role in the sense that a campaign for the Senate these days takes a fulltime commitment for up to two years," Arenberg added. "Many people cannot break from their careers and make the financial sacrifice to do that." Our ruling In an NJToday interview, Oliver claimed: "Most of the U.S. Senate is comprised of multimillionaires." Based on financial data analyzed by the Center for Responsive Politics, 62 current senators had an average net worth in 2011 of more than $1 million. Of those senators, 13 had between $1 million and $2 million; 6 had between $2 million and $3 million; and 43 senators had more than $3 million. We rate the statement Mostly True. To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com. Editor's Note: After this story was published, we learned that Massachusetts Sen. Edward Markey is included in the database of personal finances for 2011 as a congressman. We have revised the story to show that 62 senators had an average net worth in 2011 of more than $1 million.

pomt-11034	"Our courts find that 80 percent of those who do file for asylum aren’t qualified for it, do not merit that relief."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2018/jul/02/jeff-sessions/jeff-sesssions-false-claim-80-percent-asylum-appli/	Attorney General Jeff Sessions defended the Trump administration’s "zero-tolerance" policy to prosecute all immigrants who enter the United States illegally, saying not prosecuting them would be a "disservice" to the country and an "insult" to those who come to the United States legally. Sessions said "adults are only being arrested" because they didn’t come to the United States through a port of entry "where they could have applied for asylum lawfully." (That’s not accurate. Immigrants can apply for asylum even if apprehended at the border, regardless of immigration status.) "But many do not apply for asylum, of course" Sessions said June 25 before the National Association of School Resource Officers. "And our courts find that 80 percent of those who do file for asylum aren’t qualified for it, do not merit that relief." Is Sessions accurate that 80 percent of immigrants who apply for asylum "do not merit the relief"? We asked the Justice Department about Sessions’ claim, pointing to Sessions’ prepared remarks posted on the department’s website saying: "courts find that 80 percent of asylum claims are without merit." In fiscal year 2017 there was a 20 percent grant rate for asylum applications, "which suggests that most are not meritorious," Justice Department spokesman Devin M. O’Malley told PolitiFact. But experts told us it’s not that clear cut that the remaining 80 percent of asylum applications are not merited. There are several other reasons why an asylum claim is not granted, experts told us. Here’s a closer look at the issue. Asylum data The Justice Department pointed to immigration court statistics, particularly a table on asylum rates for the latest full fiscal year, 2017. A footnote for that table said the data is for asylum decisions on affirmative and defensive applications issued in completed removal, deportation, exclusion, and asylum-only proceedings. ("Affirmative asylum" is filed voluntarily with Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services; if USCIS is unable to approve a case, the agency may refer it to immigration court within the Justice Department. "Defensive asylum" applications go before an immigration judge and are filed by individuals who are in removal proceedings.) Here’s what the 2017 asylum rates said: • Grant rate: 20.22 percent • Denial rate: 33.51 percent • Other closure rate: 27.66 percent • Administrative closure rate: 18.61 percent The "other" rate is for cases that have a decision of abandonment, not adjudicated, other, or withdrawn. The administrative closure rate covers "decisions that have not been placed back on the docket following a granted motion to recalendar," the footnote for the table said. Just because the grant rate is about 20 percent, it does not mean that an 80 percent aren’t qualified, or don’t merit relief, as Sessions claimed. As the Justice Department table showed, there are several other factors at play. It’s also worth noting that the data the Justice Department highlighted includes "affirmative asylum" cases, which initiate with USCIS and are referred to immigration court. Affirmative asylum applicants are not in removal proceedings, as would be people apprehended at the border due to the "zero-tolerance" policy. Denise Gilman, a clinical professor and director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, pointed to other data released in the Justice Department’s fiscal year 2016 statistics yearbook. It showed a 31 percent grant rate in 2016 for defensive asylum claims. Border claims would fall into that pile (along with some others), Gilman said. Experts weigh in Immigration law experts told us that some asylum cases can also be denied while still having viable claims. It is not accurate to infer that because only 20 percent of claims were granted that the rest were not meritorious, said Jennifer Gordon, a law professor at Fordham Law School. "Many cases are denied for procedural reasons not related to the merit of the claim, or because the applicants are unrepresented or poorly represented and therefore don't have the chance to make their case in an effective way," Gordon said. She also said that cases decided by asylum officers are not counted in the immigration court statistics. Access to counsel significantly impacts the outcome of a case, said Lori A. Nessel, a law professor and director of Seton Hall University School of Law's Center for Social Justice. "When asylum-seekers are detained, they are much less likely to have lawyers and without lawyers, they are less likely to even seek asylum or other relief, much less be granted," Nessel said. Immigrants, including asylum applicants, also do fare better in some courts than in others, said Stephen Meili, associate professor of law at the University of Minnesota Law School. An October 2017 story published on NJ.com noted disparities in outcome of cases, with immigrants faring better in courts in Newark, N.J. than in Atlanta. Greater access to lawyers in the Newark and New York area could determine success in courts, the story said. In discussing merit, it's also important to count the number of cases that are reversed by the board of immigration appeals or by one of the circuit courts of appeals, said James Hathaway, a law professor and director of the Program in Refugee and Asylum Law at the University of Michigan Law School. Our ruling Sessions said, "Our courts find that 80 percent of those who do file for asylum aren’t qualified for it, do not merit that relief." Sessions’ claim is based on Justice Department data showing a 20 percent asylum grant rate in 2017. But that doesn’t necessarily mean that the remaining 80 percent were without merit. The data the Justice Department used to support Sessions’ remark actually undercut his point. Some cases had not been adjudicated or placed in the court docket. Immigration law experts also said that even if a case is denied, it could still be meritorious, but unsuccessful in court because an applicant did not have a lawyer. Sessions’ claim is not accurate.

pomt-13879	"As Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton laundered money to Bill Clinton through Laureate Education, while Bill Clinton was an honorary chairman of the group."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2016/jul/01/donald-trump/did-hillary-clinton-launder-millions-dollars-while/	Donald Trump assailed Hillary Clinton’s credibility in a rapid response email following her speech on economics on June 21. Trump claimed that Clinton used her role as secretary of state as a vehicle to funnel government money to her husband. "As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton laundered money to Bill Clinton through Laureate Education, while Bill Clinton was an honorary chairman of the group," the email said. "Clinton's State Department provided $55.2 million in grants to Laureate Education from 2010-2012. Laureate thanked Bill for providing unbelievable access to the secretary of state by paying him off $16.5 million. This is yet another example of how Clinton treated the State Department as her own personal hedge fund, and sold out the American public to fund her lavish lifestyle." Laureate Education is a network of more than 80 for-profit educational institutions that operate in 30 countries. Bill Clinton was named Laureate’s honorary chancellor in 2010 and maintained this position until 2015. His role chiefly consisted of advising the company on educational matters and traveling to campuses across the world to speak to young people. The Trump campaign did not respond to our requests for clarification, but his argument seems to be based off of claims made in Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash. In the book, Schweizer describes what he calls the "Clinton blur" between the activities of Bill and Hillary Clinton, the State Department and associated nonprofits and corporations. We decided to investigate Trump’s claim that Hillary Clinton, who was secretary from 2009 through early 2013, "laundered" money to Laureate to pay off her husband’s salary. We ultimately found that there is zero evidence that Laureate received any money from the federal government while Clinton was at the State Department. Bill Clinton and Laureate Education Neither Bill Clinton nor Laureate Education disclosed his compensation as honorary chancellor. However, his tax returns show that Laureate paid him approximately $16.5 million between 2010 and 2014. We looked to usaspending.gov to find out if Laureate received any funding from the State Department. The site tracks the amount of money given to various organizations through government grants and contracts. According to this database, Laureate did not receive any money from any federal agency while Bill Clinton was in his role, nor while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. State Department Spokesperson John Kirby said in a statement, "The State Department is not aware of any grants provided directly to Laureate Education since 2009, though we are aware of some grants to educational institutions within or affiliated with the Laureate Education network." The International Youth Foundation Clinton Cash draws a connection between Laureate Education and the International Youth Foundation, a nonprofit that supports youth employment, entrepreneurship and social innovation across the world. The book notes that Laureate Chairman Douglas Becker is also chairman of the foundation’s board of directors. The foundation’s profile on usaspending.gov shows that it received approximately $72.6 million in grants between fiscal years 2009 and 2013. Trump gets to his $55.2 million figure by summing the grant money received between 2010 and 2012. We looked at the grant money given to the International Youth Foundation by the government between 2009 and 2013. FY 2009: $9M from USAID FY 2010: $17M from USAID FY 2011: $14.6M from USAID FY 2012: $23.6M from USAID. $1.9 million from State Department. FY 2013: $10.4M from USAID The grant money shown on usaspending.gov appears to have sharply increased while Hillary Clinton was at the State Department, which is the gist of the claim that Trump’s source makes. However, he fails to mention several key facts that undermine the logic of his claim. First, the International Youth Foundation had been receiving similar amounts of grant money before Hillary Clinton joined the State Department. An open letter by CEO William Reese claims that they negotiated a grant in 2008 under President George W. Bush for $30.2 million for a USAID mission in Jordan. He says that the money from this grant was handed out over several years, overlapping with new grants from President Barack Obama, giving the false impression that funding had sharply increased after Clinton became secretary of state. We looked at financial records provided by the foundation and confirmed the existence and size of the grants. The records show that approximately $24 million from the grant was dispensed between 2010 and 2012. Second, almost all of the grants came from USAID, which is a separate agency than the State Department. Is it possible that Hillary Clinton had influence over the USAID grant process while she was secretary of state? A State Department spokesperson told us the two agencies have separate grant and contract offices, separate procurement offices and their own rules with regards to the grant process. "State would not have oversight of or be involved in the USAID grant process — grants are let through a competitive process that the agency itself undertakes," said Jennifer Kates, vice president and director of Global Health & HIV Policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, who is familiar with the agencies’ grant processes. Finally, there is no evidence to indicate that the International Youth Foundation is a sister organization of Laureate that could be used to transfer money to the company. Schweizer points to Douglas Becker to imply that the organizations are linked. However, Becker isn’t paid for his position at the foundation and has no official executive role. In an interview with PolitiFact, Reese of the International Youth Foundation expanded on their relationship with Laureate. "If we were a subordinate organization we would have to state that in our 990. If we were to transfer money over to Laureate we would have to put that," Reese said. "We’ve received money from Laureate but never given money to them." Reese stated that the two organizations have worked together on a variety of projects related to global development in the past, such as a relief project for the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The foundation’s records show that it’s been receiving between $100,000 and $1.4 million per year from Laureate since 2003, seven years before Bill Clinton joined Laureate. When we asked about any relationship Bill Clinton had with the International Youth Foundation, Reese said, "No contractual or employment or consulting agreements have been made with President Clinton." The foundation’s profile on Charitynavigator.org, a site that ranks nonprofits according to transparency and accountability, shows that it’s a respected charity with a score of 94.26 out of 100 possible points. The foundation has worked with various other high-profile partners such as Nokia and Barclays since 1990. Our ruling Trump said Hillary Clinton "laundered money to Bill Clinton through Laureate Education, while Bill Clinton was an honorary chairman of the group." That's a serious of charge of illegal activity. Actually, the State Department under Clinton never made any direct transfers to Laureate Education. Trump’s source conflates Laureate with a separate charitable organization that received funds from a separate government agency. The International Youth Foundation is a respected nonprofit that has received money from the government since the Bush years, before Clinton joined the State Department. We rate this claim False.

Scott Walker took a new approach when asked about his jobs record during the first GOP presidential debate on Aug. 6, 2015. Fox News anchor Chris Wallace reminded viewers that Walker promised in 2010 that state employers would create 250,000 jobs in his first four-year term. "In fact, Wisconsin added barely half that and ranked 35th in the country in job growth," Wallace said, addressing Walker. "Now you're running for president, and you're promising an economic plan in which everyone will earn a piece of the American dream," he said. "Given your record in Wisconsin, why should voters believe you?" Walker responded that the state’s unemployment rate has declined from more than 8 percent in the depths of the Great Recession to 4.6 percent, and that the state had "more than made up for the jobs that were lost during the recession." Then he turned to the claim we want to check: "And the rate in which people are working is almost five points higher than it is nationally." Is he right? And is that something new under Walker? About the statistic Walker’s campaign said he was referring to the Labor Force Participation Rate, a measuring stick created by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. The participation rate includes "the number of people who are either employed or are actively looking for work," according to Investopedia.com. It does not include those who are no longer actively searching for work. It’s a different vantage point than the more typically used unemployment rate. As of June 2015, the state’s rate was 67.9 percent. That compares with the national rate of 62.6 percent. Thus, Wisconsin’s rate is about 5.3 percentage points higher than the national one. So, Walker is correct on the number. (A note: the national figures come from a different set of data, the Current Population Survey, while the state figures are from the Local Area Unemployment Statistics.) The history behind the numbers But, a deeper look shows that the state’s performance predates his time in office. That is, Wisconsin’s labor force participation has exceeded the nation’s for years. For instance, in 2010 -- the year before Walker took office -- the state’s participation rate was 63.4 percent, compared with 58.5 percent nationally. That was a difference of 4.9 points, at a time when the economy was just beginning to emerge from the recession. Wisconsin’s high water mark was 71.8 percent in 1997, compared with 63.8 percent nationally, a difference of 8 points. Nationally, the number reached a high in 2000, at 64.4 percent. Wisconsin has topped that figure in 24 of the past 38 years. Our rating In the debate, Walker said "the rate in which people are working (in Wisconsin) is almost five points higher than it is nationally." He’s right on the numbers, but the same statement could have been true had it been made by any of his seven immediate predecessors, Republican and Democrat. That important bit of context was missing from his claim. We rate it Mostly True.	None	Scott Walker	None	None	None	2015-08-21T10:00:00	2015-08-06	['Wisconsin']

pomt-04764	Mitt Romney "gave away his father's inheritance."	true	/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/27/reince-priebus/republican-national-committee-chair-reince-priebus/	Mitt Romney, the self-made man. That’s part of the "Mitt Romney story" that Republicans plan to tell at their convention in Tampa this week. His father may have been well-to-do, but Republicans have been emphasizing for weeks that Romney made his millions on his own. Romney’s father, George, was chief executive of Detroit automaker American Motors Corp. and a three-time governor of Michigan who ran for president in the 1960s. Mitt grew up in a wealthy Michigan suburb, attending prep school and ultimately Harvard. He's been the target of silver-spoon attacks because he’s worth more than $100 million. (Perhaps far more.) But Republicans argue he wasn’t handed his wealth — he earned it. He even "gave away his father’s inheritance," national committee chair Reince Priebus repeatedly told TV interviewers on Aug. 26, 2012, as the party prepared to open its convention. We’ve rated a related claim from Romney himself that he "didn’t inherit money" from his parents. That earned a Half True, because he previously told interviewers he did get an inheritance, but donated it to Brigham Young University. This time we’re checking whether he "gave away his father’s inheritance." We’re short on primary evidence for the claim — we haven’t seen his father’s will, nor a receipt from Brigham Young. But there’s a strong circumstantial case that Priebus is correct. Rich get richer George Romney died in 1995 at age 88. By that time, his son had led Bain Capital, the private equity firm he launched in 1984, for more than a decade. As Romney told a C-SPAN interviewer in 2006: "I did get a check from my dad when he passed away. I shouldn’t say a check, but I did inherit some funds from my dad. But I turned and gave that away to charity. In this case I gave it to a school which Brigham Young University established in his honor. ... And that’s where his inheritance ended up." Why did he give the money away? "I figured we had enough of our own," he said. According to a short history of the George W. Romney Institute of Public Management at BYU, the family provided an endowment in 1998, within a few years of George Romney's death. Our ruling Reince Priebus says that Romney "gave away his father's inheritance." Romney has repeatedly said so himself and that's backed up by the simple fact that Brigham Young University has an institute named for his father launched just a few years after his death. And there’s no reason to think Romney would have needed the money a decade after his lucrative move to Bain Capital. We find the evidence supports the claim and we see nothing to contradict it. If any evidence emerges, we'll review it. But in the meantime, we rate Priebus’ claim True.	None	Reince Priebus	None	None	None	2012-08-27T18:02:59	2012-08-26	['None']

pomt-01550	"The president referred to the Syrian opposition just a few months ago as pharmacists and doctors, and so on."	true	/punditfact/statements/2014/sep/14/michael-hayden/former-cia-director-obama-said-syrian-opposition-w/	President Barack Obama drew harsh criticism for comparing the terrorist group Islamic State to a "JV team" — and then again for claiming that’s not what he said (PolitiFact rated that statement False). On Sunday, another one of his characterizations of the situation in the Middle East came under fire as the political talk shows debated his plan for dealing with instability there. Former CIA and NSA director Michael Hayden was asked about Obama’s decision to arm local rebel groups in Syria to help fight the Islamic State there. He wondered why Obama was suddenly interested in arming opposition forces there. "The president referred to the Syrian opposition just a few months ago as pharmacists and doctors, and so on," Hayden said. "We've turned on the dime in terms of our expectation for them, so if we're going to get them to this force that he said it was fantasy to rely on to the force that's going to be, as (White House Chief of Staff Denis McDonough) said, the anvil in a combined arms operation, they're going to need an awful lot of help." In this case, we're checking whether Obama described the Syrian rebels as "pharmacists and doctors." We're not checking whether the rebels actually are pharmacists or doctors, as we'll explain in a bit. We tried to reach Hayden but were unsuccessful. McDonough, though, was asked about Obama’s comment during an appearance on CNN’s State of the Union. "I think that the question that the president was responding to at the time was looking back a couple of years," McDonough said. "We have had a relationship with these fighters now for a couple of years. They're getting better and more capable." If that’s the case, then maybe Hayden was embellishing Obama’s comments. Keep in mind, the debate over arming the Syrian opposition forces in their fight against Syrian President Bashar al Assad has been ongoing for years. PolitiFact noted in a fact-check last week that several key members of Obama’s national security team favored the move in August 2012. Let’s take a look at exactly what Obama said. We found four instances of Obama describing the Syrian opposition forces in recent months. May 29 Obama discussed his foreign policy during an interview with NPR. He was asked if conditions were more "robust" for aiding the rebels than in the past. "I wouldn't say the conditions are better," Obama said. "In many ways, the conditions are worse. "When you talk about the moderate opposition, many of these people were farmers or dentists or maybe some radio reporters who didn't have a lot of experience fighting," he added. "But creating a capacity for them to hold ground, to be able to rebuff vicious attacks, for them to be able to also organize themselves in ways that are cohesive — all that takes, unfortunately, more time than I think many people would like." For what it’s worth, the Washington Post fact-checked Obama’s claim about the makeup of Syrian rebels as farmer, dentists and radio reporters and found it to be dubious. June 19 In mid June, a few days before Obama asked Congress for $500 million to train and equip some of the Syrian opposition, he discussed the makeup of those forces on a couple occasions. In a June 19 press conference, a reporter asked Obama if "the expansion of the Syria war into Iraq changed your mind about the type of weapons and training we’re now willing to give the opposition there?" Obama responded: "The question has always been, is there the capacity of moderate opposition on the ground to absorb and counteract extremists that might have been pouring in, as well as an Assad regime supported by Iran and Russia that outmanned them and was ruthless. "And so we have consistently provided that opposition with support," Obama said. "Oftentimes, the challenge is if you have former farmers or teachers or pharmacists who now are taking up opposition against a battle-hardened regime, with support from external actors that have a lot at stake, how quickly can you get them trained; how effective are you able to mobilize them. And that continues to be a challenge." The next morning, he made a similar comment to CBS' This Morning. "When you get farmers, dentists and folks who have never fought before going up against a ruthless opposition in Assad, the notion that they were in a position suddenly to overturn not only Assad but also ruthless, highly trained jihadists if we just sent a few arms is a fantasy." Aug. 8 In a sitdown with New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman, Obama again was asked about why he chose not to arm the Syrian rebels. "This idea that we could provide some light arms or even more sophisticated arms to what was essentially an opposition made up of former doctors, farmers, pharmacists and so forth, and that they were going to be able to battle not only a well-armed state but also a well-armed state backed by Russia, backed by Iran, a battle-hardened Hezbollah, that was never in the cards," Obama said. Counter to what McDonough said Sept. 14, Obama very much seems to be talking about the Syrian opposition in the present and the challenges in providing them with assistance and arms. This continued up until August. The one caveat that Hayden does not mention is the conversation was largely in the context of the opposition’s capacity to go up against Assad and the Syrian regime, not their ability to fight a rogue terrorist organization like the Islamic State. Still, it is a noticeable about-face that as recently as August, Obama told Friedman he believed "there’s not as much capacity as you would hope" for providing these individuals training. Our ruling In discussing Obama’s decision to arm opposition forces in Syria, Hayden said, "The president referred to the Syrian opposition just a few months ago as pharmacists and doctors, and so on." We found several examples of Obama, as recently as June and August, characterizing the Syrian rebels as pharmacists and doctors, as well as dentists, radio reporters and teachers. Usually he was describing their capacity to fight Assad, but that doesn’t make Hayden’s point any less accurate. We rate Hayden’s statement True.

pomt-00697	"We spend more money on antacids than we do on politics."	false	/truth-o-meter/statements/2015/may/03/john-boehner/john-boehner-we-spend-more-money-antacids-we-do-po/	Bellyaching about the state of American politics doesn’t seem to get very far with House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. In a freewheeling interview with NBC News, Boehner dismissed the idea that special interests or gerrymandered congressional districts undercut what Washington does for the average citizen. And ditto for the billions of dollars that fuel the American political system. "We spend more money on antacids than we do on politics," Boehner told Meet the Press host Chuck Todd on May 3, 2015. "We live in an imperfect democracy. But as bad as it is, let me tell you this. It’s better than any other place in the world." That struck us as a novel comparison. Do Tums and Rolaids lay a bigger claim to Americans’ paychecks than electioneering? We dug into the numbers, and while we are confident that Boehner could tell us how he spells relief when it comes to taxes, his math leaves something to be desired. Boehner’s spokesman Kevin Smith pointed us to two articles. One from the trade publication Drug Topics spoke of a $10 billion yearly market for antacids. The other from the nonprofit organization that tracks political money, the Center for Responsive Politics, said total spending on federal campaigns in 2014 was $3.7 billion. The problem is, that antacid number was for sales worldwide. In America, the total is about $2 billion. We found that estimate from a couple of sources. The business website Statista.com reported $1.96 billion in sales of antacid tablets in 2013. That excludes liquid antacids. We found 2011 figures for both tablets and liquid antacids. Liquid antacid sales add about 5 percent more to the total -- $1.6 billion in tablets compared to about $83 million for liquids. Assuming the same trend held in 2013, we’re looking at a total sales figure around $2 billion. That’s a lot of indigestion, but it’s less than the amount spent on the 2014 federal elections. The most recent data from the Center for Responsive Politics actually puts the total closer to $3.8 billion. That includes spending by the candidates’ campaigns, the party committees, Super PACs and outside groups. Even if we limit the tally just to candidates and the parties, there was still more than $2.7 billion spent. Boehner’s comparison gets into deeper trouble when state-level races are factored in. The National Institute on Money in State Politics reports almost $3 billion in spending in 2014 to elect governors and members of state legislatures. With or without factoring in state money, Boehner’s comparison doesn’t come close. Our ruling Boehner said Americans spend more on antacids than they do on politics. But the evidence Boehner’s office cited was based on worldwide antacid sales. Americans themselves spent more than $2 billion on antacids each year, reports show. Federal campaign spending tops that no matter how you cut it. Using the source provided by Boehner’s office, the total in 2014 was about $3.8 billion. Factoring in state elections makes the disparity even greater. We couldn’t swallow this claim. We rate it False.	None	John Boehner	None	None	None	2015-05-03T16:11:36	2015-05-03	['None']

pomt-07588	Oregon concealed gun applications include "home phone numbers, home address, Social Security numbers, what kinds of guns you have in the house … whether you were dishonorably discharged from the military, what controlled substances you are taking and were you ever accused of -- accused, mind you -- of stalking."	mostly true	/oregon/statements/2011/mar/26/kim-thatcher/kim-thatcher-says-concealed-handgun-applications-r/	The Oregon House recently passed a bill that would remove concealed handgun applications from the public record. Proponents of the bill say that there’s too much personal information on individual citizens tied up in the documents. Public records should focus on the government, not private citizens, they say. Here’s Rep. Kim Thatcher’s full-throated defense of the move from the House debate on the day they passed the bill: "As the law stands now, the information in these applications includes things like, home phone numbers, home address, Social Security numbers, what kinds of guns you have in the house -- that's what's on the application -- whether you were dishonorably discharged from the military, what controlled substances you are taking and were you ever accused of -- accused, mind you -- of stalking," Thatcher, R-Keizer, said. "And right now all of that would be subject to public records disclosure." That’s an awful lot of information, indeed. But being our usual suspicious selves, we wondered whether all of that was truly included in the application. So, we did a quick check -- well, we thought it would be a quick check. We’d just pull down the Multnomah County Sheriff’s online license application and take a look, right? Well, it turns out that each of Oregon’s 36 counties has a slightly different application -- some considerably more stringent, some considerably less. After a few days of web searching and phone calling, we got our hands on 34 of the applications. Here’s what we found: -"Home phone numbers": Yes. This is one of the first things every application we reviewed asks for. -"Home address": Yes, again. You also have to include a mailing address if that’s different. -"Social Security numbers": Sort of. Every application we reviewed asks for a Social Security number, but all, save two, expressly note that "disclosure of your Social Security account number is voluntary." -"What kinds of guns you have in the house": Not usually. On 24 of the applications we looked through, there was no question asking applicants about current ownership. Of the remaining eight, six asked whether you "currently own or possess a firearm," but only if you have ever been dishonorably discharged from the armed forces, renounced your U.S. citizenship, been ordered to register as a sex offender in any state or use controlled substances. Everybody else can skip the question. The remaining four from Baker, Grant, Gilliam and Klamath counties ask all applicants for this information. -"Whether you were dishonorably discharged from the military": Yes, this is on most applications. If you have been, you also have to say when it happened. -"What controlled substances you are taking": Yep, this is there. Such controlled substances, for those who are curious, include but are not "limited to, marijuana, cocaine, methamphetamine, methadone, LSD, or ecstasy." (That quote is from the Multnomah County application.) -"Were you ever accused of ... stalking": Nope. Eleven applications don’t touch on this subject at all. The other 23 ask only if the applicant is "currently subject to any type of restraining or stalking order by the court." They also have to include some specifics about that situation if that question applies to them. That said, if the order has been lifted, the question doesn’t apply -- note the word "currently." For what it’s worth, those last two questions (the one on controlled substances and the one about stalking) are pretty important given that federal law, according to the application, prohibits folks who say yes to those questions from possessing firearms at all, much less handguns of the concealed variety. Thatcher is spot on when it comes to four of her assertions (the phone numbers, home addresses, military discharge and controlled substances), but she’s less accurate on the other three (social security, current gun ownership and stalking). When we called her office, Rep. Thatcher -- and later her spokeswoman Dawn Phillips -- told us she wasn’t making sweeping proclamations about all of the applications. What matters, they said, is that her comments apply to some of the state’s 36 applications. On that point, she’s pretty close to right. That is, except for the stalking claim. Thatcher makes it sound as though anybody accused of stalking at any point in their lives would have to say so on the application. But that’s just no true. On certain applications, you have to noted whether you are currently under a court order. That’s considerably different, in our view. Still, we’ll give her the benefit of the doubt that some of the necessary nuance was left out because her comments were spoken -- not written -- and rate this claim Mostly True. Comment on this item.

pomt-04499	Says U.S. Senate opponent Tammy Baldwin supported a federal budget "that spent trillions -- not billions, trillions -- more money than the Obama budget."	false	/wisconsin/statements/2012/oct/05/tommy-thompson/budget-backed-democrat-tammy-baldwin-spent-trillio/	In their race for a U.S. Senate seat, Democrat Tammy Baldwin and Republican Tommy Thompson depict each other as out of touch with the typical Wisconsin voter. The Madison congresswoman brands Thompson as a wealthy insider who is "not for you anymore." And the former governor labels Baldwin an extreme liberal. Thompson continued his line of attack on WISN-AM in Milwaukee on Sept. 27, 2012, hours before his first debate with Baldwin. He told conservative talk show host Jay Weber that Baldwin’s "philosophy is to spend as much money as possible and forget about the consequences of the next generation, the consequences of the declining dollar, the consequences of our debt load." "In fact she is so liberal -- I don’t know if people out there really know this -- she joined the Progressive Caucus, which introduced a budget that spent trillions -- not billions, trillions -- more money than the Obama budget." In the same vein, Thompson during the debate called Baldwin the House’s "number one spender" and alluded to her support of "increased spending" with the Progressive Caucus budget. Let’s see if Thompson’s right about the trillions. The caucus The Congressional Progressive Caucus, according to its website, consists of U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent, and 75 Democratic members of the House of Representatives. Baldwin is a vice-chair of the group. The caucus gained attention when U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., claimed in April 2012 that its members were members of the Communist Party. That rated a Pants on Fire from PolitiFact Florida, which confirmed through the Communist Party USA that no members of Congress are members of its party. The fiscal 2012 budget proposed by the Progressive Caucus was what Thompson was referring to when he made his trillions more comment about Baldwin, Thompson campaign spokeswoman Lisa Boothe told us. That plan, unveiled in April 2011, was offered as an alternative to budgets proposed by President Barack Obama and by House Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the Republican vice-presidential nominee. Baldwin did vote for the caucus budget, which was introduced as an amendment to Ryan’s budget. The amendment failed in the House, 347-77. Budget comparisons The Progressive Caucus budget would have spent $44.5 trillion from 2012 to 2021, according to an analysis done for the caucus by the labor-backed Economic Policy Institute. To see how that compared with Obama’s plan over 10 years, we contacted experts from two nonpartisan think tanks: Taxpayers for Common Sense, a government spending watchdog; and the Concord Coalition, which seeks balanced federal budgets. They agreed that Obama’s fiscal 2012 spending plan called for $46 trillion in spending. That’s $1.5 trillion more than the Progressive Caucus Budget. So, Thompson was wrong when he said the Baldwin-backed caucus would spend "trillions more" than Obama’s budget. Thompson has said, in prepared statements before and after his radio interview, that the Progressive Caucus budget would have raised trillions more in taxes than Obama’s budget. And our experts agreed the caucus budget would have collected $42 trillion in taxes over 10 years, some $5 trillion more than Obama’s. But that wasn’t Thompson’s claim on the radio. What’s more, raising taxes doesn’t automatically mean a corresponding increase in spending. Indeed, The Economist magazine, among others, pointed out the Progressive Caucus budget would have reduced federal deficits more than both the Obama and Ryan budgets -- primarily because of its higher taxes and cuts in defense spending. Our rating Thompson claimed Baldwin supported the Progressive Caucus budget, which he said spent "trillions more" than a budget from Obama. Baldwin did back the proposal, which would have raised taxes by trillions more than the president. But the caucus plan would have actually spent less money than the Obama plan. We rate Thompson’s statement False.	None	Tommy Thompson	None	None	None	2012-10-05T09:00:00	2012-10-27	['Tammy_Baldwin', 'Barack_Obama', 'United_States']
